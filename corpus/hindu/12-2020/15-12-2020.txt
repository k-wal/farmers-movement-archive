15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. talks to breakaway leaders as farmers hold hunger strikes||As several thousand farmers held hunger strikes and dharnas at Delhi’s border and across the country on Monday, demanding a repeal of the three recent agricultural marketing laws, the Centre continued to engage with individual elements in the farmers’ movement, in an effort to restart negotiations and broker a settlement. The national convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), one of the farmer groups leading the protest, was removed from his position after he expressed willingness to engage in separate talks with the government, focussing on demands for a minimum support price (MSP) law, rather than the repeal of all the three contentious laws. Kejriwal joins fast As the protest reached its 19th day, leaders of the movement held a day-long hunger strike from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal joined the fast in solidarity. Dharnas , or sit-ins, were held across the country, with people coming out in 60% of districts, according to estimates from the AIKSCC. About hundred farmers continued to hold a sit-in on the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Rewari, blocking traffic towards the capital on the Delhi-Jaipur Highway. The farmers, from Rajasthan and southern Haryana, heading to Delhi to join the protests, were stopped at the border by Haryana Police. On the Uttar Pradesh border, protesters aligned with the Bharatiya Kisan Union-Tikait temporarily blocked the highway at Ghazipur. “Farmers are being arrested, and their tractors and trolleys are being stopped. Farmers from Uttarakhand are also being held back in U.P. We will not tolerate this harassment,” BKU leader Rakesh Tikait told presspersons, threatening to completely seal the Ghazipur border. “State government should not interfere. Our fight is long, and our demands are with the Centre.” However, another farmer leader from U.P. and the national convener of the AIKSCC, V.M. Singh, said he was willing to drop the demand for a repeal of the laws if the Centre brought in a law to guarantee MSP for all farm produce, from both public and private buyers. “These three laws will automatically become infructuous if the MSP guarantee law is passed. That was always our original demand. [Other organisations] are now changing the goalposts,” he told The Hindu. Mr. Singh was evicted from his position as AIKSCC national convener on Sunday night for his stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-talks-to-breakaway-leaders-as-farmers-hold-hunger-strikes/article33332592.ece
15 December 2020||MANGALURU,||Emergency Response Support System, 112, starts working||The 112 Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) started working in the city on Monday, a month after its launch in other parts of Dakshina Kannada. The Mangaluru Police Commissionerate became the fourth Police Commissionerate and the 17th police unit to introduce the service. Police Commissionerates of Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Mysuru and Hubballi-Dharward have the service. In all, 13 district units and four Police Commissionerates are now covered under 112. Launching the vehicle service under the system, Police Commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash said that for accident, crime, fire, natural disaster or any other emergency, people can call 112. The calls will be received by the Centralised Call Centre at the office of the Additional Director-General of Police (Communication, Logistics and Modernisation) in Bengaluru. Looking at whether the emergency relates to police, fire or health, messages will be passed on to the departments concerned for immediate response. As many as 19 Hoysala vehicles of the city police are linked to the system and they will be the first responders. Dedicated staff, who have been trained in the operation of the ERSS, are manning these vehicles and they will work in shifts. There will be no calls received on 100 henceforth, and 112 will be the number to which information meant for the police can be passed on. “Even if people call 100, it will be routed to 112,” Mr. Vikash said. Director-General and Inspector-General of Police Praveen Sood told The Hindu that the police are giving “15 by 15” promise to the public. It will take 15 seconds to answer the call and 15 minutes to reach the place of distress. Mr. Sood said that the inclusion of police units in the 112 response system across the State is happening in stages. “Personal briefing is being done for each district for its inclusion in the system,” he said. Ten more district units will be part of the system by January 15. The entire State will be covered under the system by January 26, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/emergency-response-support-system-112-starts-working/article33333121.ece
15 December 2020||New Delhi,||India is far ahead of China in soft power, says Rajnath||The “unprovoked aggression” on the Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how the world is changing, how existing agreements are being challenged and how power is being asserted not just in the Himalayas but across the Indo-Pacific, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday, referring to the ongoing stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh. “Whenever there is a situation at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the most obvious outcome is a comparison between India and China’s military strength. There can be a serious debate on who owns more military might but when it comes to soft power there is no scope of ambiguity. India is far ahead of China when it comes to leading the world with ideas,” Mr. Singh said at the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He said India, due to its location, size, population and economy, had always been at the strategic forefront of global security. ‘Exemplary courage’ Referring to the “big build-up of armed forces” at the LAC in Ladakh, he said the forces had shown exemplary courage and remarkable fortitude and “fought the PLA with utmost bravery and forced them to go back”. Mr. Singh said India has been a victim of cross-border terrorism. It fought the scourge alone even when there was no one to support, but later the world understood that India was right about “Pakistan being the fountain-head of terrorism”. “And now again our brave forces are there in the forefront fighting icy winds to guard our borders and to fulfil their responsibility. The question is can our industry also stand shoulder to shoulder with our forces?” he said. Being one of the largest armed forces in the world, India was so import-dependent in critical areas, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-is-far-ahead-of-china-in-soft-power-says-rajnath/article33332590.ece

Pre-registration must The guidelines said the latest electoral roll for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections will be used to identify the priority population over the age of 50. The guidelines added that at the vaccination site, only pre-registered beneficiaries will be vaccinated in accordance with the prioritisation, and there will be no provision for on-the-spot registrations. The Health Ministry has said that the COVID-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and to persons above 50. They will be followed by persons younger than 50 with associated co-morbidities based on the pandemic situation, and finally to the remaining population based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability. Priority group The priority group of above 50 years may be further subdivided into those above 60 and those between 50 to 60 years for purposes of a phased roll-out, based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-use-poll-roll-data-to-allot-covid-19-vaccine/article33333277.ece
15 December 2020||CHENNAI,||AMMK gets ‘pressure cooker’ symbol, MNM loses out||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday allotted the ‘pressure cooker’ symbol to the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) for the forthcoming 2021 Assembly election in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The ‘battery torch’ symbol on which actor Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) candidates had contested in the last Lok Sabha polls, was allotted to another registered party ‘MGR Makkal Katchi’, in Tamil Nadu. The MNM, however, was given the ‘battery torch’ symbol in Puducherry. Reacting to the development, Kamal Haasan said in Dindigul, that there was no question of going back or worrying about such issues. He said if there was no ‘torch light’ (as he referred to the symbol), “we will have kalangarai vilakkam (light house).” However, party functionaries were upset. C. K. Kumaravel, a second line party leader, told The Hindu, “We have worked hard to popularise the ‘battery torch’ symbol for the past two years. It is unfortunate that ECI has allotted us the same symbol in Puducherry while denying it in Tamil Nadu. We will explore legal ways to overcome this challenge.” ECI Secretary Jaydeep Lahiri communicated the decision to Chief Electoral Officers of the State and the Union Territory. The Naam Tamilar Katchi has been allotted the ‘gana kisan’ symbol in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.  In a tweet, AMMK general secretary T.T.V.Dhinakaran, expressed happiness over the ECI’s decision. Three years ago, Mr. Dhinakaran won in the byelection to Dr. R.K. Nagar Assembly constituency as an independent, using the ‘pressure cooker’ symbol. During the Lok Sabha election and the Assembly bypoll in April-May 2019, the Supreme Court, when approached by the Dhinakaran group, in March that year, refused to grant the symbol of ‘pressure cooker’ on the ground that the faction had no exclusive access to the symbol. However, the court directed the ECI to allot any one common or free symbol to the group’s candidates. The symbol then allotted was “gift box.” The AMMK polled 22.25 lakh votes in 38 Lok Sabha constituencies with a vote share of 5.25% and about 3.19 lakh votes with a vote share of 7.23% in 22 Assembly seats. In November last year, the Commission approved the registration of the AMMK. The ECI said the common symbols allotted to these parties shall be available for allotment as a free symbol to other candidates in the constituencies where the parties do not field candidates.

15 December 2020||New Delhi,||AIIMS Nurses Union goes on indefinite strike||The AIIMS Nurses Union has gone on an indefinite strike from Monday afternoon after the hospital allegedly decided to hire nursing officers on contractual basis. Last month, the union had given a notice for strike from December 16 against an “anomaly” in their pay under the Sixth Central Pay Commission, and other demands. AIIMS director Randeep Guleria appealed to the nurses to call off their agitation and return to work. He termed it “very inappropriate” and said that many people were facing pay cuts due to the pandemic. Heath Ministry order In the evening, the Union Healthy Ministry directed that there should be no cessation or disruption of nursing functions at AllMS, nor such an action aided or abetted. “Non-compliance will be treated as offence under the Disaster Management Act read with the Indian Penal Code and action will be taken accordingly against defaulting authorities/employees,” stated the order. The Ministry added that while attempts were being made to dissuade the union from resorting to strike, especially when the government is dealing with a national priority of effectively tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, the AlIMS Nurses Union vide a handwritten letter on Monday informed the hospital administration about its decision to go on strike. In the letter to the AIIMS director, the union said, “Administration turned down our demand related to 6th CPC anomaly... Adding to this, it’s shocking to know that the AIIMS administration decided to recruit nursing officers on contractual basis immediately, which is against our strike demands.” The union said the decision to hire nursing officers on contract was the reason why they went on strike from Monday instead of Wednesday. “I appeal to all the nurses, nursing officers not to go on strike and not to make us feel embarrassed about the dignity that we have as far as the nurses are concerned... Whatever issues you have, we will try and resolve amicably,” Mr. Guleria said in a statement. The AIIMS director said multiple meetings have been held with the union not only by the AIIMS administration, but also by the economic adviser in the Ministry of Health and also the person who drafted the 6th CPC. “He explained to them that their interpretation is not correct. And this (dem-and) is beyond the provisions of the gazette notification. But the union was asking for a salary hike and it was said by the government that they would sympathetically look at this as a fresh demand and asked the Department of Expenditure to consider this,” the AIIMS director said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/aiims-nurses-union-goes-on-indefinite-strike/article33332816.ece

15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi begins training of doctors for vaccine drive||The Delhi government has started training more than 400 doctors from different hospitals in the city for the COVID-19 vaccination drive. “The government has started training more than 400 doctors since yesterday (Sunday). Doctors who were trained by the Central government last week are heading the training and it will be completed in three days,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu . The official said that some doctors who are part of the Delhi government administr-ation are also being trained. The government will in the next stage train auxiliary nurse midwives and nurses, who would be the actual vaccinators. Training will also be imparted to ASHA and Anganwadi workers to spread awareness about the vaccine in their areas. FELUDA test Also, staff of one lab each in two Delhi government hospitals are being trained to use FELUDA (FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay) paper strip test for COVID-19 from Monday. The FELUDA test is done in a lab using a nasopharyngeal swab, just like the RT-PCR test. According to officials, the FELUDA paper strip test gives results within one hour, which is much faster than the RT-PCR test. The training in FELUDA test is being carried out using leftover samples. On October 22, the Indian Council of Medical Research issued an advisory for the use of FELUDA paper strip tests for COVID-19 detection. “Today there was an online training for the two labs. From tomorrow (Tuesday), there will be on-the-spot training for both the labs,” the official said. The government plans to purchase 50,000 FELUDA kits once it is available later this week on a “Government e-Market” (GEM), an online purchase platform for government agencies, the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-begins-doctors-training-for-vaccine-drive/article33332821.ece

15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||November sees food inflation drop to 9.43%||India’s retail inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) moderated marginally in November to 6.93%, from 7.61% recorded in October, with food price inflation cooling off to 9.43% from 11% in the previous month. In rural India, both overall retail inflation and food price inflation, were about 0.5 percentage points higher than the 6.73% and 9.1%, respectively, recorded in urban India. The National Statistical Office (NSO) combines the rural and urban inflation rates to arrive at All India inflation rates. “The headline CPI inflation for November 2020 printed appreciably lower than our expectations, benefiting from stable vegetable prices at the retail level,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA. “While this provides welcome relief, it is unlikely to prove adequate for any imminent rate easing,” she said. The Reserve Bank of India, in its monetary policy review earlier this month, had said that inflation is likely to remain elevated, barring transient relief in the winter months from prices of perishables. “This constrains monetary policy at the current juncture from using the space available to act in support of growth,” it had noted. Among the major States, Bihar recorded the highest inflation at 9.8% in November, followed by West Bengal (9.42%), Andhra Pradesh (9.08%) and Telangana (8.99%).  WPI rises Wholesale price index-based inflation rose further to 1.55% in November, from 1.48% in October, as per provisional official data released on Monday. Food price inflation moderated from 5.78% in October to 4.27% in November. “The divergence between retail and wholesale food inflation is increasing and has touched a five-month high of 5.5% in November 2020,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research. “We expect the retail inflation to decline to 5.5% to 6.0% range in the last quarter of 2020-21 due to easing food prices. However, sticky core inflation and COVID related inflation will keep headline inflation elevated,” he said. Inflation in manufactured products, which have a weightage of over 64% in the WPI, touched 2.97% — the highest level recorded in a at least 20 months, suggesting a continued industrial recovery, on the back of 2.1% inflation recorded in October. Primary articles’ inflation moderated in November to 2.72% from 4.74% in October, led by a 13.2% decline in minerals prices and an 11.11% dip in crude petroleum and natural gas prices. The fuel and power segment of the WPI however, showed a negative inflation of 9.87%, marginally recovering from the negative 11% inflation recorded in October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/november-sees-food-inflation-drop-to-943/article33332634.ece

15 December 2020||Ahmedabad,||Gujarat to get 30,000 MW renewable energy park||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday will lay the foundation stone for what is billed to be the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park in Gujarat’s Kutch district. The park, once completed, will generate 30,000 MW power through solar panels and windmills on 72,600 hectares along the India-Pakistan border. The energy park is being set up by the Gujarat government with the participation of private players such as the Adani Group, which is the country’s largest renewable power generator, and Suzlon, a dominant player in wind energy. It will have dedicated zones for wind and solar energy storage as well as an exclusive zone for wind park activities. During his day-long visit to his home State, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation for a desalination plant and a fully automated milk processing and packing plant in Kutch dairy. To meet the growing demand for water, Gujarat has turned to harnessing its vast coastline, taking steps to transform seawater to potable drinking water with the upcoming desalination plant at Mandvi, Kutch. The plant, with a capacity of 10 crore litres a day (100 MLD) will strengthen water security in Gujarat by complementing the Narmada Grid, the Sauni network and treated waste water infrastructure. This will be one of the five desalination plant the State government has planned to set up along the coastal regions in Kutch and Saurashtra region, both facing water shortage during deficit monsoons. Other upcoming desalination plants are—Dahej (100 MLD), Dwarka (70 MLD), Ghogha Bhavnagar (70 MLD), and Gir Somnath (30 MLD). Nearly 8 lakh people across the regions of Mundra, Lakhpat, Abdasa and Nakhatrana talukas will receive desalinated water from this plant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gujarat-to-get-30000-mw-renewable-energy-park/article33332591.ece

15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Centre must involve CMs, says Cong. leader||The Union government should involve the Chief Ministers and find a way out of the stand-off with farmers on the three farm laws through dialogue and negotiations, the Congress’s Deputy Leader in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, said on Monday at the 93rd annual general meeting (AGM) of the FICCI. “Today what we are seeing is turbulence and protests on the farm laws. Reforms must be participatory, not arbitrary. There must be consultations. Nothing should be rushed through or done without building a consensus. That results in what we are seeing — agitation, conflict and the loss of trust,” he said. “I personally feel that through dialogue, negotiations and persuasion, everything can be resolved. We have Chief Ministers of States and they must be involved and let’s get over this crisis too, together as a nation.” Calling himself a votary of reforms, Mr. Sharma said that any reform must be backed by a national consensus as that gave confidence to partners countries and investors. He said India lost 10% of its GDP because of the pandemic and the shock because of a “stringent lockdown”. The government should make money available to the poor sections as that would help revive the economy by improving consumption. Though India was not thrown off-balance despite the shock, it was debatable whether India was witnessing a V-shaped recovery or a K-shaped recovery, he stated. The former Union Commerce Minister claimed that India was facing crises of low capital expenditure, investment and an impending banking crisis. Call for consensus The chariot of democracy must have the government as well as a robust, effective and responsible Opposition, he pointed out. Mr. Sharma cited the example of the United States and how the Supreme Court there had taken charge after a bitter election, to argue for a similar role for the judiciary in India as well. Indian judiciary had an independent role and the Supreme Court had a constitutional duty and mandate to uphold the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-must-involve-cms-says-cong-leader/article33332539.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||India, Britain to discuss upgrade of ties||British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other Ministers on Tuesday during his three-day visit to India, expected to prepare for a possible visit by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in January. India has invited Mr. Johnson as a guest for the Republic Day celebration. While the Prime Minister’s visit has not been confirmed yet, Mr. Raab, who is the U.K. Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, will discuss a range of agreements, including one for an upgrade of the relationship to a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership”, to be signed during Mr. Johnson’s visit, officials told The Hindu . From 2004 “India and the United Kingdom enjoy a strategic partnership since 2004 which has been marked by regular high-level exchanges and growing cooperation in diverse areas,” said a statement by the External Affairs Ministry announcing the visit from December 14 to 17. “Mr. Raab’s visit will pave the way for further strengthening of the partnership across trade, defence, climate, migration and mobility, education and health sectors in the post-Covid, post-Brexit context,” it said. The U.K. Foreign Secretary (who is the equivalent of the British Foreign Minister) will be accompanied by the Permanent Undersecretary of the Foreign Office, Philip Barton, who was, until recently, the High Commissioner of the U.K. to India. Mr. Raab’s visit comes days after Mr. Johnson’s controversial remarks in the U.K. Parliament that seemed to confuse India-Pakistan tensions with the farmers’ protests at the Delhi borders. The U.K. Prime Minister’s office later clarified that he had “clearly misheard the question”, adding that the British Foreign Office was “following the issue of protests in India closely”. Neither the External Affairs Ministry nor the British High Commission responded to a question on whether the issue or the U.K.’s comments would be discussed during Mr. Raab’s visit. Wide range According to the officials, India and the U.K. will discuss the framework of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which will include defence and strategic relationship, Indo-Pacific policy, trade, and cooperation on renewable energy ahead of the PM’s visit. Mr. Johnson’s visit to India will be one of his first forays abroad in 2021, after the U.K. formally leaves the European Union (EU), and officials are hopeful of an announcement that India and the U.K. would begin talks for an “early harvest” Free Trade Agreement (FTA) during the visit. Defence agreements A mutual defence logistics support agreement is in an advanced stage of negotiation, while a government-to-government (G2G) mechanism for defence deals and a defence training Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) are also in the works. In addition, the two sides may conclude a defence technology and industrial capability cooperation (DTICC) agreement, the MoU for which was signed in April 2019. Government sources said the two countries were close to signing a G2G agreement on jet engine technology development. The U.K. has also made a pitch to India for joint technology development of sixth generation fighter technologies which can go into India’s fifth generation advanced medium combat aircraft as well as offered the design of its Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier for Indian Navy’s proposed second indigenous carrier. The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth would be in the Indian Ocean next year on its maiden deployment. Meanwhile, the U.K. has already announced its plans to deploy a Liaison Officer at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) meant to improve Maritime Domain Awareness. Mr. Raab will meet Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Tuesday, and will leave for Bengaluru on Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to Glasgow for the next UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021, and both sides are keen on expanding their partnership on fighting global warming and building renewable energy technologies, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-britain-to-discuss-upgrade-of-ties/article33332555.ece
15 December 2020||Bengaluru,||‘Wistron attackers misbehaved with women staff ’||The violent mob which attacked the Wistron company in the Narasapura industrial area also allegedly misbehaved with women employees before robbing their valuables, according to the complaint filed by an assistant manager. She narrated how she resisted the attack, rescued around 400 women employees and helped them get out through a safe passage. Later, she approached the police and filed a complaint based on which the police charged the accused with outraging modesty, unlawful assembly and trespass. In her complaint, Malini Srinivas, 40, assistant manager, said she noticed a group of 500 contract employees barge into the women’s section of the workplace and start ransacking the premises. The group, armed with iron rods and clubs, started breaking open the staff lockers and taking away the belongings of the employees. A few women staff who noticed this rushed to save their belongings, but the mob misbehaved and assaulted them. While a few managed to save themselves, many of the women staff members lost their belongings in the melee, she alleged. Sensing trouble, Ms. Srinivas took all the women staff into a room and locked them up. The women staff waited for some time till the mob moved on. Ms. Srinivas later took the women to a safe exit and sent them out, she has said in the complaint. The police are now recording the statements of Ms. Srinivas and the women staff members to identify the attackers. Meanwhile, a group of eight policemen who went to Wistron to contain the violence were allegedly attacked by an armed group of around 6,000 men who not only pelted stones at the police party and drove them away, but also vandalised the police vehicle. The police had to back out to cover themselves from the stones. Additional policemen rushed and brought the situation under control. Police have taken up a case against the attackers, charging them with assaulting government servants while on duty and criminal intimidation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wistron-attackers-misbehaved-with-women-staff/article33332507.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Leaders of many groups join fast||At Singhu border on Monday, as the farmers’ protest entered the 19th day, leaders of various organisations observed a day-long fast in solidarity with farmers across the country. Avtar Singh Mehma, State Press Secretary of Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab, said 33 leaders were part of the hunger strike. “This is a symbolic strike. Farmers are observing the strike at their headquarters in different States and those who live nearby, will be marching towards the Capital on Tuesday,” he said, adding that two minutes of silence was observed on stage over the alleged deaths of over 20 farmers near Delhi borders in the last 18 days. Farmers also observed the strike in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana and other States, Mr. Singh added. He said the crowd is rising, and trackers and trolleys are being managed at the tail of the protest site. “Whoever joins is being asked to park vehicles by the side and not near the stage so that people have space to move,” he said. “A boycott of Ambani’s and Adani’s products has already been called,” he said, adding that the protest will continue to grow. Security stepped up Meanwhile, the Delhi Police installed another layer of security with steel adjoining the cement barricades. On Thursday, over 20 people from Odisha also joined the protest in solidarity with the farmers. “We want the government to take back the anti-farm laws. These bills will impact every state because the prices of wheat, rice, and vegetables will also increase. If the government believes that the protest is only restricted to Punjab and Haryana or only north India, we're here to change that perception,” said Amiya Pandav from an organisation Ama Adhikar. Sachin Mohapatra, State President of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasang (Odisha), said more people will arrive in the coming days. “Only one train runs every week, therefore, it takes time. I am one of the 40 people who meet the government officials and these people have come to support me,” he said. Keeping the fire alive Quintals of woods are stacked every few metres at Singhu border protest site and is used for cooking through the day and bonfire to beat the cold at night. Baljinder Singh, resident of a Rauke Kalan, a village in Punjab, said he brought 100 quintals of wood from his village to the protest site after a 12-hour truck ride. Mr. Baljinder received a call from his villagers protesting here regarding the need for wood. “As soon as I got the call, I gathered a few young boys and told them that we need to collect wood. Three trolleys set out for the work,” he said. Jaswinder Singh — a 19-year-old pursuing industrial training — drove one of the trolleys in the village and knocked doors requesting wood from each house. “People open their hearts and give as much as they can — 5kg or 50kg depending on their means,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/leaders-of-many-groups-join-fast/article33332542.ece

In Goa, the fifth and last of the offshore patrol vessels (OPV) in the series Saksham being built at Goa Shipyard was launched into water and is expected to be delivered to the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) by October 2021. P17A ships with a displacement of around 6,670 tonnes will be the most advanced state-of-the-art guided missile frigates once inducted, the GRSE said in a statement.

This project is unique in that it is being built simultaneously at two locations, at the GRSE and the Mazgaon Docks in Mumbai. Fincantieri of Italy is the know-how provider for technology upgrade and capability enhancement in this project. The indigenous OPV project was launched on November 13, 2016. Since then, two vessels have been commissioned and all five have been launched, the ICG said in a statement. “In spite of the ongoing COVID-19 situation and disruptions in supply chains, it is creditable for the shipyard to complete the 100% hull construction and launch the vessel within 18 months from keel-laying, which was in June 2019,” the ICG said. The vessel is in advanced stages of outfitting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stealth-frigate-himgiri-is-ready/article33332548.ece

15 December 2020||Kolkata,||Mamata govt. should take a stand on farm laws: Oppn.||The Trinamool Congress should make its stand on farm Bills passed by the Centre clear by bringing a Bill in West Bengal Legislative Assembly, the Left parties and Congress leadership said here on Monday. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Abdul Mannan and Leader of Left Legislature party Sujan Chakraborty said a session of the Assembly should be convened immediately to pass a Bill to make the laws passed by Centre not applicable in the State. Both pointed out that several States like Rajasthan, Punjab, Kerala and Chhattisgarh have passed legislation to make the Central laws ineffective there. “We have written three letters in the past few months seeking the convening of the Assembly but the State government has not listened to us. It is clearly double standards by the Trinamool Government not to pass such laws,” Mr. Chakraborty said. The Communist Party of India(Marxist) MLA added that the TMC government has passed two Bills making the same provision effective in the State as the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government has passed.  Met Governor Earlier in the day, Mr. Mannan met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on the issue of law and order situation. “Abdul Mannan, Leader of Opposition, called on me today at Raj Bhawan. He expressed serious concern at rise in political violence and decline in law and order @MamataOfficial. He deprecated politically inspired police postings @WBPolice and stressed need of fair elections. Governor over the law-and-order situation,” the Governor tweeted. Mr. Mannan said that he raised the issue of transfer of police officers and expressed apprehension that these are not routine transfers but made keeping in mind the upcoming Assembly polls in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-govt-should-take-a-stand-on-farm-laws-oppn/article33332825.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||1971 perpetrators not held accountable: Indian envoy||The perpetrators of the 1971 genocide in Bangladesh have not yet been brought to justice for their actions, Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Vikram Doraiswami said on Monday. At a virtual event organised by the Observer Research Foundation, he said taking forward the memory of the events of 1971 was part of the cooperative vision of South Asia. “Redressal or at least acknowledgement of what happened in 1971 is also important. We need to remember the perpetrators of these crimes — the orchestrators, the directors and the masterminds who committed these crimes — have never been brought to justice. Indeed there hasn’t been enough of an effort to recall that this is indeed a genocide,” Mr. Doraiswami said. The comment is expected to highlight memories of close ties of the past right before Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina virtually on December 17 for a summit. Mr. Doraiswami’s comments came on the day Bangladesh marks as Martyred Intellectuals Day to remember the teachers, journalists and poets killed on this day in 1971 by the Pakistan Army and its local collaborator Al-Badr. The massacre was the last phase of the genocide that began in March that year which triggered a mass refugee flow into India and ultimately the India-Pakistan war which ended on December 16 with the surrender of the Pakistan Army. The massacre is viewed as a last-moment vengeance against the intellectuals of Bangladesh who had consistently criticised Pakistan Army’s actions in the erstwhile East Pakistan. The Bangladesh Muktijuddho Manch organised a protest rally in Dhaka on Monday and attempted to march to the High Commission of Pakistan in Dhaka. Apology sought The Manch said, “Pakistan should apologise for the genocide of 1971 without any further delay and the Pakistan High Commission in Dhaka should stop conspiring against the spirit of 1971,” said former Justice Shamsuddin Choudhury Manik. He also called for increasing surveillance on the activities of Pakistani diplomats stationed in Dhaka. Mr. Doraiswami said the memory of 1971 should be preserved by both India and Bangladesh. The comments came days after Ms. Hasina reminded the envoy of Pakistan that the painful memories of the genocide of 1971 will never be forgotten by Bangladesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/1971-perpetrators-not-held-accountable-indian-envoy/article33332533.ece

In addition, at least one person from the police, home guard, Civil defence, NCC, NSS, NYK, who will check the registration status of the beneficiary at the entry point and ensure guarded entry to the vaccination session, a person who will authenticate/verify the identification documents, two-support staff who will be responsible for crowd management, IEC/communication and support to the vaccinator. The 113-page operational guideline document noted that based on the number of registered beneficiaries and the priority accorded, vaccination sessions will be planned to allow one session for 100 beneficiaries. “While most healthcare and frontline workers would be vaccinated at fixed session sites, vaccination of other high-risk populations may require outreach session sites, and mobile sites/teams.

15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||More takers for private healthcare under PM-JAY||Patients seeking care at private hospitals tend to be older and a larger share consist of men compared with those seeking medical care at public hospitals, show data released by the National Health Agency (NHA). In its briefing on “The role of private hospitals” published recently, the agency says they account for over half of the empanelled hospitals, nearly two-thirds of claim volumes, and three-quarters of claim outlays in the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). This, when private hospitals are making a smaller contribution in extending the geographic reach of PM-JAY to underserved areas. The top PM-JAY packages by value — including knee replacement, cataracts, haemodialysis and cardiovascular surgeries — are overwhelmingly provided by private hospitals . The period for the analysis was from September 23, 2018 to February 29, 2020. Rising fraud Medical audits have also revealed that private hospitals are more likely to indulge in fraud and abuse than public hospitals and more likely to discharge patients early post-surgery to cut costs. “Ensuring the accountability of private hospitals to provide efficient and high-quality care is a pre-eminent challenge for scheme implementation. Offering a robust public sector alternative in the form of high-performing government hospitals serving as a market anchor will be one element of such an approach,” the report says. The agency’s survey also found that over 72% of private empanelled hospitals are located in just seven States: Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka. Better infrastructure “There is huge State-wise variation in the share of empanelled private hospitals from less than 25% in most of the northeastern and hill States to 80% in Maharashtra,” says the report. It also notes that private hospitals have fewer beds than public hospitals and are more likely to be empanelled for surgical packages and super-specialties. They also report better infrastructure for clinical and support services than their government counterparts, though data is incomplete. As per the data, private hospitals account for 63% of all PM-JAY claims and 75% of the total claim value. The data further states that claims processing appears to be more efficient in the case of private hospitals than for public hospitals. Previous survey evidence shows that prior to the launch of PM-JAY, patients often paid out-of-pocket for private hospital care, citing quality, trust, and availability of services as the major reasons for doing so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/more-takers-for-private-healthcare-under-pm-jay/article33332558.ece
15 December 2020||CHANDIGARH,||‘BJP-led govt. turning more autocratic’||Hitting out at the BJP against the backdrop of the farmers’ agitation, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said that during the present BJP-led government at the Centre, the country had seen a dangerous slide into increasingly autocratic and unitary system with growing centralisation of power in a few hands. Mr. Badal said there was a need for a truly federal structure in the country with genuine political, economic and executive autonomy to the States. “This alone is the ultimate and durable guarantee against the social, political and economic turmoil which the country has been witnessing in recent years,” he said. Mr. Badal said the alarming crisis following the passage of three anti-farmer Acts would not have arisen if the government had followed a federal approach through consultation, conciliation and consensus among States. “The farmers’ crisis cannot be delinked from the ill-advised unitary and dictatorial tendencies in the country. The problem could have been averted through an approach based on federal principles,” he said. He said his party would work in tandem with like-minded regional and national parties to make India a genuine federal country. His party fully backed the total revocation of the new farm laws, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-led-govt-turning-more-autocratic/article33332528.ece

A meeting of the committee, held against the backdrop of 36 out of the 239 people on duty at the Sannidhanam testing positive, decided to withdraw all primary contacts of the positive cases from the zone on an emergency basis and a list prepared by the Health Department will be handed over to the departments. The commercial establishment where an employee had tested positive was immediately closed down and seven others who had been working there were immediately taken out of the Sannidhanam. Inspections at business establishments in the region will be intensified. The meeting also decided to take necessary steps for the smooth conduct of the festival at Sabarimala. Meanwhile, increased incidence of sighting of wild animals, including leopards, along the Sabarimala route has forced the authorities to make slight changes in the travel timing of pilgrims. Devotees leaving the Nilackal base camp from 2.30 a.m. will be allowed to the Sannidhanam from Pampa only from 4 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/strict-covid-regulations-at-sabarimala/article33333033.ece

15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Release our funds, MPs urge Centre||At a meeting of the standing committee on MP Local Area Development (MPLAD) funds of the Rajya Sabha headed by Deputy Chairman Harivansh, members of all parties unanimously asked the government to release funds for the projects sanctioned in 2018 and 2019, which were under way before the funds were suspended due the COVID-19 pandemic. At the meeting, the government, according to sources, unequivocally said that resuming the funds before March 2022 was out of the question as the Rs. 3,900 crore of funds have not been budgeted. The MPs, however, the sources said, pointed that many projects that were approved earlier and under way have also not received funds since the suspension. “We all agreed unanimously when the government brought in changes to suspend the MPLAD funds to aid the fight the pandemic. However, that does not mean the projects which were approved long before should not be completed,” a committee member said. The government does not even have the statistics of the projects that have been left mid-way after the suspension. According to sources, officials from the Ministry of Statistics that handles the MPLAD funds told the committee that it was collating data in this connection. The committee has received representations from several MPs on the issue. The MPs get around Rs. 5 crore annually under the scheme. The money is released only after the Centre receives completion certificates from districts. “The committee also reiterated an earlier recommendation that the funds should not lapse within 18 months as is the current norm. Instead, the MPs should be given 30 months after he/she proposes a project,” another committee member said. In their representations, the MPs had argued that the funds become more critical during the pandemic.  We agreed when it was suspended during pandemic.

15 December 2020||KOTTAYAM,||NCP-KC(M) spat simmers in Kerala’s ruling Left front||Days after the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) voiced its displeasure over the alleged sidelining by the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the controversy gained traction further on Monday with the Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani airing his views on the issue. Interacting with mediapersons on the sidelines of an event supporting the protests against the new Central farm laws, Mr. Mani initially sought not to be drawn into the controversy and said any issues that had cropped up locally would be settled within the coalition.  ‘Cold response’ However, to a query on reports over the cold response of NCP leader Mani C. Kappan, MLA, during electioneering in Kottayam, Mr. Mani, without denying the charge, replied: “I am not sure. You may verify it yourself and find out.” Mr. Mani’s reaction drew a sharp reaction from the NCP leadership in Kottayam, which retorted that the NCP had not become part of the Left coalition ‘one fine morning’ – an apparent reference to the entry of the KC(M) into the LDF. ‘Ask Philip Kuzhikulam’ “In case of any doubts regarding the MLA’s participation in electioneering, the Mani group should ask its Pala constituency president Philip Kuzhikulam about it,” said Joshi Puthumana, president of the NCP Pala block committee. According to him, Mr. Kappan won Pala, a constituency almost renounced by the LDF, by fighting four elections over two decades. “The people of Pala have a clear idea about those who constantly criticised the Pala MLA and the LDF till two months ago and what happened thereafter,” he added. Pala seat Though the ongoing controversy pertains to the issues over seat-sharing during the ongoing local body polls, at the core of this entire episode is the claim raised by both parties over the Pala Assembly seat, say observers. Following reports that Mr. Mani had demanded the Pala seat during the informal consultations with the LDF ahead of its entry into the coalition, Mr. Kappan had clarified that there was no question of giving up the seat. Meanwhile, speculations are also rife that the United Democratic Front is looking to take advantage of the situation and has approached disgruntled leaders within the NCP.

15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||NRIs discuss new farm laws with Minister||The notion about farmers, who are not participating in the protests outside Delhi against the new farm laws, as being in favour of the legislations is wrong, Minister for Agriculture S. Nirajan Reddy has remarked. He stated that the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan were closer to Delhi and therefore, responded first to the new farm laws. Besides, their reaction is immediate as more than 50% of their produce is sold in mandis (agriculture market yards), which have been rendered non-entities in the new farm laws, the Minister said. Mr. Niranjan Reddy made the comments during a virtual interactive session session with NRIs from Telangana on the new farm laws on Monday. He said, instead of encouraging farmers with support price and incentives, the Centre’s new laws removed the concept of minimum support price (MSP). On the argument that the new laws would enable hassle-free countrywide trading of the farm produce, the Minister said it was already happening with e-NAM programme. He also faulted the attitude of some intellectuals who are supporting the new farm laws stating that they were linking agricultural produce (raw) with other commodities, forgetting the fact that there would be a time limit for disposal of the farm produce, while the other commodities (processed produce) would have no time limit. A farmer can’t hold his produce for long for various reasons, including timely repayment of money borrowed for raising the crop, the Minister pointed out. Further, he sought to know from the Centre why it had written off agricultural loans when Rs. 6.5 lakh crore bad debts of the corporate sector were waived. He also sought to know how a farmer could improve his/her income without protection from the government in the free trade environment and felt that the major objective of the new farm laws was to bring the essential commodities into the control of corporate sector. Responding to a query from Mahesh Tanneeru on the BJP leaders’ argument that MSP would be intact in spite of the new farm laws, the Minister said it was only a lip service since there was no provision of MSP in the new laws. On the way forward from the present imbroglio, as asked by another NRI, Ram, the Minister suggested that the implementation of new farm laws should be kept in abeyance at least till the time the farming community is convinced about its claimed benefits. NRIs Kalyan Chakravarthi, Niranjan Podduturi, Raj, Chandu Talla, Harishwar Reddy, Srikanth Reddy, Shiva Kaleru and Harinder Tallapalli also participated in the virtual interaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nris-discuss-new-farm-laws-with-minister/article33332953.ece
15 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||SEC seeks explanation from Kerala CM||The State Election Commission (SEC) has sought an explanation from Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the complaint that he had violated the model code of conduct with his announcement that COVID-19 vaccination will be provided free of cost to everyone in the State. The United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had lodged separate complaints with the Commission stating that Mr. Vijayan had breached the model code. The Commission has written to the Chief Minister seeking a written explanation from him, State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran told reporters here on Monday.

Mr. Vijayan had stated that the COVID-19 vaccination would be provided free to all, during a press briefing on Saturday. The third and final phase of polling in the local body elections was held on Monday in four northern districts. Meanwhile, the Commission will not be taking any action on the complaint that Local Self-Government Minister A. C. Moideen had cast his vote ahead of the scheduled polling time in Thrissur district, Mr. Bhaskaran indicated. The election officers and the returning officer concerned have reported that the polling began at 7 a.m. as scheduled and not earlier, he said. The results of the local body elections are expected to be out by noon on Wednesday.

15 December 2020||Srinagar,||Terrorists open fire at PDP leader’s house||A policeman was killed as militants opened fire at the residence of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Haji Pervez Ahmad in Srinagar on Monday morning. An official said the unidentified gunmen tried to barge into the house in the Natipora area after attacking a personal security officer (PSO) guarding the gate. “If my second PSO had not retaliated, they would have managed to get inside,” Mr. Ahmad, who contested the 2008 Assembly poll, said. The PSO, identified as constable Manzoor Ahmad, was hit in the abdomen and later succumbed to injuries at a nearby hospital. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti alleged that there was downgrading of security of party leaders. “I strongly condemn the attack. The J&K administration has left Opposition leaders in a vulnerable position by downgrading their security. Lapses are likely to occur since protection given is inadequate,” she tweeted. DGP’s clarification Responding to Ms. Mufti's allegation, Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh said the PDP leader was beforehand asked by the police “to shift the location because of the congested area being prone to militant attacks”. Mr. Singh said, “The leader regularly violated security advisories. We reviewed his security and found there was need for a PSO and provided two”. The attack was an attempt to disrupt the ongoing peaceful District Development Council polls, he stated. “The police have laid their hands on some clues on the number of militants involved and the route used. The attackers will soon be brought to book,” he added. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, in a tweet, said: “I condemn the cowardly attack and salute the supreme sacrifice.

Members of the BKU (Ugrahan), however, were participating in a sit-in outside the District Collectorates in several parts of Punjab. “We are not participating in the hunger strike. The decision was taken by members of the 30-odd farmer unions from Punjab. They didn’t ask us; nor were we invited when the decision was taken,” Sukhdev Singh, BKU (Ugrahan) general secretary, told The Hindu . Mr. Singh, however, made it clear that this would not have any adverse effect on the ongoing movement. “We have been working in coordination with the 32 farmer unions since the agitation started. But at times there had been different decisions taken by them or us. But let me assure you that the aim of all of us is to get the farm laws revoked,” he said. In at least 15 districts across Punjab, members of the BKU (Ugrahan) were protesting since morning. On December 10 (Human Rights Day), the BKU (Ugrahan), during their protest, demanded the release of activists jailed for the Bhima Koreagon agitation. Notably, the BKU (Ugrahan) and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee are not part of the group of 32 unions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bkuu-opts-out-of-hunger-strike-but-will-continue-stir/article33332530.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||U.P. says journalist was riot mastermind||The Uttar Pradesh government has objected to a plea by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) to release its secretary, Sidhique Kappan, describing him as a “mastermind” with links to riots and disturbing public tranquillity nationwide. The State government, in an affidavit, said Mr. Kappan and his other co-accused were “mobilised towards” Hathras in Uttar Pradesh on the instructions of Mohammad Danish, an accused in the Delhi riots case. They were constantly in touch with Danish and Rauf Sherief, who is the general secretary of the students wing of the Popular Front of India (PFI). Mr. Kappan and his co-accused were detained en route to Hathras, where a Dalit girl was allegedly gang-raped and she died later. They were later booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and offences under other criminal laws. Sibal seeks time Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Monday, senior advocate Kapil Siibal, for the KUWJ, sought time to file its response. The State said Mr. Kappan was directly and closely associated with PFI members, who were executive members of banned terrorist organisation SIMI. The State accused the KUWJ of misleading the court by portraying Mr. Kappan as a journalist. It said he was only an occasional contributor to some media outlets. The identity card shown by Mr. Kappan belonged to a paper, Thejas , which was closed in 2018. However, this paper was an “acclaimed mouthpiece” of the PFI. The PFI is an “incarnation” of the banned SIMI. ‘Extreme views’ “ Thejas with which Sidhique Kappan has been associated is so extreme in its views that it has been creating religious discord in the State of Kerala insulting religious sentiments. The views of the paper were so extreme that it called terrorist Osama bin Laden a ‘martyr’ in its front page cover story on October 31, 2011”, the affidavit said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-says-journalist-was-riot-mastermind/article33332534.ece
15 December 2020||Lucknow,||U.P. woman denies forced marriage||The 22-year-old pregnant Hindu girl from Moradabad, whose Muslim husband was arrested under the new ordinance against unlawful conversions, is undergoing ‘microscopic examination’ after she was admitted to a hospital for the second time in three days with complaints of abdomen pain, the Uttar Pradesh child rights panel said. Uttar Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UPSCPCR) chairperson Vishesh Gupta told The Hindu on Monday that the foetus carried by the woman identified as Pinki was secure. Ms. Pinki, who was lodged at the Nari Niketan centre, a government-run women’s shelter, was undergoing tests at a women’s hospital. “ Abhi tak foetus bilkul secure hai (The foetus is completely secure as of now),” Mr. Gupta said. While an official said on Sunday that Ms. Pinki was three months pregnant, Mr. Gupta said doctors reported to him that the foetus was seven weeks old. As per the information provided to him by doctors there was no miscarriage, he added, reiterating the statement by the district probation officer, Rajesh Chandra Gupta, to The Hindu on Sunday. ‘Will submit report’ The “microscopic examination” of the woman, however, is to be conducted, said Mr. Gupta. The UPSCPCR would submit a report on the incident to the State government, he said.  Ms. Pinki was admitted to a hospital for the second time on Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, the district probation officer denied the report that Ms. Pinki was forced into a miscarriage, carried by The Telegraph quoting Ms. Pinki’s in-laws.  Her husband, identified as Rashid, and his brother were arrested under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 on December 5, allegedly on the basis of a complaint filed by Ms. Pinki’s mother. The complaint said Mr. Rashid had induced Ms. Pinki into marriage and converted her under the garb of providing her a job, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/moradabad-woman-to-undergo-further-tests/article33332556.ece

15 December 2020||Kolkata,||Trinamool MLA and Minister lock horns||Jitendra Kumar Tiwari, senior Trinamool Congress MLA and Chairman of the Asansol Municipal Corporation, on Monday alleged in a letter to State Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim that petty politics was stalling the development of the industrial city. “I am writing this letter requesting you to kindly allow the Asansol Municipal Corporation to get benefits provided by Central government or [let] State government provide equivalent funds for development of our beloved city Asansol as a rectification of ill deeds on your part towards Asansol,” Mr. Tiwari said in the letter. Central funds lost Blaming Mr. Hakim for allegedly preventing Asansol from benefiting from Rs. 2,000 crore of Central funds allotted under the Smart City Mission Project, Mr. Tiwari said “due to political reasons we were not allowed to get benefits of this project by the State government”. The MLA’s letter and open dissent sparked a war of words with the Minister, who said it was the policy of the State government to develop all cities. He added that Mr. Tiwari should have spoken to him before writing a letter. “If someone wants to leave the party they can. I am not saying that Jitendra will do so, he is a still a committed worker of the Trinamool Congress. But the BJP is misleading many,” Mr. Hakim said. The Asansol leader responded by saying that he could not turn a blind eye to the aspirations of the people of his constituency. “I will leave the chair and all facilities if it comes in the way of development of people of Asansol,” Mr. Tiwari said. The State BJP leadership joined the issue and welcomed Mr. Tiwari’s comments. Mr Tiwari’s complaints have added to the discontent in the TMC. Party heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari has been vocal in his dissent and Forests Minister Rajib Banerjee has also struck a discordant note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-mla-blames-party/article33332536.ece

15 December 2020||Bengaluru,||RTC employees call off strike in Karnataka||After a day-long high drama on Monday, employees of road transport corporations (RTCs) called off their strike bringing relief to lakhs of people who were put to great hardships owing to non-availability of buses. Farmers’ leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar, who was leading the employees, made the announcement at Freedom Park here after receiving a written assurance from the State government on fulfilling nine out of ten demands. The government approved these demands on Sunday, but on Monday, protesters demanded a written assurance from the Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi. On behalf of the government, BMTC chairman N. S. Nandiesha Reddy handed over the written assurance. A section of the protesters demanded that the strike be continued till their demand that they be considered as government employees was conceded; and many also sought clarity on implementing the pay scale recommended by the sixth pay commission. Following Mr. Chandrashekar’s discussion with the Transport Minister, he later announced calling off the strike. “The strike has been called off after the State government agreed to meet nine out of ten demands made by the employees,” he said. Mr. Chandrashekar also said that the government had been given a three-month deadline to implement the promises made. The Transport Minister, on Sunday, categorically said that it was impossible to consider them as government employees as there were other boards and corporations and they may also come up with similar demands. Among the major demands approved are: providing compensation of Rs. 30 lakh to families of employees who died of COVID-19, reducing probationary period of trainees to one year, administrative reforms to address complaints of employees on harassment, providing allowances to drivers and conductors withheld because of COVID-19. But not all employees were happy. “The very purpose of the strike was to demand that we be considered as government employees and that has been totally dismissed. There is also no clarity on how the sixth pay commission will get implemented. Earlier, once in four years, through agreements, pay revisions used to happen. I don’t know what we have gained from this strike. The major benefit is for families of employees who died of COVID-19 who will get compensation,” said an employee. Drivers also raised objections over repeated changes in the stand taken by leaders on demands. Some employees said calling off the strike was needed as non-availability caused hardship to the general public across the State. Mr. Chandrashekar also came under attack on Monday, with Revenue Minister R. Ashok calling him a “villain” who was “misleading employees”. Loss due to strike Owing to the strike, the cash-strapped RTCs suffered a loss of over Rs. 459 crore. KSRTC lost over Rs. 21 crore and BMTC Rs. 9 crore. During the protests, miscreants also damaged windshields and side mirrors of 64 buses by pelting stones. “Compared to previous days, we managed to operate some of the buses before the announcement was made on calling off the strike. After 5 p.m., bus services resumed across the city. KSRTC too operated intra-State and inter-State services. Buses will be operated as scheduled from Tuesday onwards,” said a transport corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rtc-employees-call-off-strike-in-karnataka/article33332504.ece

On the Uttar Pradesh border, protesters aligned with the Bharatiya Kisan Union-Tikait temporarily blocked the highway at Ghazipur. “Farmers are being arrested, and their tractors and trolleys are being stopped. Farmers from Uttarakhand are also being held back in U.P. We will not tolerate this harassment,” BKU leader Rakesh Tikait told presspersons, threatening to completely seal the Ghazipur border. “State government should not interfere. Our fight is long, and our demands are with the Centre.” However, another farmer leader from U.P. and the national convener of the AIKSCC, V.M. Singh, said he was willing to drop the demand for a repeal of the laws if the Centre brought in a law to guarantee MSP for all farm produce, from both public and private buyers. “These three laws will automatically become infructuous if the MSP guarantee law is passed. That was always our original demand. [Other organisations] are now changing the goalposts,” he told The Hindu . Mr. Singh was evicted from his position as AIKSCC national convener on Sunday night for his stand. The Centre has offered a written assurance that MSP will continue, but has so far refused to consider a legal guarantee. “If the government invites us for talks, I am willing to negotiate on behalf of U.P. farmers... So far, we have supported the demand for repeal of the three laws, but we cannot support a deadlock. We cannot be so rigid,” Mr. Singh added. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, meanwhile, met groups of farmers who support the farm reforms, albeit with amendments. Speaking to journalists after the meeting at Krishi Bhavan, Mr. Tomar said, “The government is ready for talks at any time. We wanted to have a clause-by-clause discussion on these laws. We are engaging with farmers. We have given our proposal to the farmers The farmer leaders have to decide and convey when they are ready for the next meeting.” Haryana Deputy Chief Minister and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala also urged the unions to take a step back and end the stand-off in the larger interest of the farming community. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who has previously acted as a mediator with farm leaders, also struck a conciliatory note. “Agriculture has been one sector which has been able to avoid the adverse effects of the pandemic... There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever,” he said, addressing industry group FICCI.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||November sees food inflation drop to 9.43%||“The headline CPI inflation for November 2020 printed appreciably lower than our expectations, benefiting from stable vegetable prices at the retail level,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA. “While this provides welcome relief, it is unlikely to prove adequate for any imminent rate easing,” she said. The Reserve Bank of India, in its monetary policy review earlier this month, had said that inflation is likely to remain elevated, barring transient relief in the winter months from prices of perishables. “This constrains monetary policy at the current juncture from using the space available to act in support of growth,” it noted. Among the major States, Bihar recorded the highest inflation at 9.8% in November, followed by West Bengal (9.42%), Andhra Pradesh (9.08%) and Telangana (8.99%). On the other end of the spectrum, Delhi, with 3.43% retail inflation, Punjab (5.36%) and Kerala (5.49%), recorded the lowest price rise in the country. Although lower food inflation has moderated CPI, core inflation still remains high at around 5.5% and protein inflation is still high within the food index, warned Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director of research at Knight Frank India. “High household inflationary expectations during the pandemic has made the CPI inflation sticky even in a weak demand scenario,” she said. Wholesale price index-based inflation rose further to 1.55% in November, from 1.48% in October, as per provisional official data released on Monday. Food price inflation moderated from 5.78% in October to 4.27% in November. “The divergence between retail and wholesale food inflation is increasing and has touched a five-month high of 5.5% in November 2020,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research. “We expect the retail inflation to decline to 6-5.5% range in the last quarter of 2020-21 due to easing food prices. However, sticky core inflation and COVID-related inflation will keep headline inflation elevated,” he said. Inflation in manufactured products, which have a weightage of over 64% in the wholesale price index, touched 2.97% — the highest level recorded in at least 20 months, suggesting a continued industrial recovery, on the back of 2.1% inflation recorded in October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/november-sees-food-inflation-drop-to-943/article33332523.ece

The park will generate 30,000 MW power through solar panels and windmills on 72,600 hectares along the India-Pakistan border. It is being set up by the Gujarat government with the participation of private players such as the Adani Group, which is the country’s largest renewable power generator, and Suzlon, a dominant player in wind energy. The park will have dedicated zones for wind and solar energy storage as well as an exclusive zone for wind park activities. During the day-long visit to his home State, Mr. Modi will also lay the foundation stone for a desalination plant and a fully automated milk processing and packing plant in Kutch. To meet the growing demand for water, Gujarat has turned to harnessing its vast coastline, taking steps to transform seawater to potable drinking water with the upcoming desalination plant at Mandvi, Kutch. This is one of the five desalination plants the government plans to set up along the coastal regions of Kutch and Saurashtra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gujarat-to-get-mega-renewable-energy-park/article33332524.ece

Fatema Quaid Zohar Challawala said the custom which allows the father “continuous custody” was against the welfare of both the child and the mother. The petitioner, represented by advocate Sriram P., said the custom was in clear violation of the Supreme Court verdicts which have consistently held that the welfare of the child is paramount while deciding custody.  The petitioner claimed her 10-year-old son was forcibly taken from her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/appeal-against-dawoodi-bohra-child-custody-norm/article33332551.ece
15 December 2020||MYSURU,||Father of a minor involved in road accident arrested||The father of a minor boy, who was involved in a road accident that claimed three lives on the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway on Thursday night, has been arrested. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic and Crime) Geetha Prasanna said the father of the boy, who was driving the four-wheeler involved in the accident, was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody. Ramesh, 40, his wife Usha, 36, and his daughter Monisha, 5, were killed while Siddharth, 3, escaped with injuries, when the two-wheeler on which they were returning to Mysuru from Siddalingapura on the outskirts of the city was hit by the four-wheeler driven by the 14-year-old boy around 10 p.m. on December 10. The 14-year-old, who was driving the vehicle, has been sent to the juvenile home, police said. After the boy abandoned the four-wheeler and fled the spot, the police recovered his father’s identity card from the vehicle. The four-wheeler belonged to a car showroom in Hootagalli in the city and was meant for trials for customers. The boy’s father had brought the vehicle home with him and the boy had taken it for a drive, leading to the ghastly accident, said Ms. Prasanna adding that the accident took place when the boy lost control of the speeding vehicle on the highway. She said the boy’s father was found to be ‘negligent’ in giving the vehicle to a minor boy to drive, which was responsible for the loss of three lives. Survivor with relatives The three-year-old boy, who was injured in the accident, has been discharged from the hospital and handed over to relatives, she said. According to Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Sandesh Kumar, a case had been booked under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code against the boy’s father, who is now in judicial custody. This is the first time such an incident has happened in the city, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/father-of-a-minor-involved-in-road-accident-arrested/article33332639.ece

Speaking to media persons at the party’s office in Delhi, Mr. Chautala said the farmers were initially seeking a few amendments to the three laws and a guarantee on minimum support price, and putting forward a new demand every day would only prolong the talks. “It has been 17 days since the agitation began and no one knows how long it might continue. It should be resolved at the earliest. It is in the larger interest of the farmers,” he said. He said Centre was ready to agree on a “few things”, and the farmer unions too should take a step back on their demands. “The stand-off would harm agriculture,” said Mr. Chautala. “A solution can be reached only through talks and not by being adamant,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pare-down-demands-jjp-tells-farmers/article33332823.ece

15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Protests may raise logistics costs, says CII||The CII on Monday said the ongoing farmers’ protests may lead to about 8-10% increase in logistics costs due to detours with consignments taking 50% longer to reach destinations in States such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi-NCR. “The agitation by farmers in many parts of India has led to disruption in supply chains and logistics. This will have a bearing on the economy over the coming days and may impinge the ongoing recovery from the economic contraction due to COVID-19,” the industry body said. “Around two-thirds consignments in transit are taking 50% extra time to reach destinations in the above States. In addition, the transport vehicles are forced to travel up to 50% longer to reach Delhi from the warehouses in Haryana, Uttarakhand and Punjab. This may push logistics cost by up to 8 to 10%,” it said. The CII statement added that many companies in the industrial belt surrounding Delhi are facing labour shortages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/protests-may-raise-logistics-costs-says-cii/article33332540.ece

A Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul reluctantly, and after much persuasion from senior advocate Harish Salve, agreed to consider the limited question on a request made by 94-year-old Veera Sarin, who said the “errors of history should be corrected and never happen again". “Something wrong may have happened at a particular point of history... But it has been 45 years. Many of the persons are no longer with us...”, Justice Kaul, leading a three-judge Bench, expressed his doubts. But Mr. Salve, for Ms. Sarin, replied “this may perhaps be the right time to do it”. “There was abuse of powers... If we do not tend to correct the errors of history, it will go on. We have to revisit this error. She [Sarin] wants a declaration that the Emergency was unconstitutional. For that, she cannot go to any other court,” Mr. Salve submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-hear-petition-on-emergency/article33332550.ece

Ebrahim Kunju in the Palarivattom flyover corruption case. Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan, while dismissing the bail petition of the Indian Union Muslim League leader, observed that the investigation was on in the case and very serious allegations had been levelled against the former Minister. Therefore, the petitioner could be released on bail at this stage. The petitioner submitted that he was suffering from multiple myeloma with renal failure and had been undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kochi since April 2020. Hence, he sought bail on medical grounds. Plea on medical grounds Rejecting the contention, the court pointed out that the petitioner, arrested on November 18, was now treated by a doctor of his choice. A person who got admitted to a hospital of his choice a day before his arrest and was being treated by a doctor of his choice was not entitled to the benefit of Section 437(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure (granting bail on medical grounds), especially when the treatment was going on. The court also noted that the report of a medical board constituted on the directive of the Muvattupuzha Vigilance court suggested that it was better for him to have hospital care until his clinical and hematological parameters improve, especially because of his immunocompromised state. The court granted Mr. Kunju the liberty to file a fresh bail petition once he was discharged from the hospital and removed to a prison.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-turns-down-ebrahim-kunjus-bail-plea/article33332512.ece

Left leaders had spotlighted the questionable voice clipping as evidence of a Central government-backed political plot against the government. Subsequently, the Customs arrested Swapna for a second time on the charge of smuggling out the profits of gold smuggling as foreign currency to Dubai.

15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hit hard by pandemic, hotels realign operations||The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the restaurant business in Chennai. Those who are in this sector are realigning their models, cutting down on expansion plans. Some have even downed the shutters. The data provided by industry experts and various associations show that over 2,000 small, medium and big restaurants have folded in the last two months. The reason — lower footfalls, labour shortage and the inability to pay rents and salaries and repay loans. “The city has over 8,000 eateries, including bakeries and coffee shops. Of them, over 2,000 have wound up. Many more are on the verge of closing down,” said M. Ravi, president of the Chennai Hotels Association and chairman of Vasanta Bhavan Hotels India Pvt. Ltd. Minimal staff He said many big restaurant chains had cut down the number of outlets, while many had paused their expansion plans. “If you look at our own business, we are streamlining our branches and we are learning to operate our branches with minimal staff,” he said. A quick search on social media forums and OLX will throw up dozens of advertisements, posted in the last 90 days, saying restaurants are up for sale. Those tracking the business in Chennai said many players were looking for investors; some were even willing to shed stakes to get the money needed to run their business. A restaurant owner, who had put up an advertisement for sale, said, “My hotel (40-seater) is situated right near the Koyambedu bus terminus. My business has dropped by 70% and my expenses are more than what I’m making each day. So I have decided to sell the assets and do the same business from home and sell through delivery apps.” Cooking is a hobby The proprietor of another restaurant at Choolaimedu said that after the lockdown many families started cooking food at home; even those who came to hotels tightened their belts. “Men and women who had never cooked before took to cooking as a hobby during the lockdown with the help of online videos. They have seen the cost difference and are in a saving mode now,” he said. “I was planning to sell my business for Rs. 13 lakh, and no one is coming forward; I’m now pitching the sale for Rs. 7 lakh-Rs. 8 lakh so that I can clear my loans.” Most of the restaurants that have come up for sale are located near information technology hubs, business corridors, schools and colleges. Four different restaurant owners who had put up advertisements on OLX and social media platforms to sell their business said they did not expect crowds until the vaccine was out. “Several unorganised home-caterers have mushroomed in the last few months. This has also taken its toll on restaurants,” one of them said. ‘A lesson’ K.T. Srinivasa Raja, managing director of Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets India Pvt. Ltd., said the volume of business had reached 70% of the pre-COVID-19 levels. He said that while many restaurants had closed, many had opened new branches. “COVID-19 was a lesson for the industry to rethink business strategies. Hopefully, in 2021, the business will fully reach the pre-pandemic levels,” he said. He has reopened only 80% of his branches. The pandemic had taught the industry how to run the business with the existing workers and how to make a good output with lesser resources, he said. “We would not have imagined all this if COVID-19 had not happened.” A hotelier at Vadapalani, who has shifted from Arcot Road to a nearby location, said smaller spaces would make sense in future. “Takeaways constitute over 60% of my total orders. So it made an economic sense for me to shift from a big premises to a less expensive small space,” he said. Sathish D. Nagasamy, managing director of Dindigul Thalappakatti, had a different story. For him, 80%-85% of the business is back; even during the lockdown, he opened seven new branches. “We are opening 10 more branches by March 2021 in Coimbatore, Vellore and Palakkad, among other places,” he said. Mr. Nagasamy said the sales had been better in Tier-II towns than in the cities. The only challenge for him was staff shortage.

15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Beaches reopen to lukewarm response||Greater Chennai Corporation on Monday opened beaches for visitors after nine months of lockdown. Fewer visitors and vendors were found on Monday in Marina and Elliot’s beaches. According to estimates, less than 10% of the vendors turned up on at the Marina beach on Monday evening. The Greater Chennai Corporation had estimated that there were more than 1,700 vendors on the Marina beach before the lockdown. The number of vendors would be restricted to 900, officials said. The number of vendors on Marina beach was less than 150 on Monday. Most of the shops on the Marina beach remained closed by evening. Civic officials said many vendors had lost their source of livelihood and were unable to set up shop now. Civic officials would identify such vendors. Less than 20 vendors were found doing business on Elliot’s beach on Monday evening. Most of the shops were damaged in the cyclone a few days ago. The number of cars parked at the two beaches was much less than that of a normal day before the lockdown, according to estimates of civic authorities. Garbage collection Corporation Chief Engineer N. Mahesan said the civic workers collected five tonnes of solid waste from the Marina beach on Monday. “We have increased the number of conservancy workers, bins and vehicles to improve collection of waste,” said Mr. Mahesan. S. Mangala Raj, former councillor, said many vendors in the beaches had started business in other parts of the city. “The crowds will increase on Pongal day, increasing the risk of COVID-19. The government should have opened the beaches after a few more months,” said Mr. Mangala Raj. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Revenue and Finance) Meghanatha Reddy said various departments of the Corporation had made coordinated efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 because of crowding at beaches. “We have not collected any fine from residents on the first day. Officials have been asked to follow standard operating procedures. There will be an uptick in the number of visitors to the beach this month. But many people are on the watch because of COVID-19 cases in IIT Madras,” said Mr. Meghanatha Reddy. Projects under the Smart City mission in the Marina beach will be completed this month. Work on “Namma Chennai”, a 10-feet high installation, would also begin, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beaches-reopen-to-lukewarm-response/article33332698.ece
15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court displeased with waning quality of political rhetoric in State||The Madras High Court on Monday expressed displeasure over the “waning quality” of political rhetoric in the State and urged the leaders to avoid “vituperative and abusive” language while addressing each other. It also advised them to desist from levelling allegations without materials to substantiate them. Justice N. Sathish Kumar made the observations while quashing three criminal defamation cases filed at the instance of the State government against DMK president M.K. Stalin for having accused Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and others of indulging in corruption. Making it clear that his observations were not directed only against the petitioner before the court but also other politicians, the judge said though everyone enjoys a constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression, it could not be taken as a licence by them to use abusive language against their opponents. “This court is of the view that the leaders, irrespective of political parties, should introspect on the use of harsh words and vituperative language and desist from doing so at least in the future,” the judge observed in one of the three orders. He was dismayed when State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan read out the contents of the petitioner’s Tamil speeches for which the defamation proceedings had been initiated. He said the language used by the Leader of the Opposition was not in good taste. Though as many as eight quash petitions filed by Mr. Stalin had been listed before the judge on Monday, he quashed only three cases. He adjourned the rest to January 7 after the SPP stated that he required time to argue them since they were related to a baseless charge levelled against the Chief Minister. It was brought to the notice of the court that two of the five cases had been filed against the Leader of the Opposition for having accused Mr. Palaniswami of playing a role in the Kodanad case without any iota of material. “This is a baseless charge and I need time to argue the matter,” he told the judge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-displeased-with-waning-quality-of-political-language/article33332729.ece
15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors voice concerns over mini clinics||With the Chief Minister launching 2,000 mini clinics on Monday, a section of government doctors has voiced concerns over the location of these clinics and their working hours, and diversion of doctors, including those from mobile medical units, to these clinics. In a letter to the Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) welcomed the decision. However, it said that as per the government order, these clinics would function from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Though doctors and nurses could go home and return for duty in the evening, it would be difficult for them as these clinics were planned for areas with fewer transport facilities. As a result, they would have to stay at the clinic, their working hours getting prolonged for over 10 hours, it said. How was it possible for the staff to stay at a place that would not have basic amenities, including toilets, for more than 10 hours as the clinics were coming up at health sub-centres or panchayat buildings, it asked. With doctors working in mobile medical units and Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) teams diverted to the mini clinics, the TNGDA asked whether it would be possible for these schemes to continue. It said new doctors and staff nurses should be recruited for the mini clinics through the Medical Services Recruitment Board. In addition to recruitment of new doctors, the the Tamil Nadu Medical Officers Association (TNMOA) demanded a re-evaluation of the timings of the clinics, appointment of a pharmacist for dispensing medicines, grant of transport facility or travel allowance for doctors and framing of guidelines for the functioning of the clinics. As per the plan, the mini clinics are to be established in needy areas to improve access to primary health care facilities. However, a section of government doctors has pointed out that there are issues in identifying locations. “The guidelines for the location of the clinics were not followed strictly. There are discrepancies between the proposal of the Health Department and what has been implemented. In many areas, the clinics are not being set up in strategic locations. As a result, the neglected population will remain neglected. The local Ministers had selected the locations of the mini clinics,” an officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In phase-I, 630 mini clinics are being readied. A government doctor pointed out that in most places, many health sub-centres were converted into the clinics. He said the clinics were opened in places where there are government health care facilities nearby. “As of now, many doctors attached to mobile medical units, RBSK and Primary Health Centres with less than 100 outpatients are diverted to these clinics. These programmes will get diluted. For instance, the RBSK units carry out school health programmes, while a mobile medical unit covers 42 villages a month. These services will be compromised,” he said.  The guidelines for the location of the clinics were not followed strictly.

Each clinic will have a doctor, a nurse and an assistant. He said 2,000 clinics would be opened across the State. He inaugurated around 200 clinics at Royapuram, Vyasarpadi and Mylapore in Chennai. The State has 1,851 primary health centres, and the mini clinics will be opened in places where there are no primary health centres and where a large number of poor people live. In his address, Mr. Palaniswami said: “Across Tamil Nadu, one doctor, one nurse and one assistant will be employed in every Amma Mini Clinic so that the poor can seek treatment in the areas where they live. The places where the poor live in greater numbers will be identified for opening mini clinics...” He said poor families had to spend Rs. 100-Rs. 200 on treatment from private facilities. “Amma Mini Clinic is a scheme to ensure that poor families don’t even have to bear that burden...,” he said. These clinics will function from 8 a.m. to noon and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. They will check temperature, oxygen levels, blood pressure, haemoglobin levels and blood sugar levels and test urine samples. “The Amma’s (Jayalalithaa’s) government has provided medical services to rural poor across Tamil Nadu by setting up 254 primary health centres and upgrading the facilities at 166 primary health centres with 30 beds and scan facilities. Based on the requests from people, government hospitals and primary health centres are being upgraded. As many as 16.17 lakh beneficiaries have received baby-care kits at a cost of Rs. 219 crore. Besides, Rs. 4,000 is being given to pregnant women under the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme.” He said: “9.69 lakh people have been provided with medical consultation through the ‘104’ scheme, while 902 new ambulances have been pressed into service under the 108 Emergency Ambulance Scheme, benefiting close to 46.8 lakh persons, including 11.26 lakh pregnant women.

The government has spent Rs. 190 crore on the estaablishment of ‘Linear Accelerator’ facilities for cancer treatment at 10 government hospitals, enabling the poor to receive as good medical care as that can be had from private hospitals.” Mr. Palaniswami said 7.62 lakh camps had been held under the ‘Mobile Hospital’ scheme, benefiting close to 6.30 crore people, and 67, 077 people have benefited from the Amma Master Health Check Up Scheme. “The Adyar Cancer Institute has been upgraded at a cost of Rs. 120 crore. Four cancer treatment zones have been created in Tamil Nadu at a cost of Rs. 59 crore. Government hospitals have been provided with 56 CT scan machines, 22 MRI scan machines, 18 catheterization laboratories and 530 dialysis equipment at a cost of Rs. 300 crore,” he said. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said, “We have succeeded in bring down the number of COVID-19 cases from over 6,000 cases a day to over 1,000 cases a day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the efforts of Amma’s government in getting the pandemic under control. Ever since the disease emerged in China, Amma’s government took all precautions and declared it an ‘infectious disease’ under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act and released guidelines under the Epidemic Diseases Act.” “So far, 228 COVID-19 testing centres have been created...,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-amma-mini-clinics-to-treat-poor/article33332693.ece
15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||PIB supports initiative to fight misinformation||At a crucial time like this, it is important to harness social media and spread the right information to counter misinformation, said T.V. Venkateswaran, Science communicator and scientist at Vigyan Prasar. He was speaking on “Science communication through social media during pandemic times” as part of the Indian International Science Festival 2020 organised by the Press Information Bureau on Monday. Mr. Venkateswaran said that ever since outbreak of COVID-19, social media was used to spread misinformation. “People’s reaction to a new disease which has been unheard of has been a combination of panic, coming up with conspiracy theories, or even disbelief which has led them to seek quack remedies. All these pose challenges to ensuring public cooperation to fight the spread of the virus,” he said. “We cannot ignore how many people demonstrated acts of humanity and kindness at a time like this and helped people out.” He said experts in the field of science and medicine from across the country came together to harness the power of social media and reach out to people through a host of initiatives. “The web portalindscicov.inhas around 500 scientists from across the country who recognised the need to share accurate, science based information regarding COVID-19 in different languages to ensure it reaches many people. Covid-gyan.in, an initiative of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and the Indian Institute of Science, was initiated to provide resources and information about the pandemic,” Mr. Venkateswaran said. Series of lectures The PIB too, he said, had been working on combating fake news and misinformation. “Vigyan Prasar brought out Ariviyal Palagai with over 100 lectures in Tamil from experts collaborating with the Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre. This sought to take the right information to the people at a time when there were new rumours and unverified information being spread,” he added. M. Annadurai, Additional Director General, PIB, delivered the introductory address as a part of the discussion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pib-supports-initiative-to-fight-misinformation-on-covid-19/article33332710.ece
15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Visitors back in Mamallapuram as monuments reopen||Visitors to Mamallapuram were surprised to find archaeological monuments open on Monday after being shut down for several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since only online booking of tickets was permitted, the tourists bought tickets on their mobile phones even as they waited outside the monuments. Naveed Hafiz from Bengaluru, in Chennai on a business trip, said he chose to come to Mamallapuram thinking the monuments were open. “I did not even know they were closed. I was lucky that they reopened today. Buildings in Chennai are all commercial, there is nothing special about them. I like seeing historical places and the guide here is explaining very well,” he said. Balan, a guide, said it was nice to see people entering the monuments. “After hotels and resorts opened, there were very few visitors and they could not enter the monuments. Today, there are people around. We will have to wait and watch if the numbers increase,” he said. Worst hit Tourist guides, photographers, trinket sellers and sculptors, who depend on the tourism industry were severely hit by the lockdown. J. Sethuraman of Mamalla Group of Hotels said the bulk of the town’s economy depended on budget travellers and that segment was yet to pick up. “We have been seeing guests at resorts. Last month, since weddings were held, families came in. As far as heritage properties are concerned, December looks better with occupancy going up from 10% to 25%,” he said. Official sources in Archaeological Survey of India said that monuments in other parts of the country were opened for visitors a few months ago. “In Tamil Nadu, it has been a month since they were opened, but the Kancheepuram district administration decided to reopen those in Mamallapuram only now. We do not allow physical ticketing. You have to book your session and pay for it online. There are five ticketed sites in the State and we are ensuring all standard operational procedures, including sanitisation, wearing of masks and physical distancing, are maintained here,” the official said.

15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CPI(M) leader condemns police action||CPI(M) State secretary K.Balakrishnan condemned the police action against those who protested across the State on Monday before the District Collectorate backing the farmers in Delhi. In a statement, he alleged that police had attacked farmers and women who participated in the protest and arrested them. In Dindigul, former MLA K. Balabharathi and others were attacked and kept in a marriage hall, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged. He also warned that people will teach an apt lesson to the Edappadi Palaniswami-led government “which is treating farmers like anti-social elements through police action”. Medical fee hike Meanwhile, Mr. Balakrishnan has appealed to Mr. Palaniswami to direct the Rajah Muthiah Medical College in Annamalai University to collect fees similar to that of other government medical colleges. In his letter, he pointed out that Rajah Muthiah Medical College is asking students to pay fees of Rs. 5.44 lakh for MBBS courses and Rs. 3.45 lakh for BDS courses and alleged that they are not allowing students to attend classes if they don’t pay the fees. He said this had caused stress among students and parents and the higher fees had been fixed when a case was pending before the apex court on the issue. He urged the Chief Minister to intervene and ensure that the college does not force students to pay higher fees. Mr. Balakrishnan also demanded that the college be brought under the purview of the Health Department. It should be converted into a government medical college and hospital. He suggested that the name should be changed from Rajah Muthiah Medical College to Cuddalore Government Medical College and Hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpim-leader-condemns-police-action-on-protesters/article33332726.ece
15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Now, doctors keep close watch on post-COVID-19 symptoms||Fresh coronavirus infections may be on the decline but doctors continue to keep a close watch on post-COVID-19 sequelae in Chennai. From the commonest symptom of fatigue to the rarest complication involving the eyes, a cross-section of doctors is of the view that patients who had COVID-19 need follow-up for at least a year. One of the first institutions to start a post-COVID Outpatient Ward (OP), the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), has so far received 1,074 patients since August. Of this, 292 persons were in the age group of 51 to 60 years and 255 aged 41 to 50 years. “We have been seeing 10 to 12 patients a day for the last 102 days. We ask patients to come for a follow-up four weeks from the date of hospital admission,” E. Theranirajan, dean, RGGGH, said. Out of 1,074 patients, 63 were newly diagnosed with diabetes. As many as 173 patients complained of myalgia. While 130 patients complained of breathlessness, CT scans showed new findings in the lungs in 14 of them, he said. Twenty-four persons were newly diagnosed with hypertension, and whether this was associated with COVID-19 or was stress-related was being evaluated. Psychological evaluation found that 191 persons had sleep disorders, 111 had anxiety disorders and 44 depression. About 95 persons with visual problems were referred to the Government Ophthalmic Hospital. He said that the department of community medicine was engaged in continuous follow-up of all patients. “So far, we have reached out to 14,000 of the 28,000 persons who were admitted for COVID-19 treatment at RGGGH through phone calls. Through the post COVID-19 OP, we are analysing the symptoms that persist in patients,” he said. ‘New illness’ At Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, the post COVID-19 OP has so far treated 500 to 600 persons. “COVID-19 is a new illness, and we do not know about its late complications. So, it is imperative for physicians to follow the patients for at least six months to one year,” R. Jayanthi, hospital dean, said. In their experience, patients with over 70%-80% lung involvement in the primary illness hardly had residual deficits. “Follow-up is important to check for any chronic lesions in patients who had lung involvement,” she said. D. Suresh Kumar, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals said fatigue was the commonest post-COVID symptom that they saw in patients. “Many say they are unable to do simple jobs and need to take rest. Some report with persistent mild cough, sore throat, while there are some others with lack of taste and smell,” he said. With hospitals focussing on post-COVID complications in the last few months, around 10% to 20% patients who were affected with COVID-19 during June, July and August were approaching for a review now, he said. “The symptoms persist longer in about 3% to 5% of persons.” There were rare complications of loss of vision too. “The blood vessels to the eyes are blocked. As a result, there are patients who come in with retinal problems,” Dr. Kumar said. Many persons have suffered heart attacks within four to six weeks of initial symptoms, he noted.  Psychological evaluation found that 191 persons had sleep disorders, 111 had anxiety disorders and 44 depression||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-keep-a-close-watch-on-post-covid-19-symptoms/article33332691.ece

(CMRL) plans to conduct a signalling test and a trial run with a locomotive next week, sources said. CMRL is likely to open the 9-km phase I extension project between Washermanpet and Wimco Nagar by the end of next month. According to CMRL officials, they planned to run the locomotive engine this week but for some reason, it had been pushed to next week. “The signalling test too will be a trial to check how it functions; if there are any hitches, they have to be rectified now before the final signalling software is handed over by next month,” an official said. The locomotive is operated usually before the opening of any stretch after the track is laid. “It is a routine process; the real test is when the train is operated and the working mechanism of all the systems such as signalling, overhead cables, telecom and others are checked. There is still no decision taken on when the trial run with trains will commence,” another official said. Sources said while the trial run and checking of systems were set to begin, focus would be on completing the construction of stations along this stretch. “Compared to last month, the speed of construction of stations has picked up; but this is not enough. They have to significantly gain speed to finish it on time next month for the inauguration of this stretch,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-rail-trial-run-signalling-test-on-north-stretch-likely-next-week/article33332704.ece

15 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||33 more test positive on IIT Madras campus||Another 33 persons have tested positive for COVID-19 on the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras). With this, a total of 104 persons — 87 students, 16 mess employees and a resident — have tested positive for the infection, even as the Health Department and the Greater Chennai Corporation are in the process of lifting 300-odd samples. Sources in the Health Department said preliminary investigation into the possible source of infection pointed to the common mess that was closed down two days ago after a number of cases were reported. However, this being a pandemic, the department was not ruling out the possibility of transmission caused by the movement of people and meeting at common places. The lack of maintaining physical distancing in the mess could be one of the reasons. Pointing to the need to maintain physical distancing in places of dining, an official said that similar clusters had occurred in a textile showroom in Tiruchi and in a few marriages and funerals. Official’s inspection The institute came under containment following a spike in COVID-19 cases in the last few days. After reporting sporadic cases since December 1, the institute witnessed a rise in the number of cases from December 11 following which the departments, centres, and the library were shut. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan met the students who were undergoing treatment at the Government COVID-19 Hospital, Guindy, and inspected the college and hostels on IIT Madras campus on Monday. “After the spike in cases, we, in addition to contacts and those with symptoms, have gone for saturation tests. So far, out of the 449 persons tested, 104 are positive for COVID-19. All are in the mild category with two among nine hostels having more cases,” he said. He added that the X-ray and CT scan of all patients were taken. So far, all are mild and stable but under close monitoring, he said. “The Health department is repeatedly focussing on three Cs — closed spaces, crowded spaces, and contacts. The Directorate of Public Health and City Health authority is studying the cause of this cluster. We are lifting 300-odd samples more and are likely to complete lifting of samples by Tuesday,” he said. He added that the numbers are likely to rise. “This is the best strategy. We need to isolate and treat positive persons so that the infection does not spread,” he said. The Health Secretary was accompanied by Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director of IIT Madras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/33-more-test-positive-on-iit-madras-campus/article33332686.ece

15 December 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Kumkis deployed in Gudalur to trace wild elephant||Following the wild elephant attack that claimed the lives of a father-son near Gudalur in the Nilgiris district on Sunday, the Forest Department has deployed three kumkis (trained elephants) to trace the wild elephant on Monday. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle) I. Anwardeen told The Hindu that kumkis Bomman and Wasim from Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) and Kaleem from Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) will be engaged to trace the wild tusker. About 30 Forest Department personnel, including two teams from MTR, an elephant tracking team from ATR and a Rapid Response Team from the Nilgiris will be involved in the search operations, he said. On Sunday evening, Kolapalli union DMK councillor Anandaraj (49) and his son Prasath (29) were travelling on a two-wheeler near Gudalur when they were attacked and trampled to death by the wild elephant. Similarly, Nagamuthu (60) from Cherangode in Gudalur was killed in an elephant attack on December 11. Mr. Anwardeen said that the wild male elephant, whose age is estimated to be over 50 years, is suspected to have been involved in both these incidents. The Forest Department will tranquillise the wild elephant in a conducive topography, he said. “This is a hilly terrain. We have to look for a right place to dart it,” Mr. Anwardeen said. Drones are also being used to trace its whereabouts, he noted. Meanwhile on Monday, Gudalur DMK MLA M. Thiravidamani said that many shops remained closed in Pandalur taluk and the residents staged a demonstration condemning the Forest Department for not taking precautionary measures to prevent elephant attacks. A meeting was convened with senior officials from Revenue Department and Forest Department in Gudalur on Monday, where demands for employment for the deceased’s kin and compensation were placed, he said. Mr. Thiravidamani also urged the district administration to install adequate street lights and clear the bushes next to roads, which will prevent elephant attacks in the future. A senior official from the Revenue Department said that Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya has provided oral assurance for a government job to the kin of the deceased. However, the relatives demanded a compensation of Rs. 25 lakh as opposed to the usual Rs. 4 lakh during the meeting, which could be decided only by the State government, she said. The relatives of Anandaraj and Prasath have not accepted the bodies from Gudalur Government Hospital as of Monday despite the completion of autopsy due to these demands, according to the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kumkis-deployed-in-gudalur-to-trace-wild-elephant/article33332746.ece

15 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||24x7 drinking water supply project makes little progress||Almost two years after starting work on the 24x7 drinking water supply project to revamp drinking water distribution in the old city area – 60 wards – the Coimbatore Corporation has made very little progress. The Corporation sources familiar with the project said the civic body had only completed 10% of the total work. This meant that the Corporation had replaced only pipeline for 170 km of the 1,700 km. By December 2020, the Corporation should have completed at least 320 km. Even the 170 km pipeline that the Corporation had laid, it had not completed work in any area, the sources said, explaining that the civic body that had divided the project area in 60 wards into 102 district metering areas had not completed work in even one of those. Even as the pipeline laying work by digging roads was getting delayed, the Corporation explored the possibility of constructing at least a few of the 32 overhead tanks or service reservoirs proposed under the project. The reason that the Corporation wanted the tank construction to take priority was that it was not on roads and therefore required very little inter-department coordination for traffic management. But even this work had not taken off, as expected, the sources conceded and added that the Corporation had renewed tank construction on a priority and would very soon take up construction of six tanks. The reasons that the Corporation sources attributed for the delay were the slow start of the project, the COVID-19 lockdown affecting the arrival of pipelines and other materials and, the return of labourers. Now the Corporation had asked the contractor executing the project – Suez India Pvt. Ltd. – to double the number of labourers so that the pace of execution improved. The contractor, as per the agreement signed with the Corporation, was supposed to complete the pipeline laying and tank construction work in four years, by 2023.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/24x7-drinking-water-supply-project-makes-little-progress/article33332753.ece

15 December 2020||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Unruly scenes as police try to break up farmers’ protest||The farmers’ announcement to stage a wait-in protest near the Collectorate campus here on Monday witnessed some unruly scenes, wordy altercations and forced removal of cadres by police personnel. Led by various farmer organisations affiliated to different associations, major opposition parties and members from AIDWA and CITU joined together to condemn the Central government for its ‘adamant’ attitude in not resolving the farmers’ strike in New Delhi. Farmers have been protesting in Delhi for over a fortnight demanding the Union Government to withdraw the Farm Act passed recently in the Parliament. Senior Communist leader and former MLA Balabharathi led the demonstration near Anjali Hotel roundabout. As the police said that there was no permission for the protest, the agitators moved towards Sheeba Hospital, but again the police followed them and said that no one was permitted to obstruct vehicular traffic. Finally, when the demonstrators moved towards the Collectorate and announced that they would resort to a wait-in protest until the Centre agreed to the demands of their counterparts in New Delhi, the police, through the public address system appealed to the agitators to disperse and warned that they would arrest them. As a large posse of personnel arrived in vans, the agitators refused to disperse. When some of the women agitators were being dragged to the vehicle, Ms. Balabharathi objected to such an ill treatment. "Treat us with dignity...we are here for a public cause," but the police physically lifted and dragged some of them and took them to a private marriage hall. The CPI (M) district secretary R. Sachidanandam condemned the police action in a press statement. Shouting slogans against the AIADMK government and the BJP, the farmers led by Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam president N. Perumal, said that they would not be cowed down by such threats. They refused the food served to them by the police at noon. A senior officer said that as they had not given permission for agitation, cases will be booked against them. Theni In Theni, members of various farmers associations assembled in front of the District Collectorate led by coordinator T. Kannan. DMK west district secretary Thanga Tamilselvan, CPI(M) district secretary D. Venkatesan, Periyakulam MLA Saravanakumar among others addressed the gathering. They explained about the consequences of the Farm Laws and how it would affect the livelihood of the farmers. When the agitators continued with their addresses, the police issued an ultimatum and arrested them from the spot. While a majority of them courted arrest, some among them had to be taken by force, the demonstrators claimed.   Ramanathapuram Supporting the farmers' agitating in New Delhi, a large number of members from farmers associations and opposition political parties staged a demonstration in Kamudi and near the Collectorate. CPI(M) district secretary V. Kasinathadurai led the agitation near the solar power plant facility owned by the Adani group in Kamudi in which party cadres shouted slogans against the Centre and the BJP. At Ramanathapuram Collectorate, All India Farmers' Sammelan coordinator V. Mayilvaganan and others joined in a wait-in protest agitation. However, the police said that there was no permission and hence arrested them.  Sivaganga Former CPI MLA Gunasekaran led the agitation in Sivaganga in which CPI (M) Veerapandian, Satyamurthi (Congress), Sevanthiappan (MDMK) and cadres joined. Any delay in withdrawing the Acts may further cause problems to the government as the farmers were on protest for more than 15 days, they said. Instead of testing the farmers’ patience, the government should invite them for talks and announce sops so that the livelihood of the farmers was not under threat in any way, the speakers said during the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unruly-scenes-as-police-try-to-break-up-farmers-protest/article33332892.ece

In a petition submitted to the administration here on Monday, P. Manikandan, member of the general council of the association, said they had been raising their demand with the State Commissioner for Welfare of the Differently Abled Persons, Chennai, for over two years now. But, no steps had been taken so far, the petition said. Five vehicle designs were tested at the Commissioner’s Office in Chennai and improvements were made by the private company that manufactured the vehicles. Though a design was finally accepted on December 21, 2018, no steps were taken to distribute the vehicles to them. The petition also wanted pension for persons with spinal cord injuries hiked like the one prevailing in Andhra Pradesh, which was Rs. 5,000. The petition said complexities in mobility, functional disabilities and spinal cord injuries should be declared as multiple disabilities and should be properly evaluated and declared in the disability certificate.

15 December 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Protest condemning attacks on Dalit community||Members of Tamil Puligal Katchi staged a demonstration here on Monday condemning the continuous attack on Dalit community in the district. Led by its district secretary R. Sinthanaiselvan, the members said there were 77 types of modern untouchable atrocities carried out against the community with an aim to suppress their basic rights. The brutal murder of the couple at Chittapullampalayam in Kodumudi Taluk, attack on a couple for their inter-caste marriage at Bhavani and attack on a youth at Vellode were a few incidents that happened in the district in the past few months. Despite the affected persons lodging complaints with the police, only katta panchayats happened and the victims did not get justice. They said reducing the post-matric scholarship for Dalit students by the BJP-led Central government was an injustice to the community and wanted scholarships given for engineering graduates regularly. The Centre had also reduced the scholarship from Rs. 87,000 to Rs. 30,000 for students from SC/ST/BC and OBC students studying medical courses. Also, students need to take up entrance exams for receiving the scholarship, they said and wanted the system withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protest-condemning-attacks-on-dalit-community/article33332908.ece

As the police denied permission for the protest in front of the Collectorate, it was organised at a private vacant land located on Perundurai Road. MPs A. Ganeshamurthi (Erode), Anthiyur P Selvaraj (Rajya Sabha), DMK deputy general secretary Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan, Erode South District DMK secretary S. Muthusamy, senior leaders from the Congress, left parties and other allies participated. Speakers said the laws were meant to benefit corporate companies and would have a huge impact on people and the farmers in the country. They said the BJP-led Central government had passed various laws in favour of private companies and industrialists in the country and the three farm laws would encourage hoarding and price fixation by the companies. They said the farmers could not decide on the crop to be cultivated and would be forced to cultivate what corporate companies and multinational companies would decide. The Electricity (Amendment) Bill would enable withdrawal of all the subsidies and 100 units of free power given to households, power looms and other key sectors. Also, consumers would be forced to pay additional charges for power consumption, they said and wanted the Bill withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-begin-fast-in-erode/article33332909.ece

15 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Protests in support of farmers continue||Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi cadres staged a demonstration in front of Reliance Trends showroom in the city as part of a protest call given by All India Kisan Sabha Coordination Committee to boycott two corporates in connection with new farm laws. The protest was led by Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan. “The hurriedly passed three farm laws were not in the interest of farmers but only to promote the interests of Ambani and Adani corporates,” said Mr. Venkatesan. Stating that even before the laws could be passed in the Parliament, both the corporates had started to build cold storage facilities and godowns, he said it raised suspicion that the corporates had been given green signal much before. Such important laws were neither sent to the Select Committee of the parliament for discussion nor the opposition allowed to debate in detail on the cons of the farm legislations, he charged. “The government that did not allow opposition to debate on the important issue, is now holding talks with the protesting farmers for four to five hours every day,” he said. The farmers have appealed to boycott the two corporates and its products and services, he said. Meanwhile, farmers and cadres of political parties attempted to stage a sit-in protest at the Collectorate. They wanted the Centre to repeal all the three laws. Among the protesters were leaders C. Ramakrishnan (CPI-M), P. Kalidoss (CPI), Pudur Boominathan (Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam). The protesters were arrested and removed from the spot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protests-in-support-of-farmers-continue/article33333111.ece
15 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Will contest Assembly election: Kamal||Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan on Monday said he will definitely enter the fray in the 2021 Assembly elections, unlike in the last Parliamentary polls where he chose not to contest. Addressing journalists in Madurai where he undertook the second day of his election campaign, Mr. Haasan said, “It would not be the right moment now to announce from which constituency I will contest.” Ties with Rajini Asked about the likelihood of a poll pact with Mr. Rajinikanth, he said the possibility of such a tie-up was hinted last year itself. “We are waiting for the right moment. It will be appropriate to give more information based on the announcement expected to be made by Mr. Rajinikanth on December 31,” he said. “Even in the highly-competitive film industry, both I and Mr. Rajinikanth have not been competitors. We have travelled in our own paths,” added Mr. Haasan. At the same time, he said details regarding the formation of a third front for the elections will be announced soon. The MNM will prioritise on forming a corruption-free government and work towards removing corruption right from the highest to the lowest income groups of the State, he assured. The main party members have been trained for the past two years on corruption-free governance.  Mr. Haasan said that he would not accept being called an atheist. “I am a rationalist. My personal views will not affect my work towards the people,” he said. He claimed that ruling AIADMK leaders are anxious that the goodwill and support from the public for MNM has increased. He accused the AIADMK of creating a false impression that the MNM is a party only for the privileged people and not for the common people. When asked about the farmers’ protest in New Delhi, Mr. Haasan said MNM members had participated in it. The three agricultural laws will affect the livelihood of the farmers. Earlier, Mr. Haasan held meetings with industrialists, advocates and differently-abled persons in Madurai. Later, he campaigned at Usilampatti before heading towards Andipatti and Theni. Focus on women In Theni, Mr. Haasan said the MNM would field more women candidates in the election than any other party. Interacting with party functionaries, he said the number of women voters in Tamil Nadu was higher than men. “If this is to be taken as a yardstick, then women voters would decide who should emerge victorious in every constituency. Who would form the government..and so on,” he said. In an apparent reference to the AIADMK leader O.Panneerselvam’s recent remarks that women and men should govern the State for two-and-a-half years each, he said that if this was the ruling party’s stand, then here (in Theni), the father was an MLA and his son an MP. Claiming that the MNM would not simply preach, he said the party would give more opportunity to women candidates. There were at least 20 women achievers in their own fields in the MNM, according to him. A majority of the women, he said, were described as home makers in Tamil Nadu. When many of them donned the role of daughter, wife, mother, sister and friend, they deserved more in the public life. “If elected, we will give the governance to women and the youth. In their hands, it would be safe and responsible,” he added. Many people termed politics as gutter. “We in the MNM will change the nomenclature. It is just a matter of time. We will give a new meaning to politics in the future,” he said. Without naming the Dravidian parties, he asked the reasons for not appointing women as party district secretaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-will-contest-assembly-election-kamal/article33332731.ece
15 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Vehicular underpass at Karungalakudi soon||A long-pending demand of residents is to be fulfilled soon with the construction of a vehicular underpass at Karungalakudi junction on the Madurai-Tiruchi highway. In the absence of an underpass, many people have been either killed or injured at this intersection on the four-land highway. Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, who had made a poll promise of bringing an underpass at the junction, has successfully brought one. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has informed the MP that the underpass would soon be constructed at a cost of Rs. 19 crore. As per police data, 42 accidents have been reported at this spot in the last four years till November 2020, claiming 16 lives and injuring 37 persons. “Not a day passes without an accident at the spot and people do escape with minor injuries or just escape by a whisker,” said A. Kumar, 30, of Alangampatti. The National Highways Authority of India has fenced the service roads on both the side to prevent people from entering the carriageway. Still, people from both sides cross the road to reach hospital, schools, banks and shops. After NHAI laid a bypass road, many shops have come up on both sides of the road. “Even if they need not go to shops, people who need to board buses or get down from buses on Tiruchi-Madurai section have to cross the road,” he said. Though the police kept barricades on both sides of the junction across the carriage way, on many occasions, the speeding vehicles have hit even the barricades. “Since the road is straight for a long distance, drivers tend to drive at a higher speed,” he said. People who had then objected to construction of the flyover at the junction when the four-lane work was started 10 years back, now realise its importance as the speed of vehicles has increased drastically.  People from both sides cross the road to reach hospital, schools, banks and shops A.

They were found on the mud flat and wetland areas of the sanctuary. Breeding ground S. Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forest, Thanjavur, told The Hindu that the flock might have flown thousands of miles from Mongolia, Tibet and Central China. They usually breed there and migrate to India during the winter. The high-altitude flyers might stay until January or February and fly back to their native places by crossing the Himalayan ranges. He said it was fascinating to watch the birds in droves. The high-flying birds are capable of flying through the passes of the highest mountains at a height of above 12,000 feet. They are grey and white with two horseshoe-shaped brownish black bars on the back of their white head. They eat plants and grass. ‘Unique system’ According to a study, Mr. Ramasubramanian said, the geese can migrate more than 1,500 km in a single day. They have a unique system to absorb oxygen quickly. They can extract more oxygen than many other birds. The large-scale presence of the birds in the Bird and Wildlife Sanctuary at Point Calimere was a good indication of a conducive ecosystem at the sanctuary, the Conservator of Forest said.

After starting their voyage from a harbour in Oman eight days ago, the fishermen had travelled more than 2,700 km to reach Muttom harbour only to be arrested by the police. They were identified as L. Stephen David, 52, G. Joseph Edwin, 40, M. Francis, 58, S. Aldo, 28, S. Sahaya Thatheyus, 46, all from Kanniyakumari district, and Mohamed Rajib, 27, from Bangladesh. The Marine Police personnel said the fishermen, who were working in the mechanised boat of one Abdullah Kamish Ali of Jelan in Muscat for the past 14 months, were not reportedly paid their salary. When they took up the issue with the Indian Embassy in Oman no action was taken to ensure immediate disbursal of their salary arrears. On coming to know about the complaint forwarded to the Indian Embassy, their employer started torturing them, which forced them to flee the Gulf country in the boat. Their passports are with Kamish Ali. Since the fishermen had returned illegally along with a Bangladesh national, they were questioned by various agencies, including Q Branch and Intelligence Bureau, after which they were arrested and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/6-fishermen-reach-muttom-from-oman-in-boat-held/article33332881.ece

15 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Abandon plan to privatise Electricity Dept.: former MP||Former Member of Parliament M. Ramadass on Monday requested the Centre to abandon its plan to privatise the Electricity Department (ED) of the Union Territory. In a letter to the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) R.K. Singh, the former parliamentarian said the Centre should allow the public ED to continue. In case the Ministry wished to improve the power distribution system in the Union Territory, the Centre should direct the territorial administration to convert the Department into a board with autonomy and accountability, he suggested. “An independent regulatory commission could evaluate the board’s performance.” Since its inception 64 years ago, the Department had made remarkable strides in the distribution of electricity, he said. “Should we handover all that we have built in the last 64 years to a private player on a platter at throw away price? What is the rationale in privatising a profit making and robust enterprise?” the former MP asked. “The private player will not improve the existing facilities. The operator may, instead, try to exploit customers by hiking the tariff,” he added. “By maximising his profits and filling his coffer, he may proclaim to be more efficient, but at a heavy loss of public welfare. In a small place like Puducherry, one company can distribute electricity which means a monopoly situation and not a competitive market as claimed by the proponents of privatisation,” Mr. Ramadass said in his letter. Local govt.’s views Since electricity is a concurrent subject, the views of the local government should be heard. “Electricity is a public good like water, roads, to be used by the public. If so, are not the people of Puducherry entitled to an explanation on the virtues of privatisation of their Electricity Department? People are consulted even on the revision of tariff by the commission but not on denationalisation of their property,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/abandon-plan-to-privatise-electricity-dept-former-mp/article33333230.ece

15 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Recent rains leave roads in Puducherry battered||The condition of many roads in Puducherry town and suburban areas have taken a beating after the region recorded good rainfall in the monsoon season. Potholes on several stretches are making commute difficult, particularly for two-wheeler riders. “It is very difficult to ride during night as lighting is not proper because trees block street lamps. Only after hitting a pothole do we realise that the road has been damaged,” S. Coumar, a resident of Rainbow Nagar said. The worst affected stretches are Subash Chandra Bose Salai; Venkatasubba Reddiar Statue to Marappalam on Cuddalore road; Anna Statue to Indira Gandhi statue on Marimalai Adigal Salai; Raja Theatre Junction to Rajiv Gandhi Square; and Muthialpet Clock Tower to Sivaji Statue on Karuvadikuppam Road. Subash Chandra Bose Salai road was damaged even before the rains. According to an official in the Public Works Department, tenders for undertaking repair work were called for three times in the last six months but there were no takers. Estimates were prepared for Rs. 11 lakh but contractors refused to take up work, the official said.

However, the waterfalls – Main Falls, Five Falls, Old Courtallam Falls and Tiger Falls – will remain open for the visitors only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., a statement by Collector G.S. Sameeran said on Monday. As per the arrangement made by the district administration now, two teams of officials would be posted in each waterfall to regulate the number of men and women taking bath in the waterfalls at a time while ensuring physical distancing. The visitors, as they come to Courtallam, should wear masks and ensure at least 2-meter gap, besides sanitising their hands frequently. Those who hail from ‘containment zones’ should avoid coming to Courtallam. The ‘use and throw’ articles discarded by the visitors should be put in the trash kept across Courtallam by the town panchayat administration, the statement said. Moreover, the Collector has instructed the shops situated close to the waterfalls to sprinkle bleaching powder. The traders and the hospitality industry of Courtallam that would enjoy an excellent business between June and August every year during the season was hit hard this year as the lockdown was in place. Even though the ‘season 2020’ was not so impressive with the waterfalls rarely getting good flow of water induced by the southwest monsoon, the tourist destination lost its revenue completely due to the COVID-19 restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/courtallam-opens-for-tourists/article33332882.ece

Interacting with party functionaries, Mr. Haasan said that the number of women voters in Tamil Nadu was higher than men. “If this is to be taken as a yardstick, then women voters would decide who should emerge victorious in every constituency. Who would form the government..and so on,” he said. In an apparent reference to AIADMK leader O. Panneerselvam’s recent remarks that women and men should govern the State for two-and-a-half years each, he said that if this was [projected as] the ruling party’s stand, then here (in Theni), the father was an MLA and his son an MP. Claiming that the MNM would not simply preach, he said that the party would give more opportunity to women candidates. There were at least 20 women achievers in MNM, according to him. A majority of the women, he said, were described as homemakers in Tamil Nadu. When many of them donned the role of daughter, wife, mother, sister and friend, they deserved more in public life. “If elected, we will give the governance to women and the youth. In their hands, it would be safe and responsible,” he added. Many people termed politics as gutter. “We in the MNM will change the nomenclature. It is just a matter of time. We will give a new meaning to politics,” he said. Without naming the Dravidian parties, he asked why parties were not appointing women as party district secretaries. Dindigul Later in the evening, he addressed party functionaries in Dindigul. Pointing out that the Indian democracy was ailing due to maladministration and poor governance, Mr. Hassan said with people’s support, fresh blood can be injected and good governance delivered. The MNM had many doctors as members. “We will give the right medicine and cure the disease,” he said. He said that the Election Commission had not given the ‘torch light’ symbol to the MNM. But there was no question of going back or worrying about such issues, he said and added that if there was no torch light, we will have ‘kalangarai vilakkam’ (lighthouse). Appealing to the cadres to do door-to-door visit in their wards, Mr. Kamal Hassan said that the time had come for forces like the MNM to cleanse the nation.  If elected, we will give the governance to women and the youth - in safe and responsible hands   Kamal Hassan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mnm-to-field-more-women-candidates/article33332883.ece

While the illness was prevalent in her family, lack of awareness caused the death of her oldest brother. “When I fell sick often, my parents took me to a doctor who diagnosed me. My dad’s brother too had died of it,” Ms. Parameshwari said. Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterised by less oxygen-carrying protein (haemoglobin) and fewer red blood cells in the body than normal, causing slow growth, iron overload and heart problems. When Parameshwari completed class 9, she fell ill. “I had to drop out of school and take treatment, including blood transfusion once every fortnight. While sitting idle at home I began to watch a channel on YouTube- ‘Amy's Life’. Amy suffers from a chronic illness and documents her life despite it. Watching her, I decided to do the same,” she said. Going by the name ‘Paramu thals’, Ms.Parameshwari began to document her visit to the doctor and blood transfusions required for her treatment on YouTube since January 2019. “There is not enough awareness of my condition. How one is diagnosed with it and what treatment is available. I do not want to give advice but I want people to learn from my experiences and by watching me,” she said. While documenting her illness, Ms. Parameshwari had visited a newly opened supermarket in the city and vlogged it. “It was an instant hit! People watching the videos began to request reviews of other such shops, where to buy dresses, nightwear and sarees. It was then that I began making review videos,” she said. Ms. Parameshwari takes the help of her older sister and three younger siblings who act as cameramen to shoot her videos. “My family is very supportive and allow me to do what I love. I have begun earning some money from it, but I end up spending it to make more videos,” Paramu said. “My favourite part is when people recognise my parents on the street as Paramu’s mother and father, they get overjoyed.” Her channel now has 27,500 subscribers while some of her popular videos garner as many as 35,000 to 50,000 views. “There are not enough people making videos on shops, food and entertainment in Tiruchi. I would like to scale up my content and make videos from other States, even other countries, but I would like to take it one day at a time,” she said, smiling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vlogging-on-thalassemia-has-brought-her-a-huge-fan-following/article33332851.ece
15 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Gallery showcases Christmas spirit||Leader’s Choice art gallery recently held a virtual exhibition featuring the works of seven artists on a devotion-based theme. Titled ‘A Masterpiece for the Divine Master’, the online event introduced viewers to paintings in a variety of styles, with a brief explanation by their creators. Tiruchi-based artist and gallery curator Hemon Carduz toldThe Hinduthat the event was aimed at raising awareness of artists’ inspirations when he or she drew on a devotional theme. “Art has the power to heal. These pieces have been selected to inspire viewers to take a deeper look within themselves” he said. The seven artists who participated in the show were Alexander Zachariah, Francis M. Ravindran, Fr. Francis Xavier SDB., Margaret Thomas, S. Mark Rathinaraj, Philomena Edward and Fr. A.J.Thamburaj S.J. Divine themes Though the theme centred around the life of Jesus Christ, the artists chose to express themselves through diverse methods and iconography. Explaining his painting ‘There is Always a Cross to Bear’, Alexander Zacharaiah, creative director of the Chennai-based advertising agency Rubecon Communications, said, “A lot of my work is based on the narrative. I did this painting after my father’s funeral, and the scenes that I have portrayed are loosely based on a conversation I overhead in the churchyard, about prayer for the departed soul. I have tried to show that there is a crack running through our soul, and how we use our faith to heal it.” Academic and graphic artist Margaret Thomas said that “God is in the details”, when she revealed her inspiration behind her pen-and-ink drawing of dense foliage on canvas in her work titled ‘Finding My Soul’. “I took up this meditative piece during the lockdown, inspired by the humble reed, and a book by Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. The research made me more aware of the different kinds of textures and shapes in Nature,” she said. Among the other works that held the eye were Mark Rathinaraj’s reinterpretation of Leonardo Da Vinci’s iconic oil painting ‘The Last Supper’ as the line drawing ‘The Lord’s Supper’, and Fr. Francis Xavier’s ‘Holy Family’, which focused on an Indianised version of divinity, and Christ as a symbol of feminism. Francis M. Ravindran and Philomena Edward showed alternative views of the crucifixion, while Fr. A.J. Thamburaj used symbols from different faiths to show the oneness of humankind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gallery-showcases-works-of-artists/article33332855.ece
15 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Manachanallur bypass road to be ready for commissioning by month-end||The new bypass road around Manachanallur, which has been opened to traffic on a trial basis, is expected to be ready for commissioning by end of this month. The opening of the new stretch comes especially in the wake of the recent rain and traffic congestion in Manachanallur located on the outskirts of Tiruchi city. It will ease traffic congestion in the town famous for its rice mills. The bypass road on Tiruchi-Thuraiyur Road runs a length of about 2.64 km and was sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs. 25.15 crore. Sources in the Highways Department say a decision on the formal opening of the bypass will be taken by the government. “Another layer of bitumen has to be laid on the road. We will complete the work by the end of this month after which the road will be opened formally,” according to an official. The Highways Department has so far planted about 800 tree saplings of nearly 20 species along the new road. “We plan to plant about 1,000 plants in sync with the greenery around,” the official says. The bypass starts near Panguni Vaical (beyond Nochiyam) at Athani and joins Thuraiyur Road again beyond Manachanallur Taluk Office, averting the need for motorists to go via the narrow and congested roads in Manachanallur town. The green field road was laid after acquiring about seven hectares of land spread over Manachanallur, Uluthankudi and Poonampalayam revenue villages. The project was announced in 2012-13 budget session of Assembly. The construction of the by-pass road comes as a relief to commuters as it will reduce travel time between Tiruchi and Thuraiyur considerably. It will also avert frequent traffic snarls on Local Fund Road in Manchanallur. The narrow road has been bursting at its seams due to heavy traffic and encroachments. Second project The Highways Department will soon prepare a detailed project report for laying another bypass around the town, this one branching off from Samayapuram-Manachanallur Road. It awaits administrative sanction for preparing the DPR. Once the sanction is obtained, an agency will be commissioned to prepare the DPR for the second bypass for the town, which is planned from Vengankudi on Samayapuram-Manchanallur Road to Athani on Tiruchi-Thuraiyur Road, a distance of about 2.83 km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manachanallur-bypass-road-to-be-ready-for-commissioning-by-month-end/article33332876.ece

The protesters, led by P. Perumbadaiyar, State vice-president of AIKS, staged wait-in in which148 persons, including 14 women were detained. The protestors said the controversial Farm Acts which are supporting the corporate should be withdrawn completely. “The Acts had been passed by the Narendra Modi-led government in the Parliament without a debate for ensuring more profit to multi-billionaires while the farmers, the primary producers, are being decimated. To make things worse, the Palaniswami-led State Government is supporting the Acts for its survival,” they charged. Taking out a procession from their party office at Kokkirakulam, the Congress cadres, led by the party’s Tirunelveli city district president K. Sankarapandian, joined the AIKS protesters. Functionaries of CPI (M) too joined this agitation after staging a demonstration in front of Reliance Supermarket. Cadres of MDMK and members of various farmers’ associations also joined the agitation. Though the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the Thamizh Puligal had announced that the outfits would organise a rail roko in support of the protesting farmers, the agitation was converted into a demonstration as the police made it clear that any disruption in the rail traffic would lead to their detention and remand. In Thoothukudi, 164 protesters were arrested as the AIKS along with the cadres from other political parties and organisations staged a similar agitation in front of the Collectorate while 122 persons were held in Tenkasi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wait-in-stir-by-aiks-members/article33333270.ece

15 December 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Persons living with spinal cord injury seek specially designed vehicle||Persons living with spinal cord injury have appealed to the State Government to give them retrofitted scooter specially designed for those whose movement has been crippled by the spinal cord injury. A group of people with spinal cord injury, who came to the Collectorate on Monday to submit a petition, said the TVS Motors, after testing the retrofitted scooter on five different occasions in the presence of the persons living with spinal cord injury, finally designed a vehicle on January 3, 2019, which is suitable for the target group. Hence, the government should give this finally designed battery-operated vehicle to the beneficiaries as they now need somebody’s help to start the retrofitted scooter. Moreover, authorized service centers for the vehicles should be identified in adequate number in every district. The monthly assistance being given to the persons living with spinal cord injury should be increased to Rs. 5,000 and ensure 3% annual hike. Rehabilitation centers, hostels and entrepreneurship training for this group should be created in every district and treatment for the ailments being caused by the spinal cord injuries included in the Chief Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme, they said. Probe sought Seeking impartial probe into the recently conducted examination, in which more than 98% students failed, a group of teacher training students submitted petition to the Collector on Monday. The petitioners said results of the examinations that were conducted between September 21 and October 7 for the teacher training students showed that 98% of the candidates had failed in the examination. Even as COVID-19 lockdown was in force, the examination was organised continuously for 14 days without proper planning and without giving any time to prepare for the examination. “Though many of us had done the examination very well, 98% students have failed in the exams.” “Since we suspect that the evaluation of the answer scripts has been done in a callous fashion, the State Government should order for an impartial probe into this scam by a team comprising Judges and the academicians not coming under the control of SCERT to bring out the truth. Moreover, the examination should be conducted afresh or the government should order for evaluation of our answer scripts again,” the petitioners said. ‘Grant aid’  Physically challenged S. Marimuthu of Thimmarajapuram submitted a petition at the Collectorate seeking monthly assistance and artificial limb. After his son Veeramanikandan, the sole breadwinner of the family, died on August 16 last, the family is living with the free rice being given in the ration shop and also on rice being sold in ‘Amma Unavagam’. “Though I submitted twice the petition seeking monthly assistance, I am yet to get the monetary help. I pray to the Collector to order for monthly assistance and an artificial limb for me,” said Mr. Marimuthu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/persons-living-with-spinal-cord-injury-seek-specially-designed-vehicle/article33333267.ece

15 December 2020||Tiruvannamalai,TAMIL NADU||A palace in Arni is crying for attention||A winding lane from Arni Road through a forest leads to Poosimalai Kuppam, a village in Arni which houses a dilapidated British-style building — the Poosi Forest Palace. Located close to 35 km from Vellore, this structure, which is over 170 years old, is an attraction for many architects and heritage enthusiasts. However, the building is crying for attention and has now become a haven for anti-social elements. With a structure about to crumble, villagers and heritage enthusiasts want the government to maintain it. Mohan Hariharan, an architect and a native of Arni, has started a ‘Save Arni Palace’ campaign. “This palace was built after 1850 by the 10th Arni Jagir Srinivasa Rao Sahib. The architect was William Pogson, a Britisher who has constructed many famous buildings in the Madras Presidency including the Spencer’s showroom,” explained Mr. Hariharan. He said Pogson had termed this palace the shooting box as it is believed British friends of the Jagir used to stay here and hunt foxes and hogs. “There is a rumour that it is a French Castle that the then Jagir built for his French mistress. This is wrong,” he added. The palace has two bedrooms on the ground floor and two on the first floor with attached bathrooms. “This is probably one of the few palaces in the region with chimneys for a fireplace. Though it was not required in a place with a hot and humid climate, the Jagir was adamant about having British-style construction,” he says. Unique feature Mr. Hariharan said another unique feature of the palace is that the ceiling is a form of Madras Terrace, but made with steel joists and brick jelly — lime concrete. “It also has a structural steel pillar brought from Britain, which is also used for rain water disposal. Pogson seems to have incorporated South Indian style construction too, in the building as seen in certain parts of the palace.” To save the palace from complete ruin, Mr. Hariharan started the campaign a few years ago. “I grew up in this place and have come for excursions to the palace during my school days. There used to be stained glass windows, which earned the palace the name of ‘Kannadi Maligai’,” he explained. Mr. Hariharan has been bringing many heritage enthusiasts to this palace over the past many years. “There are two other buildings near the palace. One seems to be the kitchen and servant quarters and another circular structure, with many pots, seems to be for pigeons. They could have been used for hunting or for sending messages,” he said. Locals’ demand “The palace has become a hangout for anti-social elements. People drink here and create a ruckus. When we question them, they verbally abuse us,” said a resident of Poomalai Kuppam village. Krishnaveni Thangaraj, panchayat president, Poosimalaikuppam village, said that it would be helpful if the government restores it and converts it into a tourist attraction. “A lot of people come here. It is an ideal tourist spot as the palace is surrounded by a forest,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-palace-in-arni-is-crying-for-attention/article33332900.ece

15 December 2020||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Agitating protestors held outside Virudhunagar Collectorate||Members of various farmers organisations and cadres of different political parties were arrested when they tried to stage a sit-in protest outside Virudhunagar Collectorate on Monday. The protesters, under the banner of All India Kisan Sabha coordination committee, gathered outside the Collectorate to show their solidarity with the farmers protesting in Delhi seeking repeal of three farm laws, as the police had blocked their way into the premises. The protest was led by coordination committee president, Kaliraj. Tamil Nadu Farmers Association district secretary, V. Murugan, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam district president, N.A. Ramachandra Raja, were among the leaders of farmers who took part in the protest. Mr. Ramachandra Raja said, “the Centre had not included minimum support price in the new legislation which the farming community has been demanding for. Besides, contract farming that has been extended to other crops will badly affect the farmers as it has failed in case of cane growers. Crores of rupees that need to be paid to the farmers by the sugar factories have not been paid for years and Government intervention has not been effective. If this is the case, now every farmer will face losses.” Similarly removal of various crops from the list of essential commodities will only benefit the corporates, he said. K. Arjunan, S. Balasubramanian (CPI(M), P. Lingam, T. Ramasamy and Azhagirisamy (CPI) and R.M. Shanmugasundaram, Sippiparai A. Ravichandran, (MDMK)took part in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/agitating-protestors-held-outside-virudhunagar-collectorate/article33332898.ece

Ram Ganesh. However, at least 60 Amma mini clinics have been planned for the district and they would come up in phases within the next three months. “Every mini clinic will have a doctor, a nurse and a worker. These clinics will function from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and then from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. The doctor will be available six days a week. Since many hospitals are closed on Sundays, we are planning to keep the mini clinics open on Sundays and provide weekly off on Saturdays,” Dr. Ram Ganesh said. Basic laboratory tests for haemoglobin level, blood sugar, pregnancy test and albumin level in urine can be done here. Besides, blood pressure could be checked. The mini clinics would be in addition to the 11 Government Hospitals, 58 primary health centres and 245 health sub-centres functioning in the district. The Government Hospitals are located in areas with more than one lakh population, the PHCs are in places with a minimum of 30,000 population. Similarly, the health sub-centres functions in places where the population is above 5,000. “Mini clinics will cater to areas where the population is less than 5,000. People need not travel more than 2 km for getting healthcare. Besides, patients who need to get regular medicines can get them near their homes,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/virudhunagar-to-get-60-mini-clinics-in-three-months/article33332884.ece

In a tweet, AMMK general secretary T.T.V.Dhinakaran, expressed happiness over the ECI’s decision. Three years ago, Mr. Dhinakaran won in the byelection to Dr. R.K. Nagar Assembly constituency as an independent, using the ‘pressure cooker’ symbol. During the Lok Sabha election and the Assembly bypoll in April-May 2019, the Supreme Court, when approached by the Dhinakaran group, in March that year, refused to grant the symbol of ‘pressure cooker’ on the ground that the faction had no exclusive access to the symbol. However, the court directed the ECI to allot any one common or free symbol to the group’s candidates. The symbol then allotted was “gift box.” The AMMK polled 22.25 lakh votes in 38 Lok Sabha constituencies with a vote share of 5.25% and about 3.19 lakh votes with a vote share of 7.23% in 22 Assembly seats. In November last year, the Commission approved the registration of the AMMK. The ECI said the common symbols allotted to these parties shall be available for allotment as a free symbol to other candidates in the constituencies where the parties do not field candidates.

15 December 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Cong. leader’s remark on PM does the rounds on social media||A controversial statement made by Congress leader Raju Sait about Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely shared on social media in Belagavi on Sunday. Addressing a meeting of the SC/ST wing of the party, Mr. Sait, president of the city Congress unit, on Saturday had said that India was fighting two viruses, one COVID-19 and the other Mr. Modi. “We need to save ourselves from both,” he had said. “COVID-19 has killed a lot of people directly and the lockdown has impacted the poor greatly. Mr Modi is the virus that has crippled this country’s tolerance, multi-cultural ethos and has damaged the economy to unprecedented levels. We have to take steps to save ourselves from such viruses,” he said. Some of his supporters shared the quote with other messages like down with BJP, but some others opposed it and hurled abuses at Mr. Sait. At the meeting, Mr. Sait had asked workers to convince the people about choosing the Congress over the BJP. “The BJP is anti-poor, anti-farmer, anti-minority, and anti-SC/ST. It is working only to help large corporations. It is bending rules and violating sacred principles of governance to make it easy for these companies to make profits, without following labour laws. The Centre’s amendment of three laws and Karnataka’s amendment of the land revenue laws is only to help multinational companies and corporates. Farmers are protesting against these moves in New Delhi. All of us have to support them and express solidarity,” he said. The Congress on the other hand, was the party of the poor, backward, SC/ST, and minorities, Mr. Sait had said. ‘Highly corrupt’ On Sunday, Satish Jarkiholi, KPCC working president, criticised B.S. Yediyurappa’s administration as ‘highly corrupt’. At a workers meeting in Saundatti, he said that a recent survey had ranked the Yediyurappa government as number one in corruption. This is evident and obvious. There is no government office in the State where you will not find bribery, irregularities and lethargy, he said. He described the gram panchayat polls as an indicator to the 2023 Assembly and 2024 Parliament elections. There are differences in all parties. The Congress is no exception. However, all workers should work in unison during elections, he said. Mr. Jarkiholi described workers as horses who led the party to victory in difficult situations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-leaders-remark-on-pm-does-the-rounds-on-social-media/article33332935.ece
15 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC rider on Lingayat corporation decision||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday said that any further decision taken based on the November 23 notification of the State government to establish a Karnataka Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation (KVLDC) under the Companies Act, 2013, would be subject to the orders to be passed by the court. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by S. Basavaraj, a city-based advocate. The Bench ordered issue of notice only to the government for now, while pointing out that the KVLDC may not come into existence at present as elaborate procedures are required under the Companies Act to establish a corporation. “The establishment of the corporation is unconstitutional, apart from destroying the very foundation of the secular philosophy propounded by 12th century social reformist Basava,” it was contended in the petition. It stated that the government decision also isolated Veerashaiva-Lingayat community from the mainstream. “The petitioner believes that the inclusiveness Basava propounded, which has now metamorphosed into secularism as a basic feature of the Constitution of India, ought to be practised by the State in letter and spirit, but the impugned order destroys all such values,” the petitioner contended. The decision to establish the corporation “smacks of mala fides on the face of it” as the preamble of the November 23 notification states that Veerashaiva-Lingayats are a majority in the State of Karnataka. The petitioner alleged that the real intent was to “woo 17% of the voters”. As the government notification stated that Rs. 500 crore would be provided to the corporation, the petitioner, a taxpayer, contended that it was in violation of Article 27 of the Constitution, which states that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes if the the proceeds are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-rider-on-lingayat-corporation-decision/article33332666.ece
15 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mixed response to Church Street First initiative||People walking their dogs, couples enjoying al fresco dining, buskers performing, street vendors selling everything from peanuts to leather jackets… They have become regular sights on Church Street after vehicles were banned on weekends from November 7. The Church Street First project, which will continue till the end of February, has been implemented by the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT), Indian Institute of Science, and the U.K. technology innovation platform Catapult Network as part of the Clean Air Street Initiative. But, a little over a month later, the response to the initiative has been mixed. Guitarist Byra, who is part of the three-member band, Metanoya, which has been performing outside Rasta Café after the initiative began, said it has been a positive experience. “I have been performing on Church Street for some time now , but people used to look at me like, ‘What is this guy doing?’ But after this initiative, people are a lot more receptive.” However, Anirudh Nopany, co-founder of Brik Oven which has set up tables and chairs outside, says: “The idea is great but the orchestration and the timing of it is not. [This is] when gatherings should not be allowed or promoted. Also, during and post lockdown, there was a trend of people coming in their cars and eating in their own vehicles. We were seeing 15 to 20 cars every weekend. Obviously, that’s not possible now. We have seen a drop in our sales by about 20%.” He added that they are working towards seeing if they can get “something positive” out of this. “We’re planning to post about it on social media; we haven’t done that yet.” Krishna Gowda, owner of Bookworm which has set up a display of books on the street, echoes Mr. Nopany’s view. “The initiative is very good, but not the timing. Most of my regular customers have one question: is it safe to come there when there are crowds? Additionally, parking space has not been specified. Many of my customers also exchange books. They find it difficult to park somewhere else, and carry a heavy bag and walk to the store,” he said. He, however, added that a positive outcome is a rise in new customers. “People want to see what the initiative is all about so there have been many newcomers to Church Street,” he said. Vinay Sreenivasa, member, Bengaluru Jilla Beedhi Vyapari Sanghatanegala Okkuta, says, “We are saying invite more street vendors; let them come and sell their food and their wares. That will make it better and more inclusive.” Artists and art groups are invited to send in proposals to spoc@churchstreetfirst.com which will be considered for approval by DULT.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mixed-response-to-church-street-first-initiative/article33332656.ece
15 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||C.M. Ibrahim meets Deve Gowda||Speculation about the future political moves of senior Congress MLC C.M. Ibrahim continued on Monday morning as he met Janata Dal (S) supremo and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda. This came against the backdrop of his meeting with former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy, who invited the Congress legislator to join the regional outfit that Mr. Ibrahim was part of in the past. Mr. Ibrahim leader is learnt to have been offered the post of JD(S) State president by Mr. Kumaraswamy. “I met Mr. Gowda today as I was unable to meet him and wish him on his birthday,” Mr. Ibrahim told The Hindu . He also said that his discussions with Mr. Gowda took forward his earlier talks with Mr. Kumaraswamy, who was also present on Monday. When asked about his next move, the MLC said, “I will travel across the State from Wednesday. I will decide on the future based on the suggestions I receive during my tour. I cannot take any decision without consulting the people. I will travel two districts at a time and will be able to take a decision in about a month’s time.” Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar had held a meeting with Mr. Ibrahim lasting nearly two hours on Saturday to convince him not to leave the party. Party sources said that Mr. Ibrahim has been sulking after his request to be made Leader of the Opposition in Legislative Council was not met. He has been keeping a low profile in the party after his fallout with former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, with whom he used to have a good equation, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-ibrahim-meets-deve-gowda/article33332668.ece
15 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru’s COVID-19 story may have got better, but doctors advise caution||From being one of the least-affected major cities during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak to becoming one of the worst hit, and then seeing a substantial dip in the number of cases, Bengaluru’s journey so far in an unpredictable year has been a roller-coaster ride. When the pandemic outbreak became evident in March, the city reported 44 cases with a positivity rate of 3.76%. As cases multiplied, primarily after unlock measures began kicking in, by June, 4,904 were reported. The steady rise in cases continued in July, when the numbers blew up to 52,106 with a 24.15% positivity rate, and started breaching the one lakh mark by September. The huge numbers had sent the administration and medical fraternity into a tizzy, with hospital resources being stretched beyond means, staff complaining of being overworked, patients alleging being turned away from hospitals, and government departments scrambling to control the situation. Surprisingly, in October-November, when the festival season was ushered in expecting it to make matters worse, the number of positive cases began dipping. From 1,01,120 cases in October, the number of positive cases dropped to 31,856 in November. BBMP commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the initial explosion in case numbers began due to the opening up of the economy. “A lot of people started coming into the State. Migrant workers too started returning to work. One by one the economy opened, and mixing of populations, which was contained during the lockdown, started,” he said. The commissioner said it was the aggressive strategy targeting, tracing, isolating and the huge number of tests conducted that proved effective. “We went on testing. If someone was found positive, then they would be isolated and the chain broken. We have not lost that momentum. In the last 10 days, we have been conducting over 41,500 tests,” he said. With colleges reopening, adding to the list of sectors opening up before the assurance of a vaccine coming into the scene, Mr. Prasad said the BBMP was ready. R. Ravindra, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), credited increased testing and isolation of positive patients as the major contributing factors in bringing down the numbers. “People are still being tested and 35% of patients in my hospital are COVID-19 positive. So patients are coming in. Surveillance is still happening. The BBMP is on its toes. What is different now is that there is no panic,” he said. The tapering number of cases is encouraging non COVID-19 patients to seek help, he said. “Non COVID-19 work has definitely picked up, surgeries are back to normal. Earlier, patients were unwilling to come. Now, outpatients are coming in and it is 70% back to normal,” he added. However, Dr. Ravindra advised caution. “It appears that the natural cycle of the virus is of numbers going down before a second wave hits. This is what we have seen happening around the world. But now people are increasingly becoming complacent with wearing mask and social distancing. “Tourist movement has increased and everyone is in year end mode. I would advise caution,” he said.  We went on testing. If someone was found positive, then they would be isolated and the chain broken. We have not lost that momentum N. Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner, BBMP||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citys-covid-19-story-may-have-got-better-but-doctors-advise-caution/article33332647.ece
15 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No-confidence motion: one-day Council session likely to be stormy||The Legislative Council meeting on Tuesday is expected to be a stormy affair over the issue of no-confidence motion moved earlier by BJP members against Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty, even though the motion does not figure in the agenda for the day released on Monday night. The BJP, which wants to move the motion, shot off a letter to the Chairman on Monday requesting him to step aside for the Council to enable the House to take up the issue. The party legislators, in the letter, also took exception to the Chairman’s decision to reject the notice given for the motion on the grounds that it was not in order. “The right to decide on the notice rests with the Council and not the Chairman,” they said in the letter, asking the Chairman to allow the House to function under the Deputy Chairman. The Chairman, through the Council secretary, informed the members who moved the motion that since there were no specific allegations, the notice was not in order. In a separate letter to the secretary, the BJP members said it was the Council that had the right to decide. The Congress, meanwhile, is expected to raise the issue of the Council being reconvened without following the rules. “We are going to press for a point of order over the legality in convening the House again,” a senior Congress member said. The Council is being reconvened after being adjourned sine die last Thursday, following an appeal by BJP members to Governor Vajubhai R. Vala. The BJP had accused the Chairman of adjourning the session despite being informed that many crucial Bills, passed in the Assembly, had to be brought to the Council. The BJP’s petition also said that the Chairman did not enjoy majority support in the House and that it was “unacceptable” that he wanted to continue as Chairman tillthe next session. Mr. Shetty, in an interview with The Hindu earlier, had said that the no-confidence motion was a “closed chapter”. On Monday, Leader of the Opposition in the Council S.R. Patil too defended the Chairman and pointed out that BJP members had submitted a petition under Rule 165 of the Council to move a no-confidence motion, which had been rejected by the Chairman. However, BJP spokesman N. Ravikumar said that if the no-confidence motion was a closed chapter, it had to be announced in the Council. He also claimed the JD(S) would support the motion. JD(S) support is crucial for the BJP to unseat the Chairman as the latter lacks the numbers in the 75-member Council. While the JD(S) has not formally announced its move, multiple sources in the party said the 14 JD(S) members could vote in favour of the motion. The BJP and Congress have 31 and 28 members, respectively, excluding the Chairman. “The party leadership is yet to inform us about the stand to be taken on the motion. We will most likely support it,” a JD(S) legislator said. Another legislator said that Congress leaders had not even spoken to JD(S) leaders seeking support, so the point of backing the Congress did not arise. But Mr. Patil said, “We are hoping the JD (S) will support us. The leaderships of both parties will be speaking to each other on the matter.” The Congress has issued a whip to all its members to compulsorily attend the Council meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-confidence-motion-one-day-council-session-likely-to-be-stormy/article33332664.ece

15 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kadalekayi Parishe begins||The two-day Kadalekayi Parishe began on Monday, albeit without the customary groundnut fair. The parishe is celebrated on the last Monday of the Hindu month of Karthika. The parishe kicked off with the usual prayers at the Doddaganapati temple on Bull Temple Road and the kadalekayi abhisheka to Basavanna. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city, the historical groundnut fair, like many other festivals, is being celebrated in a low-key fashion. In a letter to the Muzrai Department, the executive officer of the Doddaganapati temple, Basavanagudi, proposed low-key celebrations, which includes the customary puja at the temple. The official has also suggested that permission should not be granted for setting up of stalls for sale of groundnuts outside the temple, as is the custom. Former Basavanagudi councillor B.S. Sathyanarayana said that the Muzrai Department, which usually auctions space outside the temple to vendors, did not do so this time around. With several devotees insisting on buying groundnuts after offering prayers at the temple, permission had been granted to less than 30 groundnut sellers, who were vending from pushcarts outside the temple, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kadalekayi-parishe-begins/article33332650.ece

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order while disposing of two PIL petitions filed in 2016 and 2018. The Bench observed that there was no “general prohibition” in the Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act of 1997 on the appointment of non-Hindus to posts under the offices of the Commissioner. The Act only stated that every officer or servant appointed to carry out the purposes of this Act shall be a person professing the Hindu religion. The Bench said that a person posted as data operator or one supervising the works of Group D employees cannot be said to be carrying out the purposes of the Act. While disposing of another PIL petition, which questioned the printing of the name of the then Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada district, A.B. Ibrahim, in an invitation to the car festival of Mahalingeshwara temple in Puttur, the Bench observed, “Government staff, irrespective of their religion, discharge their duties to celebrate festivals of different religions.

The protesters first staged a demonstration in support of the farmers’ demand for repeal of the laws, condemning the Prime Minister’s apathy towards the genuine demands of farmers. The farmers led by Shivanna Hubballi, Mahesh Pattar, Amrut Ijari, and others alleged that the Union government was least bothered about the plight of the farmers and was trying to hand over the farm sector on a platter to the corporate houses on the pretext of helping the farmers. Dharna staged Later, blocking the road and staging a dharna, the farmers said that although the farmers were protesting for the last 16 days in New Delhi, the Centre was still bent on helping the corporate houses. If the Union government was really concerned about farmers, it should first implement the recommendations of the Dr. Swaminathan committee on farm issues. If the government failed to respond to the demands, then the farmers would be forced to intensify the agitation, they said.  Meanwhile, at Dharwad APMC yard, floral tributes were paid to farmers who passed away during the Delhi protest. District president of Raitha Krishi Karmikara Sanghatane (RKS) Laxman Jadagannavar said the farmers’ agitation from November 26 had intensified now and so far, 15 farmers had lost their lives fighting for the cause. “However, the government is still adamant even as the farmers are agitating braving the cold weather of Delhi. The government, which should have been the voice of the farmers, is trying to suppress their voice by using force against them and is trying to paint a wrong picture of the protesters. But the farmers’ protest will continue till the withdrawal of the anti-farmer laws,” he said. District secretary of RKS Sharanu Gonawar, Hanumesh Huded, Siddappa Garagad, and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-block-nh-to-express-solidarity-with-delhi-protesters/article33332945.ece

15 December 2020||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. support sought to popularise horse riding||Mangaluru Horse Riding Academy, the only horse riding training institute in the region established in 2015, has urged the administration to bring horse riding training under the Smart City project and facilitate the establishment of an equestrian club in the city. Academy promoter Avinand Achchanahalli believes such a club with training and accommodation facilities could serve the interests of enthusiasts not only from Dakshina Kannada but also from neighbouring districts, including the entire coastal region. Except Mysuru and Bengaluru, there is no other well-equipped horse riding training academy in the State, he told The Hindu . He said that the academy has been training children in the six-16 age group from Dakshina Kannada. It has trained over 600 students so far. Meanwhile, there were inquiries from children from adjoining districts, including Udupi, to get training in riding. Mr. Achchanahalli said that the very concept of horse riding was new to Mangaluru and surrounding areas where it was unheard of till the academy was established in 2015. The academy was striving to make the sport/ activity that has multiple benefits and sports potential popular in the region. The academy has also plans to train differently-abled, tribal and third gender children in horse riding to help develop their self-confidence and also enable them to compete in paralympic events. There was a hitch, however, Mr. Achchanahalli said, while pointing out that the academy operates out of about 25 cents land obtained on lease from the Jogeshwar Mutt. An equestrian club needs spacious location, he said and added that one such location is available next to the skating rink adjacent to National Highway 66 at Kadri. He has submitted representations to the zilla panchayat and Horticulture Department that owns the land to grant three acres on a 49-year lease to the academy to develop a full-fledged academy/ equestrian club. Working on a not-to-profit basis to promote riding activity in the region, the academy was in need of government support to popularise horse riding, Mr. Achchanahalli said. He added that he would also approach Mangaluru Smart City Ltd., Mangaluru City Corporation and elected representatives from the region seeking support for the initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-support-sought-to-popularise-horse-riding/article33333146.ece

15 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Bus services resume in Mysuru as RTC strike ends||Bus services resumed in Mysuru after a gap of four days after the indefinite strike by the KSRTC and other road transport corporations in support of their demands was called off following talks with the government. However, the operations had been recommenced as per requirement and full-fledged services sticking to the daily schedules would resume from Tuesday onwards, the authorities said here. KSRTC officials said the services resumed since morning but the number of trips went up only in the afternoon as passengers started pouring in to the mofussil bus-stand on learning that the services had begun. The Sarige, Rajahamsa and Airavatha services to Bengaluru and other places resumed, bringing a sigh of relief to commuters who bore the brunt of the strike by the staff who demanded the government employee status among other demands. On Sunday evening, when the buses were preparing to resume services following reports of the calling off the strike, the employees, however, decided to continue with the strike till all their demands were met. The leaders later announced that the strike would continue, forcing the staff here to continue with it. Amidst the police security, services resumed on Monday morning in limited numbers. Firstly, the services to Bengaluru were resumed and subsequently to other places with the police escorting the vehicles till a distance to ensure they safely ferry the passengers after some incidents of stone throwing. However, since afternoon, the number of trips went up as more employees returned to their respective duties. However, buses are being operated based on the number of passengers, a KSRTC official told The Hindu.  Meanwhile, Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S T Somashekar visited the mofussil bus-stand on Monday to assess the situation and also spoke to the staff and the passengers. He told reporters that the staff should not have been carried away by the misinformation campaign as the government had taken measures in their favour. Despite the lockdown, the government paid salaries to the road transport corporation employees. Even today the corporations have not come out of the crisis and therefore the employees could have put forward their demands after the State was in position to handle such demands, he argued. He took a dig at farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar for allegedly instigating the transport corporation employees and said he should focus on issues concerning farmers instead of meddling in the affairs of sectors in which he has no knowledge. “He (Chandrashekar) should not bring politics here. He should not have instigated the striking staff that affected the passengers in the times of COVID-19. The staff should have understood his intentions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bus-services-resume-in-mysuru-as-rtc-strike-ends/article33333164.ece
15 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Panchalinga Darshana: Special rituals conducted at Talakad temples||The main event as part of Panchalinga Darshana Mahotsava was held at Talakad in the early hours of Monday amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The Mahotsava, which happens once in few years, is under way since December 10 and concludes on December 19. Amid the special rituals and Abhishekas at the five temples in and around Talakad that constitute the Panchalingas – Sri Vaidyanatheshwara, Sri Arkanatheshwara, Sri Pathaleshwara, Sri Maraleshwara, and Mudukuthore Sri Mallikarjunaswamy– began as early as 4.30 a.m. and went on till 7.30 a.m. The ten-day Panchalinga Darshana Mahotsava got off to a start on December 10 and the main event happened on the last Monday of the ‘Karthika’ season which is considered to be auspicious. Seven-year gap Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, who was present during the rituals at Talakad before the devotees were allowed to offer puja at the temples, said the last Panchalinga Darshana was held in 2013 and this year’s event has come after a gap of seven years. The ‘abhisheka’ to the Shivalingas at the five temples was done using 11 different ingredients including milk, ghee and honey amidst the chanting of hymns by the priests. All special rituals took place simultaneously across the five temples of Sri Vaidyanatheshwara, Sri Maraleshwara, Sri Pathaleshwara, Sri Arkanatheshwara, and Sri Mallikarajunaswamy at Mudukutore and the temples were opened for the devotees after the rituals and pujas were completed. The temples will be opened till 3 p.m. until the Mahotsava concludes following a decision taken by the government in view of the pandemic. Virtual event The rituals were telecast live so people could watch the proceedings live from home since the darshana had been restricted to the locals and also to tackle the pandemic situation. The live streaming of the rituals on https://www.youtube.com/c/Mysuruvartheilaake was held between 4.30 a.m. and 10 a.m. Safety measures The Mahotsava on Monday was restricted to 1,500 and 1,000 people on following days until December 19. The rituals were live streamed on social media platforms on the advice of the State COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, which recommended observing it in a simple manner by restricting the number of devotees and confining it to the locals, complying to the safety precautions and government guidelines to control the spread of COVID-19. Face masks had been made mandatory as was social distancing at the temples.  Crowd management The devotees are allowed in to the temple only after they showed their IDs proof. Check-posts had been set up along the roads leading to Talakad and other temples for crowd management. As a precaution, barricades had been put up along the Cauvery bank to prevent people from venturing into the waters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panchalinga-darshana-special-rituals-held-at-talakad-temples/article33332942.ece
15 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||JD(S) to cross swords with traditional foe Congress in GP polls in Old Mysore||Old Mysore region is once again set to emerge as a key political battlefield for traditional rivals Janata Dal (S) and Congress during the forthcoming gram panchayat elections. Even though gram panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, it is common knowledge that grassroots-level workers and supporters of parties throw their hats in the ring to further their political aspirations. The JD(S), which draws its strength from its support base concentrated in the Vokkaliga heartland of Old Mysore region, is wary of a possible dilution of the party’s identity at the grassroots level in the wake of its tie-up with the Congress to not only form a coalition government, but also share seats in the last Lok Sabha elections. Hence, the significance of the timing (eve of the gram panchayat elections) and the venue (Mysuru) chosen by former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy to unleash his harshest attack in recent times against the Congress is not lost on political observers. The JD(S) leader was repentant for aligning with the Congress to form a government after the 2018 polls while sounding nostalgic about the party’s alliance with the BJP during 2006-08. For decades, the Congress and the JD(S) had slugged it out against each other in election after election in most parts of Old Mysore, encompassing the districts of Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, and Hassan, among other areas. The local JD(S) leaders preferred to align with the BJP in many hung urban and rural local bodies. Making amends The JD(S) is so keen on retaining its political ground that the run-up to the gram panchayat elections has also seen former Minister and JD(S) MLA S.R. Mahesh calling on sulking party MLA G.T. Deve Gowda, who represents Chamundeshwari constituency, and seeking his participation in the poll campaign. Mr. Mahesh also expressed his readiness to apologise to Mr. Gowda if he had erred earlier. The Congress, which claimed to have won the most number of gram panchayat seats in the last elections in 2015, has also activated its poll machinery and is preparing for a ‘Gram Janadhikara’ convention for Chamundeshwari constituency that will be addressed by the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Mysuru on December 18. The ruling BJP, which has hitherto been an also-ran in most rural areas of Old Mysore, is holding Gram Swaraj conventions in various taluks in the hope of making inroads into the region in the coming polls by capitalising on its good performance in several parts of Old Mysore in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. According to political observers, gram panchayat elections are crucial for political parties and their leaders. “All the parties and leaders rely heavily on these gram panchayat members to mobilise voters during the elections to taluk aand zilla panchayats, the Assembly, and even the Lok Sabha,” said a leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-to-cross-swords-with-traditional-foe-congress-in-gp-polls-in-old-mysore/article33332663.ece
15 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Kodagu gets Rs. 46.82 cr. for relief work||A sum of Rs. 46.82 crore had been released to Kodagu for infrastructure improvement works in flood-affected areas. Many places across Kodagu were hit by floods and landslips in August. Roads, bridges and other public facilities were damaged. For emergency relief and repair work, Rs. 46.82 crore had been released as per the SDRF/NDRF norms, said former Speaker and MLA K.G. Bopaiah in Madikeri on Monday. The funds had been released as per the requirements and estimates of the repair works in the affected areas. Various works Roads, bridges, lakes, government buildings, water supply networks, electricity transmission lines, transformers and other basic amenities had suffered serious damage in the floods following heavy to very heavy rains. As the people in Kodagu continue to suffer, the government has released the funds for the works, bringing relief to the people who had been facing calamities since last three years. The Department of Panchayat Raj and Rural Development got a major chunk of the grant for the work. A sum of Rs. 29.26 crore was released to the department and about Rs. 13.08 crore had been granted to the Department of Energy since the floods had badly affected electricity transmission.  Even school buildings in Kodagu were damaged and the DPI had been released Rs. 2.06 crore for repairs. It said 117 school buildings were in need of repairs. Classrooms had collapsed in four villages. It had sent the list of school buildings damaged in rain and the estimate of repairs to the district administration. Team visit A Central team had visited one of the damaged schools at Korangala village when it was on a tour of Kodagu recently to assess the damage. The buildings built under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan have RCC roofs. Tiled roof buildings are common in Kodagu as it records heavy rains almost every year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kodagu-gets-rs-4682-cr-for-relief-work/article33333166.ece
15 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Illegal water lines beneath Irwin Road stump: VVWW||The Vani Vilas Water Works (VVWW), an arm of KUWSDB, which handles drinking water distribution across Mysuru city on behalf of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), recently came across four pipelines illegally laid for water supply on Irwin Road, which is undergoing widening. Disclosing this during a virtual interaction with the members of Mysuru Grahakara Parishat here recently, Mohammad Fauzulla Mustaffa, Assistant Executive Engineer, VVWW, who spoke on ‘Recent trends in water supply management in Mysuru’, said the issue had been taken seriously and being investigated since the pipelines do not exist in VVWW’s distribution network. “We are on the watch for illegal water connections and ensure tamper-proof meters are installed in each household,” he added. Developmental works The AEE explained works taken up at pumping stations, like Melapura, Hongalli, Belagola besides Kabini at Bidara Gudu pump house where a lot of development works are being carried out under the Amruth scheme. These include improvement of pump houses to higher capacities and setting up of water treatment plants. The works delayed due to the pandemic are expected to be completed by next year, facilitating supply across Mysuru for at least two hours daily, he said. MGP members sought the setting up of a vigilance squad for independently checking existence of any illegal connections and bringing light to all such cases for penalty. Under the distribution enhancement scheme in 2011, during the JNNURM project, the incomplete works are being taken up for early completion, he said. Water bills To a question from Aswathanarayana, Working President, MGP, and one of the participants, on how water bills are recovered from households on the outskirts, the AEE said water is supplied in bulk in GPs, unlike to households in Mysuru and the GPs are charged very less. Yet, the GPs owe nearly Rs. 35 crore dues to the MCC. Another member Raghavendra suggested that VVWW should consider giving a discount in water bills or property tax for the consumers paying promptly. K.V. Ramanath, another member, complained that monthly bills were not being received for the past two months and he was paying the bills based on the message he received on his phone. B.S. Shankara claimed that apartments and commercial complexes, who have not taken water connection and source their water from borewells, are not being charged for using the UGD network, resulting in loss of income (a nominal amount of Rs. 150 is being charged), to the corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/illegal-water-lines-beneath-irwin-road-stump-vvww/article33333167.ece

The Transport Minister, on Sunday, categorically said that it was impossible to consider them as government employees as there were other boards and corporations and they may also come up with similar demands. Among the major demands approved are: providing compensation of Rs. 30 lakh to families of employees who died of COVID-19, reducing probationary period of trainees to one year, administrative reforms to address complaints of employees on harassment, providing allowances to drivers and conductors withheld because of COVID-19. But not all employees were happy. “The very purpose of the strike was to demand that we be considered as government employees and that has been totally dismissed. There is also no clarity on how the sixth pay commission will get implemented. Earlier, once in four years, through agreements, pay revisions used to happen. I don’t know what we have gained from this strike. The major benefit is for families of employees who died of COVID-19 who will get compensation,” said an employee. Drivers also raised objections over repeated changes in the stand taken by leaders on demands. Some employees said calling off the strike was needed as non-availability caused hardship to the general public across the State. Mr. Chandrashekar also came under attack on Monday, with Revenue Minister R. Ashok calling him a “villain” who was “misleading employees”. Loss due to strike Owing to the strike, the cash-strapped RTCs suffered a loss of over Rs. 459 crore. KSRTC lost over Rs. 21 crore and BMTC Rs. 9 crore. Miscreants damaged windshields and side mirrors of 64 buses. “Compared to previous days, we managed to operate some buses before the announcement calling off the strike. After 5 p.m., bus services resumed across the city. KSRTC operated intra-State and inter-State services. Buses will be operated as scheduled from Tuesday onwards,” said a transport corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/transport-employees-call-off-strike/article33332658.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Vishwajith Shetty made these observations while declining to accept the BBMP’s claim that it had identified 106 illegal religious structures put up in the city and initiated action against them as per the law. The BBMP, the bench said, has not made serious efforts to identify such illegal structures as per the guideline issued by the Supreme Court in its September 29, 2009 directions. Also, the bench said that the affidavit filed by Additional Chief Secretary Rajneesh Goel does not disclose the steps taken by the State government to implement the apex court’s directions to act against illegal religious structures irrespective of religion. The bench made these observations in its order while hearing a PIL petition, suo motu initiated by the High Court to monitor implementation of the directions issued by the apex court in 2009.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-anyone-believe-that-only-106-illegal-religious-structures-existed-on-public-properties/article33332645.ece
15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Concern over India still importing tomato paste, pulp||Though India has made rapid strides in horticultural research, it still imports tomato paste and pulp for the processing sector. This has caused concern among scientists and policy makers who want the country to not only be self-reliant in its tomato processing requirements, but also reverse the trend by exporting raw material for processing on a big scale. The import of finished tomato products (paste, canned tomato and sauce) stood around 23,700 tonnes during 2019-20 with a total value of $20.64 million. Of this, the import of tomato paste is a major component as it accounts for 21,834.96 tonnes with a value of $19 million, according to trade statistics of Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, processed by Shruti Sasidharan, Consultant for Tomato News SAS, the trade publication of World Processing Tomato Council based in France. Here too, China has scored a point as nearly 72% of tomato paste imports are from it, followed by the U.S. (17%), Spain (6%), Italy (3%) and Chile (1%). The U.K., Switzerland, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Bhutan too accounted for a small quantum of imports. But the economic as well as scientific analysis of tomato processing sector clearly indicates lack of high-yielding tomato varieties that are suitable for processing. Strategy session Realising this, the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a strategy session with a theme of ‘Need for breeding tomatoes suitable for processing in India’ to provide an interface between scientists and processing sector. Addressing scientists and processors, NAAS president T. Mohapatra, who is also director-general of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, expressed concern over the failure to develop processing varieties. He gave a target of building super hybrid varieties suitable for tomato processing to scientists. A.T. Sadashiva, scientist who has been credited with developing high-yielding and disease-resistance tomato varieties, including the Arka Rakshak, pointed out that the processing sector needs tomato varieties that would be available at rates below Rs. 4 a kg to make it economically viable.  ‘Not profitable’ But this price level would not be profitable for farmers from the present varieties due to low yield and high cost of cultivation. This would mean that India has to increase its tomato productivity by four-fold from the present average of 10 tonnes per acre, he explained. This is possible if farmers get hybrid varieties that are suitable for processing and grow them by following proper practices. This would help farmers and also create more jobs in rural areas, he observed. An exporter of processed tomato products says that there is a demand for Indian varieties in foreign market as Indian varieties have distinct taste.   Fact sheet India imported 23,700 tonnes of tomato processed products in 2019-20  This was valued at $20.64 million  Of this, tomato paste accounted for 21,834.96 tonnes  72% of tomato paste imports are from China||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concern-over-india-still-importing-tomato-paste-pulp/article33332674.ece

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘Aim is 2,000 ESDM startups by 2022’||The Karnataka government aims to stimulate the growth of 2000 ESDM (Electronics System Design and Manufacturing) startups by 2022 and create 20 lakh jobs by 2025, said Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who is also the Minister for Electronics, IT/BT and Science & Technology. How to achieve target According to a release, participating in an event organised by the Indian Electronics Semiconductors Association (IESA) to present awards to ‘technovation’ winners of the ESDM sector on Monday, he expressed confidence that the target could be achieved through skill development, quality infrastructure, ecosystem support, encouragement to startups, and ease of doing business. Forward-looking policies The Indian Electronics System Design and Manufacturing industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the country and has the potential to play a huge role in the nation’s economic recovery. Accordingly, the Central government has instituted forward-looking policies to foster the growth of the Indian electronics ecosystem, the Deputy Chief Minister said. Contribution of State The State contributes 64% towards India’s ESDM exports and 10% to India’s electronic industrial output. Karnataka is India’s largest chip design hub.

Long queues were seen outside many polling booths even after completing the stipulated time of voting. Both the districts witnessed a rush of voters to the polling booths from the first hour of polling. However, the total polling percentage announced at 7.30 p.m. marginally fell compared with that of the previous elections in 2015. In Kannur, a total of 78.46% of the voters exercised their franchise, which was 80.91% in 2015. Kannur Corporation registered 71.16% voting as against 74.75% in 2015. Among the eight municipalities, Anthoor witnessed a huge turnout of voters. In the case of block panchayats, Payyanur saw the highest voting percentage compared with 11 other panchayats. A total 82.01 per cent of the electorate cast their votes, which was a fall in comparison with the 84.93 per cent polling in 2015. In Kannur The polling in the Kannur district remained mainly peaceful with no major incident of violence reported. However, the seizure of crude bombs near the polling booth at Mozhakkunnu panchayat created some tension. The bombs, which were kept in a bag and bucket, were seized by the police from Nelliyad and Vattampoyil. Earlier in the day, the police arrested an 18-year-old youth, who tried to cast a bogus vote at Kadannapally Panapuzha gram panchayat. In another incident, the presiding officer at the booth in Kannavayal Pathanakandu East LP School allowed a challenge vote after the complainant, Premadasan, a native of Muzhapilangad, alleged that his vote had been cast by someone else. Kasaragod district In Kasaragod, 77.14% of the voters exercised their franchise. Of the total 10,48,645 voters, 8,08,909 people registered their votes. The turnout was lesser than that in 2015, which saw 78.43 polling. Of three municipalities in the district, Nileswaram witnessed 80.38% polling. Kasaragod municipality registered the lowest polling percentage with 70.3%, which in 2015 was 70.41 per cent. Of the six block panchayats, Nileswaram recorded 82.07 per cent voting.

Speaking to the media after casting his vote at a polling booth at the Cherikal Junior Basic School in the Dharmadam grama panchayat, near here, on Monday, Mr. Vijayan said Kerala was the only State in the country which had given the entire treatment for COVID-19 free of cost. “Will such a government take money from the people for vaccination, which will actually cost less than the treatment,” the Chief Minister asked. He asserted that there was no breach of the code of conduct as alleged by the Opposition. ‘Historic win’ He said it will be a historic election and the Left Democratic Front will win seats even in areas which have not been its strongholds earlier. “We have never faced an election like this in Kerala. In this election, all the forces are confronting us together and even Central agencies are making arrangements for it,” he said. “They think their efforts will make us weak and upset. However, on the day of counting, it will be clear who is going to be weak and upset,” he said. The Chief Minister said not only the United Democratic Front would suffer a huge setback in this election, but the Indian Union Muslim League would be shattered as well. Earlier in the day, Minister E.P. Jayarajan, who reached the polling booth in the first hour of polling, said that the LDF would make a historic victory in the local body elections. He said the people of the country were praising the policies of the government.

Speaking to the media after casting vote at the Kodiyeri Basic UP School, he said this election would be a recognition of the government’s development and welfare activities. In the last local body elections, the LDF had upper hand in seven districts. This time, the people would favour the LDF across the State. The LDF government had saved the people of Kerala from starvation during the COVID-19 crisis. He said that people had realised that the allegations of gold smuggling were false and mere propaganda. “People want food, they want a home, they want health. Kerala has a government that has ensured all these” he said. Mr. Balakrishnan said the All India Congress Committee would not approve of the Congress in Kerala allying with Jamaat-e-Islami and SDPI.

15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Death of maid: police invoke trafficking charges||The incident in which a domestic help died after more than a week-long struggle, following a fall from a sixth-floor apartment near the Marine Drive here, has taken a more serious turn with the Central police probing the incident, invoking a more grievous charge of human trafficking. Three days after the incident, the police had registered a case invoking Sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code based on the woman’s husband’s complaint that she was locked up against her will in the apartment. “We have now invoked IPC Section 370 for human trafficking, which is a non-bailable offence. We will add more sections as our probe warrants,” said S. Vijayasankar, Station House Officer. The section entails imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. It entails greater imprisonment terms, including for life, for trafficking more than one person, minors and repeated offences. The victim from Tamil Nadu was found on the portico of the apartment on December 5, hours after she might have fallen while climbing down using two saris tied to the handrail of the balcony attached to the kitchen where she reportedly used to sleep at night. She succumbed to her injuries on Sunday. Women’s panel The Kerala State Women’s Commission on Monday intervened in the issue and its chairperson M.C. Josephine called for a reprobe, while terming the incident “mysterious”.       Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a mega adalat of the Commission here, she alleged that the employer of the deceased had been accused of cruel treatment of a 14-year-old girl who was engaged as maid in the past. The police at that time had invoked soft charges, she said. Ms. Josephine and Commission member Shiji Shivaji on Monday visited the apartment complex and collected evidence. Shortly after the police registered a case, the employer of the deceased, a lawyer, petitioned the District Police Chief (Kochi City) demanding an impartial probe and accused the woman of trying to flee after stealing money. He also accused the investigating officer of forcing the family of the maid to level allegations against him under the influence of a section of the media. Sonia George, State Secretary of Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), alleged that there was pressure on the family of the deceased not to press charges and to accept some compensation in return. She said the victim with a visually challenged husband hailed from a family that was so poor that even their 13-year-old son had to work to make both ends meet. A senior Labour Department official said that any intervention in the matter would be subjected to police investigation and that compensation, if any, would have to be paid by the employer. He said the department would help with the transportation of the body. ‘Bid to settle case’ The maid’s husband on Monday said that a person close to the employer had approached him with a request to settle the case. At a press conference, Srinivasan said his thumb impression was collected on a few papers. He said promise was made to foot hospital bills and to bear the expenses of taking the body back home. However, none of those promises were fulfilled. Mr. Srinivasan said he had asked his wife to return in view of the forecast of Cyclone Burevi. However, the flat owner did not allow her to return without returning the advance of Rs. 10,000 that he had allegedly paid. Following this, the amount was transferred to his account. Yet, his wife was not allowed to come back home, he said. He alleged that there were attempts to sabotage the case and demanded action against the employer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/death-of-maid-police-invoke-trafficking-charges/article33333041.ece
15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Aluva hospital to turn COVID care centre||With the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kalamassery, likely to scale down the number of COVID-19 patients who can be treated at the facility, and PVS Hospital at Kaloor possibly having to wrap up operations by the end of January, health officials in the district are scrambling to augment facilities at the District Hospital, Aluva, to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients. So far, the MCH, an exclusive COVID-19 treatment facility, has borne the brunt of care for seriously ill patients, while PVS Hospital has been treating category B and C patients for a little over three months. However, classes at the medical college are set to resume soon, and the hospital would have to be opened up to non-COVID patients. “A final order on beginning classes for students has not arrived yet. But classes are likely to resume by January. A few beds will still be set aside for COVID-19 patients,” said Dr. Peter Vazhayil, Superintendent, MCH. Meanwhile, another private hospital has expressed interest in acquiring PVS Hospital, which had remained defunct till the district administration took over and converted it into a COVID-19 care centre. “The sale has not been finalised yet, but the party that is likely to go through with the deal has said that we might have to vacate the premises by the end of January,” said a doctor associated with the functioning of the hospital. The hospital has the capacity to treat around 120 patients, but only 70 beds have been made functional. Equipment to be shifted “The equipment that was donated for our use at the hospital, like ventilators, will be shifted to the District Hospital at Aluva. The rest will remain at the facility after the take-over,” the doctor said. The government had initially invested around Rs. 45 lakh to get the hospital up and running, according to Dr. Junaid Rahman, former president, IMA, Kochi chapter. Since then, private organisations have been footing the daily expenses of the hospital through their CSR funds. When its functioning ceases, the staff at PVS Hospital was also likely to be shifted to the District Hospital at Aluva. The District Hospital would be a 100-bed COVID-19 facility with 50 ICU beds, according to Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Some treatments like that for haemophilia, and regular outpatient facilities, would continue at the hospital. The MCH would continue to retain around 20 beds for COVID-19 patients, and facilities at other government hospitals in the district, like the Muvattupuzha General Hospital and the government hospital at Palluruthy, have been equipped to treat COVID-19 patients, he said. The second-line treatment centre at Adlux, Angamaly, is also set to wrap up by the end of the month and return to use as a convention centre. In October, the facility had been equipped with oxygen concentrators, which would be shifted to the other COVID care centres, Dr. Numpeli said. Once the centre at Adlux stopped functioning, the CIAL convention centre, with the capacity to treat around 167 patients, would continue to accommodate patients requiring oxygen support, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/aluva-hospital-to-turn-covid-care-centre/article33333047.ece

The name Palarivattom used to be associated with jackals, not corrupt people. The earlier connection should be restored to the place. The court observed that the Palarivattom flyover, which reduced traffic congestion in Kochi to some extent, “is now unpopular because of the alleged corruption in its construction.” “The name Palarivattom evolved from the word ‘Pagalnarivattom,’ which means a place where jackals roam even in the daytime. Now, Keralites suspect that corrupt people, not jackals, wander in this area,” Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan observed while turning down the bail plea of former Public Works Minister Ebrahim Kunju. “Jackals are better than corrupt people,” the court added. VACB allegation The main allegation by the VACB against the former Minister was that he had received bribe from RDS Project Ltd., a contracting company that undertook the construction of the Palarivattom flyover. As per the Vigilance, an illegal sanction order was issued by T.O. Sooraj, fourth accused and the then Public Works Secretary, to start the construction of the flyover, violating the rules of business. The petitioner had illegally sanctioned an amount of Rs. 8,25,59,768 as mobilisation advance, fully knowing that no advance was allowed as per rules. The Vigilance argued that the Minister had no authority to sanction such an advance. The Vigilance suspected that the amount deposited in the account at Punjab National Bank, Market Road, Ernakulam branch, maintained by the Muslim Printing and Publishing Company Ltd., which publishes the Chandrika daily, the Indian Union Muslim League mouthpiece, was the bribe received by the petitioner. Mr. Kunju was a member and chairperson of the governing body of Chandrika , Kochi, as per the VACB.

15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||High Court sets aside order on quota in local body posts||A Division Bench of the High Court on Monday set aside a single judge’s verdict directing the State government to recast the reservation made for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) and women to the offices of presidents and chairpersons of local bodies in accordance with the principle of rotation. Allowing the appeals filed by the State Election Commission and the State government, the Bench observed that the single judge should not have interfered as the commission had already started the election process. The court added that in order to recast the reservation as directed by the single judge, the election process would have to be put on hold, which amounted to interfering with the process. Before election The court further observed that the exercise for reserving the posts should have been done by the State government and the commission sufficiently ahead of the election process so as to enable any aggrieved person to raise objections to it. Referring to the contention in the initial petition that the upper limit of 50% reservation as envisaged by the Constitution was violated, the court said it was a matter for adjudication after the election was over. Since the single judge had found that there was no illegality on the part of the commission to reserve the offices in accordance with the statutes, interfering with the electoral process was not right, especially when the recasting procedure was complicated, the Bench observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-sets-aside-order-on-quota-in-local-body-posts/article33333056.ece

15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Traffic plan being worked out for Palarivattom||With the reconstructed Palarivattom flyover scheduled for commissioning in June 2021, the police and agencies engaged in rebuilding the structure are mulling the possibility of erecting a removable barricade in the area beneath its central span, and directing traffic flow along Civil Line Road though underpass-line U-turns in order to avoid waiting at traffic signals to cross the junction. Without signal system The U-turns could be hewed out on either side, around 100 m away from the span, beneath the flyover. This would do away with the need for a full-fledged signal system at the busy junction, since vehicles would be able to flow continuously, just like the traffic regulation that is now in place as part of the flyover reconstruction. Alongside the progress of work, efforts would be made to identify a space beneath the structure that had got at least 5-m vertical clearance, said official sources. The average height of a bus is around 4 m. Lorries carrying containers and cars seldom operate along Civil Line Road. Height gauge A height gauge with vertical clearance of 5 m can be erected here. A height gauge has been erected on either side of the Vyttila flyover to prevent entry of vehicles taller than 5.50 m, to ensure the safety of the metro viaduct that is located 5.50 m above that structure. Even taking into account the rare possibility of a vehicle carrying load taller than 5 m taking a turn, regular U-turns which did not have height restriction were available on the northern and southern side of the Palarivattom flyover, they added. The modification will bring about a rectangular-shaped traffic square beneath the structure, around which vehicles will keep moving without any obstruction. Barricading A boom-barrier-like barricading at the centre of the flyover can be opened in case any extra-tall and extra-long vehicle has to pass through. Six lanes The advantage of the Palarivattom Bypass Junction is that there are three lanes on either side. It will enable smooth flow of vehicles negotiating the U-turn. More signboards Additional lights and signboards will have to be installed in the vicinity to ensure safety, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-plan-being-worked-out-for-palarivattom/article33333039.ece

Strong protest Determined not to let go of the incident as just another addition to the statistics of such tragedies, the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) is set to mount a strong protest, seeking a permanent solution to the exploitation of domestic workers constituted of migrant women from neighbouring States, especially Tamil Nadu. “Despite repeated demands, migrant workers remain outside the ambit of the Unorganised Workers Social Security Board.

She said that as per the labour code on occupational safety introduced by the Centre, it was the responsibility of the host State to ensure social security benefits for migrant workers and to transfer them to their home State when they moved back. Ms. George said 500-odd women, including girls as young as 12 years, from a small radius within Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu, were engaged as domestic workers in Kerala, especially in the northern districts. The migrant domestic workers are often physically abused and lead a perpetually insecure life, stripped of even basic amenities such as a decent place to sleep. “There are local agents, often relatives or neighbours, who recruit them. When approached to assess their condition, they and their families appear to be reluctant to interact with people like us for fear of these agents,” said Ms. George. Benoy Peter, executive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development, said women from socially and economically marginalised families faced additional vulnerability. “Domestic workers, especially those staying with employers, remain invisible and highly fragmented and are subjected to physical, verbal, and sexual abuse. In the case of really young ones, who may even be trafficked, their salary gets paid to their parents and it may not be sure whether the salary is being paid at all,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/focus-on-miserable-lives-of-domestic-workers/article33333045.ece
15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Quiz Swapna, Sarith in jail officials’ presence’||Officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) can interrogate Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith, the accused in a money laundering case, only in the presence of jail authorities. Though the agency wanted to question them without any jail officials being present in the interrogation room, the special court trying the case refused to heed to the request. While allowing the custodial interrogation of the accused for three days, Kauser Edappagath, Principal Sessions Judge, who is considering the case, ordered that the jail authorities could be present in the room, but at a distance. The jail officials should stand at a distance so that the interrogation would be inaudible to them. The investigation officer can question the accused till December 16, the court directed. New evidence The ED wanted to question the duo to confront them with the new evidence that reportedly emerged during the interrogation of M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The accused should be interrogated between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and allowed a break of half an hour after two hours of questioning. The superintendents or their subordinates of the jails in which the accused are housed should be present during the interrogation. The accused should not be subjected to any physical or mental torture during the investigation, the court ordered. Earlier, opposing the demand of the ED, counsels for the accused contended that the custodial interrogation of the accused was unnecessary as they were subjected to prolonged questioning.  If the court permits the interrogation, stringent conditions should be imposed and the accused should not be harassed in any manner, they submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/quiz-swapna-sarith-in-jail-officials-presence/article33333090.ece

Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, Traco Cable has been able to improve its performance at the Irumpanam, Pinarayi and Thiruvalla units of the company. Company sources said Traco’s major share for the conductor segment was with KSEB besides the Rajasthan and Punjab Electricity Boards. Traco supplies both cable and conductors for the low and high tension sections.

15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Minimum wages still not applicable, finds study||With multiple employers and the non-applicability of labour laws, domestic workers struggle to access minimum wages, social protection or workplace safety and health, all of which are integral to the decent working conditions of a domestic worker as stated in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Domestic Worker Convention, 2011, a recent study has found. Bonded labour The study, ‘Road Map for Developing a Policy Framework for the Inclusion of Internal Migrant Workers in India’, observed that live-in workers faced additional challenges of work conditions akin to forced or bonded labour, including a lack of privacy, defined working hours, and access to trade unions or other organisations working with domestic workers. The study was brought out by the ILO in collaboration with Aajeevika Bureau and the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development. By packaging accommodation as a “perk”, migrant workers living in their employer’s residences are put to highly exploitative circumstances where they are available to the employer for work round-the-clock. Deceptive or coercive recruitment without revealing the nature of work, wages or working conditions, excessive deductions purportedly for food and accommodation, forced migration on account of an often intergenerational debt bondage even amounting to human trafficking were other issues faced by migrants, including domestic workers. Sexual harassment Women migrant workers also face lack of safety and frequent sexual harassment by their co-workers and contractors. The study recommended effective implementation of the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act of 2013 for protecting the rights of women migrant workers in the informal sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/they-remain-outside-the-ambit-of-minimum-wages-finds-study/article33333042.ece
15 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Call for Kochi metro to slash rates||Votaries of public transport have demanded that Kochi Metro emulate other metro systems in India which are offering discount of up to 50% on travel fare, in order to overcome steep drop in footfall due to the pandemic situation. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) must offer discounts, especially to regular travellers, in order to attract more commuters to the system of mass rapid transport, it has been said. The average number of daily commuters now is less than 20,000, while the pre-COVID figure was approximately 65,000. The Hyderabad Metro came up with a Metro Suvarna offer, by challenging smart card holders to take a metro ride and offering up to 50% cashback on recharge of cards. It resulted in ridership increasing by 30% and the average number of daily commuters increase to 1.30 lakh. The special offer also included free trips to smart-card holders, said Ebenser Chullikat, who has been at the forefront of those demanding substantial fare reduction in order to regain a reasonable patronage for Kochi Metro. Less than a lakh of metro commuters have purchased smart cards. Around 75% commuters still opt for QR paper tickets, possibly because availing the card comes with many riders, he added. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Principal Advisor E. Sreedharan was among those who joined the bandwagon of stakeholders who have been suggesting discounts. It would not affect KMRL’s revenue, and would benefit people who were avoiding the metro by citing its fare structure, they reminded. KMRL sources said it was up to the State government to take a call on discounts or slashing fares. The Director Board’s approval too was crucial. The risk posed by the pandemic too had to be taken into account, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-grows-for-metro-to-slash-rates/article33333049.ece

The voter turnout in Kozhikode city was 70.39%, while the overall voting in the district was 79.10%. In 2015, the corporation recorded a turnout of 74.93%. From the beginning, the turnout was appallingly lean in the urban sector. It was less than 10% after two hours of polling when the overall polling recorded over 15%. It hovered around 30% while the turnout in seven municipalities and 70 grama panchayats crossed 40% at noon. This despite the NDA striving to gain dominance in 45 divisions over its perennial rivals, the UDF and LDF. Interestingly, the electoral dynamics was not to be seen on the polling day, though all the three fronts had marshalled all their resources during electioneering. Initially, party leaders were apprehensive that the polling percentage would be low in the city. But it picked up momentum in the afternoon and towards the fag end of the voting process. The Kannur Corporation, which went to polls in the last phase, along with Kozhikode, recorded 70.47%. Many believe that the urban voter, dominated by the middle class, has a growing sense of apathy towards voting. Compared to Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi, the voter turnout was better in Kozhikode. The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation recorded 59.96% voting in the first phase of elections held on December 8. The Kochi Corporation recorded 62.04% voting in the elections held on December 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/apathy-of-urban-voter-evident-in-kozhikode-city/article33333021.ece
15 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Physical distancing norms thrown to the wind||Physical distancing norms were thrown to the wind in a few rural polling stations where the police and the election authorities had a tough time managing the crowd. To disperse an irate group that defied the COVID-19 protocol near a booth at Theruvanparamba, the Nadapuram police had to fire tear gas shells many times. The infuriated group later locked horns with the police and damaged a patrol vehicle. Tension prevailed in the area, as UDF workers accused the police of misbehaving with them in the name of enforcing the physical distancing protocol. The protesters who thronged the area for nearly an hour alleged that a senior police officer from the Nadapuram station had used rude words against voters. A merchant from the area said policemen had triggered protest with their “immature approach and arguments”. The situation was brought under control after senior police officers and a Deputy Collector agreed to hold conciliatory talks, he added. Amid the clash, a group of LDF reached the scene, claiming that the police had acted promptly against the UDF workers who had defied the the COVID-19 protocol. It fuelled further clashes between LDF and UDF workers. Later, the booth was fortified by deploying additional police personnel. Only voters were allowed to enter the compound. Video cameras were also used to capture movements of suspected individuals. A senior officer from the Nadapuram police sub division said action would be initiated against those who were caught on camera violating the protocol||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/physical-distancing-norms-thrown-to-the-wind/article33333016.ece

In some polling booths, police personnel and Home Guards were seen advising voters to keep at least a metre distance to ward off the threat of infection. The presence of senior citizens, among them many women, was a notable feature of the election. The presumption that the elderly would not come out to vote fearing contraction of infection was laid to rest in many places.

Accompanied by close family members, they confidently walked in to exercise their franchise. Special arrangements were made in several booths to help senior citizens cast vote without waiting in queues. Special police officers assisted differently abled senior citizens to effortlessly reach polling stations. Besides, vehicles carrying voters were allowed in several polling station compounds.

Chandrasekharan, alleged that a group of Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers tried to prevent her interaction with media persons at Vaikkilassery on Monday. She complained that the CPI(M) workers made their entry to the scene with a claim that no one was having permission to interact with the media near the polling station. However, it was not followed in the case of other leaders, she said. “I don’t know why I alone was denied permission to speak about my voting experience. The presiding officer at the booth also was found acting strange without uttering a word against the self-assumed guardians of the booth,” Ms. Rema told The Hindu . According to her, it was the continuation of the attacks against her for maintaining a tough stance against the ‘corrupt CPI(M) leadership.’ The RMPI leader accused the Left Democratic Front government of crossing all limits with its ‘anti-people’ policies and by supporting those who were facing serious criminal charges. “The huge turnout of voters daring the COVID-19 situation itself was an example of the public protest against the ruling front. We are sure that the LDF will lose all their seats in four grama panchayats in and around Onchiyam,” she claimed. “Our party workers are being attacked every time during elections. It is this violence which actually prompted all parties to unite in their fight against the CPI(M). Even after the murder of T.P. Chandrasekharan, the CPI (M) has not stepped back from its politics of violence,” she alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rmpi-leaders-charge-against-cpim/article33333088.ece

To evoke the curiosity and thus create an awareness against the use of non-biodegradable materials,” Shailesh E.P., Junior Health Inspector of Kozhikode Corporation, explained. Braided coconut leaves and screwpine mats were used for banners and waste baskets in these booths. Messages regarding the COVID-19 protocol were displayed on coclocasia leaves. Drinking water was kept in earthen pots. In some places, the polling officers used paper pens for writing and areca leaf plates as trays in the polling booths. “We could have used a variety of other materials such as jute or terracotta which are also eco-fiendly. But they would not make the impact that this greenery makes and grab as much attention,” Mr. Shailesh said.

15 December 2020||Mukkom/Koduvally,KERALA||Peaceful in Koduvally||Debate over the United Democratic Front’s tie-up with the Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Welfare Party of India (WPI) in the local body polls may be heating up elsewhere in the State, but the situation in and around Chennamangallur, the latter’s stronghold in Mukkom Municipality, is relatively calm. Similarly, though the candidature of Karat Faisal could be a topic of discussion in other parts of Kerala, the feeling in Chundappuram Division of Koduvally Municipality, from where he is contesting as an Independent, betrays no such thing. A steady stream of voters was seen outside the tiny building hosting Dawa Centre Madrassa in West Chendamangallur (Division 21) where the UDF’s Ramla Gafoor, an activist of the Indian Union Muslim League, is pitted against Janakeeya Munnani’s Thasnim Nasar. The Munnani is a coalition of rebel Congress and IUML activists backed by the Left Democratic Front. Ms. Gafoor has the support of the WPI. Just across the road, in Pulparamba (Ward 20) the WPI’s Gafoor Master is contesting against the Munnani’s C.T. Thoufeeq. Mr. Gafoor is backed by the UDF. Similarly, in Mangalassery and Kanakkuparamba (Divisions 19 and 18), WPI candidates Fathima Kodappana and Sara Koodarathil are fighting the polls with UDF support. The WPI is backing an Independent candidate in Division 23 and a Congress candidate in Division 22. Among the voters are senior citizens, a majority among them women. On the poll prospects, Mohammed Naseem, a local resident, said, “This belt is a fortress of the Jamaat-e-Islami. We are sure of a victory. There could be debates about the situation here elsewhere, but there is no tension here.” The WPI or candidates backed by the party had won three seats in the 2015 elections. Cut to Koduvally Municipality, where close to a dozen Independents, the most notable among them Mr. Faisal, and rebel candidates are in the fray. A voter outside Raulathul Uloom Madrassa, Kilacharveed, in Chundappuram Division, claims that the UDF mechanism is in a mess in the municipality. “Nobody is listening to the leadership, and that is why there are many rebels and Independents here. A.P. Abdul Majeed, vice chairman of the outgoing council, is contesting as an Independent after his party set a three-term limit,” he added. Mr. Faisal himself was seen outside a polling booth, greeting voters. “ The controversy around gold smuggling will not have any impact here. I will get the votes of the UDF, LDF, and even BJP supporters. It will be a verdict against the lack of development here,” he claimed. Though Mr. Faisal, a member of the outgoing council, had the backing of the LDF initially, it was withdrawn in the wake of the controversy surrounding gold smuggling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poll-scene-calm-in-mukkom-koduvally/article33333012.ece

15 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State’s vaccination priorities come into question||As Kerala awaits the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, questions on how it should be prioritised are being raised. Right now, approximately one crore front-line health-care workers in the private and public sector have been projected as the priority group to be vaccinated in the country first, followed by those in higher age groups. The State has already initiated an exercise of line-listing its health-care workers. While no vaccine has yet been approved in the country for emergency use authorisation, there are many who feel that rather than blindly following the Centre’s directive, Kerala should have a clear assessment of the priority population for vaccination, especially since the State has a higher proportion of the elderly population than the rest of the country. Lower mortality Though health workers are considered to be at increased risk, incidents of loss of life amongst them have been fewer in Kerala than in other States. “When the vaccine is being reserved for specific populations, should we not administer it first to the group where we can have the highest mortality benefit? If so, people who are now dying in the State due to COVID-19 — those in higher age groups, those with chronic renal failure/diabetes — should be administered it,” says a medical professional. Doctors themselves have been discussing this in many professional foras, including the State Medical Board, whether the State should take a second look at its priority population, he says. Younger group Health-care workers are a relatively younger age group and most of whom would have already had prior but silent exposure to the virus. This would certainly place them lower in priority. That raises the moot question whether the State has really been able to ascertain the segment that has been the most vulnerable and these data can only be gleaned from an analysis of the actual COVID-19 death data. ‘Missing’ deaths Kerala’s ‘missing’ or ‘undercounted’ COVID-19 deaths and the consistent manner in which many COVID-19-continuum deaths are being kept out of the official list (because they had died after testing antigen negative) have since long been a matter of serious debate. Many public health experts are unhappy that the State has not done a death data reconciliation exercise because accurate death certification is vital for assessing the impact of COVID-19 in the State. Only such data can provide actual information on who died during the pandemic, their medical conditions and other essential characteristics. “Though the elderly are dying more, mortality has been observed across all age groups in the State during the pandemic. In the absence of proper data, we can only guess who among these have the maximum vulnerability,” they point out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-vaccination-priorities-come-into-question/article33333094.ece
15 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Stir in support of ryots continues||CPI (M) acting State secretary and Left Democratic Front (LDF) convener A. Vijayaraghavan has blamed the Centre of failing in its responsibilities by ignoring the farmers’ welfare. Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of attempting to create rifts among the agitating farmers in New Delhi, he said such efforts that were being made to scuttle the ongoing protests would turn futile. He was inaugurating the third day’s stir of the indefinite demonstration being observed by Samyuktha Karshaka Samithi (United Farmers Front) at the Martyrs’ Column, Palayam, in solidarity with the ongoing agitation in the national capital. Massive crisis Mr. Vijayaraghavan, who is also Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilali Union president, said the contentious farm laws that were passed by the Centre threatened to push the agrarian sector to a massive crisis, one that was unprecedented in independent India. “Such policies were akin to those that had been adopted by the British colonialists when they provided legal backing for feudal land tenure that paved the way for fiefdom and also destroyed the Indian agriculture sector to shape it in a manner that catered the needs of the British market. Such decisions had then led to an acute food shortage and pushed many to poverty,” he said. The CPI(M) leader accused the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of playing into the hands of corporate powers, even while neglecting the interests of farmers as well as the common man in the country. No steps were being made to rein in the increasing agricultural costs that has prompted several farmers to avail loans, he alleged. On the other hand, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in the State has bucked the trend by protecting its farmers. “During the last four-and-a-half years, the government has increased returns for farmers, even while achieving success through a 25% hike in cultivation. The State has also been procuring paddy at a rate that is 40% higher than the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Centre. In addition, we are also the first in the country to fix MSP for vegetables,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/centre-neglected-farmers-welfare-vijayaraghavan/article33333081.ece

15 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State’s travel industry pushes for opening of bars, spas||With tourist footfall set to rise during the Christmas, New Year season, the government has come under pressure to permit the reopening of bars and wellness spa services adhering to the COVID-19 protocol. The government can decide on opening of bars, wine parlours, and spa services in hotels only after considering inputs from excise, health, and police officials in view of a warning over a spurt in COVID-19 cases after the local body elections. Rejected earlier The government had turned down bar owners’ request to reopen bars and wine parlours two months ago. Though the request had the backing of the Excise Department, the government turned it down after the Health Department and the police expressed concern that it would lead to increased transmission of COVID-19. Now, citing the increase in footfall and good occupancy in high-end properties in Kovalam, Thekkady, Munnar and Wayanad, the travel sector is planning to push for reopening of bars and wellness spa services in at least hotels with valid licences. Thomas John Muthoot, Chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Kerala chapter, held discussions with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran in this regard. Mr. Muthoot said the Chief Minister had been informed about the increase in tourism inflow to the State. “Kerala is way ahead of other States in the tourism and hospitality sector. This is the time for the government to support the industry,” he said. Wellness services To recover from the negative economic impact of COVID-19, the CII Kerala Tourism Panel, led by Jose Dominic, has recommended that hotels with valid licences should be allowed to open up bars and serve alcohol. With people keen to travel to Kerala to wellness services, the CII panel pointed out that spa facilities would help ease the financial crisis faced by the hotels. There are 265 liquor outlets under the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), 36 outlets under Consumerfed, 576 bar hotels, and 291 beer parlours in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-travel-industry-pushes-for-opening-of-bars-spas/article33333062.ece

The Congress leader narrated on his Facebook page how he and his family love their pet dog Scooby even after coming to know that it is visually impaired and said animals also own this universe. He also shared some pictures of himself with the pet dog. Social media users said the post was a touching one, with a user writing: “Wow..that’s a touching story.” Mr. Chennithala said he was upset after hearing the news about a pet dog that was tied to a car and dragged along a road by its owner in Kochi, who was arrested later after the incident sparked a controversy. Saying that it was his younger son Remit had brought Scooby to their house two years ago, he said it had become part of their family soon. It was only later that the animal was shown to a veterinary doctor, who confirmed that the dog was visually impaired. Though the family was first pained to know that the dog had no vision, they later began to love it more intensely, he said. The Congress leader said though it is visually challenged, the dog has a great sense of hearing and smell, with which it overcomes the shortcomings. “Dog is an animal that loves its owner more than its body... don’t harm these animals which love you double if you give them love.

According to the task force officials, acting on information that several batches of red sanders operatives, mostly woodcutters, from Tamil Nadu had entered the Seshachalam hills a week ago, combing parties were pressed into action. Around 4.30 am (Monday), a large group of smuggling operatives was sighted coming towards the road point from the forest on western side of Tirumala, carrying the logs.

15 December 2020||KOLLERU (WEST GODAVARI DT.),ANDHRA PRADESH||Mystery illness raises concerns over Kolleru lake pollution||The outbreak of a mysterious illness in Eluru and the neighbouring villages in West Godavari district is a wake-up call on the increasing pollution levels in the Kolleru lake and other water bodies in Andhra Pradesh and it’s high time the State and Central governments took steps to prevent air and water pollution to avoid health hazards, say environmentalists. More than 600 people fell sick due to the undiagnosed illness in the last few days. Experts from the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, found the presence of herbicides in the vegetable samples collected from the affected areas. On the other hand, the scientists of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS-Mangalagiri and New Delhi), who tested the blood samples of some patients, confirmed lead and nickel in the samples. “We are worried over the alarming situation in the areas in and around the Kolleru lake, the largest fresh water lake in the country. The government should respond to the health situation immediately and take measures to protect Kolleru and other water bodies in the State,” say the Kolleru Parirakshana Samithi members. “The Kolleru Lake, spread over 2,50,250 acres (up to tenth contour, 90,100 hectares), is now facing a threat from pollution due to release of effluents into the rivers and canals flowing into the lake,” says 92-year-old M.V. Suryanarayana Raju, a samithi member. The waste, including chemicals, being released into the tanks, irrigation canals and streams in and around Vijayawada, Gudivada, Eluru, Mudinepalli, Kaikalur and other areas is posing a health threat to the people living in the surrounding areas and the aquatic and animal life of Kolleru, he says. “There are about 46 island (bed) villages and 76 belt villages in Kolleru with a population of more than 3 lakh. About 200 species of birds brood and breed in the lake and the Atapaka Bird Sanctuary in it,” explains Mr. Raju.  Unscientific methods  A professor in S.R.K.R. Engineering College, Bhimavaram, P.A. Ramakrishna Raju, who did mapping of the Kolleru Lake and its surrounding villages and prepared a report on the happenings in Krishna-Delta area, said the government should take steps for taking up traditional methods by following scientific ways to prevent pollutants from agriculture fields and aqua ponds. “The government should take up a drive to check water quality in the water bodies of the area as people in many villages here have been suffering from various skin and other ailments,” says a private doctor preferring anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mystery-illness-raises-concerns-over-kolleru-lake-pollution/article33333207.ece

Leading a demonstration by journalists in front of the Collectorate here on Monday, he said they would use their good offices with the management of dailies in the State and ensure boycotting of advertisements issued by the State Information and Publicity department to publicise government programmes, and step up stir against alleged denial of scribes rights to accreditation cards. It was unfortunate that the State government was mulling reducing the number of accreditation to scribes of each journal, he said, adding that the journalists were struggling to discharge their duties much more during COVID-19 times without accreditation cards for long. He said 53 journalists had succumbed to coronavirus in the State. The Rs. 5 lakh ex gratia announced by Chief Minister Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy after protracted stir by the scribes to treat them also as COVID-19 frontline warriors, remained only on paper with the I&PR department delaying settlement of claims of bereaved family members, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/scribes-body-to-move-pci-against-state-govt/article33333179.ece

15 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Capital will continue in Amaravati: Somu Veerraju||Bharatiya Janata Party State unit president Somu Veerraju has asserted that the capital of Andhra Pradesh will continue in Amaravati and there need not be a second thought about his party’s stand against the “three capitals”. The capital will be built in Amaravati in the next five years at a cost of Rs. 5,000 crore, he stated, while observing that the Central government projects in the region did not stop in spite of the State’s “ill-conceived” move to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam. He vowed to fight on behalf of the farmers who parted with their lands under the pooling scheme. Addressing farmers at Thullur in Guntur district, who are protesting against separate capitals proposed for Executive, Legislative and Judicial functions, on Monday, Mr. Veerraju demanded that the government give title deeds to farmers who gave 64,000 acres for the construction of Amaravati and develop another 9,000 acres in its possession. He pointed out that the BJP had its State party office in Vijayawada, seeking to buttress his argument that the capital would not be shifted out of the erstwhile VGTM region. Also, he recalled that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had initially endorsed the idea of developing Amaravati as the capital and took a U-turn for reasons which he should explain. Mr. Veerraju said those insisting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should intervene in the matter of capital shift, had to tell in which issue did Mr. Modi keep quiet. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh State president A. Rambabu, vice-president Chandrasekhar Reddy and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/capital-will-continue-in-amaravati-somu-veerraju/article33333199.ece

15 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC dismisses State’s plea to recall earlier order||A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Justices Rakesh Kumar and J. Uma Devi, on Monday dismissed the Interim Application (IA) filed by the State government for recalling an earlier order in which the court wished to proceed with the question on whether there was a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the State. Making his submission, Advocate-General S. Sriram said he would file an SLP in the Supreme Court as the High Court refused to accommodate his views on the matter, to which the judge replied that he was at liberty to do so. During the course of the hearing on a batch of writ petitions (WPs), which initially revolved around the alleged unlawful arrest of former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in Visakhapatnam in February 2020 just before he embarked on his Praja Chaitanya Yatra against the YSRCP government, the special senior counsel for Home Department, S.S. Prasad, raised an objection saying that there was no necessity for them to be placed before the court, having regard to the framework of the WP filed by a former TDP MLA and because there had been no amendment to its cause. Mr. Sriram’s plea at this juncture to be given an opportunity to place the facts before the court, and a request by him to record the same, was turned down by Mr. Justice Rakesh Kumar, who observed that it was a part of the State’s efforts to delay further proceedings. When the Advocate-General sought to make a submission that his response to a query raised by the court itself was not being heard, Mr. Justice Rakesh Kumar said such a conduct was not expected of him. While insisting that he had the right to be heard, Mr. Sriram replied that he would prefer a SLP in the Supreme Court, and that he was loath to join a debate on his conduct and that of the judge. He asked for two weeks time to file a counter as the court chose to lay down the parameters on which it desired to proceed with the question of breakdown of constitutional machinery, but was directed to revert with his views on December 16 while exercising his option to approach the apex court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-dismisses-aps-plea-to-recall-earlier-order/article33332516.ece
15 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. moves to promote energy efficiency||The committee of financial institutions empanelled by the AP State Energy Conservation Mission (AP - SECM) would enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) of the Ministry of Power for facilitating the financing of Energy Efficiency (EE) projects under the Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE) scheme, Energy Secretary N. Srikant said at a rally organised here on Monday as part of the National Energy Conservation Week. Mr. Srikant said the government was striving to promote EE measures in all energy-intensive sectors, particularly in industries, buildings and agriculture. Accordingly, steps were being taken to implement PRGFEE for extending financial support to the EE projects. For this purpose, the AP - SECM had constituted a committee of eight banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, PNB, YES Bank, IOB, Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Union Bank) and three Non-Banking Financial Companies (NABARD, PFC and IIFL) for facilitating funding of the EE projects under PRGFEE. Partial risk coverage Mr. Srikant said the BEE had institutionalised the PRGFEE, under which banks and NBFCs would be provided partial coverage of risk involved in extending loans to the projects. The AP - SECM would invite tenders for selecting an agency for supplying Internet of Things- enabled power monitoring devices to the MSMEs. The devices help in promoting EE in the industries by churning out real-time information on electricity voltage fluctuations. With this data, the MSMEs would be able to take immediate steps for saving energy. The government is spending Rs. 42,000 crore for purchasing power from various sources, Mr. Srikant said, adding that there was scope to save approximately Rs. 10,000 crore by implementing the EE measures. Krishna district Collector A. Md. Imtiaz said the district administration attached high priority to EE and energy conservation activities. AP CPDCL CMD J.

15 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Traffic police focus on parking travails||The traffic police have launched a special drive to root out the problem of unauthorised parking at various areas across the city, particularly in busy market areas. Police are visiting various commercial establishments across the city and are insisting that the managements come up with cellar parking facilities for their customers without further delay. According to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ch. Adinarayana, the police embarked on the special drive a few days ago and will continue it for the next few weeks. Main aim “Our aim is to ensure that customers park their vehicles only in the cellars of the residential/commercial establishments and not on the roads, which lead to traffic congestions,” he said. “All the managements are being informed about clearing their cellars to facilitate parking for their customers. Many have cellar parking but are not using them properly. The managements are extending their cooperation,” he said. “About 30% of the cellars have been cleared in various areas. The drive will be conducted under all the police station limits. We are taking up this drive area by area on a daily basis. The III Town police have recently conducted a drive from Siripuram to Vemana Mandir on one day and on the next day, the drive was organised from Tycoon Restaurant junction to Dronamraju Circle,” he said. Long-pending issue Due to lack of cellar parking in some commercial showrooms and usage of cellar parking for other purposes in other areas, motorists are forced to park their vehicles outside shops or establishments. In some areas, three-fourth of the roads are being occupied as people park their four-wheelers on roads due to lack of parking facility. According to the police, Dabagardens, Gopalapatnam, Pendurthi, Dwaraka Nagar, Jagadamba Junction, Siripuram, MVP Colony, Gajuwaka and Akkayyapalem have become traffic nightmares for motorists and pedestrians alike. Police opine that a number of roads were laid decades ago and with the increase in vehicles, population and establishments, parking problems have risen manifold. In some areas like Dabagardens and Gopalapatnam, traffic congestion is severe mainly due to unauthorised parking. Fines Mr. Adinarayana said that after three weeks of special drive, the police would start imposing fines against the violators. Not just the managements of the commercial establishments, fines will be slapped on motorists parking on ‘no-parking’ stretches instead of cellars or parking places, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/traffic-police-focus-on-parking-travails/article33333297.ece

15 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Maoists kill tribal after branding him as informer in Visakha Agency||Within a week after concluding the PLGA week, the members of the banned CPI (Maoist) have escalated violence by allegedly killing a tribal from Vakapalli village in G. Madugula mandal in Visakha agency, after branding him as a police informer. The incident reportedly happened just before midnight on Sunday. The deceased has been identified as Gemmili Krishna Rao. It is learnt that around 30 Maoist cadres picked up the victim from his home and hacked him to death at a place close to the village. The Maoists left a letter accusing him of being a police informer and forcing tribal youth to take part in the ‘Jana Maitri’ programme and the volleyball tournaments being conducted by the police. He had given shelter to a police informer who had allegedly aided the police in the Ramaguda exchange of fire (over 30 Maoists were killed in 2016). He was threatening the witnesses and the victims of the Vakapalli gangrape case to silence them, the letter charged. As per the letter, Krishna Rao was killed by the members of PLGA from the Pedabayalu and Korukonda Area Committee, for his anti-party activities, after holding a ‘praja court’ hearing. He was warned on several occasions but he did not heed them, the letter said. Police refute claims However, the police claimed that he was an innocent tribal and had nothing to do with the police activities and that as per the villagers no ‘praja court’ was held. Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao said, “Vakapalli was once a Maoist stronghold but ever since the police had made inroads, the former were losing their ground as the tribals were joining the mainstream. To counter the situation and to create fear among the tribals, they hacked an innocent tribal in front of his family and friends. The deceased, aged around 32, is survived by wife and three children.” According to OSD (Narsipatnam) Satish Kumar, the deceased was once a militia member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/maoists-kill-tribal-after-branding-him-as-informer/article33332517.ece

Releasing a video from his home town Narsipatnam on Monday, Mr. Patrudu alleged that the YSRCP was afraid of conducting the elections fearing rout. When elections were conducted in Telangana and in the conflict-ridden Jammu and Kashmir, the YSRCP government was opposing the exercise citing the COVID-19 pandemic. “This clearly indicates that it is afraid of an imminent defeat,” the TDP leader said. Referring to the proposal to increase property tax based on the value of the property, he said it would seriously impact the people, especially the poor and the middle class, as the tax rate would go up exorbitantly. The government should drop the proposal immediately, he said. On TIDCO housing, he said the houses were constructed with the Central government funds, and that the State government had a very small role in it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-opposing-local-polls-fearing-rout/article33333195.ece

15 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Aground ship may turn into a tourism venture||The fate of the aground Bangladeshi ship MV Maa, still hangs in balance, a month after the owners called off the refloating operation and issued a letter of ‘Abandonment’ to the Protection and Indemnity Club, United Kingdom. While sources say that a Visakhapatnam-based private party had taken over the ship, the Visakhapatnam Port Trust has asked the firm not to take any decision, as the A.P. government has evinced interest in converting it into a tourist venture. Speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, a senior official from the private firm said that the ship owners and the insurance companies have handed over the ship after a deal was settled, but further work has been kept pending, as the Department of Tourism, A.P., is surveying the possibilities of converting the ship into a tourism spot. Alternatives “We had the intention of refloating it or scrapping it. While refloating may be a costly proposition, scrapping it is viable, but certain clearances are needed, including from DG Shipping and MoEF. But now since the A.P. government is contemplating its moves, we have kept the matter on hold,” he said. It is learnt that officers from the Tourism Department had visited the ship on three or four occasions to asses the possibilities. The 80-metre and 3000-tonne ship with about 15-member crew on board ran aground near Tenneti Park on October 13 due to bad weather. MNC Resolve Marine was appointed by the owners to tow it out, but due to some last minute issues, the owners decided to abandon it. Visakhapatnam already has a Naval submarine museum (INS Kursura) and a TU142 Naval aircraft museum, on Beach Road. The ship has already become a tourist attraction, with over 1,000 people thronging the spot on weekends to have a closer look at it and click pictures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aground-ship-may-turn-into-a-tourism-venture/article33333205.ece

15 December 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Finally, children get decent park in Pradeep Nagar||Children of more than eight colonies of the town are happy with a park coming up in Pradeep Nagar. Earlier, they used to play on busy roads in the absence of a park, causing concern among the parents. Though many sites were reserved for community needs in newly developed Pradeep Nagar, land grabbers reportedly occupied them with the alleged support of influential persons. In this background, Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation encouraged local residents to construct the parks with their own funds in municipal sites. Former TDP councillor and philanthropist Meka Kasi Visweswardu, who came forward to take up the responsibility, spent nearly Rs. 5 lakh for the development of the park, in which a library had also been constructed. Swing set, slides, merry-go-round, sea-saw, climbers and others play equipment have been installed for children. “I have been striving hard for the park for the last two decades. Finally, the dream has come true with the allocation of 600 square yards of land of Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation. Play and knowledge both are important for children. That is why, I constructed a library also on the premises. We are planning to start skill development programme for women in the same premises,” said Mr. Visweswardu, who constructed the park in memory of his parents the late Meka Venkatanarayana and Satyavati. Vizianagaram Rotary Club Central presented two cement benches and 20 chairs for the library. Pradeep Nagar Welfare Association secretary D. Krishna Patnaik said that nearly 35 senior citizens had been walking regularly in the track developed within the park. “In the absence of community hall, it was difficult or us to meetg one another to discuss about the development of colonies. Now the park is a boon for people of many colonies, including Thotapalem, YSR Nagar, Sivaji Nagar and others,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/finally-children-get-decent-park-in-pradeep-nagar/article33332594.ece

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border demarcation stops abruptly||The 53-day exercise to demarcate the Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border in the Ballari Reserve Forest stopped abruptly three days ago after the Survey of India, Ballari, and Anantapur, respective State Survey officials, and Revenue Department officers worked relentlessly since October 15.  SC order The Supreme Court asked the Survey of India in 2018 to arbitrate between the two States and mark about 70 points on the inter-State border over a length of 15 km in Siddapura, Malapanagudi, and Tumti in Karnataka, and three villages in D. Hirehal Mandal of Anantapur district. Ballari Deputy Commissioner S.S. Nakul told The Hindu on Monday that the exercise was stopped as there was no official map or sketch demarcating the border points agreed upon by the officials of both the States. “I have written to the Survey of India to furnish the maps based on which the current exercise was being done. Our survey team officers were asked to sign on a document that gives the current points of pitching border survey stones, but in the absence of any authenticated document, we refused to sign,” Mr. Nakul said. “The reply is awaited,” he said, when asked about why such a doubt arose at this point after the exercise was being jointly done for 53 days. The entire border dispute arises only in the iron-ore rich portion of the border areas, and there is complete agreement in the non-mining areas. The Obulapuram Mining Company had allegedly blasted some reference points, such as the Thimmappana Gudda Trijunction, marked by the British during a survey then, but the Anthara Gangamma Konda Trijunction reference point was available. Meanwhile, The Hindu contacted Tapal Ganesh, the man who raised objection over the map being used by the Survey of India for demarcating the boundary and wrote to the Karnataka Chief Secretary and made a field visit to the OMC mining area, where the current Survey of India demarcation activity was done.  ‘Different map’ Mr. Ganesh contends that the Bellary Reserve Forest Map of 1896 was being used by the SOI officials, which was not to the scale as it was not the primary map and points did not match on the ground. “If they use the 1887 traverse data which was more accurate, the border points on the ground will also match,” said Mr. Ganesh. A look from the Anantha Gangamma Konda Trijunction point shows the new survey boundary points going down the hill into Tumti village, but not in the direction of the Thimmappanna Gudda Trijunction, which has become the bone of contention. This change in boundary will deprive some mining leaseholders of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh of their leased areas, which were given based on the village maps available with respective governments at the time of giving mining leases. But now those maps were not being referred to for the final demarcation of the boundary. Only after the inter-State border is demarcated, the Central Bureau of Investigation can proceed further in the alleged illegal mining charges that are being faced by the Obulapuram Mining Company, added Mr. Ganesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/abrupt-stop-to-demarcation-of-karnataka-ap-border/article33332502.ece

15 December 2020||GUNDLAMACHANOOR (SANGAREDDY),TELANGANA||Villagers take the initiative to protect government land||In a rare way of exhibiting their responsibility, residents of Gundlamachanoor village saved government land worth crores of rupees. Last month, there was a protest in the village in Hatnoora mandal of the district. The villagers cornered the revenue inspector and did not allow him to move out of the panchayat office for about five hours. However, he was “released” after top officials intervened. The village has over 400 acres of government land in survey number 237 and a part of it . was allotted to a section of people who constructed houses. However, in a portion, illegal mining was taking place. Some people, also from the same village, eyed about six acres of land in the village adjacent to the water tank. Repeated complaints by the villagers to the officials failed to address the problem. One night, the encroachers used heavy machinery and cleared the ground. This shocked the villagers and they felt that people are taking advantage of government’s negligence in protecting lands. Except a few people, many started protesting. The villagers said that already houses was constructed in the occupied land. “The land belongs to tthe government and it has to be protected. There is no objection if the land is allotted the poor as per government norms. But we will not allow it to be occupied by ineligible people,” said a villager who had participated in the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/villagers-take-the-initiative-to-protect-government-land/article33333000.ece
15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||RoW accorded to T-Fiber across the State, waiving all charges||The State government has decided to accord right of way (RoW) permission for laying optical fibre networks including underground, open trench or any other method for expediting the prestigious Telangana Fiber Grid project (T-Fiber) aimed at providing high speed broadband connectivity to 83.5 lakh households covering 12,751 gram panchayats, across 585 mandals and 33 districts, besides all metros and municipalities in the State. T-Fiber project has been declared as “vital public purpose project” considering the socio-economic impact it would have on the State. The T-Fiber is in the process of establishing state-of-the-art network operations centre to monitor the operations and maintenance for execution of the project in aggressive timelines so that it would be completed by the end of 2022. 38,000 kms of OFC T-Fiber project consists of laying of optic fibre cable in PLB HDPE ducts to the tune of 38,000 kms of which 18,000 kms ducting will be done through Mission Bhagiratha. The balance 20,000 kms fresh trenching is to be executed in phase-I from State headquarter to mandal to gram panchayat while the other parts of the network of about 50,000 kms from gram panchayat to households would be in phase-II. The RoW permissions for laying the network in urban and rural areas had been given duly waiving off the charges in all areas under the jurisdiction of the government departments, including the local bodies and any other institution set up by the government. Accordingly, five days prior intimation would be given to the authorities concerned before the trenching/laying of optical fiber cable works are taken up. Approvals in the forest areas, those relating to railways and highways would be taken up separately. The two power distribution companies on their part should give access to electric, lighting poles, sub-stations and related infrastructure to be used by the Telangana Fiber Grid Corporation through their authorised agencies for aerial optic fibre routes. Power Discoms had been asked to provide electricity connections on top priority on payment basis to the T-Fiber point of presence locations at the district/mandal/village level offices. “No further permissions other than intimation to bodies concerned will be required to be taken,” IT Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said in the orders issued. No separate approval All the RoW permissions accorded to Mission Bhagiratha and National Optic Fiber Network/BharatNet Phase-1 would be equally applicable to Fiber Grid project and no separate approval is needed to be taken from the departments concerned. In addition, right of permission to access the State government buildings at village, mandal parishad, zilla parishad offices and collectorates or any other government buildings round the clock had been accorded to the project for housing the network components for successful implementation of the project. The right of permission would apply for all areas under the jurisdiction of the government departments, including local bodies and public sector undertakings, as well as institutions set up by the government. Space guidelines The heads of these offices have been directed to provide necessary space (1,000 sft at district level, 500 sft at mandal level and 250 sft at the village level) free of cost for housing the network equipment/infrastructure. The safety and security of the network equipment would be the responsibility of the respective panchayat secretary at village level, officer in-charge or his authorised representative at mandal and district levels. All charges like rent, administrative and any other kinds of fee are waived off for the project. The administrative departments have been asked to issue instructions to their field units in the form of a circular to strictly adhere to the decisions so that RoW is implemented smoothly.  Power Discoms have been asked to provide connections on payment basis to T-Fiber point of presence locations at the district/mandal/village level offices.

15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Central govt. releases Rs. 559 crore to State||The Centre has released Rs. 559.02 crore to the State to meet the shortfall in the revenue on account of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The amount has been raised through the special borrowing window set up by the Centre in October to meet the GST compensation shortfall estimated at Rs. 1.1 lakh crore. The release from the Union Finance Ministry follows the State government’s decision to accept Option-1 offered by the Centre, and the State was entitled to get Rs. 2,380 crore through the special window. Under the terms of Option-1, the State obtained the facility of special window for borrowings and it is also entitled to get unconditional permission to borrow the final instalment of 0.5% of the Gross State Domestic Product out of the 2% additional borrowings permitted under the Atmanirbhar Abhiyan launched on May 17 this year. The borrowings would be over and above the special window for borrowings estimated at Rs. 1.1 lakh crore. Accordingly, the Central government had granted permission for additional borrowing of Rs. 5,017 crore (0.5% of GSDP) as part of the Option-1. The release forms part of the seventh weekly instalment that had been released to meet the GST compensation shortfall. The Centre had earlier released the amount it borrowed as part of special window of borrowing on behalf of the States and Union Territories in six instalments starting October 23. The Centre had so far raised Rs. 42,000 crore of the Rs. 1.1 lakh crore and the remaining funds would be mobilised in the due course. The State will accordingly get releases of the balance over Rs. 1,700 crore, mostly in weekly instalments forthwith.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/central-govt-releases-rs-559-crore-to-state/article33332987.ece
15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Centre ready to make changes in farm Acts’||Senior BJP leader and Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said the Centre is ready to make any changes in the farm Acts if specific objections are pointed out by the farmers bodies or the political parties, but appealed people “not to blindly oppose them” as the they are only meant to benefit the farmers. “The BJP came to power with the support of farmers, so why will the government take any steps detrimental to their interests? We have no reservations in changing any part of the Acts, however, seeking total withdrawal is not right. Farmers, 85% of whom own less than five acres, should not become pawns in the hands of political parties because of their dislike towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said, on Monday. Addressing a press conference at the party office, the Minister said the Centre and the farmers organisations had agreed on eight points, including providing legal cover to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), increasing the number of market yards from 6,000 - though it was in the States domain, providing more warehousing and cold storage chains and so on. But, the leaders of the farmers groups went back on their word and are now insisting on total withdrawal, he maintained. Mr. Reddy blamed the ‘mandi’ lobby for the strike in Delhi and said: except in Punjab, farmers across the country have welcomed the new Acts. “But, we respect those agitating also as they are also farmers and we have tried to convince them. Fact also is more than 60% of farm produce is sold outside the mandis,” he said. Corporates and private groups are already involved in agriculture activities for long and the new Acts provides more teeth to benefit farmers in case of any malfeasance, he pointed out and affirmed that the government will continue to focus on reforms to make agriculture profitable and to provide enhanced income to farmers. “The new Acts are based on the recommendations of the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan committee and demands of various farmers organisations as well as Left groups to mitigate the sufferings of the small and marginal farmers,” he said. Mr. Reddy said the Modi Government had taken up several initiatives to help agriculture sector in the last six years - like - ensuring continuous and reliable power supply, fertilizer on demand, support for cold storages and warehousing, funding soil testing, support to drip irrigation and the farm insurance schemes. “Soon the revived Ramagundam fertiliser unit at Rs. 6,000 crore will start supplying ‘Kisan’ brand of fertilizer for the benefit of farmers of the Telugu States, he added.  The new Acts are based on the recommendations of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan committee. G.

15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Firm signs pact with CCMB for dry swab RT-PCR test||CSIR-Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) revolutionary dry swab direct Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, which allows for faster testing of COVID-19, is gaining fast acceptance. SpiceHealth, a healthcare company founded by the promoters of SpiceJet, became the second lab to tie up with CCMB after Apollo Hospitals for conducting these tests in its mobile testing laboratories, on Monday. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently granted approval to CCMB to commercially use the game-changing technology of dry swab RNA-extraction-free coronavirus testing method. The method has potential to scale up testing by two to threefold with no additional resources and significantly reduce the time and costs of such tests, said CCMB director Rakesh Mishra. SpiceHealth’s first mobile testing laboratory was inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan, at ICMR, AIIMS, last month. The test is being offered at Rs. 499 only. “I am proud to announce the launch of the first-of-its-kind dry swab RT-PCR testing facility at our SpiceHealth laboratories. Our mission is to provide high-quality and low-cost healthcare at a large scale. Dry swab method will reduce testing time by 1.5 hours, significantly reduce cost and further revolutionise RT-PCR testing,” said CEO Avani Singh. The firm has five mobile testing laboratories across Delhi, with 10 more labs to be opened for the next two weeks. It is currently conducting 10,000-15,000 tests a day. “I am confident that our combined efforts will help curb case count in India and flatten the curve. We are also gearing up to help with widespread deployment of the coronavirus vaccination in the country,” she said. ‘Game changer’ Dr. Mishra observed that the dry swab testing method will be a ‘game-changer’ in testing as the method is “safer, faster and cheaper than the current testing method without compromising the quality of test results”. CSIR director general Shekhar C Mande, in his message, complimented CCMB scientists and students involved in developing the method. “CSIR is happy to contribute to the enhanced coronavirus testing in the country during the pandemic,” he said. Dry-swab direct RT-PCR method eliminates the requirement of new kits and doesn’t require any additional training to be provided to the persons conducting the test. Generally, swab samples are placed in a liquid called Viral Transport Medium (VTM) and packed heavily to avoid spillage which increases processing time at both sample collection and testing centres. The latest method eliminates this process and doesn’t require RNA extraction too, he added. SpiceHealth had also launched SpiceOxy – a compact, portable, non-invasive ventilation device, for patients with mild to moderate breathing issues. A fingertip pulse oximeter, a handy device making it easier for people to measure the oxygen level of the blood has also been developed, a press release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/firm-signs-pact-with-ccmb-for-dry-swab-rt-pcr-test/article33332638.ece
15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||There’s total chaos in State administration, alleges Bhatti Vikramarka||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka has said that there is a total chaos in the administration of Telangana as no senior official is available to people in need and it is not possible to contact them even over phone. Speaking to newspersons here on Monday, he said since Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is not available to people, officials and even the elected representatives, including his Cabinet colleagues. In the same way, the officials are also not available to people. Even the legislators are unable to contact officials of the Secretariat even over phone, lest the general public. Although two years of the TRS government’s second term is over, there is no effort from the government to pay the unemployment allowance to the qualified youth, as promised by the ruling party during the run up to 2018 December elections. There is no attempt even to formulate the guidelines for rolling out the unemployment allowance, Mr. Vikramarka pointed out. Stating that total chaos is prevailing in the matter of registration of non-agricultural assets due to introduction of the Dharani portal, the CLP leader alleged that the Chief Minister had destroyed the existing land revenue system to benefit his loyalists. He also criticised the government for not releasing funds for the loan waiver scheme this year and blamed the government for the fiasco in the procurement of super fine varieties of paddy. The Congress leader also criticised the government delay in inclusion of COVID-19 in Aarogyasri scheme to provide relief to poor. He remarked that except K.T. Rama Rao and T. Harish Rao, all other Ministers in the KCR Cabinet are dummies. On the post of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC), the CLP Leader said he had taken the opinion of the CLP to the notice of AICC in-charge of party affairs in Telangana, Manickam Tagore. He, however, stated that he had not planned to visit Delhi “as of now” on the TPCC issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/theres-total-chaos-in-state-administration-alleges-bhatti-vikramarka/article33332984.ece

15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Thorough investigation sought into Nayeem’s firearms||The Forum for Good Governance has requested Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to instruct Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar to order an inquiry into possession of 24 firearms by the slain gangster Nayeem and registration of thousands of acres of land at his behest by 752 documents. In a letter to the Governor, forum secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy pointed out that a close look at seizures by police in the house of Nayeem after his death showed he was in possession of 24 firearms, including three AK 47 rifles and one sten gun. To get a gun license for a common man was difficult as a lot of police enquiries were made for the purpose. The licenses were not given for weapons like AK 47 or sten gun. Hence, there was need for a detailed inquiry to know how he secured the licenses and the weapons. Mr. Reddy also said the police seized 752 land registration documents which was a matter of concern. A lot of records were sought from a common man when he approached the sub-registrar offices for registration of sale of land. Photo and fingerprints are also taken from him. That being the case, how could Nayeem get thousands of acres of land and register them in 752 documents. It could not have happened without the connivance of revenue and registration officials. He added that 602 cell phones were also recovered from the house of Nayeem. Call data of these phones will give a clear picture of his contacts but it was not done in police investigation against him. Not even content in the 130 diaries seized was taken as evidence in police cases. So far, the inquiry was tardy and superficial and big names will go scot free at this rate. Therefore there was need for inquiry into the role of police, politicians, revenue and registration departments in Nayeem’s case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/inquiry-sought-into-nayeems-firearms/article33332640.ece

15 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Seniors hopeful of being heard by AICC before naming new PCC chief||Senior leaders of the Congress in the State are hopeful that the party high command would name the name chief for Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) only after taking their opinion one more time. Many of the senior leaders, including those who are in the race for TPCC chief’s post by staking their claim of being the potential contenders either openly or making efforts through their links within the party, are learnt to be trying for the appointment of AICC acting-president Sonia Gandhi and former president Rahul Gandhi. They are of the opinion that there is a need to take their opinion one more time, although all of them say that they would abide by the party leadership’s decision. “We want to be heard by the party leadership directly (personally) so that our opinion gets some weightage in the selection of new chief for PCC, who will lead the party efficiently in the next Assembly elections,” a senior leader in the race for PCC chief’s post said. Taken aback by reports in a section of the media spilling beans on the frontrunner for TPCC chief’s post, the seniors have intensified their efforts to take their voice/opinion to the party high command. “We are feeling let down by such reports as a majority of party’s rank and file associated with it for long are strongly against the party’s reins going into the hands of new comers, although the voice built around such new comers is loud as it too has come from outside,” a former minister said reacting on the developments. In case money power is considered as one of the major criterion by the high command, there are several options, including the party legislator (MLC) and former MP Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy as he alone could spare Rs. 1,000 crore, a vocal senior leader said on Monday. He alleged that it is TRS and BJP that have made the process of elections money-oriented as the influence of money was less on elections till 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/seniors-hopeful-of-being-heard-by-aicc-before-naming-new-pcc-chief/article33332982.ece

Mr. Sarnaik and his sons’ houses were searched by the ED two weeks ago in an alleged money laundering case involving a security agency. In his notice, Mr. Sarnaik said, “ED called me and my son for inquiry and we are cooperating with the agency. But after a tweet from Kangana Ranaut, electronic and print media published a news story against me which was defamatory and baseless. Even though the ED has been probing me, I want to clarify that nothing illegal has been found during those raids.” He added, “This is absolutely baseless and incorrect. It is defamatory and therefore request you to forward the notice to the privilege committee of the Assembly for further action.” Mr. Sarnaik, however, did not name any news outlets. Mr. Sarnaik was in the news for moving a breach of privilege motion against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for using ‘derogatory’ language against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Last week, he appeared before the ED for questioning in a matter involving money laundering related to a private firm. The ED has claimed suspicious transactions between a private firm, Tops Securities Group, and Mr. Sarnaik.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pratap-sarnaik-submits-breach-of-privilege-notice-against-media-outlets/article33332806.ece

15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Cases of COVID-triggered fungal infection surface||Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi on Monday said that at least 10 patients have come to the hospital in the last 15 days with COVID-triggered Mucormycosis, a “lethal” invasive fungal infection. The hospital said four of the 10 patients have died while five patients lost their eyesight. Jaws and cheeks of the patients were affected. “Mucormycosis or Black Fungus can be a cause of disease and death in transplant patients, and immunodeficient individuals. However, rapid increase in cases seen in recovering COVID patients is causing grave concern,” the hospital said in a statement. Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon of the hospital, said: “The frequency with which we are witnessing occurrence of COVID-triggered Mucormycosis with high morbidity and mortality has never been seen before and is shocking and alarming.” “Symptoms of the disease include dry nose obstruction, swelling in the eye or cheeks, black dry crust in nose. Also, you cannot feel your nose and your cheeks are numb,” said Dr. Munjal. He added there is no need to panic as Mucormycosis is not contagious and the fungus targets immuno compromised people. “Once you get treated for COVID, you are immunosuppressed. Eat immunity-boosting food. Also, do not get exposed to polluted air and stay away from contaminated and damp surfaces. The fungus grows in such damp surfaces with black molds,” Dr. Munjal said. The hospital said that a 32-year-old man, after recovering from COVID-19, developed an obstruction in his left nostril. Over the next two days, his eye swelled up. “He did not respond to antibiotics or painkillers and started rapidly losing vision on the affected side. The left side of his face became numb and he was brought to the emergency ward in a partially disoriented state,” read the statement. Tests revealed the presence of Mucormycosis. He was operated upon and then put on critical support for over two weeks. He will be discharged soon but in a “disfigured state”, the hospital said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cases-of-covid-triggered-fungal-infection-surface/article33332792.ece
15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi riots: police say Devangana creating false narrative in media||The Delhi police on Monday submitted before a local court here that Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Devangana Kalita, accused in a Delhi riots case, was creating a narrative in the media to show BJP leader Kapil Mishra was behind the communal violence. It added that if the investigation, the prosecution and the country was to continue on the foundation of what is being reported in the media, then that would be the “end of rule of law”. The police also argued that there was allegedly another narrative of “inscrutable indolence” created by the accused to show the prosecution in bad light. The submissions were made before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of Ms. Kalita’s bail application in the case of larger conspiracy to the riots. Ms. Kalita’s counsel advocate Adit Pujari had earlier referred to a media report which stated that as per an alleged internal report of the police, it was pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters who carried out an attack on a Bhim Army vehicle. Mr. Pujari had argued that the riots were not started by anti-CAA protesters but those who supported it, led by Mr. Mishra. The court has put up the matter for further hearing on December 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-riots-police-say-devangana-creating-false-narrative-in-media/article33332787.ece
15 December 2020||New Delhi,||HC criticises CBSE for ‘anti-student attitude’||The Delhi High Court on Monday rapped the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for its “anti-student attitude”, saying it was “treating students as enemies” by dragging them all the way to the Supreme Court in certain matters. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan made the observation while hearing a plea moved by the Board challenging a single judge order, which said the CBSE’s reassessment scheme for students whose board exams got cancelled due to COVID-19 would apply to improvement candidates also. “We don’t like this anti-student attitude of the CBSE. You are dragging students all the way to the Supreme Court. Should they be studying or going to court? We should start imposing costs on the CBSE. They are treating students as enemies,” the Bench added. The Bench further said that if the scheme applies to all improvement students, “what is the harm in it?” The single-judge Bench had held on August 14 that the scheme approved by the Supreme Court for assessing students due to cancellation of the CBSE exams in light of COVID-19 will also apply to students, who appeared for improvement examinations as they are equal victims of the pandemic. “There is no earthshaking emergency for you to come to court now all guns blazing,” the Bench said, adding that the CBSE should have gone to the apex court for a clarification, instead of dragging students to court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-criticises-cbse-for-anti-student-attitude/article33332789.ece

15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Gold robbery solved with arrest of four||Delhi Police on Monday solved a robbery of 4 kg gold worth of Rs. 2 crore in east Delhi’s Shakarpur with the arrest of four. The accused were identified as Mukesh Sharma, Pardeep Bajaj, Prashanto Santra and Uttam Dagur. Two other accused are absconding. According to the police, a gang of four bike-borne armed men robbed 4 kg gold from Champak Gayan, a jewellery maker, on December 9. Mr. Gayan, along with his employee Saurabh, was going to Anand Vihar ISBT in an auto. When they reached Vikas Marg near Mangal Bazar Chowk, robbers obstructed their way and tried to snatch the jewellery bag from Mr. Gayan. When he resisted, they attacked him with a knife and stabbed him several times. Based on a complaint, an FIR was registered at Shakarpur Police station. Clues from CCTV footage were developed. A tip-off was received that Golu gang was involved in the incident and gang leader Mukesh alias Golu and Toni would come to Karol Bagh to meet someone. A trap was laid and they were arrested. Based on information provided by the accused, others were also nabbed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gold-robbery-solved-with-arrest-of-four/article33332798.ece

Stating that funds released by the government to six colleges in September and other colleges later were not enough to pay pending salaries to employees, the DUTA said that close to 2,000 teachers and non-teaching staff have been affected. The DUTA has requested a meeting with the CM to discuss the matter. “Withholding grants citing excuses such as non-formation of governing bodies, paucity of funds, audits and corruption charges on these colleges is unwarranted and will cause irreparable damage to the reputation of these institutions and demoralise the employees and students,” the letter read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/college-funds-duta-seeks-meeting-with-cm/article33332799.ece

Statements of witnesses were hurriedly recorded whose veracity will be tested at the time of the trial, the court further noted. While granting bail to Faisal Farooq, owner of Rajdhani School in Shiv Vihar, Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said though the accused was in jail for a considerable period of time, the police has hardly been able to bring on record any evidence against him for criminal conspiracy. The court noted that until June, virtually no investigation was done in the matter. Mr. Farooq was arrested for his alleged involvement in damaging the property of adjacent DRP Convent School during the riots. He was granted bail in the case in June, after which he was arrested in a second case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/court-grants-bail-to-school-owner-in-delhi-riots-case/article33332786.ece

The court orally suggested to the government to find out which districts had a high number of infections and increase tests in those areas. The suggestion came during the hearing of a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking to ramp up COVID-19 testing in Delhi. The HC has asked the Delhi government to file a fresh status report within a week indicating updated figures of tests carried out, district-wise infection numbers, and number of containment zones. The court also asked the Delhi government whether it was planning a fifth serological survey now that the number of infections was coming down in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-ramp-up-testing-in-affected-areas/article33332785.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Five arrested for dacoity in south Delhi||With the arrest of five men, Delhi Police claimed to have solved a case of alleged dacoity in a house in south Delhi, said a senior police officer on Monday. The accused were identified as Arman Khan, Mohd. Danish, Vijay Rana, Anil and Shiv Singh, he said. Police said that on December 9, a resident of Saidulajab Extension in south Delhi lodged a complaint saying that six to seven persons cornered him and his family at gunpoint and stole Rs. 4 lakh, gold ornaments and 2.5 kg of silver. They also took away the DVR of CCTV camera. An FIR was registered in this regard at Neb Sarai police station. “The accused wore delivery-boy T-shirt and used code words to communicate with each other to avoid identification,” added the officer. “The CCTV footage of the nearby areas were analysed and it was found that the accused came on two bikes with fake number plates,” said a senior police officer. The robbers entered the house on the pretext of delivering courier. They used gloves and masks to hide identity. A police team worked on the CCTV footage. They thoroughly checked the footage of around 25 km from Saidullahjab to Zakir Nagar. One suspect was apprehended. Based on sustained interrogation and technical intelligence, other accused were identified. Coordinated raids were conducted at multiple places and others were also nabbed, the officer said. Two pistols and three vehicles were also recovered from them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/five-arrested-for-dacoity-in-south-delhi/article33332797.ece

The air quality of the Capital was in the moderate category after 15 days and is expected to deteriorate to the “moderate to poor” category on Tuesday. The AQI of Delhi was 160 on Monday as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. The values for Gurugram and Noida were 101 and 176 respectively. The last time Delhi’s air quality was in the moderate category was on November 27 and the AQI was 137. The effect of stubble burning on the city’s air quality was low on Monday. Also, the mixing height will be low at night. This prevents pollutants from getting dispersed easily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/some-respite-as-aqi-improves-in-the-capital/article33332795.ece
15 December 2020||Pune,||Vintage photos of golden age artiste now in NFAI’s vaults||In yet another priceless acquisition of vintage Indian cinema memorabilia, the personal collection of renowned yesteryear actor-director Gajanan Jagirdar is now part of the vaults of the city-based National Film Archive of India (NFAI). Jagirdar, who aligned his talents closely with the theories laid down by legendary Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski, did some of his most memorable work during the golden age of Marathi and Hindi cinema in the 1940s. He was associated with the iconic Prabhat Studios during its heyday. Ashok Jagirdar, son of the late actor-director, handed over 130 photographs and other memorabilia from his father’s personal collection to Prakash Magdum, director, NFAI. “I was in touch with Mr. Ashok Jagirdar for the past few days and am grateful to him for his gesture in giving these priceless photos. We will be digitising them soon,” said Mr. Magdum. Speaking on the value of the collection, Mr. Magdum said that the ‘jewel in the crown’ in the collection was a black and white photograph in full costume and get-up of Jagirdar as Bal Gangadhar ‘Lokmanya’ Tilak in a Prabhat Studio production that never saw the light of day. “This now-legendary image bears such an uncanny resemblance to the freedom fighter that on many occasions, Jagirdar’s image has been passed off as an original image of Tilak,” said Mr. Magdum, shedding light on the historical context of the pictures. Yet another remarkable picture is an original caricature sketch of the actor as the protagonist of a 1953 film Mahatma drawn by then cartoonist Bal Thackeray, who subsequently founded the Shiv Sena. The film was notable for having been written by famed litterateur P. L. Deshpande, known affectionately as ‘Pu La’, and directed by Datta Dharmadhikari. While he made an indelible impression as the 18th century Maratha judge Ramshastri Prabhune in the 1944 Prabhat Studious classic Ramshastri , Jagirdar branched out to play supporting roles in several noted Bollywood classics of the 1950s and 1960s. There are several photographs of Mr. Jagirdar in his iconic role as Ramshastri, trying to administer stern justice in the cut-throat world of late 18th century politics of Peshwai Pune. “He [Jagirdar] had received enormous critical acclaim while achieving widespread popularity for his role as Ramshastri. He had even been feted with the Best Actor and Best Director awards for this film by the Bengal Film Journalists Association,” Mr. Magdum said. In Bollywood, he was typically cast in the role of the heroine’s father, or as authority figures in films such as the Dev Anand-starrer Hum Dono (1961), Grahasti (1963), and Guide (1965). “There are several images of Jagirdar from his Bollywood oeuvre, along with veteran artist David Abraham, and actor Rekha, in the collection. We are really delighted to receive these memorabilia which will be of considerable interest to both film scholars and cineastes,” said Mr. Magdum, adding that Jagirdar had also served as the first principal of the fledgling Film and Television Institute of India [then known as Film Institute of India] during 1961-62. “So, getting his photographs for preservation seems in a way like a homecoming due to the organic connection between the NFAI and the FTII,” said Mr. Magdum. One of the oldest photographs from the collection is from a 1935 film Asire Havis . Another still is from a 1938 film Meetha Jahar in which Jagirdar appeared with actor Naseem Banu. Other notables include Jagirdar’s stellar role as Mirza in V. Shantaram’s classic 1941 Marathi film Shejari , which was filmed as Padosi in Hindi. “He was one of the first artistes from Mumbai to shoot in Lahore and his film Behram Khan (1946) became very popular. Some stunning outdoor photographs of the shooting of that film also form part of this collection,” said Mr. Magdum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/vintage-photos-of-golden-age-artiste-now-in-nfais-vaults/article33332801.ece
15 December 2020||Washington,||U.S. agencies hit by massive cyberattack||The U.S. government issued an emergency directive to federal agencies in the wake of a major cyberattack, as multiple media outlets reported at least two departments — including the Treasury — had been targeted by hackers with ties to Russia. In a statement on Sunday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said it had ordered federal agencies to immediately stop using SolarWinds Orion IT products following reports that hackers had used a recent update to gain access to internal communications. “The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,” said CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales. “Tonight’s directive is intended to mitigate potential compromises within federal civilian networks... we urge all our partners-in the public and private sectors-to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks,” he added. The U.S. government earlier Sunday admitted its computer networks had been hit by a cyberattack. “We have been working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks,” a spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told AFP. “CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” IT company SolarWinds over the weekend admitted that hackers had exploited a backdoor in an update of some of its software released between March and June. “We have been advised this attack was likely conducted by an outside nation state and intended to be a narrow, extremely targeted, and manually executed attack, as opposed to a broad, system-wide attack,” the firm said. The hacks are part of a wider campaign that also hit major cybersecurity firm FireEye, which said its own defences had been breached by sophisticated attackers who stole tools used to test customers’ computer systems. FireEye said it suspected the attack could have affected numerous high profile targets across the globe. “Victims have included government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East,” the firm said. Microsoft alerts users Microsoft also alerted its users to what it described as a sophisticated campaign aimed at “high value targets” in government and cybersecurity and which it said represented “nation-state activity at significant scale.” U.S. media reports said the FBI was investigating a group working for the Russian foreign intelligence service, SVR. Russia’s Embassy in the U.S. hit back against what it said were the “unfounded” media claims that the Kremlin was involved in the attacks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-agencies-hit-by-massive-cyberattack/article33332493.ece
15 December 2020||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka’s youngest virus victim triggers campaign against forced cremations||The last week has been the worst yet for N.F.M. Fahim’s family residing in Colombo. The 38-year-old and his wife lost their new-born to COVID-19 on December 8, and even before they could process the devastating news from the hospital, authorities were ready to hand over the baby’s ashes to them. “I did not have the heart to take the ashes. We were already dealing with the shock of losing our son who was just 20 days old, and then to be told he was cremated, which goes against our religious practice, was just unbearable,” said Mr. Fahim, breaking down. He last saw his son on December 7, the night he rushed him to a leading government hospital for children, after noticing the baby’s congestion-like symptoms. In barely two days, baby Shaykh was in the news as Sri Lanka’s youngest victim of the virus, cremated against his family’s wishes because of the government’s policy of allowing only cremation, based on unsubstantiated claims that bodies of COVID-19 victims could contaminate groundwater. “We were repeatedly told the cremation has to be done within 24 hours,” Mr. Fahim recalled. Ever since COVID-19 struck Sri Lanka in March, the government has been enforcing cremations for all victims, despite the World Health Organization saying bodies “can be buried or cremated”. The island is witnessing a surge in cases — totalling over 32,000 now — since the second major outbreak in October. Making up about 10% of the country’s 21 million-strong population, Sri Lanka’s Muslim community has been urging the government to revise its pandemic guidelines that go against Islamic religious beliefs, but to no avail. The UN and International Human Rights organisations urged Sri Lankan authorities to reverse the policy, but the government’s rules remain unchanged. Opposition parliamentarians raised the issue in the House, while a dozen activists and politicians petitioned the Supreme Court in May, challenging the government’s ‘cremations only’ policy. On December 1, the top court rejected all petitions. ‘Losing hope’ The Muslim community is losing hope, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader and opposition legislator Rauff Hakeem told Parliament recently. “The community is getting ahead with a civic resistance programme of refusing to accept the bodies. This is a traumatic situation for the entire community... the trauma aside, this is going to have serious implications for generations to come,” he said, “pleading” with the government to revise its guidelines. Many in Sri Lanka see the government’s policy mandating cremations as part of a series of attacks targeting Muslims over the last few years. According to Farzana Haniffa, professor, Department of Sociology at the University of Colombo,the Rajapaksa administration has cultivated a position in relation to its base, where the demonising of Muslims is needed, and has to be maintained. “The denial of Muslims’ burial rights is just yet another step in that pursuit,” she told The Hindu . “It is unfortunate that the government, with so much power and such a huge mandate, sees the need for this,” Ms. Haniffa said. However, the recent passing and forcible cremation of baby Shaykh, has set off a silent protest. Dozens of Colombo residents tied pieces of white cloth on the gates of the crematorium this weekend, expressing solidarity, but they had been removed on Monday reportedly by the police, according to a tweet from Ali Zahir Moulana, a former parliamentarian. As calls to stop mandatory cremations grew louder over the past week, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa directed officials to find land suitable for burials, local media reported. There has been no official announcement on the development. Maldives offers help Meanwhile, neighbouring Maldives, an Islamic country of nearly 400,000 people, has stepped in to help. Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid said on Monday in a tweet: “On special request from Sri Lankan President @GotabayaR, President @ibusolih is consulting stakeholder authorities of the Government of Maldives to assist Sri Lanka in facilitating Islamic funeral rites in the Maldives for Sri Lankan Muslims succumbing to COVID-19 pandemic.” Six years after Mr. Fahim and his wife had their first child, baby Shaykh was born last month, bringing much joy to the family in an otherwise stifling pandemic year. “I drive a rented three-wheeler to make a living. We were struggling financially, but our baby boy made us so happy,” Mr. Fahim told The Hindu . “It is not easy to talk about our child, but I have put my feelings aside to speak up, only in the hope that what happened to our son doesn’t happen to even one more person. Our wounds will begin to heal only when they put an end to forced cremations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lankas-youngest-virus-victim-triggers-campaign-against-forced-cremations/article33332498.ece
15 December 2020||London,||British spy thriller author John le Carre dies aged 89||John le Carre, the British writer best known for his Cold War espionage novels Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Spy Who Came In From The Cold , has died aged 89, his agent and family said on Sunday. The author, a former British intelligence officer whose real name was David Cornwell, wrote 25 novels and one memoir in a career spanning six decades, selling 60 million books worldwide. He is survived by his wife, Jane, and four sons.  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was adapted for television in 1979, with Alec Guinness starring as the enigmatic spycatcher George Smiley, and became a classic. Gary Oldman reprised the role in the 2011 film, winning an Oscar the following year. “All who follow are in his debt,” Mr. Oldman said. “His characters were drawn deftly and deeply... For me, inhabiting George Smiley remains one of the highpoints of my life.” His friend, the novelist Robert Harris, called le Carre “one of those writers who really was not only a brilliant writer but he also penetrated popular culture —and that’s a great rarity”. Le Carre once said he owed his career in the shadows and later literary success to an “impulsive adolescent decision” to flee an unhappy life. It involved a spell in Bern, Switzerland, learning German, where he took his first steps in British intelligence, doing odd-jobs across the border in Austria. He later returned to study at Oxford University. He later transferred to the overseas spy agency MI6. It was as an MI6 officer that he had his first success with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold in 1963. For obvious reasons, he had to use a pseudonym.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-spy-thriller-author-john-le-carre-dies-aged-89/article33332495.ece
15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||U.S. Electoral College set to vote||Electors will meet in each of the U.S.’s States and the District of Columbia to cast their votes on Monday and are expected to vote in favour of the presidential candidate who won the popular vote in their respective States. Normally a low-key affair, this year the process has garnered special attention with President Donald Trump repeatedly making unsubstantiated claims that large-scale voter fraud had resulted in his challenger, Democratic candidate Joe Biden, winning the election. Mr. Biden is expected to secure 306 electoral votes against Mr. Trump’s 232, further attenuating the efforts of Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn the election. Trump supporters and anti-Trump activists clashed on Saturday in cities across the country, resulting in four stabbings in Washington DC and one shooting in Washington State. This was prompted by the Supreme Court dismissing a lawsuit filed by the State of Texas seeking to invalidate the electoral outcome in key swing States won by Mr. Biden. Late on Sunday night (Washington time), Mr. Trump tweeted claims of election fraud and appeared to threaten electors with prosecution. “Swing States that have found massive VOTER FRAUD, which is all of them, CANNOT LEGALLY CERTIFY these votes as complete & correct without committing a severely punishable crime,” he wrote in a post that also contained other unsubstantiated claims about large-scale electoral fraud. “Therefore, VOTES CANNOT BE CERTIFIED. THIS ELECTION IS UNDER PROTEST!” Mr. Trump said. Twitter tagged the comment with a ‘disputed’ label. The Electoral College will meet in groups across States — usually in the Capitol building starting on Monday morning. How they vote The Electoral College is a constitutionally mandated body set up to elect the President. Electors are chosen by political parties who have fielded a candidate in the presidential election (they cannot be federal officials or members of Congress). These individuals are normally long-time party or candidate loyalists and sometimes political hopefuls themselves — they are unlikely to vote contrary to the certified outcome of the popular vote in their State. This has, however, happened before, including in 2016 when some ‘faithless electors’ turned against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in States where each of these candidates had won the popular vote. In July, the Supreme Court ruled it was constitutional for States to have laws removing or penalising ‘faithless electors’. Thirty-two States have laws against ‘faithless’ voting. Both houses of the (new) U.S. Congress will convene on January 6 to count the votes of the Electoral College in a session presided over by U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence. For an objection to any State’s vote to sustain, it must first be supported by at least one Senator and one Representative. Any objection is then debated by each chamber of Congress separately. For the objection to go through, both houses must vote in favour of it. This is highly unlikely given that the House is controlled by Democrats and that several Republicans in the Senate are of the view that Mr. Biden is the winner of the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-electoral-college-set-to-vote/article33332500.ece

Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot live on television shortly before 9:30 a.m. (1430 GMT). “First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!” President Donald Trump tweeted. Ms. Lindsay said the jab “didn’t feel any different from taking any other vaccine.” “I feel great. I feel relieved,” she said. “I hope this marks the beginning of the end of the very painful time in our history. I want to instill public confidence that the vaccine is safe... We’re in a pandemic so we all need to do our part,” Ms. Lindsay said. Governor Andrew Cuomo, watching the landmark moment via video-link, told Ms. Lindsay he hoped the vaccine would give her and other frontline health care workers “a sense of security and safety.” “It’s going to take months before the vaccine hits critical mass. So, this is the light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s a long tunnel,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/new-york-nurse-receives-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-us/article33332576.ece

Mr. Trump made the announcement hours after his administration confirmed that senior U.S. officials, including some White House aides who work in close proximity to Mr. Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, would be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week. “People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet. “I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.” News that White House staff would receive the vaccine early drew criticism on social media. Officials said on Sunday that doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer would be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation’s top leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-reverses-plan-for-early-vaccination-at-white-house/article33332501.ece
15 December 2020||New York,||Google hit by brief outage||Internet users worldwide received a jarring reminder on Monday about just how reliant they are on Google, when the Silicon Valley giant suffered a major outage for about an hour, sending many of its most popular services offline. Google services including Calendar, Gmail, Hangouts, Maps, Meet and YouTube all crashed, halting productivity and sending angry users to Twitter to vent about the loss of services. Students struggled to sign into virtual classrooms. Google disclosed the outages on a status dashboard that shares information about its various services. Downdetector, a website for tracking internet outages, also showed that Google was offline. Google’s search engine continued to work for some people. But then about an hour after the outages began, the services started working again. It was not immediately clear how many users were affected by the outage, or what caused disruption, which began between 1150 GMT and 1230 GMT.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Firing a warning shot across big tech’s bows||It was a long time coming, but the day of reckoning for the big digital companies may finally have arrived. Despite the growing monopoly power of big tech and their use of anti-competitive practices, earlier attempts to regulate them (such as an attempt by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1998 to rein in Microsoft) had only limited success. The novel coronavirus pandemic further enhanced the monopoly power of the big tech giants. Timeline and actions But now, a rash of lawsuits and regulatory moves in the United States and Europe against the big non-Chinese digital companies (particularly Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google) suggest that the days of their easy expansion in an unregulated environment may be coming to an end. In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against Google (https://bit.ly/37fngUw) for misusing its dominant position as search engine by undermining competitors; favouring its own content in search results; doing deals with other companies to become the default search engine in many browsers and devices; and then using data on its users and competitors to reinforce its dominance and get even more revenue from advertising. Then, in early December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, sued Facebook (https://bit.ly/3mebxtD), accusing it of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors. The specific instances of Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram were cited, which apparently resulted from concerns that the growing popularity of these platforms could break the company’s hold on social media. The FTC complaint (https://bit.ly/3moqDwY) cites a Mark Zuckerberg email of June 2008: “It is better to buy than compete”; in another internal communication, he noted that Facebook “can likely always just buy any competitive startups” (https://bit.ly/37ZBpV7). By 2012, just before buying Instagram, he said the photo and video sharing app “could be very disruptive to us”, if allowed to grow independently. The purchase of WhatsApp two years later similarly reflected concerns that the instant messaging service could become the favoured social media over Facebook. The ‘wrath of Mark’ Why did these companies agree to be bought up? It was not the price at which they were sold ($19 billion for WhatsApp and $1 billion for Instagram) so much as Facebook’s ability to make an offer they could not refuse, Mafioso-style, by destroying their ability to expand and attract new users. “Will he go into destroy mode if I say no?” Instagram founder Kevin Systrom is cited as having asked an investor when considering Facebook’s offer. “Bottom line I don’t think we’ll ever escape the wrath of Mark ... it just depends how long we avoid it.” This wrath was expressed by using Facebook’s huge user base in a bait-and-switch, offering newer app or website developers various incentives (such as allowing them to use “like” buttons) that promoted their sites or apps to Facebook users, which also meant that Facebook could then gather more data on the online activities of those users. When the new app grew and emerged as a possible threat, Facebook would stop this access and thereby destroy its ability to attract a new user base. Google and Facebook are hardly the only transgressors. A U.S. House Committee Report (https://bit.ly/2WaomKW) that led up to the lawsuits has major indictments of Amazon and Apple as well. Amazon “functions as a gatekeeper for e-commerce”, reducing competition and thereby also harming consumers. It has exploitative relationships with other sellers on the platform, which “live in fear of the company” and which Amazon refers to as “internal competitors”. Sellers are not allowed to contact shoppers directly, often limited in their ability to sell on other platforms, face “strong-arm tactics in negotiations” and have to choose between getting “atrocious levels of customer service” or better service for a fee. Like the other companies, Amazon profits from ideas and products developed by others, and simply buys up start-ups or even open-source cloud-software developers when it wants. Apple also favours its own apps and seeks to put rivals at a disadvantage on its products and leaves developers with little choice for reaching consumers. Like Google, it levies high commission fees (of 30%) that end up being charged on consumers. The two companies are voracious purchasers of companies: over the past few years, Google has bought at least one firm a month; Apple buys one every two or so (https://cnb.cx/2JTK1Vq). The European Union has separately filed cases again Amazon and Google. In November, it filed charges against Amazon (https://bit.ly/37htcwd), accusing the company of using its access to data from companies selling on its platform to gain unfair advantage over them. Earlier this summer it opened two antitrust cases against Google. It is planning to change the regulatory regime (https://reut.rs/37YZNq0) to prevent the anti-competitive practices exhibited, for example, in its Android mobile operating system and its search engine. Impact on users The dangers of these aggressive monopolies are not confined to the competitors — users also suffer because of fewer options and weaker privacy controls. Both WhatsApp and Facebook have eroded the privacy protections that they earlier promised, by changing the terms of service communicated through long and complicated messages that most users simply do not read. All these companies hoard the data they collect, which increasingly covers all aspects of their users’ lives. For many of them, data are now the biggest source of revenues and profits. All sorts of use can be made of data: marketing and targeted advertising, influencing and manipulating political outcomes, targeting individuals based on particular criteria, enabling surveillance by both governments and private agencies. The idea in both the U.S. and the EU is to break up these companies — for example, by forcing Facebook to divest both WhatsApp and Instagram, much as the telecom giant AT&T was forced to break up in the early 1980s. Anti-trust lawsuits are notoriously difficult to win, but many legal experts agree that these cases are very solid. But this is only one step in the required regulatory control of these digital behemoths, which are now exercising unprecedented market power as well as other kinds of power. More regulation is clearly required, in addition to the lawsuits. The Indian angle is relevant All this has direct relevance for India, and not only because these companies are so important in India. More than 400 million of WhatsApp’s estimated 2 billion users are in India; Amazon has around one-third of the share of online retail in India, neck and neck with Flipkart that was recently acquired by Walmart; India is Facebook’s largest single market, with around 270 million accounts; Google completely dominates the search engine space in India, and most smartphones in India are Android-based. And now Facebook and Google are collaborating with India’s largest telecom company — Reliance Jio owned by Mukesh Ambani — to create a single gateway for Indians (https://bit.ly/3abrSNw) providing everything from information, news media and entertainment to daily purchases of groceries and sundry other services. Apart from their market dominance, another concern is the cosy relationship these companies have established with the ruling party in the country, and the willingness to adopt different standards of fact-checking and privacy in India, so as to benefit the powerful. Reports suggest that Facebook has been unwilling to remove incendiary and violent content for fear of backlash (https://on.wsj.com/388qyZc) from Hindu nationalist politicians and stormtroopers. This is not helped by the fact that India still does not have a privacy law, even though the Supreme Court declared privacy to be a fundamental right some time ago. Even the proposed Bill is extremely weak without adequate safeguards. It is time for Indians to wake up and realise that anti-trust regulation and public control over digital companies—including home-grown ones — have become critical for them.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||India needs to rethink its nutrition agenda||The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has released data fact sheets for 22 States and Union Territories (UTs) based on the findings of Phase I of the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5). The 22 States/ UTs don’t include some major States such as Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. While the national picture will only be clear when the survey is completed and data are released for all the States and UTs, what we have so far paints a troubling picture in relation to nutrition outcomes. Worrying findings Of the 22 States and UTs, there is an increase in the prevalence of severe acute malnutrition in 16 States/UTs (compared to NFHS-4 conducted in 2015-16). Kerala and Karnataka are the only two big States among the six States and UTs where there is some decline. The percentage of children under five who are underweight has also increased in 16 out of the 22 States/UTs. Anaemia levels among children as well as adult women have increased in most of the States with a decline in anaemia among children being seen only in four States/UTs (all of them smaller ones — Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Meghalaya). There is also an increase in the prevalence of other indicators such as adult malnutrition measured by those having a Body Mass Index of less than 18.5kg/m2 in many States/ UTs. What is also a matter of concern is that most States/UTs also see an increase in overweight/obesity prevalence among children and adults, once again drawing attention to the inadequacy of diets in India both in terms of quality and quantity. The data report an increase in childhood stunting (an indicator of chronic undernutrition and considered a sensitive indicator of overall well-being) in 13 of the 22 States/UTs compared to the data of NFHS-4. Among the remaining nine States, five see an improvement of less than 1 percentage point (pp) in this five-year period. Sikkim (7.3 pp), Manipur (5.5 pp), Bihar (5.4 pp) and Assam (1.1 pp) are the four States which see some improvement although even these are below the goals set by the government. There was a 10 pp decline in stunting among children under five (low height for age) between 2005-06 (NFHS-3) and 2015-16 (NFHS-4), from 48% to 38%, averaging 1 pp a year. Although in the right direction, this was considered to be a very slow pace of improvement. Poshan Abhiyaan, one of the flagship programmes of the Prime Minister, launched in 2017, aimed at achieving a 2 pp reduction in childhood stunting per year. All indications from these initial results of NFHS-5 are that we are likely to see an increase in prevalence of childhood stunting in the country during the period 2015-16 to 2019-20. This is extremely alarming and calls for serious introspection on not just the direct programmes in place to address the problem of child malnutrition but also the overall model of economic growth that the country has embarked upon. The World Health Organization calls stunting “a marker of inequalities in human development”. Over the last three decades, there have been phases where India has experienced high rates of economic growth. But this period has also seen increasing inequality, greater informalisation of the labour force, and reducing employment elasticities of growth. Some expansion in social protection schemes and public programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the Public Distribution System, the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), and school meals have contributed to reduction in absolute poverty as well as previous improvements in nutrition indicators. However, there are continuous attempts to weaken these mechanisms through underfunding and general neglect. For instance, in a response to a parliamentary question in December 2019, the Minister for Women and Child Development presented data which showed that only about 32.5% of the funds released for Poshan Abhiyaan from 2017-18 onwards had been utilised. The last few years particularly have been bad with slowdown in economic growth, stagnant rural wages and highest levels of unemployment. This is also reflected, for instance, in the rising number of reported starvation deaths from different parts of the country. Volunteers of the Right to Food campaign have listed over 100 starvation deaths based on media and/or verified fact-finding reports since 2015. While these data present a bleak picture as far as nutrition is concerned, what is worrying is that the situation would be even worse now as a result of the pandemic and lockdown-induced economic distress. Field surveys such as the recent ‘Hunger Watch’ are already showing massive levels of food insecurity and decline in food consumption, especially among the poor and vulnerable households. In the Hunger Watch survey carried out in 11 States, two-thirds of the respondents reported that the nutritional quality and quantity of their diets worsened in September-October compared to before the lockdown. All of this calls for urgent action with commitment towards addressing the issue of malnutrition. The NFHS-5 fact sheets, which also present data related to health, nutrition and other socioeconomic indicators, show some positive trends as well. There are some improvements seen in determinants of malnutrition such as access to sanitation, clean cooking fuels and women’s status – a reduction in spousal violence and greater access of women to bank accounts, for example. In these too, gaps remain and some States perform better than others. A piecemeal approach What these overall poor nutritional outcomes therefore also show is that a piecemeal approach addressing some aspects (that too inadequately) does not work. Direct interventions such as supplementary nutrition (of good quality including eggs, fruits, etc.), growth monitoring, and behaviour change communication through the ICDS and school meals must be strengthened and given more resources. Universal maternity entitlements and child care services to enable exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate infant and young child feeding as well as towards recognising women’s unpaid work burdens have been on the agenda for long, but not much progress has been made on these. At the same time, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition both through what foods are produced and available as well as what kinds of livelihoods are generated in farming are also important. Overall, one of the main messages is that the basic determinants of malnutrition – household food security, access to basic health services and equitable gender relations – cannot be ignored any longer. An employment-centred growth strategy which includes universal provision of basic services for education, health, food and social security is imperative. There have been many indications in our country that business as usual is not sustainable anymore. It is hoped that the experience of the pandemic as well as the results of NFHS-5 serve as a wake-up call for serious rethinking of issues related to nutrition and accord these issues priority.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Convergence of agrarian discontent in South Asia||Those familiar with the systematic attack on agriculture in South Asia over the last decades will not be surprised at the ongoing farmers’ protests in India. It could have been Pakistan, where farmers protesting for support prices were beaten up and arrested in Lahore only a month ago, or Sri Lanka, where shortages of imported fertilizers and declining subsidies has led to farmers’ outcry. In the middle of a long simmering rural economic crisis pushed over the cliff by the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts by South Asian governments to project corporatisation and deregulation as the way forward for agriculture have angered long-suffering farmers. Contempt for small-holding producers has been a part and parcel of policy-making across the region for decades. Successive governments have imposed a corporate agenda, seeking profits from food production and distribution by relaxing norms for cheap food imports, and encouraging export-oriented production, price speculation, agribusiness and retail supermarkets. South Asia’s rural landscape has been profoundly reshaped by such ‘reforms’, dispossessing farmers of their land, and pushing them into wage labour and migration as coping mechanisms. This hollowing out of rural livelihoods does not come with any assurance of stable jobs or a decent quality of life in urban areas. Pandemic opportunism The COVID-19 crisis has given a new lease of life to such efforts. India is not the only country to have attempted to seize this moment to deregulate agricultural markets. In Pakistan, at the height of the first lockdown in May this year, the government inked an agreement with the World Bank to further deregulate the country’s wheat market. In Sri Lanka, with the national budget just passed for 2021, there are only meagre allocations towards revitalising agricultural livelihoods and policies focused on supporting technologies suitable for agribusinesses. Instead of the current crisis sending governments back to the drawing board, South Asia’s authoritarian regimes, complicit with corporate interests, are railroading in anti-farmer agricultural policies. Corporate agriculture further exacerbates the existential danger faced by South Asian farmers. Such corporate solutions do not address the role of middlemen and traders in denying farmers a fair price for their labour. Instead, opening up markets to large corporations is likely to spark the same sort of race to the bottom that has been seen in the industrial and service sectors. Deregulation makes farmers’ livelihoods even more precarious and threatens food sovereignty through increased dependence on global agricultural trade. It has become far too easy to forget that it was the collapse of global agricultural commodity prices in the 1970s that had a large role to play in the debt crisis that haunts countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Reviving resistance There is a powerful legacy of rural movements in South Asia that have fought for the rights of farmers, peasants and agricultural workers. Rural movements played a crucial role in the anti-colonial struggle and fought for progressive land and agrarian reform after Independence. Seventy years on, they continue to fight against the recent waves of anti-farmer policies, while advancing new progressive visions such as peasant agroecology and food sovereignty, which put small food producers and the environment at the centre. While the issues highlighted by the Indian protests are not entirely new, the current convergence of authoritarianism and corporate capital brings this existential crisis for rural agricultural producers even more sharply in focus. Farmers’ movements have been aware of state connivance with exploitative actors, but they must now also contend with a breakdown of democratic process and increased repression. Those in power seem to have been caught off guard by the songs and displays of solidarity in Delhi and many other parts of India over the past two weeks. Just when it seemed like the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Hindutva agenda had been suppressed by severe state violence, the farmers’ movement has become the new face of opposition to the Narendra Modi government. These should be ominous signs for regimes across South Asia which continue to act with impunity in the face of demands for economic and social justice. Voices of movements The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed food sovereignty back into the public imagination. We have been reminded of how precarious our food supplies are. The solution, of course, only begins with making farming a viable livelihood. Dominant assumptions about inevitable rural-urban migration and techno-utopian transformation in agriculture must be challenged. Questions of land redistribution and other rural inequalities must remain a crucial part of the political agenda. The situation of mostly female agricultural workers, the rural landless and Dalits in South Asia remains precarious. Even as rural movements across South Asia fight the ongoing attack on their livelihoods, they must also tackle rural inequality head on. The air is ripe for new visions of rural emancipation in South Asia. Rural movements are working to transform not just their world but are becoming catalysts for a broader anti-authoritarian struggle in South Asia. The rural movements that swept across South Asia in the 1960s may seem like a distant memory. The current phase of struggles has revived old questions, while raising others about the future of our long ignored rural world. We must listen to the voices and demands of the rural movements converging across South Asia. Ahilan Kadirgamar is a Senior Lecturer, University of Jaffna.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Tax policy in trying times||The word ‘lockdown’, which is Collins Dictionary’s word of the year, sums up the pain that the world underwent in 2020. As a result of the pandemic-induced lockdown, India’s GDP contracted consecutively for two quarters from April to September 2020.  Some have gained from the pandemic. India’s super rich only became richer in the first half of the year — in some instances by over three times. Between January and June, 85 new Indians were added to the list of High Networth Individuals (with a net worth of more than $50 million). While this happened, the economy was on the verge of plunging into recession. Those dealing in stock exchanges also gained. It is amazing that when the GDP is contracting, some stocks are surging to phenomenal heights. The third set of gainers comprises corporate houses, Internet service providers, laptop makers and scientists engaged in medical research. The fourth set comprises manufacturers of masks and Personal Protective Equipment. Indian dealers have taken to this new business like fish to water.  But for most of the country, the pandemic led to unemployment and an increase in poverty levels. The migrant crisis revealed how thousands struggled to make ends meet. The government intervened. Pure economics dictates a big fiscal stimulus at the time of falling GDP and unemployment. But the government chose to rely more on monetary policy like credit easing and liquidity flow. Even here, there were no cuts in rates despite the fact that the real interest rate was falling. The fiscal stimulus was provided in stages and stood at merely 2% of the GDP compared to Japan’s fiscal stimulus (21% of the GDP), Brazil’s (10%) and China’s (7%). Taxing MNCs Corporate profits have risen sharply at the expense of wages and small and medium enterprise profits. Corporate tax rates have been lowered to moderate levels but multilateral corporates have found an easy way to make big money in the time of COVID-19. Digitalisation and e-commerce have made their job simpler. The tax administration is struggling with the implementation of the equalisation levy. Non-resident e-commerce operators were brought within the scope of this levy by the Finance Act of 2000. Online sales of goods and services will be taxed at 2%. Clarity is required in implementation. The taxation of multinational corporations has become a perennial problem. The nexus rule versus residence rule haunts tax administrations in all countries where multinational corporations operate. Digital taxation has to be amended in accordance with the UN Model Convention. There is need for India to act in sync with the OECD. Canada plans to levy new taxes on foreign technology companies to increase government revenues. Tax avoidance by global web companies has become acute because of digitalisation. In the field of indirect taxes, the government has been vigorously following whether multinational companies are passing on the benefits of tax reduction to consumers. As per the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law, any reduction in the rate of tax on the supply of goods or services has to be passed on to the consumer by way of commensurate reduction in prices. Companies are prone to benefit from GST rate reduction without passing on the benefits to the end consumers. The Anti-Profiteering Rules have to be implemented vigorously wherever there is reduction in the tax rate on any commodity or service. Rewriting the tax law India’s direct tax law needs to keep pace with fast-changing events. The Finance Minister announced a new scheme of faceless assessments and faceless appeals. But at the same time, the dispute resolution mechanism needs change. The International Court of Arbitration ruled that the Indian government’s move to seek taxes from Vodafone using retrospective legislation was against the fairness principle. It is necessary that a mechanism is found to negotiate a settlement through mediation and conciliation or, if necessary, arbitration in connection with tax disputes between the tax-paying companies and the Central Board of Direct Taxes. The Income Tax Act was framed in 1961. It has been amended several times. The government constituted the Akhilesh Ranjan Task Force to rewrite the Income Tax Act. The report is with the government but has not yet been made public. Our archaic laws should be modernised and made compatible with international tax laws. If the report had been made public, we would have had the time to discuss it. There is little time now to implement the recommendations of the Committee during the Budget session. The sooner the report is made public, the better. T.C.A. Ramanujam is a former Chief Commissioner of Income Tax. T.C.A.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Divided States of America||The Electoral College is expected to ratify Joe Biden’s election to the U.S. presidency on Monday. However, this is unlikely to end the sordid episode initiated by President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the result that has polarised the nation even further while eroding its democratic ethos. Mr. Trump’s legal team and his Republican supporters filed close to 60 petitions demanding that results in the battleground States be declared null and void. Each of these petitions was thrown out but that did not deter Mr. Trump from continuing to fantasise that he had won the election but was deprived of victory as a result of fraud. Matters came to a head last Friday after the Supreme Court summarily dismissed a petition by the Texas Attorney General supported by 17 other Republican States asking for an emergency order to invalidate the ballots of millions of voters in four battleground States — Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Following the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision Mr. Trump tweeted: “The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!” Reaction from some of his supporters, encouraged by his defiant posture, was more extreme. For the first time since the Civil War there was a call that bordered on secession. The chairman of the Texas Republican Party declared, “Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution.” What is equally worrisome is the attitude of the Republican leadership, including the large majority of Republican Senators and members of the House, most of whom have gone along with Mr. Trump’s self-delusional stance despite clear evidence, including from Mr. Trump’s Justice Department, to the contrary. A perilous game This an extremely perilous game as it panders to the basest instincts of Mr. Trump’s far-right supporters, many of them white supremacists, who have been out on the streets protesting against the “stolen election”. Some cities, such as Washington, D.C., and Olympia, Washington, have witnessed violence generated by these elements. What is more dangerous is the perception among a large majority of Republican voters that Mr. Biden’s victory was fraudulent. Surveys show that around 40% of Americans believe this baseless conspiracy. This is likely to encourage Republican Senators to put every possible obstacle in the path of Mr. Biden’s legislative agenda as well as hold up ratification of his cabinet nominees. Fear of the white population There are many reasons for this stark division among the American people. President Trump’s nihilistic rhetoric is one. But Mr. Trump’s claims have only accentuated a division whose main cause has little to do with economics or political ideology and much to do with race. It reflects the insecurity of the white population. Whites constituted about 73% of the total in 2017. But if one excludes the Hispanic whites, most of whom identify as Latinos rather than whites, this ratio falls to 60.7% of the population. It is expected to fall below 50% by 2045 as a result of immigration and low birth rates. The anti-immigration attitude of many Republicans is a product of this fear of whites becoming a numerical minority, a feeling that Mr. Trump shares as depicted by his virulent anti-immigrant attitude. The election of President Barack Obama and now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has increased the apprehension that white Americans are being deprived of their patrimony. The support for Mr. Trump’s fabricated claims is largely a product of the anxiety that the U.S. is changing ‘colour’. In this sense it is a rerun of the scenario preceding the Civil War of the 1860s. One of the main drivers of that was the emancipation of black slaves that was seen as threatening white privilege. One fervently hopes history will not repeat itself either as tragedy or as farce.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Eastern disquiet||It is now disconcertingly clear that the Assembly election in West Bengal in early 2021 will be one of the fiercest political combats in the history of India. A spectre of violence is being foretold in a series of murders and clashes in recent weeks. With the ruling party at the Centre, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), determined to displace the party in power in the State, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC), which is equally determined to guard its reign, governments are also being drawn into a partisan conduct. According to one report, more than 50 political murders have taken place in the State since the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when the BJP made deep inroads by winning 18 of its 42 seats. Limited to west and north India in its early stages of growth, the BJP has adopted an ‘act east’ policy to reinforce its dominance since 2014. Having won Assam in 2016 and gaining a foothold in several northeastern States, the party has set its eyes on West Bengal this year. It is pouring resources and deploying personnel with alacrity. The party’s impressive performance in the neighbouring State of Bihar recently has added further tailwind to the BJP’s eastward foray. The party’s 2019 advances were largely among Hindu migrants from what is today Bangladesh. The controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act is now a key plank of the BJP. The AITMC that replaced the Left Front which had been in power for 34 years until 2011 is staring at a crisis now. It was successful in mobilising the resentment against the Left, but failed to buttress itself with an alternative governance and political agenda. The Left has joined the Congress in the margins, and it will be a contest between the aggressive Hindutva agenda of the BJP, and the incoherence of the AITMC which is often seen as indulgence of Muslim communal politics, in West Bengal. The police have been ineffective against violent activists of the ruling party. The recent mob attack on the convoy of BJP president J.P. Nadda marked a deterioration in the law and order situation. The BJP has responded by roping in the Governor and the Union Home Ministry, which has sought to attach three IPS officers without clearance from the State government. The State government has since refused to relieve them for Central deputation. The battle between AITMC and the BJP should not become a tussle between the Centre and State. The role of the Election Commission will also be under scrutiny in the coming days once it announces the schedule for the election. Governments and constitutional functionaries must stay above the fray, regardless of the high stakes parties might be playing for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/eastern-disquiet/article33332471.ece
15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Green over brown||India asserted at the virtual Climate Ambition Summit, co-convened by the UN to mark five years of the Paris Agreement, that it is well on its way to not just fulfilling its national pledge on emissions reduction, but exceeding the commitment. The performance, outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, rests primarily on the estimated present reduction of emissions intensity by 21% over 2005 levels (the goal is between 33% and 35% of GDP by 2030), and the twin pillars of renewable energy and higher forest cover. Indeed, the Emissions Gap Report 2020 of the UNEP includes India among nine G20 members who are on track to achieve their unconditional commitments under the Paris pact, based on pre-COVID-19 projections. Significantly, the G20 bloc as a whole, responsible for 78% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), was not expected to meet its pledges, but some countries and the EU as a group announced higher ambition at the summit. The brief reduction in global GHG emissions brought about by the pandemic has given all countries an opportunity to review their development trajectories. The unprecedented event has enabled them to deploy an extraordinary fiscal stimulus for rehabilitation of economies — estimated at $12 trillion globally — making green growth a possibility. India faces a particular challenge, in moving its pandemic rehabilitation spending away from traditional brown sector policies aligned with fossil fuel use to green territory. At the recent summit, Mr. Modi took credit for expansion of forests, which, according to the national pledge under the Paris Agreement, will serve as a carbon sink of 2.5 bn to 3 bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. This is a key goal, given that it has multiple benefits, protecting biodiversity, influencing the climate system and providing resources for communities. But it is fraught with uncertainty. The Centre has questioned the veracity of State afforestation data and said only a fourth of the claims they made were deemed credible. Clearly, without a cohesive policy on verifiable afforestation, the carbon sink approach may yield poor dividends, with questions hanging over the spending. Achieving 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity within the overall renewables goal, from 36 GW now, needs a steep scale-up that must actively promote rooftop solar installations. There is little evidence that this is a high priority for most States. Transport-related emissions, which are a major component of the whole, have risen sharply in the unlock phase of the pandemic as people prefer personal vehicles, but the issue received little support from States which failed to reorder cities for cycling and pedestrianisation. Large-scale agriculture insurance against climate disasters also needs attention. In the year that remains before countries meet at the UN Climate Change conference in Glasgow in 2021, India needs to focus on future emissions and plan green investments that qualify for global climate funding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/green-over-brown/article33332472.ece

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||A concrete B.B.C. proposal||The Deputy External Affairs Minister, Mr. Surendra Pal Singh, made it clear in the Lok Sabha to-day [New Delhi, Dec. 14] that there was no question of allowing the British Broadcasting Corporation to reopen its office in India until the B.B.C. authorities came up with some “concrete” proposal. The B.B.C. authorities had raised the question of the Government allowing it to reopen its office during the visit to London of the Minister of State for Information, Mr. I.K. Gujral. Mr. Gujral had suggested the B.B.C. making a proposal in this regard. Mr. Surendra Pal Singh defended the Government action in ordering the closure of the B.B.C. office in India because of its continued “anti-India stance”. Showing of the Louis Malle film on India by the B.B.C. despite Indian protests was not the only reason. It came as a climax to the anti-Indian slant in the B.B.C. broadcasts even before, he told Mr. Mehta Lal Meena and others. The Deputy Minister also confirmed reports that the B.B.C. had asked permission to send a correspondent to cover the British Prime Minister’s forthcoming official visit to India. The Government of India did not agree to the nomination of a particular individual against whom there were some complaints. It had no objection if another person was suggested by the B.B.C., he said in reply to Mr. A.B. Vajpayee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-concrete-bbc-proposal/article33332483.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||CII urges Centre to disinvest aggressively, monetise assets||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to look at fiscal management from a three-year perspective, as complete recovery was expected only in FY22. In its recommendations for the Union Budget, it has also suggested aggressive disinvestment, including bringing down stake in majority public sector banks (PSBs) to below 50%, as well as monetisation of assets. The industry association submitted its recommendations to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday. “CII has suggested that the Budget proposals should focus on growth, and alongside, look at fiscal management from a three-year perspective. “Aggressive disinvestment and monetisation of assets can augment government revenues at a time when tax revenues have fallen sharply,” Uday Kotak, president, CII, said. He added that the Centre should prioritise expenditure in three areas — infrastructure, healthcare and sustainability — and that the Budget proposals should address critical areas of boosting private investments and providing support for employment generation. The representative body has suggested that healthcare expenditure be increased to 3% of the GDP over three years. “Achieving the vision of India being a $5-trillion economy is contingent on having a strong financial sector. Government should bring down its stake in PSBs to below 50% through the market route, over the next 12 months, except for 3-4 large PSBs such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank,” he said, adding that there was a need to create government-owned, professionally managed Development Finance Institutions to finance key sectors of the economy. The CII said that to raise revenues, the government should consider aggressive disinvestment of both loss-making and a few profit-making PSUs, given the capital markets were performing well. In addition, sale or lease of government surplus land should be considered. To boost private investments, he has sought a stable tax regime, stability of long-term interest rates at current levels and ensuring sanctity of contracts for government entities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cii-urges-centre-to-disinvest-aggressively-monetise-assets/article33332459.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Discretionary spending set for uptick: survey||About 48% consumers plan to spend a minimum of Rs. 1,000, going up to Rs. 50,000, on purchasing discretionary products in the next four months, according to a survey by LocalCircles. The bi-annual ‘Mood of the Consumer Survey’ received more than 44,000 responses from consumers in 302 districts of India with 55% respondents from tier 1 cities, 26% from tier 2 cities, and 19% from tier 3 and tier 4 cities and rural districts. As per the survey, while 10% households plan to spend over Rs. 50,000 on discretionary purchases in the next four months, 21% households plan to spend between Rs. 10,000-Rs. 50,000. “This would mean good news for many sectors of the economy that saw slowdown in consumer demand in the first six months of FY21,” said the company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/discretionary-spending-set-for-uptick-survey/article33332454.ece
15 December 2020||MUMBAI,||Crisil narrows FY21 GDP shrinkage estimate to 7.7%||Crisil has re-adjusted India’s fiscal 2021 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to contraction of 7.7% compared with a contraction of 9% forecast in September. This was on account of a faster-than-expected revival in activity in the second quarter, that continued into the festive season. A consistent decline in overall COVID-19 case load also aided the revision. “This is not to say that we read a conclusive recovery from here,” said Crisil. “On the contrary, some indicators point to a moderating momentum of late. The rise in inflation is also a nagging source of concern, constraining recovery. “And, the pandemic is far from over. Our forecast for fiscal 2021, thus remains predicated on the pandemic’s trajectory and importantly, what the government does to stimulate a well-rounded recovery in the coming months,” it added. “Inadequate fiscal spending, however, remains a constraint, while the possibility of a second wave of afflictions, uncertainty regarding availability of vaccine, and hiccups in global economic revival due to resurgence of cases, call for caution,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/crisil-narrows-fy21-gdp-shrinkage-estimate-to-77/article33332457.ece
15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Fuel demand drops 3.6% year-on-year in November||India’s fuel demand fell 3.6% year-on-year in November, reversing the return to normal consumption levels attained in the previous month. Total demand for petroleum products in November fell to 17.83 million tonnes from 18.51 million tonnes a year earlier, provisional data published by the Oil Ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell showed. Fuel consumption, however, posted a month-on-month increase for the third straight month, helped by reviving transportation and business activity. India consumed 17.75 million tonnes in October — the month in which fuel demand posted its first yearly increase since February as a spurt in diesel demand ahead of the festival season pushed consumption to pre-COVID-19 levels. In October, demand for petroleum products rose 2.5% compared with the year earlier period. While petrol had reached pre-COVID-19 levels in September itself, diesel consumption returned to normal in October. However, its demand fell again in November. Diesel demand, which had soared 7.4% year-on-year in October, dropped 6.9% in November to 7.04 million tonnes. Month-on-month, the demand slightly improved from 6.99 million tonnes. Fuel demand had slumped by 49% in April after a nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, shut industries and took most vehicles off-road. The 69-day nationwide lockdown was followed by local and State-level restrictions. Restrictions have eased only slowly and in phases, while localised restrictions in containment zones remain.  Festive season trend The onset of the festive season has fuelled a rise in consumption, but public transport has not returned to normal levels yet as schools and educational institutions continue to remain shut in most parts of the country. Demand for naphtha, which is used as industrial fuel for generating electricity as well as producing petrochemicals, surged 7.7% to 1.3 million tonnes in November.  This, together with a rise in other industrial fuels such as fuel oil, indicates the return of economic activity. Also, consumption of bitumen, used in road construction, jumped by 18% to 6,92,000 tonnes. LPG, the only fuel that showed growth even during the lockdown period on the back of the government giving free cooking gas to the poor, rose 4% to 2.3 million tonnes. But month-on-month, it posted a 2.8% fall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fuel-demand-drops-36-year-on-year-in-november/article33332469.ece

Bobde came when submissions were made by senior advocate C.A. Sundaram, for Cyrus Investments, about Ratan Tata’s ‘personal interest’ to have taxi aggregators use Tata cars. “What is wrong in head of family wanting information or wanting to control decisions?” the CJI asked.

15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Telcos spar over port-out charge by Jio||Reliance Jio has sought action against rivals Airtel and Vi, alleging that the two telcos were encouraging the public to migrate from Jio to show support for farmers by spreading ‘frivolous rumours’. In its letter dated December 10 to regulator TRAI, Jio had alleged that the two companies were either directly or indirectly involved in “supporting and furthering the insinuations and false and frivolous rumours of Reliance being an undue beneficiary of the farm bills”. The company added that this had resulted in its receiving a “large number of port out” requests from customers citing “this as the sole reason for porting out of Jio without having any complaints or other issues related to Jio services”. Airtel, in its reply to TRAI, refuted Jio’s allegations and said it had operated in the industry for 25 years. “During this period, we have competed hard... and striven to serve our customers with excellence. At the same time, we take great pride in treating our competitors and partners with respect.” “The current complaint deserves to be dismissed and thrown out with the contempt that it deserves. It is in poor taste and is scurrilous, to say the least,” it added. Vi, in a statement, termed Jio’s charge as ‘baseless’ and said it was intended to “malign our reputation.” “We strongly refute such irresponsible comments on us,” the telco added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/telcos-spar-over-farmer-protests/article33332455.ece

15 December 2020||MUMBAI,||Pick Gill over Shaw for Adelaide Test, say Border and Gavaskar||With two days remaining for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to begin, both India and Australia are far from certain about some of the key batting slots. But the two legends after whom the trophy for the Test series is named were unequivocal about their choice for Mayank Agarwal's opening partner. “I’ve been in Sydney watching your boys run around against Australia-A. I was impressed with [Shubman] Gill. I really think he has got something about him. I know he is young, so he is bound to play a few rash shots here and there, but he looks a seriously good player, this kid. He’ll be my pick out of the guys I saw,” Allan Border said on Monday in a virtual chat with Sunil Gavaskar ahead of the series-opener starting Thursday. “I know you guys have got big raps on [Prithvi] Shaw. It seems to me he plays a shot a ball against the new ball. It looks good on flat tracks, but in Australia, you’ve got to be a little bit more watchful about your shot selection. He seems a little bit loose outside the off-stump. If I am the Indian selector, I would be looking very closely at young Gill.” Gavaskar agreed with Border on both counts: picking Gill ahead of Shaw and Shaw playing too many strokes for an opener. “He [Shaw] has got to spend a little more time assessing... because as an opening batsman, you’ve got to give yourself a little more time to see what the pitch is doing, what the bowlers are doing,” Gavaskar said. “Trying to bat the way he’s batting at the moment is not going to make him a consistent player. Yes, he’ll score runs once in a while but to do that consistently, he has got to tighten his defence. I agree with AB that he is playing far too many shots at the start of the innings.” As for the other selection issue India’s team management is faced with, Gavaskar voted in favour of Rishabh Pant over Wriddhiman Saha. “Rishabh played in all the four Test matches two years ago and he also got a hundred in the tour game. He seems to have got under the skin of some of the Australian players with his chirping behind the stumps. I guess the team will probably look to have him. Of course, when you have just come off a hundred a few days earlier, he would be the choice of the management, I think,” he said. Pant at No. 6 “With uncertainty at the top, I think they would like to strengthen their batting and I think Rishabh Pant will play. I am hoping he plays at 6, that will allow you to pick five bowlers to try and pick 20 Australian wickets.”  Watch the first Test from 8:30 a.m. on December 17, Live on Sony Six, Sony Ten 1 and Sony Ten 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pick-gill-over-shaw-for-adelaide-test-say-border-and-gavaskar/article33332571.ece
15 December 2020||London,||Messi bails out Barca||Lionel Messi saved Barcelona from another embarrassing result by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 win over lowly Levante. Messi struck with 14 minutes remaining of a lacklustre display from Barca at the Camp Nou which will do little to ease fan fears following the 3-0 hammering at the hands of Juventus midweek. Ronald Koeman’s side is still way off the pace in the title race, nine points behind leader Real Sociedad. Games in hand Barcelona does, however, have two games in hand on the Basque outfit. Liverpool remains tied at the top of the Premier League with Tottenham after being held to a 1-1 draw at Fulham, while Pierre-Emerick Aubamyeng’s own goal condemned Arsenal to another shocking home defeat, going down 1-0 to Burnley on Sunday. Leicester took advantage of slip ups by the top two to close to within one point of the leaders as James Maddison scored twice in a 3-0 rout over Brighton. Liverpool and Tottenham — which was held by Crystal Palace earlier — face each other at Anfield on Wednesday in a top drawer contest. The champion needed a Mohamed Salah penalty 11 minutes from time to avoid an embarrassing defeat at Fulham after a dreadful first-half performance left Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp seething on the touchline. “We needed half an hour to get our feet in the game, that’s why I shouted a bit at them,” said Klopp. “I think in the first half an hour we could have lost the game, in the last 60 minutes we should have won it. In the end we get a point and that’s it.” Bobby DeCordova-Reid’s thunderous finish into the far corner to take the lead was no more than Scott Parker’s side deserved as the returning Alisson Becker kept Liverpool in the game before the break. Liverpool dominated the second-half to pin Fulham back, but needed a penalty to salvage a point when Aboubakar Kamara was penalised for handling Georginio Wijnaldum’s free-kick. Salah penalty Salah slammed the penalty low and just beyond the grasp of Alphonse Areola, but Fulham comfortably saw out the final 10 minutes to the delight of 2,000 fans at Craven Cottage. At the other end of the table, Arsenal is now just five points above the relegation zone after a self-inflicted defeat to Burnley. Granit Xhaka’s needless red card for grabbing Ashley Westwood by the throat turned the game in Burnley’s favour before Aubameyang flicked Westwood’s corner into his own net 17 minutes from time. Power performance Leicester edged out Southampton for the performance of the weekend as the Foxes blew Brighton away inside 45 minutes at the King Power. Cristiano Ronaldo marked his 100th game for Juventus with a pair of penalties in a 3-1 success over Genoa on Sunday, as the champion closed the gap on Serie A leader AC Milan which was held at home against Parma. French defender Theo Hernandez’s brace rescued a point at the death for AC Milan, which came from two goals down to draw 2-2 in the San Siro. Ronaldo, 35, joins 39-year-old Ibrahimovic as leading scorer in Serie A with 10 goals this season, for a total of 79 since joining Juventus in 2018.  The results:   Premier League: Fulham 1 (De Cordova-Reid 25) drew with Liverpool 1 (Salah 79-pen); Arsenal 0 lost to Burnley 1 (Aubameyang 73-og); Leicester 3 (Maddison 27, 44, Vardy 41) bt Brighton 0.   LaLiga: Real Betis 1 (Ruibal 51) drew with Villarreal 1 (Pau Torres 5); Elche 0 lost to Granada 1 (Suarez 42); Barcelona 1 (Messi 76) bt Levante 0.

Bundesliga: Augsburg 2 (Serdar 32-og, Richter 90+3) drew with Schalke 2 (Raman 52, Boujellab 61); Bayer Leverkusen 4 (Bailey 4, 27, Wirtz 55, Alario 90+1) bt Hoffenheim 1 (Baumgartner 50).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-bails-out-barca/article33332621.ece
15 December 2020||Chennai,||Did India miss a trick by not retaining Hardik?||The Indian think-tank might have missed a trick when Hardik Pandya flew back home after the conclusion of the limited-over leg of the Australian tour. Game-changers come rare and the 27-year-old Hardik is one. Hugely influential in the ODIs and T20Is with his visceral batting — his unbeaten 92 in the Canberra ODI also revealed his growing maturity — Hardik could have added value to the Test line-up. Even if he is able to bowl only a handful of overs, someone such as Hardik could have been an X-factor with his batting alone. Dangerous customer The dangerous No. 6 or 7 is one the bowlers are wary of, after denting much of the top and the middle-order. Hardik could have waded into them with strokes of thunder much like he did when India was reeling at 92 for six in Cape Town during India’s last Test tour of South Africa. An inspired Hardik tore into the South African pace attack with his blistering 93, surfacing at No. 7. And India reached a combative 209 on a spicy pitch. His unbeaten 52 on a seaming Nottingham surface against England was valuable too. Even when he is able to bowl little owing to fitness concerns, a case can be made to look at the wiry Hardik as a pure, high-octane lower middle-order batsman who can swing games with his bat-speed, reflexes and an improving defence. Familiar role Australians are familiar with someone like Hardik in their Test line-up. The big and strong Andrew Symonds was initially looked upon as a ODI cricketer but made a name for himself as a Test player with his attacking batsmanship at No. 6 or 7. He would go hard against a tiring bunch of bowlers. Although he could send down a few overs of off-spin, the Aussies kept Symonds in the Test line-up principally because of his shock value as an explosive batsman. His 156 against old enemy England in the Melbourne Test of 2006 was a resounding, match-winning effort. And Australia was in trouble at 121 for five when Symonds’ counter-attacking 162 — he rallied with the tail — catapulted the host to 463 at the expense of the Indian attack in Sydney, 2008. In attitude and spirit, Symonds and Hardik are similar cricketers. Match-winners whom the adversaries fear. The Indians could have kept Hardik in the Test squad down under. Undiluted aggression can scatter game-plans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/did-india-miss-a-trick-by-not-retaining-hardik/article33332562.ece

15 December 2020||ABU DHABI,||Vettel bids a musical adieu to Ferrari||Sebastian Vettel retained his composure and departed with a song in his final race for Ferrari at Sunday’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The four-time world champion German finished 14th, one place behind his team-mate Charles Leclerc, to conclude his worst season with the Italian team. “Nothing about today should get mentioned,” he said, when asked to sum up his feelings after six years as a Ferrari driver. “It was quite a bad race for us. We tried everything.” Guard of honour Before the race, the team gave Vettel a guard of honour as he walked to his car from the garage to the pit lane. In the race, his team-mate Leclerc wore a racing helmet that carried a special ‘Danke Seb’ message. On his final lap, slowing down round the Yas Marina Circuit, he surprised many by singing an Italian song about Ferrari on the team radio system. It was broadcast around the world. And after the race, he was presented with an enormous trophy by the team he represented and for whom he won 14 races. “For sure, it was an emotional day with the mechanics waving goodbye on the grid,” he said. “I felt there was a different dynamic. I am sad for the guys. I will miss them, but I’m happy to embark on a new journey.” Vettel is set to join Racing Point next season when they are re-branded as Aston Martin, replacing departing Mexican Sergio Perez alongside Lance Stroll, son of team owner Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vettel-bids-a-musical-adieu-to-ferrari/article33332769.ece
15 December 2020||Chennai,||Daruvala optimistic after ‘season of two halves’||After a troubled start to his rookie season in the Formula 2 championship, India’s Jehan Daruvala finished on a high with a win in the final race in Bahrain last week. Speaking to The Hindu , Daruvala said, “It was a difficult season with two halves. The first half was very difficult with bad starts but to finish the second half of the season strongly with a podium and win meant a lot.” After three rounds (six races) in the season’s first half without points, Daruvala managed to become a regular points-contender in the last five rounds, failing to score only twice, as he finished 12th in the overall standings. Explaining his early struggles, Daruvala said, “After the pre-season, I just wasn’t on top of stuff, especially with the start procedure. So I worked hard at the factory to nail a simple procedure rather than trying to get exceptional starts, and it worked.” The 22-year-old also had issues with his engine, leaving him with a significant power handicap in the first half of the season, especially in places with long straights like Spa and Monza. “After the first race in Monza, we finally changed the engine and since then things began to fall in place,” Daruvala added. The Indian, who was selected by the former Force India team as a part of its talent hunt programme back in 2011, is now planning for a second season in F2 and hopes to build on the momentum. While he has not finalised his team for next year, he topped the timings on two out of three days in the post-season test in Bahrain with his current team, Carlin Racing. Daruvala signed off, saying, “Testing went very well, and I have learned from this year on things like tyre management and starts. My target next year is to do what I did in F3 in 2019, where I finished third and fought for the title till the last race.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/daruvala-optimistic-after-season-of-two-halves/article33332568.ece
15 December 2020||Milan,||AC Milan will look to extend its lead over the chasing pack||Zlatan Ibrahimovic is poised to return from injury as AC Milan looks to extend its lead at the top of the Serie A table at lowly Genoa on Wednesday. Ibrahimovic has missed his side’s last three games but is still joint top scorer in Serie A alongside Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus with 10 goals each. Milan has held firm despite the towering Swede’s absence with two wins and a comeback draw last weekend against Parma when two goals from Theo Harnandez rescued a point. Stefano Pioli’s Milan saw its lead cut to three points on city rival Inter Milan, with third-placed Napoli a further point back before their head-to-head in the San Siro. Stiff test Champion Juventus, in fourth position equal on points with Napoli, faces a stiff test at home against Atalanta, which lies eighth but has a game in hand. Milan’s opponents Genoa lost to Juventus at home last weekend and is second from bottom of the league with just six points from 11 games. Main objective Inter finished last in its Champions League group, meaning it even missed out on a consolation place in the Europa League. So a first Serie A title since 2010 is now its main objective this season. But Antonio Conte’s Inter side has frequently had to come from behind this season and has picked up more points from losing positions than any other team. “Having the strength to turn it around shows that the boys want to fight and won’t give up in the face of trouble,” said Conte.  Sassuolo, a point behind Juventus, will be looking to keep in touch with the leader at struggling Fiorentina, having dropped down to fifth. Promoted Benevento hosts Lazio on Tuesday in a first clash between Italian coaching brothers Simone and Filippo Inzaghi. Filippo, 47, led Benevento back into Serie A this season, and will lock horns with younger brother Simone, 44, whose Lazio challenged for the Scudetto last season. Furious Lazio was furious after falling 2-1 at home against Hellas Verona last weekend, days after qualifying for the Champions League last 16 for the first time in two decades. “We are angry and disappointed,” said Simone whose side is ninth in the table, four points off the European berths. “We will try to make up for it on Tuesday against Benevento.” Lazio has the unenviable task of facing holder Bayern Munich in that Champions League last 16. Sixth-placed Roma hosts Torino on Thursday, having returned to the European qualification places after a thumping 5-1 win over Bologna. Torino headed straight into a training retreat on Sunday after its eighth game without a win, with the pressure mounting on coach Marco Giampaolo whose side languish in the relegation zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ac-milan-will-look-to-extend-its-lead-over-the-chasing-pack/article33332780.ece

15 December 2020||Kolkata,||We needed to get back on track: Nieva||As the Indian boxing team is looking forward to competing in the Cologne World Cup from December 17 during an extended European tour, high performance director Santiago Nieva feels the exposure has given the boxers certain advantage. Nieva listed positives of the tour, which included a 52-day trip to Italy and France. Good sparring “It was very important for us to get out of Patiala and get some different sparring. We had good sparring in Italy. We went to a competition, the first since the Olympic qualifiers (in March), in France. We had another competition in Milan. “We needed to get back on track and test ourselves with boxers of different styles. This was crucial for our Olympics preparation because in India we obviously had limited (scope)... I think we are ahead of other countries in our international schedule,” Nieva told The Hindu . Tough Living in a bio-bubble was tough for the boxers. “We would have liked to go for some sightseeing to Rome or Venice. But we are on a mission for the Olympics and cannot risk ourselves.” Nieva favoured extending the tour for the Cologne World Cup, also known as Chemistry Cup. “Chemistry Cup was initially scheduled in October. Then Germany had COVID-19 problems. They postponed it, gave us an invitation. When we evaluated, we realised it was worth extending our trip for two more weeks. “It will not be as strong as other years when Cuba and the USA were there. But there are strong European countries like Germany, France and Great Britain. There are no super strong competitions in the world right now.” After this, the boxers will take a two-week break before resuming training ahead of other international activities. “All this experience will help us in January and February. It was important to have good training, sparring and competitions. The alternative would have been much worse for us,” said Nieva.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-needed-to-get-back-on-track-nieva/article33332771.ece
15 December 2020||WELLINGTON,||New Zealand completes another innings win||New Zealand wrapped up an emphatic 2-0 sweep against the West Indies with a comprehensive innings and 12-run victory in the second Test here on Monday. The series win made New Zealand advance a step closer to making the World Test Championship (WTC) final as it overtook England to move into third behind Australia and India. It also lifted the Black Caps to be equal with Australia at the top of the World Test rankings and extended their unbeaten home run to 15 Tests. After losing the first Test by an innings and 134 runs, and being rolled for 131 in the first innings here, the West Indies saved its best for its final bat on tour, scoring 317 in the second innings. The tourists resumed the day at 244 for six, needing a further 85 runs to make New Zealand bat again. After a 20-minute rain delay, the host needed just over 13 overs to take the remaining wickets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/new-zealand-completes-another-innings-win/article33332565.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Azad eyes selector’s post||Former India all-rounder Kirti Azad has jumped into Delhi cricket in the role of a prospective State selector. The new regime at the Delhi and District Cricket Association, under the new president Rohan Jaitley, had invited applications to the post of three State selectors and coaches. Azad is among many former players who have applied. A former National selector, Azad ventured into politics at the cost of cricket. “It was not that I did not have time for cricket but politics kept me busy. It would not have been fair for me to hog a post (at DDCA) and not do justice,” said Azad. An issue at DDCA Azad is now keen to help this generation. “I am comfortable doing the job of a selector. I have the time and the experience to watch the youngsters. Selection (in all age groups) has always been an issue at DDCA and I know this area needs immediate attention,” he added. The three-member Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of Atul Wassan, Robin Singh (Jr) and Parvinder Awana will conduct the interviews of the candidates. Among those who have applied for the senior selector’s job are K.P. Bhaskar, who was the coach of the Ranji Trophy team two seasons ago when Delhi reached the final, Bantu Singh, Gursharan Singh, Ashu Dani and Karun Dubey. Prabhakar for coach’s job Former India all-rounder Manoj Prabhakar, also a former Delhi and Uttar Pradesh coach, is among those who will be interviewed for the senior coach’s position. Others in the fray are Raj Kumar Sharma, Gursharan Singh and V. Arvind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/azad-eyes-selectors-post/article33332810.ece
15 December 2020||London,||Players must take the blame, says Arsenal’s Tierney||Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney says the players must take responsibility for the club's “terrible” form after the Gunners lost a fourth home Premier League game in a row. Burnley recorded its first-ever win at the Emirates on Sunday as a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang own goal secured a 1-0 victory for the visitors after Granit Xhaka was sent off for the hosts. The result leaves Mikel Arteta's side just five points clear of the relegation zone and without a Premier League win since November 1. It is the first time since 1959 that Arsenal has suffered four home league defeats in succession — it hosts Southampton on Wednesday looking to get back to winning ways. Results must improve The current run has left it languishing in 15th place in the table and Tierney knows that results have to improve. “It's not good enough,” he said. “There is no way to disguise it. It's terrible, to be honest. It's not what we are, not where we are as a club. “It's not what the fans deserve, it's not what the manager deserves, it's not what the board deserves. It's us players that need to take responsibility for this. “It's on us and nobody else. We have got a great manager and we believe in him 100%. The blame is on us, nobody else.” Burnley had never even led a Premier League game against Arsenal but picked up a second win of the campaign to move out of the bottom three. Feel good factor “There's a feel-good factor about the place now,” said Burnley’s England defender James Tarkowski. “I know we're still low down in the table but that's not too concerning. We've been close a few years to nicking a result here, but I felt we did what we needed to do.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/players-must-take-the-blame-says-arsenals-tierney/article33332778.ece

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Penance for progeny||When Dasaratha performed the putrakameshti yaga, in order to beget sons, a divine being emerged from the sacrificial fire, with a golden pot of porridge in his hands. The divine person instructed Dasaratha to give the porridge to his wives. Since Kausalya was the chief queen, Dasaratha gave her half of the contents of the pot. Of the remaining, he gave half to Sumitra. That is, he gave her one-fourth of the contents of the pot. Of the remaining one fourth, he gave one-eighth to Kaikeyi and one eighth to Sumitra. Dasaratha was blessed with four sons, Rama being the eldest. Here we have one king Dasaratha doing tapas for progeny and being blessed with four sons. How is four significant in the context of the Krishna avatara? Vasudeva and Devaki did tapas for a son. So did Nandagopa and Yasoda. So, here we have two sets of parents doing tapas for a child, and all four are blessed with the same child — Krishna, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. Whether as Rama or as Krishna, the Lord experienced the problematic life we have on earth. He chose to face problems, and showed how to keep to the dharmic path, in spite of everything. In the Krishna avatara, He was in Devaki’s womb for twelve months. The normal gestation period for a human baby is only ten months. But the Lord lived in the cramped space of a woman’s womb for an extra two months. All this He undertook of His own accord. None of His avataras is due to karma. In the Ramayana also, we find that He chose Dasaratha as His father, before the avatara began. The whole of Vishnu Sahasranama is about Krishna, although individual names are interpreted differently. Bhishma is on his bed of arrows, awaiting death. He says that the highest dharma in the world is Lord Krishna Himself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/penance-for-progeny/article33332561.ece

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||10-man JFC holds MCFC||Two goals from foreigners, two assists from Indians and one point for each team — that’s how Mumbai City FC’s (MCFC) 1-1 draw with Jamshedpur FC (JFC) played out in the Indian Super League (ISL) on Monday. The result saw MCFC remain on top of the table with 13 points from six games, while JFC moved to sixth with seven points. JFC’s ace striker Nerijus Valsksis gave his side a dream start, breaking the deadlock in the ninth minute. Bartholomew Ogbeche played a poor backpass that was intercepted by Jackichand Singh. The pacy winger raced into the box before laying it for Valskis, who netted his sixth goal of the season with a powerful low finish. Ogbeche, however, made amends by scoring the equaliser six minutes later. The Nigerian striker side-footed Bipin Singh’s pass to restore parity. MCFC saw more of the ball, with nearly 70% possession around the 20th-minute mark, but was unable to settle down owing to JFC’s relentless high press. Things seemed to be working as per plan for Owen Coyle’s side until disaster struck in the 28th minute when Aitor Monroy was sent off for a second yellow card.  JFC’s defensive duo of Peter Hartley and Stephen Eze did exceptionally well to contain the lethal MCFC attack.  The result: Mumbai City FC 1 (Ogbeche 15) drew with Jamshedpur FC 1 (Valskis 9) .   Tuesday’s match: Hyderabad FC vs SC East Bengal, 7.30 p.m .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/10-man-jfc-holds-mcfc/article33332618.ece

15 December 2020||HYDERABAD:,||HCA A-Div League to start tomorrow||Hyderabad Cricket Association will organise the A-Division three-day league cricket championship from December 16, according to Naresh Sharma, joint-secretary. Naresh told The Hindu that in the first round 10 teams will play at Gymkhana, NFC, Uppal, ECIL and DMRC Grounds here. “Once we get the other two main grounds — AOC and Railways — and some more teams complete the formalities of submitting relevant documents including COVID-19 negative reports, the other teams too will be in action,” he said.

15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Ring in the cheer, online||The voices of singers, sound of violins and melody of flutes rise in harmony. With Christmas approaching, Festival Choristers, a group of nearly 40 singers and instrumentalists drawn from different faiths, ages and walks of life in Hyderabad will be ringing in the Yuletide spirit virtually on December 15. “We were not able to meet and rehearse due to the pandemic; the virtual concert will have the past recordings by Choristers and we hope to have a wider reach,” says chorister Aruna Bahuguna, a former IPS officer. The concert will have two sections — songs selected from earlier performances of Festival Choristers and a performance by the junior choir. Aruna says, “We used to end the concert with ‘Let There be Peace’. We have selected pieces to represent each conductor and want to keep the list of selected songs a surprise.” The one-hour performance will have a range of western classical (Mozart and George Frederic Handel), semi-classical, modern (John Rutter) as well as Hindi and Telugu numbers. Performance by the Festival Choristers is an integral part of Christmas celebrations in Hyderabad, spreading love, peace, and harmony through their music. The group was founded by former IAS officers Daphne de Rebello and Rachael Chatterjee along with Aruna in 2006 when a group of singers presented their first concert in Administrative Staff College. Twenty carollers used to perform at Raj Bhavan, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology or private halls to a select audience. As the audience numbers grew, the stage shifted to Ravindra Bharathi in 2007 and they started having annual concerts, both public and private. Planning for the annual concert begins in June, from selecting the music to printing sheets. A nostalgic Aruna says, “We miss the buzz; it is a huge exercise of buying matching saris for women and getting the blouses stitched; the men in the group get their shirts tailored. We’d practice at home and meet once a week for rehearsals at Vidyaranya school and exchange the joy and warmth of singing together. All these experiences made us what we are.” Deepti Moses, one of the younger team members, has taken over the managerial role of the group. Adds Aruna, “This break has given us time to introspect and appreciate what we have. When we get together next year, we will be doubly appreciative of being able to do it; we realise what we are missing now.”  The link for the Festival Choristers’ virtual concert will be uploaded on December 14 midnight on their YouTube channel and will be available for a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ring-in-the-cheer-online/article33333074.ece
15 December 2020||December 15 2020 00:00 IST,||A splash into cyberspace||“It’s my cameraman’s number that I have given on my Facebook page. Otherwise people keep calling to meet me in person!” says Abdul Sami, 34, with a laugh. The Guntur-native is getting used to attention after he started a fishing channel, Abdul Sami Fishing, one-and-a-half years ago. With over 1.5 lakh subscribers, it is now a source of income as well for Sami. The business of fishing vloggers is booming, with subscribers running into lakhs and millions. Kerala has the largest number of these vloggers, followed by Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra. “The huge Malayali presence is because of the different kinds of water bodies in the State, such as the sea, lakes, rivers, and ponds. The numbers have increased this year, post lockdown,” says Midhun Surendran from Kozhikode, who runs Mallu Angler (101K subscribers) and is the admin of a Facebook group of fishing enthusiasts. Starring the catch of the day Content is diverse and exciting, as these vloggers fish from the shore as well as do inshore and offshore fishing. Besides extensive coverage of the process, they talk about technique, give tips, and highlight features of the catch. The fish varieties generally featured in the vlogs are grouper, red snapper, rohu, catla, king fish, mangrove jack, barracuda, barramundi, sting ray, different varieties of snakehead, among others. Besides showing traditional fishing traps and speargun fishing, some vloggers demonstrate the use of ingenious bait, made using rice bran powder, chicken intestine, maida paste, and even cauliflower. Not just fishing techniques, vloggers also highlight the gear/equipment used, by posting review videos. “When I started vlogging in 2015, there weren’t many channels in Malayalam to guide me through the process. That’s why I decided to focus on gear. Now, thanks to us vloggers, fishing tackle shops are minting money,” says Midhun. These vloggers include members from the fishing community, who make videos documenting their day at sea, such as Ungal Meenavan Mookaiyur (821K subscribers) by K. Kingston from Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu, and Kadal Raasa-Fishing (173K subscribers) by D. Gandhi of Puducherry. A graphic designer and son of a fisherman, R. Desappan, Gandhi used to run YouTube channels that focussed on cinema, sports and cooking earlier. “When it came to creating original content, I couldn’t find a better option than fishing. So, for my channel, I ventured out into the sea for the first time. Videos featuring my father get more views! However, there are also vloggers who pay fishermen to shoot videos for their channels,” he says. Presentation, quality and variety go into the making of a successful channel, says Sebin Cyriac who has 1.34 million subscribers for his channel, Fishing Freaks. “It is a family affair for me. My videos often feature my 85-year-old grandmother, Rosamma Joseph, who introduced me to fishing, my parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, and their families, friends, neighbours…. One episode had 24 of us, when we travelled to Chellanam (in Kochi) a day after my elder brother’s wedding!” says Sebin, who was all set to move to Canada before vlogging changed his life. To stand out The presence of too many channels has forced vloggers to think different. “It is important to showcase something new. So I am going on a three-month fishing trip to Dubai to create novel content,” says Ahammed Bisher of Folks Channel, who just back from a four-day deep-sea fishing trip off the shore in Kozhikode. Malayali vlogger Unni George from Kumbalangi near Kochi, adds that he often looks for adventure in his videos. One of them show his encounter with an arapaima, weighing 37 kg, a strong predator he caught at a quarry in Angamaly. The fish though endemic to Amazon, is grown in commercial farms in Kerala and escaped to water bodies during the flash floods. Meanwhile, Maruthu Palanichamy (Konkan Fishing), a native of Kambam in Tamil Nadu and currently settled in Bengaluru, brings his 15-year experience into his vlogs. He stands out because he travels across the coastline to fish, covering parts of Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Karnataka. “That is why my channel is in English. Also, I use inflatable boats for fishing expeditions, which isn’t common in the angling community,” he says. Even though most vloggers present content in their mother tongue, Sami prefers to be silent: “I can speak only Hindi but my videos are watched by people across the world. So, I let the videos speak for me.” Money matters A vlogger’s revenue can run into several lakh rupees, inclusive of the amount obtained through product promotions. There is no better example than Unni. His vlog, OMKV Fishing&Cooking founded in 2018, became the means to clear his debts after a kidney transplantation. “OMKV, short form for ‘Odu Meene Kandam Vazhi’, is my life now! I couldn’t risk my health by doing heavy jobs after the transplant. So I decided to try my luck on YouTube and that clicked,” says 34-year-old Unni. However, even with sophisticated gear, there is no guarantee that you get a great video every time. Abdul Vajid of Tackle Tips explains, “One has to also understand the science behind fishing, especially about how moon, tides, weather, wind... influence fish activity. One has to be at the right place at the right time and use the right technique. Patience is the key.” A small percentage of vloggers focus on catch-and-release content. Chennai-native Om Prakash, of ‘Om is fishing’, who works with a BPO in Bengaluru, specialises in Malabar snakehead ( vaaha ), a “vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List”, found only in Kerala. “I travel to Kerala to catch the fish and unless it is gravely injured, I always release it. My purpose is to create awareness about this species. Even the angling community doesn’t know much about it. Now I also focus on cherumeen (Channa Psuedomarulius), a sub-species of bullseye snakehead,” says 38-year-old Om. Another crusader is 27-year-old Ngurang Nega from Arunachal Pradesh who creates awareness of the golden mahseer, an endangered variety, on his channel, Mahseer Fishing Arunachal Pradesh. “Even local people aren’t aware of the need to conserve the fish. So I fish for the mahseer and introduce it to the viewers before releasing it,” Nega says. Om concludes, “When you go fishing, it is also about connecting with nature. And you have a responsibility to conserve the fish stock for the future generation.”  Earn your way A vlogger can apply for monetisation to YouTube after getting 4,000 watching hours and 1,000 subscribers. Once the content is analysed for authenticity, one can start earning. “However, the revenue depends on the number of views and not on the number of subscribers. It took me three months to make $100. If the videos garner one million views a month, you get Rs. 12,000-Rs. 15,000 per month. The amount goes up if the video goes viral,” says Sebin. There are vloggers who get as high as Rs. 15 lakh per month. A basic combo pack of fishing gear costs Rs. 1,500, which is not enough to catch all varieties of fish. Reels are priced at Rs. 2,000 and up, and some high-end models cost Rs. 75,000-80,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-splash-into-cyberspace/article33333071.ece
15 December 2020||Jaipur,||Rajasthan CM condemns BJP leaders’ remarks against farmers||As the agitating farmers continued their sit-in on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday condemned the statements of the BJP leaders decrying their protest. Mr. Gehlot said the farmers’ protest was for their genuine concerns, which the NDA government at the Centre was ignoring. Mr. Gehlot demanded that the Centre find an amicable solution and address the grievances sympathetically, “instead of blaming gangs and anti-national elements for these protests”. He pointed out that the farmers had been protesting in a peaceful manner. “The farm laws that are not in the interest of the farming community must be taken back,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. In another tweet, Mr. Gehlot said it was most ironic that the farmers who fed the nation were compelled to sit on a hunger strike, because the government was not listening to their woes. “Our farmers have presented an example of peaceful agitation in front of the nation. The government must shun arrogance,” he said. A large number of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSS) members, accompanied by civil rights activists, staged a demonstration outside the district collectorate here demanding an immediate repeal of the agriculture sector laws. The protesters also raised slogans against the BJP’s attempts to defame the farmers. ‘Posters of Sharjeel’ BJP national general secretary Arun Singh said in Jaipur earlier on Monday though the farmers were innocent, some elements among them “need[ed] to be exposed”. He said the protesters were putting up the posters of individuals like Sharjeel Imam, arrested on charges of sedition during the anti-CAA protests. Mr. Singh, who is in-charge of party affairs in Rajasthan, said the farm laws had been enacted in the interest of the farmers, but the Congresswas opposing the reforms because of “political considerations”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-cm-condemns-bjp-leaders-remarks-against-farmers/article33332835.ece
15 December 2020||Bhubaneswar,||High Court exonerates man of rape charge after 30 years||The Orissa High Court has exonerated a man who was convicted of rape and sexual assault charges more than 30 years ago. The incident had taken place in Odisha’s Balangir district on the night of October 3, 1989 when one Shatrughna Nag was found in a compromising position with a girl at the latter’s house. The girl’s family members thrashed Nag and filed a complaint at the Titlagarh police Station. The man faced trial for offences punishable under Sections 376/511, 354 and 457 of the IPC. In March 1990, the trial court found him guilty and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs. 100 under Section 376/511 of the IPC. He was also convicted under other charges. The man, however, secured bail and was released from jail two months later. The rape convict appealed against the judgment in the Orissa High Court in 1990. As per the judgment delivered on Friday by Justice S. K. Sahoo, circumstances indicated that the girl was a consenting party. “After having been caught red-handed with the convict in a compromising position inside her bed room in the night, the victim tried to put the entire blame upon the convict as the perpetrator of the crime to save her own skin before her family members as well as in her society,” says the judgment. Justice Sahoo set aside the conviction of the appellant under Sections 376/511, 354 and 457 of the IPC. The High Court, however, found Nag guilty on charges of trespassing (Section 448 of the IPC) to the girl’s house. The maximum substantive sentence provided for offence under Section 448 is one year. Since he had already served seven months of imprisonment during trial and had to go through mental trauma for facing the case over three decades, the High Court did not award further imprisonment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/high-court-exonerates-man-of-rape-charge-after-30-years/article33332830.ece
15 December 2020||Guwahati,||Bodoland People’s Front stakes claim to form Council||The Bodoland People’s Front, which emerged as the single largest party with 17 seats in the just concluded Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) polls, on Monday staked claim to form the new Council even as the stage is set for swearing-in of five members of the BJP-UPPL-GSP coalition on December 15. BPF president Hagrama Mohilary in a letter to Assam Governor Jagadish Mukhi requested that his party has emerged as the single largest party in the 40-member council and as such should be given the first opportunity to prove majority in the autonomous body. He also requested the Governor to give them a period of seven days for following the necessary procedures to prove majority.  No comment yet Raj Bhavan sources are yet to comment on the BPF’s claim. Established in 2003, BTC is an autonomous self-governing body under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, a special provision that allows for greater political autonomy and decentralised governance in certain tribal areas of the Northeast. BTC covers four districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri which fall under the Bodoland Territorial Region. BPF is an alliance partner of BJP in the State government, but has been dumped and BJP has joined hands with the United Peoples’ Party Liberal and the Gana Suraksha Party to constitute the council as a coalition. The BJP-UPPL-GSP combine had staked its claim on Sunday with the Governor accepting their claim and directed that they be sworn in on December 15. A five member team, led by UPPL’s Promode Bodo, comprising two each from BJP and UPPL and one from GSP, is scheduled to be sworn in at Kokrajhar on Tuesday. Mr. Mohilary had appealed to BJP to extend its support in forming the council as the results had led to a hung House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bodoland-peoples-front-stakes-claim-to-form-council/article33332838.ece
15 December 2020||new delhi,||Over 2,000 women set to join agitation||Over 2,000 women from families of farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agriculture laws at Singhu Border here will join the ongoing agitation in the coming days. The farmers are preparing to intensify their protest to press their demand for repeal of the laws. Farmer leaders said they are making arrangements to host the women, coming from various parts of Punjab. Tents are being put up, and a separate langar is being planned. Extra temporary toilets are also being arranged. The aim is to give them a safe and comfortable environment to stay at the protest site, they said. Farmer leader Harendir Singh Lakhowal said a Delhi-based outfit donated around 200 tents on Sunday that are now being put up at Singhu as well as Tikri borders. Some people have also offered their flats for temporary accommodation. Shiv Kumar Kakka, one of the 33 farmers who observed a hunger strike at Singhu border on Monday, said it is not an agitation of Punjab farmers alone, but of farmers from across India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/over-2000-women-set-to-join-agitation/article33332841.ece
15 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Supporters in Punjab help keep the fire alive at Delhi border||Quintals of woods neatly stacked every few metres have become a common sight at the Singhu border protest site. The farmers and their supporters have been using them to light fires for cooking as well as to beat the winter chill at night. From Punjab But how does the wood reach the Capital? Baljinder Singh, a resident of Rauke Kalan village in Moga district— shared how he brought 100 quintals of cut wood from his village to the protest site at the crack of dawn — around 3 a.m. on Monday — after a 12-hour truck-ride. Mr. Baljinder received a call from his villagers protesting here for wood — one of many such calls made back home by the protesters here at the Capital’s borders. “As soon as I got the call, I gathered a few boys and told them that we need to collect wood. Three trolleys set out for the work,” he said. Nineteen-year-old Jaswinder Singh, who is pursuing industrial training, drove one of the trolleys around the streets of the village and knocked on each and every door, requesting them to donate wood. “We told them that our brothers here in Delhi are protesting against the government for our rights and they need the wood for food. People gave us as much they could — 5kg or 50kg, depending on their means,” he said. The villagers use wood from old trees in farm fields for their chulha (stove). Recalling an incident with a 95-year-old woman in the village, Mr. Balwinder said when she found out the reason behind the requirement of wood, her eyes welled up and she requested to be taken along. “She could not come because of her age,” he added. After collecting wood in three trolleys from each household in the village of about 7,000 people, Mr. Balwinder and his two friends went to get it chopped in a town — Nihal Singh Wala — which is 15kms from the village. The wood was then shifted to a truck. “We left the village at 3 p.m. on Wednesday and reached here about 3 a.m. on Thursday,” Mr. Balwinder said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/supporters-in-punjab-help-keep-protest-fire-alive-at-delhi-border/article33332845.ece
15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Farm laws are anti-people and will cause massive price hike: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who observed a day-long fast on Monday in solidarity with protesting farmers, said the three farm laws were not just “anti-farmer” but also “anti-people”. The Aam Aadmi Party leaders, including Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, held a “mass fasting” at the party headquarters. Mr. Kejriwal said: “These laws will cause a massive price hike. These laws are here just to favour some capitalists. So do not think that you are doing any favour to the farmers by supporting them. These laws are already passed so now if these laws are not rolled back then we all will be in trouble.” He said the farmers were protesting against the laws and doing a favour to all the citizens. “We all need to protest against these laws. Our party is standing beside farmers. MSP should be legalised,”he said. He also urged politicians to not defame the farmers. “The farmers are protesting following the method of non-violence. But the BJP leaders are telling them that they are agents of China and Pakistan. They are calling them anti-nationals and terrorists. The politicians who are saying such things should be ashamed. The son of the farmer, who is fighting at the border to protect our country, when he gets to know that his family members are called terrorists then imagine what he might feel. This is unacceptable. I want to request all these politicians who are trying to defame these farmers to immediately stop these dirty politics.” At the “mass fasting” at the party headquarters, AAP leader and MLA Atishi said: “Today, we all from AAP are on mass fasting. The Centre should listen to farmers and they should remember that we can make roti every day at our houses because of them. They should also know that if they forget the farmers then the latter can bring them down.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farm-laws-are-anti-people-and-will-cause-massive-price-hike-cm/article33332847.ece
15 December 2020||JAIPUR,||Former BJP MLA convicted in criminal case||A sessions court in Rajasthan’s Aklera town on Monday sentenced former Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Manohar Thana, Kanwar Lal Meena, to three years’ imprisonment in a 15-year-old case of criminal intimidation and assault of public servant. Meena had threatened the Aklera Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) during elections for Deputy Sarpanch in 2005. After a Magistrate’s court acquitted Meena in 2018 following a protracted trial, the prosecution and the public servant filed revision petitions in the sessions court. The court was informed that Meena had pointed a revolver at the head of SDM Ram Niwas Mehta and threatened him with the demand that the repolling be ordered “within two minutes”.  Camera snatched Meena also snatched a digital camera of an IAS probationary officer accompanying Mr. Mehta and broke the video cassettes of the videographer who was shooting footage of the demonstration during the polls. He left in a rage after the local villagers brought him under control and persuaded him to put the revolver back in his pocket. Aklera Additional District & Sessions Judge Aseem Kulshreshtha convicted Meena under Sections 506 (criminal intimidation) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. After the court handed down the punishment, Meena was taken into custody and shifted to jail. Meena served as a BJP MLA from 2013 to 2018 during the Vasundhara Raje regime. Mr. Mehta, a Rajasthan Administrative Service officer, is at present the Joint Secretary in the State government's Home Department. An alleged attack by a mob led by Meena, when he was an MLA of the then ruling party, on the activists taking part in a ‘Jawabdehi Yatra’ (march for accountability) in Jhalawar district's Aklera region on January 16, 2016, had made headlines. Videos had emerged showing the MLA with a lathi charging towards the activists and beating and chasing them away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/former-bjp-mla-convicted-in-criminal-case/article33332833.ece
15 December 2020||Jaipur,||Impressive victory for Congress in Rajasthan||After a setback in the recent zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections, the ruling Congress has registered an impressive victory in the urban local body polls held in 12 districts of Rajasthan. The Congress won 620 of the 1,775 posts of ward councillors in 50 local bodies for which the results were announced on Sunday. With its tally of 548 seats, the Opposition BJP fell behind independent candidates who bagged 595 seats. Seven candidates of the Bahujan Samaj Party, two each of the CPI and the CPI(M), and one of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party also won. Having won a significant number of seats, the Independents were likely to play an important role in the formation of boards in several municipal bodies. Of the total urban local bodies which went to polls, 43 were municipalities and seven were municipal councils.  Poor show in rural polls In the panchayati raj polls, the BJP’s zila pramukhs were elected in 12 zila parishads, while the Congress could manage only five zila pramukhs. The Congress and the BJP joined hands to defeat the zila pramukh candidate of the Bharatiya Tribal Party in Dungarpur, following which the BTP threatened to sever its alliance with the ruling party. Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra said his party was set to form the boards in 41 municipal bodies, while the BJP was expected to do so only in nine. “The results clearly indicate that the urban voters are drifting away from the BJP. Its claim of sweeping the local body polls has been exposed. Independents fielded strategically by the Congress are going to support us,” he said. ‘Hard work’ Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the people had reposed faith in the Congress. Congratulating the victorious candidates, Mr. Gehlot said the Congress workers had worked hard during the campaign. The elections witnessed a record polling, with the average voting reported at 79.9%. The highest turnout at 90.32% was recorded at Nagar in Bharatpur district in the polls for the town’s municipality. The voting for chairpersons of urban bodies will be held on December 20. The districts which went to polls were Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Bharatpur, Dholpur, Baran, Sriganganagar, Kota, Sawai Madhopur, Sirohi, Karauli and Dausa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/impressive-victory-for-congress-in-rajasthan/article33332831.ece
15 December 2020||New Delhi,||Plea seeks ban on betting and gambling websites||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response of the Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party government on a plea to ban websites, which are involved in gambling, betting and wagering. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the Ministries of Finance and Electronics and Information Technology to give their stand on the plea by next date of hearing on January 29, next year. Avinash Mehrotra, in his plea, said that despite laws enacted by various States prohibiting such activities, a large number of websites providing gambling, betting and wagering games are still accessible in India. His plea also stated that the online gambling system in India is unregulated and is “a place for carrying out hawala operations, money laundering, etc”. “In fact, it is submitted that foreign exchange laws, as well as Income Tax laws, are likely being violated today by the online gambling websites,” the petition has alleged. Mr. Mehrotra said last year he moved a similar petition, which was disposed of with a direction to the Centre to treat it as a representation. Subsequently, he was informed by the Central government that it did not have the legislative competence to deal with his representation to ban or block websites, his plea said. He contended that all these activities, though expressly prohibited by law, are being carried out because of lack of enforcement of the laws in question.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/plea-seeks-ban-on-betting-and-gambling-websites/article33332840.ece

After closing down the civic bodies, the Mayors are sitting at dharna. The people of Delhi want cleanliness and governance and now, they regret electing the BJP. Yesterday, the Delhi Police, which is under the Centre, detained many of our MLAs,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj at a press meet. ‘Biggest scam exposed’ He alleged that AAP has exposed a “scam” of Rs. 2,500 crores, which is “bigger” than the Commonwealth Games scam — that happened under the then Chief Minister Sheila Dixit. “Today is the 8th press conference on the corruption of the BJP ruled civic bodies. Till today, the BJP has not given a single answer to allegations of corruption made AAP. This [Rs. 2,500 crore] scam is the biggest scam in the history of Delhi but the BJP has not responded to this as well,” he said. “The citizens of Delhi are now confident that the civic bodies will not do any work for them; be if sanitation or cleaning the roads or maintaining the park or handling monkey menace. The desperate BJP has attacked the house of Deputy Chief Minister,” Mr. Bharadwaj added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-is-doing-drama-outside-kejriwal-house-alleges-aap/article33332843.ece
