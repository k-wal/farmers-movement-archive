23 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||20 flyers from U.K. test positive||At least 20 passengers flying in to India from the United Kingdom tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday as the government issued stringent standard operating procedures (SoP), mandating RT-PCR tests at all airports for each traveller from the country and isolation at a separate institutional facility for positive cases in view of the new coronavirus strain. Advising caution as the new strain in the U.K. has undergone 17 changes, increasing its transmissibility by 70%, NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul said the mutation had so far not affected the severity and the case fatality of the disease. He added that as of now, the mutation had not been detected in India, and that it would have no impact on the potential of the emerging vaccines being developed in India or internationally. “There is no cause for concern, no need to panic, as for now. But we have to stay vigilant,” Dr. Paul said at a press conference in the national capital. On direct flights Of the 20 passengers found infected, six were on a flight that landed in Delhi at 11.30 p.m. on Monday and two on a flight that arrived at Kolkata on Sunday night. Four persons, who landed in Ahmedabad, and eight persons, including a crew member, who reached Amritsar on Tuesday tested positive. All flights were direct Air India flights from London. “Five passengers were found positive at the Delhi airport. One passenger who took a connecting flight to Chennai was tested there and found positive,” an official in Delhi said. All incoming passengers from UK were being tested, said Dr Gauri Agarwal, of the Genestrings Diagnostic Center handling coronavirus testing at Delhi airport. The positive samples were sent to the National Centre for Disease Control for research on the new strain, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/20-passengers-from-uk-test-positive-stringent-sops-kick-in/article33398334.ece
23 December 2020||KALABURAGI,||Kappagallu GP breaks a tradition to vote||Panchayat elections were held in Kappagallu village in Ballari district after an incredibly long gap of 30 years on Tuesday. The need for holding an election to the local body of village governance had never arisen all these years in this village as the village, which was known for its unity, had been electing gram panchayat members unopposed. The village elders holding a meeting well in advance to the scheduled date of the panchayat elections and unanimously deciding their representatives in the gram panchayat was the practice. However, it was not the case this time as there was no unanimity in the selection of members. The entire village was largely divided into two groups — the elders who were for continuing the tradition of electing members unopposed and the young people who were for holding elections to let the voters exercise their right to elect their representatives. When polling was held in the village, the division was conspicuous. The elders looked not just disinterested but were sad as a tradition had been broken. The younger generation appeared active and enthusiastic to see people casting their votes.  The young were for holding elections to let voters exercise their right to elect their representatives||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kappagallu-gp-breaks-a-tradition-to-vote/article33398486.ece
23 December 2020||MANGALURU,||New veterinary polyclinic likely to start functioning next month||The new spacious government veterinary polyclinic, which provides specialised treatment to animals and birds, is likely to be operational on the Jail Road in the city in the second week of January. Set to replace the old polyclinic, the new clinic will have large space for operating upon big and small animals. Coming up on a 1.6-acre piece of land, this new building is among the new polyclinics being built across the State under the Union government’s Rural Infrastructure Development Fund. Apart from Mangaluru, a new polyclinic is also coming up in Udupi, said Deputy Director for Polyclinic, Mangaluru, D. Ramaprakash. The new polyclinic will have rooms for operating upon small and big animals. There will be watch wards for small and big animals to keep them under observation. A laboratory for testing blood and other samples, an ultrasound scanning room, an isolation room for keeping infected animals, and the autopsy room will be available. The new building will have facility for treating waste water. Waste water will go to an underground tank that has three parts. It is in the first part that waste water will accumulate and where sodium hydrochloride powder is used to kill bacteria. The water then will flow to another portion and then, onto the third parting it will percolate. “We will not allow waste water mix with the sewerage line,” Dr. Ramaprasad said. Works on the new building in Mangaluru started three years ago. Initially planned as a ground plus first floor building, changes had to be made following objections from the authorities of the adjoining Mangaluru District Prison. The lockdown affected construction work. “It is only in the last few weeks that the pace of construction picked up. Almost 95 % of the works are completed. We have planned to inaugurate the new building on January 15,” Dr. Ramaprasad said. The Pashu Sanjeevini ambulance, which helps in providing specialised treatment for animals on the doorsteps of farmers, will also become operational on the same day, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-veterinary-polyclinic-likely-to-start-functioning-next-month/article33398942.ece
23 December 2020||MANGALURU,||First phase of polling in GPs peaceful in twin districts||Except a minor incident at Harekala in Mangaluru taluk, the first phase of gram panchayat elections in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi went off peacefully on Tuesday. According to the provisional statistics, if Dakshina Kannada recorded 75.05 % voting, Udupi registered 74.10 %. Taluk-wise, provisionally, Mangaluru recorded 72.23 %, Moodbidri 77.77 % and Bantwal registered 72.82 % voting in Dakshina Kannada. In Udupi, Udupi taluk recorded 74.80 %, Hebri taluk 79.41 %, Brahmavar 73.79 %, and Baindoor taluk registered 71.28 % polling. The police used lathis to disperse a group of political activists engaged in heated arguments at a polling booth in Harekala at about 1 p.m. According to the police, Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) activists questioned a Congress activist who was repeatedly going to a polling booth at Ramakrishna Aided Secondary School in Harekala. This led to a heated exchange of words between the SDPI and Congress activists. The incident did not have any impact on polling and the process went on smoothly, the police said and added that no case has been registered in this connection. Polling was held in 172 gram panchayats in the twin districts. These were 106 panchayats in Mangaluru, Moodbidri and Bantwal taluks in Dakshina Kannada and 66 panchayats in Udupi, Brahmavar, Hebri and Baindoor taluks in Udupi district. The second and the final phase of elections will take place on December 27. Counting will be held on December 30. COVID-19 protocols were followed in majority of the polling stations. Many voters said that they knew the candidates in person and that voting for them might help to get projects completed in their villages. After visiting some polling stations in Udupi, Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha told presspersons that people showed interest in exercising their franchise. In remote places such as Nadpalu in Hebri taluk of Udupi district, people were seen turning up for voting in the morning itself. At a polling booth in Nadpalu, out of the total 662 voters, 337 had already exercised their franchise by 11.45 a.m. Voting was brisk in the evening again. As there are travel restrictions due to the pandemic this time, NRI voters were fewer in numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/first-phase-of-polling-in-gps-peaceful-in-twin-districts/article33398945.ece
23 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Telangana govt. initiative to tackle new COVID variant||The Telangana government has set up a special surveillance mechanism to tackle the spread of a more virulent SARS-CoV-2 virus sequenced in the UK. A tipline 040-24651119 has also been installed for travellers from the UK, said Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao, Director of Public Health at a crowded press conference in a small room in Hyderabad on Tuesday. “About 358 travellers have come from the UK and they are in the process of being identified and will be asked to quarantine and observe symptoms,” said Dr Rao who said all passengers from UK are being tested with RT-PCR but all of them have tested negative. “There is no need to panic about the variant. It is spreading rapidly that’s the only difference. The morbidity rate is not higher due to this virus variant,” informed Dr. Rao, who said the pandemic is under control in Telangana. “Till now the variant has not been sequenced in India though three national scientific institutions are working on it. So, we can say the variant of the SARS-CoV2 has not appeared in India,” said Dr Ramesh Reddy, Director of Medical Education. Both the health officials struck a note of caution about the forthcoming festive season. “Celebrate with your family. Don’t invite strangers and people you don’t know. Vulnerable members of your family might be affected in a serious way later,” said Dr. Rao who termed masks as the best defence against the virus. The standard operating procedure announced by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare dictates that the: “State governments shall ensure that all passengers travelling from or transiting through airports in UK and disembarking in India would be subjected to RT-PCR test on arrival. In case of a positive sample, it is recommended that spike gene-based RT-PCR test should also be performed by an appropriate laboratory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ts-efforts-to-tackle-new-covid-variant/article33398867.ece
23 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Priest, nun guilty in Abhaya case, says special CBI court||After 28 years of vexatious legal wrangling, a special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) here on Tuesday found Father Thomas M. Kottoor and Sister Sephy guilty of the murder of 19-year-old novice Sister Abhaya, who was found dead in a well at Pious X Convent of the Knanaya Catholic order in Kottayam in March 1992. CBI special judge K. Sanal Kumar will pronounce the quantum of their punishment on Wednesday. He found the accused liable for murder and destruction of evidence. The CBI’s case was that the accused had killed Abhaya after the novitiate unwittingly discovered them in objectionable circumstances when she went to collect drinking water from the convent’s kitchen on the night of March 27. To prevent their liaison from being known, Sister Sephy bludgeoned Abhaya on the side of her head with the blunt side of an axe. The suspects then dumped the body into the well of the convent to make it appear as a suicide. The CBI had no case that the suspects had sexually assaulted Abhaya. Earlier, the High Court had given Father Jose Poothrukayil and former Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch, K.T. Michael discharge from the case for want of evidence. The CBI had named Father Jose as an accomplice in the murder. It had accused Mr. Michael of destroying evidence. The police had dismissed Abhaya’s death as a suicide. A subsequent Crime Branch inquiry, led by Mr. Michael, seconded the finding. The findings caused public outrage. An action council headed by Jomon Puthenpurackal ushered in a CBI inquiry in 1995. The case took a sensational turn in 1996 when the then DSP, CBI, Varghese P. Thomas opted for voluntary retirement after he allegedly came under pressure to write off the death as a suicide. The case meandered through various levels of the judiciary till trial finally commenced in August 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/priest-nun-guilty-in-abhaya-case-says-special-cbi-court/article33399052.ece

23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Jail authorities told to ensure Ishrat’s protection||A Delhi court on Tuesday directed the Mandoli jail authorities to “immediately” act to prevent alleged harassment of former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a north-east Delhi riots case, inside the prison premises. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat gave the direction after Ms. Jahan alleged that she was badly beaten up by inmates at Mandoli jail and was continuously facing harassment in prison. The court directed the prison authorities to give a detailed report on Ms. Jahan’s complaint and the steps taken to address the issue. Later in the day, Director General (Tihar) Sandeep Goel said Ms. Jahan was shifted to another barrack after a “minor scuffle” was reported between her and another woman inmate on Tuesday morning. “Both of them have been shifted to different barracks to avoid any scuffle,” said Mr. Goel. Ms. Jahan had told the court during the videoconferencing hearing that this was the second incident of harassment and violence against her in the last one month because of which she was under high stress. ‘Called a terrorist’ She said that on Tuesday around 6.30 a.m., some inmates beat her up badly and hurled verbal abuses. She alleged that the other inmates kept calling her a “terrorist” and even demanded money from her in the canteen. Ms. Jahan complained that she has been facing such harassment since the past four months. Her counsel said that two women in her prison cell attacked Ms. Jahan after objecting to her offering prayers in the morning. Taking note of her complaint, Judge Rawat directed the prison authorities to take all necessary steps to ensure that Ms. Jahan was not further harassed by anyone inside the prison just because she complained. The judge remarked that Ms. Jahan seemed to be in a state of “utter fear” while directing the jail authorities to talk to her and try to allay her fears. During the hearing, the counsel for suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, also charged with the stringent UAPA, alleged that most of the accused in the north-east Delhi riots cases were facing discrimination in prison. The counsel said the accused are being termed “terrorists” even before a final decision of the court. Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, another accused, claimed that he was not allowed to meet his family members through videoconferencing despite repeated requests by them. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, also an accused in a case, complained that he had not been provided with a soft copy of the chargesheet till now. The court asked Mr. Khalid’s counsel to move an application before the Tihar prison authorities in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jail-authorities-told-to-ensure-ishrats-protection/article33398657.ece

The court had already ordered a compensation of Rs. 25 lakh and a government job for her. Hearing a batch of public interest litigation petitions that sought adequate compensation to the woman, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi directed the State to provide monthly financial assistance of Rs. 7,500 to the woman taking into account the fact that she has to spend at least Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 on nutrition per day. The court also took note of the fact that the woman had studied Commerce but was yet to complete the degree course. The judges asked if the government could appoint her as a Junior Assistant instead of an Office Assistant and if her appointment could be made permanent. The court also sought to know if the woman could be given Siddha treatment. The judges directed the State government to respond to the queries on December 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/high-court-directs-govt-to-give-more-assistance-to-sattur-woman/article33398432.ece
23 December 2020||MADURAI,||Plan to acquire 1,478 acres of farmlands dropped||The 13-year-old struggle by farmers of three villages – Karisalkalampatti, Sivarakottai and Swamimallampatti – in Tirumangalam taluk to retain their agricultural lands that were acquired for setting up SIPCOT industrial park has fructified after the Department of Industries dropped the plan. A Government Order, dated December 21, issued by Principal Secretary, dropping the scheme comes after the district administration declared that the entire 588.57.87 hectares of lands in the villages were cultivable and their acquisition would directly affect farmers. “It is a huge victory for all the farmers who have sustained the protest all these years,” said president of Madurai District Farmers Association M. Ramalingam, who had spear-headed the protest. The farmers said though deprived of irrigation facility, the fertile lands were the major source for minor millets. “The black soil with high water-holding capacity in the rain-fed fields helped the farmers grow minor millets, pulses and cotton,” said former Joint Director of Agriculture A. Jeyasingh Gnanadurai. Even when the farmlands under double crop area of Periyar-Vaigai irrigation system had remained bone dry for months together without adequate storage in reservoirs, the farmlands in these three villages had vast tracts of greenery. “The farmers were able to grow crops even with sparse rainfall,” he added. The problem started with the government in 2007 planning to acquire around 5,500 acres of lands in Tirumangalam taluk. However, it dropped the lands in Vellakulam, Kalligudi and Kengampatti. Subsequently, it dropped 1,000 acres in Sengapadai. In 2009, it issued a G.O. on acquiring 1,478.71 acres of lands in Sivarakottai, Karisalkalampatti and Swamimallampatti. “We were growing 22 varieties of millets and pulses and cotton through the year,” Mr. Ramalingam said. The fodder acquired from the crops helped the farmers raise at least two lakh goats/sheep and around 500 milch animals. The farmers claimed that officials misguided the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on government’s plan and subsequently they had to go to the Supreme Court. Jayalalithaa, then the leader of the opposition, had vowed to return the lands to the farmers upon coming to power in 2011. However, the issue was put in the back burner though during every Parliamentary and Assembly election, the AIADMK promised to keep its words. The G.O. now said there was no need for an industrial park at Sivarakottai as one was functioning in Kappalur (10 km away) and another was in the pipeline in Sattur (45 km away). The farmers thanked Revenue Minister and Tirumangalam MLA R.B. Udhayakumar for taking efforts to retrieve their farmlands.  It is a huge victory for all the farmers who have sustained the protest all these years M.

23 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Focus now on tracing 2,127 travellers from U.K.||With as many as 2,127 people having arrived from the United Kingdom in Karnataka from December 1 till date, the State Health Department is faced with the mammoth task of monitoring their health status and tracing their contacts. According to data from the Health Department, the samples of 233 passengers have been collected for tests so far. Of the 2,127 people, as many as 1,696 have landed in Bengaluru. A total of 179 samples have been collected from Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural and BBMP limits. While 119 are from Mysuru and 58 are from Mangaluru, 31 and 29 are from Dharwad and Udupi, respectively. Apart from the 179 samples collected from Bengaluru Urban, Rural, and BBMP limits, as many as 13 samples have been collected from Mangaluru and eight from Tumakuru. Meanwhile, sources said two persons — a 36-year-old mother and six-year-old daughter from Vasanthapura ward in Bommanahalli zone, who landed in the city on December 19 and did not have a COVID-19 negative report — have tested positive through Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). Their RT-PCR reports are awaited. “After their report arrives, the samples will undergo genome sequencing to ascertain if the patients have been infected with the new strain. The reports will be sent to NIV, Pune, for validation,” sources said adding that the mother and daughter have been shifted to Victoria Hospital. Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey told The Hindu that so far international travellers without a COVID-19 negative report were mandated to undergo 14 days home quarantine. “Those who arrived with a COVID-19 negative report had no quarantine. Those who came without a COVID-19 negative report before the Centre announced a ban on UK flights are being traced and tested,” he said. Meanwhile, the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) discussed the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the U.K. and its possible impact in the State. TAC members, who were of the view that there should be no lapses in contact tracing, said the Health Department had done really well in terms of contact tracing in the initial months. “Contact tracing should be taken up with the same zeal now also,” a member said. Another member recalled that in the initial months the infection had spread through foreign returnees as only thermal scanning was done at airports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/focus-now-on-tracing-2127-travellers-from-uk/article33398484.ece

The order was issued on Tuesday after Mr. Nimbalkar approached the court seeking to quash the FIR filed against him by the CBI. In the FIR, the CBI charged five police officers, including Nimbalkar — who was at the time IGP Economic Offices, CID — under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act for accepting illegal gratification in the form of electronic gadgets and other benefits from the IMA to give favourable reports. IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan was also named in the FIR. Mr. Nimbalkar dismissed the charges, claiming that the report on the IMA, in which no irregularities were found, had been prepared by his juniors and submitted to him. He in turn forwarded it to his seniors. The report, which was forwarded, is not final, he submitted to the court. He further said that for the same offence, two FIRs had been filed which was not permissible under the law. Special public prosecutor for the CBI P. Prasanna Kumar argued that the witnesses and material for both the cases were different. The CBI also assured the court that there was no proposal to arrest the accused officer, but planned toconclude its investigation by April 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ima-scam-special-court-tells-cbi-not-to-take-coercive-action-against-ips-officer-nimbalkar/article33398616.ece

Those who test negative will be allowed to go, but they will have to observe a 14-day mandatory home quarantine. These norms apply to the passengers travelling either directly from the U.K. or travelling through connecting flights or those who entered the country using any other means of transport. “We have issued orders to the Collectors and Superintendents of Police to trace the people arriving from abroad and take these preventive measures,” said Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare Bhaskar Katamneni. Three-T strategy In a review meeting on Tuesday, Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy called for utmost caution and asked the officials concerned to do the needful to ensure that the new strain did not impact people of the State. In containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the State has had a positive result by following a ‘three-T strategy’ — Trace, Test and Treat. Due to the government’s tireless efforts in carrying out tests on a large-scale, the virus has been isolated in most regions, the officials said. The mortality rate continues to be as low as 0.81 %. Out of the 8,78,937 cases that have been detected so far, 3,992 were still active as on December 21. The State has carried out 2,11,631 tests per million which places it at the top of the testing charts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-screening-mandatory-for-all-uk-returnees-in-state/article33398329.ece

23 December 2020||CHENNAI,||Chennai sample sent to NIV||The passenger who tested positive for COVID-19 after he arrived in Chennai from the U.K. by air via Delhi is in a stable condition, Tamil Nadu Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Tuesday. With a new strain of the novel coronavirus found in the U.K., the sample collected from him has been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. He said 15 persons who had arrived here from Delhi were under institutional quarantine and the 25-year-old man was shifted to Government Corona Hospital, Guindy, after he tested positive. “...It need not necessarily be the new strain... However, we have sent the sample to the NIV for genomic analysis,” he said. The Health Secretary said officials were tracking the contacts of the passenger. “We are tracking persons who were seated adjacent to him, three rows ahead and three rows behind.” He said nine persons who arrived from the U.K. by another flight were also tested. “We will be following the Standard Operating Procedure issued by the Government of India and will track the contacts,” he said. He said officials activated the testing booth at the Chennai airport. “We got the list of persons who arrived on domestic flights, and are monitoring them. We are doing this foolproof. Similar measures are implemented at the airports in Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai. We have set up information booths for persons coming from nearby airports,” he said. Dr. Radhakrishnan, along with T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, and S. Divyadharshini, Joint Commissioner (Health), Greater Chennai Corporation, inspected the arrangements made at the Chennai airport to test passengers returning from the U.K. List prepared The Health Secretary added that persons returning from abroad were required to undergo a RT-PCR test 96 hours before the travel and be under home quarantine. “Even if they tested negative, they could pick up the infection during travel. Following the detection of the new strain in the U.K., the Centre and the World Health Organization have issued guidelines. The Chief Minister has directed that all persons who returned from the U.K. be tested on the fourth day. Accordingly, we have prepared a list of 1,088 persons who travelled from the U.K. in the last one week. We are doing saturation tests, as we did on the IIT-Madras campus,” he said.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said the reason behind the fast spread of the virus in Delhi in March-April was that lots of people travelled from abroad to the city. “Our strategy is to identify those who are based out of Delhi and have travelled from the U.K. in the past two weeks and conduct door-to-door test for them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-to-trace-passengers-who-arrived-from-uk-in-last-14-days/article33398658.ece

23 December 2020||Bengaluru,||HC rejects BSY’s plea against probe||In a setback to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday rejected his plea challenging the probe ordered against him by the Special Court for Lokayukta cases in a corruption case related to alleged illegal denotification of a parcel of acquired land when he was serving as Deputy Chief Minister during 2006. While castigating the Lokayukta police for not conducting the probe against Mr. Yediyurappa between February 18, 2015, and April 2, 2019, even though there was no stay order of the High Court operating during this period, the court observed that there was “intentional and deliberate” delay on the part of the Lokayukta police. Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order while dismissing the petition filed in 2019 by Mr. Yediyurappa questioning the probe ordered against him by the Special Court for Lokayukta cases on February 18, 2015, and the First Information Report registered against him on February 21, 2015. “...the allegations made in the complaint and the material produced in support thereof prima facie make out ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioner [Mr. Yediyurappa],” the court observed. The Lokayukta court had ordered investigation based on a private complaint filed in 2013 by one Vasudeva Reddy of Belandur in Bengaluru complaining about illegality and corruption by Mr. Yediyurappa and former Minister R.V. Deshpande in connection with denotification of several acres of land at Bellandur and Devarabisanahalli villages notified for IT parks. In the case of Mr. Deshpande, the High Court in October 2015 quashed the case against him on the ground that Special Court could not have proceeded against him sans sanction, and the Supreme Court in 2017 confirmed this order. However, the High Court in its Tuesday’s order in Mr. Yediyurappa’s petition held that no prior sanction was required as the BJP leader had ceased to hold the post of Deputy Chief Minister when the Lokayukta court ordered investigation in 2015 and also sanction was not necessary for ordering investigation. “A reading of the complaint clearly indicates that the petitioner herein is sought to be prosecuted for the independent act of denotification of the lands done by him during his tenure as the Deputy Chief Minister,” Mr. Justice Cunha observed while stating that the benefits of quashing of case against Mr. Deshpande cannot be extended to Mr. Yediyurappa. “I find that distinct and separate allegations are made against the petitioner [Mr. Yediyurappa]... This allegation prima facie discloses a cognisance offence insofar as the petitioner is concerned which needs to be investigated,” the High Court observed.  The court observes that there was ‘intentional and deliberate’ delay on the part of the Lokayukta police  In the case of R.V. Deshpande, the High Court in October 2015 quashed the case against him on the ground that Special Court could not have proceeded against him sans sanction, and the Supreme Court in 2017 confirmed this order, the court says||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-rejects-bsys-plea-against-probe-in-denotification-case/article33398483.ece

Stalin on Tuesday submitted to Governor Banwarilal Purohit a 97-page memorandum containing corruption charges against Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and seven of his Cabinet colleagues. He urged the Governor to order a probe by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption into the charges against Mr. Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and Ministers S.P. Velumani, P. Thangamani, C. Vijayabaskar D. Jayakumar, R. Kamaraj and R.B. Udhayakumar. The memorandum cited specific schemes in the portfolios of Highways, Municipal Administration, Electricity, Health, Fisheries, Food and Information Technology, in which the party alleged corruption had taken place. The DMK also claimed that Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam had amassed wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income. “We already submitted complaints to the DVAC about these charges. Since the agency is not taking any action on our complaints we have submitted a memorandum to the Governor,” Mr. Stalin told journalists outside Raj Bhavan. Mr. Stalin said there was a complaint against Mr. Palaniswami in connection with irregularities in the fund obtained from the World Bank and alleged scam in the National Highways. The complaint against Food Minister Kamaraj was in connection with the alleged illegal sale of rice allotted by the Centre in the open market. “The country and the people know the irregularities and corruption in the AIADMK government led by Jayalalithaa between 2011 and 2016. After Mr. Palaniswami assumed office, corruption has become all pervasive and penetrated every department,” the Leader of the Opposition claimed.  Asked about the response of Mr. Purohit, he said the Governor had agreed to look into the complaints and take necessary action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stalin-seeks-probe-against-cm-ministers/article33398431.ece

23 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Southern States step up surveillance at airports||The Kerala government has decided to intensify surveillance and strengthen SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities at airports and seaports now that the new U.K. variant of the virus, known as B.1.1.7, which is believed to be highly transmissible, could be in circulation. A high-level meeting convened by Health Minister K.K. Shylaja on Tuesday said that while more information on the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which had gathered significant mutations — 23 in all — around the S spike protein, was still forthcoming, the State needed to be on a high state of alert. This was particularly so, given the peculiarities of the State, which has a high proportion of international travellers passing through its four airports; a population with the highest proportion of elderly in the country and a significant percentage of population suffering from various co-morbidities. The Minister expressed concern that the circulation of the U.K. variant, which has been described as 70% more contagious, could significantly increase the threat perception for the State which has been paying a lot of attention on imposing reverse quarantine and protecting its care home inmates. In the new situation, more attention would be paid to improving the intensive care facilities and hospital infrastructure. Special mechanism The Telangana government has set up a special surveillance mechanism to tackle the spread of the more virulent virus sequenced in the U.K. A tipline 040-24651119 has been installed for travellers from the U.K., said Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao, Director of Public Health, in Hyderabad on Tuesday. “About 358 travellers have come from the U.K. and they are in the process of being identified and will be asked to quarantine and observe symptoms,” said Dr. Rao. All passengers from the U.K. were being tested with RT-PCR but all of them had tested negative. A.P. for screening In adherence to the letter issued by the Union Health Secretary, the Andhra Pradesh government has instructed that all travellers from the U.K. should be screened and undergo RT-PCR test. Those who test negative will be allowed to go, but they will have to observe a 14-day mandatory home quarantine. These norms apply to the passengers travelling either directly from the U.K. or travelling through connecting flights or those who entered the country from any other means of transport. “We have issued orders to Collectors and Superintendents of Police to trace the people arriving from abroad and take these preventive measures,” said Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare Bhaskar Katamneni. In a review meeting on Tuesday, Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy called for utmost caution and asked the officials to do the needful to ensure that the new strain did not impact people. Tests positive A passenger who arrived in Chennai from the U.K. by air through Delhi has tested positive for COVID-19. With a new strain of the novel coronavirus found in the U.K., the passenger’s sample has been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Tamil Nadu Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said 15 persons who had arrived in Chennai on a flight from Delhi were under institutional quarantine. One of them, a 25-year-old man, had tested positive and was shifted to the Government Corona Hospital, Guindy. “The patient’s condition is stable. It need not necessarily be the new strain of coronavirus. However, we have sent the sample to NIV, Pune, for genomic analysis,” he said. The Health Secretary said officials were tracking the contacts of the passenger.

While the Congress and the National Conference (NC) also did decently well in Jammu, senior BJP leaders felt that the party had managed to hold its ground, even if its performance in areas such as the Chenab Valley was not to its satisfaction. Party leaders were more vocal about the (at the time of writing) four seats that the BJP won in the Valley, in the districts of Pulwama, Bandipora and Srinagar. “Lotus blooms in Kashmir, Aijaz Hussain won from Khanmoh II, Srinagar,” said a congratulatory tweet from the BJP’s Jammu and Kashmir handle. “The BJP and the National Conference, in our view, are the two gainers from the polls. Where earlier in the valley, we wouldn’t get a single person to hold the BJP flag, we managed to win three seats [at the time of writing],” said a party leader involved in the State.  ‘Victory for democracy’ Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur, in-charge of the polls on behalf of the party, and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh, who is an MP from Jammu, left Delhi for Jammu as soon as the results started trickling in, for post-result work. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Thakur described the results, despite the sweep of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) in the Kashmir Valley and the NC retaining some pockets of influence in Jammu, as “a victory for democracy and development”. “People have shown faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for development and [said] ‘no’ to terrorism and separatism. We also feel that the next generation of second rung leadership that these elections have thrown up across party lines and among Independents bodes well for the development of grassroots democracy,” he said. Senior party leaders also tried to find small slivers of a silver lining in the sweep of the Valley by the PAGD, which, not to put too fine a point on it, is a vote sentiment against Delhi. NC’s performance “While we did see huge local-level tie-ups in the PAGD to defeat the BJP, the National Conference has far outstripped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) within the Gupkar alliance, which will have its own repercussions for the alliance. And while the point that the failure of the new, more Delhi-friendly Apni Party shows that its not a sentiment that favours Delhi, the NC’s good performance is a good omen for a less hardline Valley politics, looking at the party’s history,” said a senior office-bearer in the BJP in Delhi. “In any case, the fact that such results have come shows that the poll process was free and fair and participation by the voters showed faith in democratic institutions,” said another leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-upbeat-about-kashmir-poll-results/article33398281.ece

Air India rescheduled its Mumbai-London-Cochin flight, and operated its flights between the U.K. capital and Ahmedabad and Delhi as per schedule, according to an airline spokesperson. The arrival time for Vistara’s U.K. 18 flight was also advanced to 11.30 p.m. on Tuesday. The government on Monday announced a ban until December 31 on all flights to and from London to curb the entry of a new strain of coronavirus found in the UK. In response to queries on whether there would be bans on other countries where a mutant strain similar to the one in the U.K. was found, a government official said no decision has been taken on the matter. The government has also issued a directive to suspend flights from Oman and Saudi Arabia till December 29. Air India posted on Twitter that it will offer passengers booked to travel during this period a one-time free rescheduling of their bookings till December 31 next year. The withdrawal of flights to Saudi Arabia and Oman follow their governments’ decision to restrict international flights. Despite the night curfew imposed in Mumbai till January 5, 2021,all operations at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) will continue as scheduled, the airport operator said in a statement. “Passengers travelling to and from the airport during the specified hours will be allowed to proceed onwards as cab services and public transportation will remain operational at all time,” it said.

23 December 2020||THIRUVANATHAPURAM,||€100 million German aid for RKI||Kerala has received €100 million as ‘policy loan’ and another €2 million as ‘grant’ as the second tranche of financial aid being extended by Germany for the Rebuild Resilient Kerala Initiative (RKI) through the German Development Bank KfW. The agreement for the policy loan and grant was signed in New Delhi on Tuesday by Additional Secretary, BC & FSDC, Union Ministry of Finance, C.S. Mohaptra and Office Director, KfW, New Delhi, Christoph Kessler. Like the first tranche of the €170-million financial support extended by Germany, the aid will reach the State budget through KfW on the basis of the pact signed between India and Germany. The €100-million ‘Climate Kerala Loan’ can be utilised by the State for RKI initiatives and even for coping with COVID-19. Grace period Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Kessler said the policy loan had been provided for 12 years at a low interest of less than 1% and a grace period of three years. The repayment would start only after three years , and this would give relief to the borrowing State. Kerala would have to undertake the policy metrics spelled out and this was the main string attached for the policy loan provided by KfW. The World Bank, which had also co-financed the RKI with Rs. 1,779.58 crore, and KfW would monitor the implementation of the RKI projects being executed to overcome natural disasters such as the 2018 floods that ravaged the State, Dr. Kessler added. Of the €170 million provided earlier by Germany, €90 million was a reduced-interest loan to promote climate-resilient reconstruction of the transport infrastructure, including bridges and roads. Special place Dr. Kessler said India and Kerala had a special place in Indo-German cooperation, trade, and bilateral relations and this was reflected in the aid being provided. The World Bank has also agreed to provide the second tranche of financial aid to the RKI. The agreement with the World Bank will be signed in April 2021. In the 2019-2027 period, projects totalling Rs. 36,500 crore are to be taken up under the RKI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/100-million-german-aid-for-rki/article33398579.ece
23 December 2020||Kolkata,||Four skip Bengal Cabinet meeting||Four Ministers of the West Bengal government were absent from a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the State Secretariat on Tuesday. The absence, coming days after Suvendu Adhikari, a former Cabinet Minister joined the BJP at a rally held by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, has sparked speculation about rising dissent in the Trinamool Congress. Two of the absentees were from north Bengal — Tourism Minister Gautam Deb and Minister for North Bengal Development Rabindranath Ghosh. However, the absence of these Ministers from north Bengal, about 600 km from Kolkata, is not unusual as they have not been attending Cabinet meetings since the outbreak of COVID-19. The other two Ministers who skipped the meeting were Minister for Fisheries Chandranath Sinha from Birbhum, and Minister for Forests, Rajib Banerjee from Howrah, who has been vocal about alleged “favouritism” in the Trinamool. Attempts have been made by the party leadership to placate Mr. Banerjee with senior leaders meeting him a few weeks ago. Incidentally, Nabanna, the State Secretariat, is located in his constituency of Howrah. The Ministers’ absence has given rise to speculation given that Mr. Adhikari had stayed away from Cabinet meetings for several months before ultimately moving to the BJP.  BJP show cause  Amid the rising political temperature in the State ahead of the Assembly election, the BJP State leadership issued a show cause to Sayantan Basu, general secretary of the State unit. The letter issued by BJP State vice-president Pratap Banerjee said Mr Basu had, on December 18, “ventured to give bites to electronic media which constitute derogatory and anti-party statements.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-skip-bengal-cabinet-meeting/article33398283.ece
23 December 2020||Ghaziabad,||Politics can wait, but not development: Modi||“Politics can wait, but the development of the country cannot,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday. Addressing the centenary celebrations of Aligarh Muslim University as chief guest, he said that just as the Independence movement was a common ground for giving up differences, “we should work together for a new India” now. “In every society, there are ideological differences but when it comes to national goals, every difference should be kept aside.” Mr. Modi is the first Prime Minister after Lal Bahadur Shastri to address the university. Politics, he said in his online address, was an important part of society but “society is much bigger than politics and power”. “For the progress of society, there is a space above politics. It is important to keep exploring that space, and campuses such as the AMU can play a vital role in that,” he said. “When we talk of a new India, I feel that the development goals of society should not be seen from a political prism,” he said. “When we work on it, the space of those who spread negativity for vested interest would automatically shrink. The underprivileged, the women, and the youth would not like to wait. We have already wasted much time on resolving the differences.” Invoking Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas , the PM said every citizen in the country should reap the benefits of development. Stressing that the government did not discriminate among citizens while formulating its policies and programmes, he said the country’s resources belonged to every citizen. The country was moving on a path in which nobody was left behind because of one’s religion.” Citing the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, he said it helped in reducing the dropout rate of Muslim schholgirls from 70% to 30%. Recalling Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s remark that the first and foremost duty of one who was concerned about his country was to work for the welfare of all people, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, Mr. Modi said “every citizen should remain assured of his or her constitutional rights and about his future.” He said the institution’s core values were its identity and that the government would not be found wanting in supporting it. Fight against pandemic He lauded the AMU’s role during the coronavirus pandemic. “Thousands of people were tested free, an isolation ward and a plasma bank were developed and the university contributed a big sum to the PM Cares Fund. It shows your seriousness towards fulfilling your role towards society,” he said, adding that the Chancellor had promised support during the coming vaccination drive as well. Describing the AMU as “a mini-India”, Mr. Modi underlined that while on the one hand, Arabic was taught on the campus, there was a century-old Sanskrit Department as well. “In the library of the university, if there is a manuscript of the Koran, the translations of Gita and Puran have also been preserved with equal care,” he said. This diversity, he said, was not just the strength of the AMU but also of India. “We should not let this strength weaken. The AMU inculcates the feeling of “ Ek Bharat, shresth Bharat (one India, great India).” Empowering women Appreciating that the first Chancellor of the AMU was a woman, he praised the university for empowering women through education, and noted that the ratio of women students in the university had risen to 35%. The AMU, he said, had played an important role in strengthening ties with different countries. “The research that is conducted in Urdu, Arabic and Persian gives new energy to our relations with the Islamic world.” He said he had been told there were 1,000 foreign students on the campus. “It is AMU’s responsibility that these students carry with them the best of India because what they will hear and learn in AMU, they will associate that with the identity of India. You have to work on the soft power of the university and work on your role towards nation-building,” he said. The Prime Minister released a special stamp. Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor, welcoming the Prime Minister, said “Under your guidance, AMU needs continued support to maintain its historic, special and constitutional character for the good of the nation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/politics-can-wait-but-not-development-modi/article33398290.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||States told to update Census register||The Registrar General of India (RGI), which conducts the decennial Census exercise, has written to all State coordinators to update names of an area, locality, colony or a building in the “charge register”, an important census document that will help enumerators to collect details during the first phase of Census-House Listing and Housing Census and the National Population Register (NPR). While the dates of the first phase of the Census, initially to be rolled out in some States on April 1, has not been finalised, the letter may be an indication to start the exercise that was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The charge register shows the distribution of work among enumerators and marks the House Listing Blocks (HLB) to be visited by each official. Each HLB, the primary unit for collection of data, can comprise an estimated present population of only 650 to 800. The register will also be used for the field work relating to the updating of NPR since the same functionaries would be engaged for both the exercises. Around 30 lakh enumerators — government officials and government schoolteachers — will each be assigned the responsibility to collect the details of 650 to 800 people through both online and offline mode. The RGI’s letter said that since the charge register does not have a separate column to mention the names of “place, locality, colonies” or “towers,” such names could be included against “column number 18.” The letter said this was being done to avoid duplication and to ensure that none of the households was left out from the census exercise. All States were asked to complete the charge register by December 31, 2019 and the letter asks for additional details. The other details included in charge register are name, area and estimated population of a village or a town. 31 columns On January 9, the RGI notified the 31 columns for which the enumerators will seek response for the House Listing and Housing Census. The questions include — whether the respondent has access to LPG/PNG connection, if the person owns a radio, transistor, television, access to Internet, whether they own a laptop, computer, telephone, mobile phone or a smartphone among other things. The office of the RGI had in a Right To Information (RTI) reply in November said the schedule or the questionnaire of the NPR was “being finalised” and the information about the expected date of first phase of Census 2021 was “not available.” The NPR’s link with the proposed National Register of Citizens and the yet to be implemented Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 has been opposed by as many as 13 States and Union Territories. According to the Citizenship Rules framed in the year 2003, NPR is the first step towards compilation of the National Register of Indian Citizens or NRC. NPR was first collected in 2010 and then updated in 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-told-to-update-census-register/article33398301.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Cong. to meet President on farm stir||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi will lead a delegation of the party’s Members of Parliament (MPs) to Rashtrapati Bhavan on December 24 and hand over around two crore signatures against the three farm laws to President Ram Nath Kovind and would request him to annul the farm laws. In a statement, party general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal said, “....the Congress party had launched a nationwide campaign for collecting memoranda of appeals addressed to the Honourable President of India signed by farmers, farm labourers and other stakeholders opposing these legislations right from the initial stage of introduction of these Bills in the Parliament. Around 2 crore signatures, urging the intervention of Hon’ble Rashtrapati ji for withdrawal of the three legislations, have been collected till now,” he said. Mr. Venugopal also accused the Narendra Modi government of using various tactics to discredit the farmers’ movement: from tiring out the farmers to labelling Opposition leaders as anti-national. He also noted that the government’s “refusal” to listen to the demands of the farmers has resulted in the death of 44 farmers. “It has become absolutely clear that the Modi government is only committed to the welfare of large corporates instead of innocent farmers and farm labour. The government has also been on an overdrive using public money to create false propaganda and narrative in favour of the legislation and discrediting the protesting farmers. It is pushing manufactured surveys in media discourse to create support in favour of these anti-farmer laws,” Mr. Venugopal added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-to-meet-president-on-farm-stir/article33398287.ece
23 December 2020||Kochi,||Western Ghats home to 3,387 leopards||The Western Ghats region is home to 3,387 leopards stealthily roaming around its forests. Karnataka tops the list with 1,783 leopards, followed by Tamil Nadu with 868, according to the Status of Leopards in India 2018 report. With 650 leopards, Kerala has the third highest number of big cats in the Western Ghats region. Goa has 86. “The Western Ghats is home to 3,387 leopards, against India’s population of 12,852,” says the report released recently by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The leopard population was counted during the tiger population assessment undertaken in 2018. The leopard population was estimated to be within the forested habitats in tiger-occupied States, the report said. The presence of the animal was recorded in the forested areas of Western Ghats, Nilgiris, and sporadically across much of the dry forests of Central Karnataka. Leopard population of the Western Ghats landscape was reported from the four distinct blocks. The Northern block covered the contiguous forests of Radhanagari and Goa covering Haliyal- Kali Tiger Reserve, Karwar, Honnavar, Madikeri, Kudremukh, Shettihali Wild Life Sanctuary (WLS), Bhadra and Chikmagalur. The Central population covered southern Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and northern Kerala covering the forests of Virajpet, Nagarhole, Bandipur, Madumalai, Satyamangalam, Nilgiris, Silent Valley, Wayanad, BRT Hills, MM Hills, Cauvery WLS, Bannerghhata National Park. A second central cluster covering central Kerala and Tamil Nadu comprising the Parambikulam-Anamalai - Eravikulum - Vazachal population. Camera traps The southern leopard population block in southern Kerala and Tamil Nadu comprised the forests of Periyar-Kalakad Mundanthurai -Kanyakumari. A total of 6,758 leopard photographs were obtained from Western Ghats from camera traps. The images helped in the identification of 1,681 adults and sub-adults. While noting that the leopard population had increased in most of the tiger reserves in the Western Ghats landscape, the report cautioned that the growing human population and increasing fragmentation of landscape led to increased human-wildlife interactions in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/western-ghats-home-to-3387-leopards/article33398267.ece
23 December 2020||Hubballi,||Polling peaceful despite skirmishes||Barring a few scattered instances of votersand supporters of candidates having arguments with the polling staff and police, and one instance of a group clash in Chitradurga district, the first phase of the gram panchayat elections concluded peacefully across Karnataka on Tuesday. There was enthusiastic participationby voters despite the COVID-19 scare. While elaborate arrangements were made to ensure adherence to the COVID-19 guidelines, voters were often seen violating norms such as maintainingsocial distancing. A group clash and case of stone pelting was reported at Azad Nagar in Baramsagar hobli of Chitradurga district. Two groups fought with each other over the issue of bringing voters to the booth. According to the police, the situation was tense but brought under control. Police action over violation of the model code of conduct led to tension for a while at Rudrapatna village in Arkalgud taluk as locals allegedly manhandled a police officer and staged a dharna. On receiving information about a breakfast distribution programme, a team led by Konanur PSI Ajay Kumar caned voters outside the polling booth, which enraged the people. The police have detained five people in this connection. Elderly voters Braving age-related problems, elderly voters came out to vote in good numbers. Gopi Poojary, 105, from Tenka Edapadavu, voted in a polling booth at Ganjimutt, near Mangaluru city, with autorickshaw driver Ashok Prabhu Vaddur carrying her to the polling station. Nonagenarian Rukamma, of Kere Bhosga village, and 90-year-old Vijamma, of Narona gram panchayat, also enthusiastically exercised their franchise. However, 73-year-old Rathnamma of Mutturu village, who cast her vote at Changadihalli in Sakleshpur taluk, did not survive to know the election result. She breathed her last minutes after coming out of the polling booth. Chand Pasha, 99, of Karakanalli in Bidar district, also passed away after returning home from the booth. Damodar Yaligar, a gram panchayat candidate, was found dead in a house at Garag village in Dharwad district. While the polling concluded peacefully, a polling official himself created a scare in Belagavi district after he was found in possession of a pistol on Monday night. The official, Suleman Sanadi, was subsequently questioned by the police and replaced by another officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/polling-peaceful-despite-skirmishes/article33398637.ece
23 December 2020||Kolkata,||Mamata refutes Home Minister’s figures||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday gave a point-by-point rebuttal of the developmental indicators provided by Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his recent visit to West Bengal and added that he owed her a “ dhokla ” treat for being proved wrong. For the second consecutive day, Ms. Banerjee held a press conference and said that West Bengal was the “number one in poverty eradication, rural housing, rural roads, 100-day work, minority scholarship and e-governance and e-tendering”. “He [the Home Minister] made Bengal seem like a nightmare land...Where were you 11 years ago? Did you see Bengal then? I have no objection with the truth, but if there is no truth to the criticism, I will challenge it,” the Chief Minister said. Ms. Banerjee said that while the Home Minister had said that the State ranked 20 when it came to industrial production whereas the State ranked fourth in these criteria. On the subject of foreign direct investment (FDI), the Chief Minister said that FDI inflows had increased from 0.22% in 2011 to 1.62% in 2019-20, marking an increase of over 736%, and Rs. 20,000 crore of foreign investment had come to the State. Ms. Banerjee said that the law and order situation in the State had significantly improved under the Trinamool Congress (TMC) regime, and areas like Jangalmahal in the southwestern region, and the Darjeeling hills, had “all become peaceful”. “According to NCRB ( National Crime Records Bureau) data, political killings, other incidents of crime and rape cases have decreased during the TMC rule. BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leaders, while pointing fingers at others, should also speak up against the Hathras rape-murder incident in Uttar Pradesh,” the Chief Minister said, adding that Kolkata has twice been accorded India’s “safest city” tag. Ms. Banerjee also pointed out that health indicators like the infant mortality rate, institutional delivery had also improved significantly in the TMC’s rule. “There are 85,642 beds in State government hospitals, which is much higher than the 58,647 beds [they had] in 2011,” she said. Mr. Shah has targeted the TMC, saying that the State had slipped in a number of development indicators and had become “number one in corruption, extortion and political violence”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-refutes-home-ministers-figures/article33398561.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Health data shows India does not need a two-child policy: PCI||The latest data from the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) provides evidence of an uptake in the use of modern contraceptives in rural and urban areas, an improvement in these demands being met, and a decline in the average number of children borne by a woman, and prove that the country’s population is stabilising and fears over a “population explosion” and calls for a “two-child policy” are misguided, say experts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day Speech in 2019 appealed to the country that population control was a form of patriotism. Months later, the NITI Aayog called various stakeholders for a national-level consultation on the issue, which was subsequently cancelled following media glare on it. The first part of the NFHS-5 report, which was made public earlier this month, records data for 17 States and five Union Territories. The analysis of the data by the international non-profit Population Council (PC) shows that the Total Fertility Rate (number of children born per woman) has decreased across 14 out of 17 States and is either at 2.1 children per woman or less. This also implies that most States have attained replacement level fertility, i.e., the average number of children born per woman at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. “We need to think through and move away from the two narratives being built without any evidence. The data is the response to myth and misconception around the two-child norm,” said Poonam Muttreja, executive director, PFI. While during NFHS-3 and NFHS-4, conducted between 2005 and 2016, there was a decline in the use of modern methods of contraception (oral pills, condoms, intra-uterine device) across 12 of 22 States and UTs, in NFHS-5 as many as 11 out of 12 States where there was a slump have witnessed an increase in their use, showed the analyses presented by Dr. Niranjan Saggurti, country director, PC, at a web conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/health-data-shows-india-does-not-need-a-two-child-policy-pci/article33398306.ece
23 December 2020||Hyderabad,||17 arrested in drive against loan apps||In a swift action, the police of Hyderabad and Cyberabad on Tuesday arrested 17 people, including several heads of app-based instant loan companies, for their role in lending money at a high interest rate and harassing the defaulters through coercive methods. Acting on a spate of complaints from debtors, who were allegedly harassed by the lenders, the police during country-wide raids picked up the promoters of several such online-loaning firms and their call centres. Cyber Crime police of Hyderabad raided two places at Udyog Vihar in Gurugram and three places in Hyderabad resulting in the arrest of 11 people working for Liofang Technologies Private Limited, Hotful Technologies Private Limited, Pinprint Technologies and Nabloom Technologies Private Limited. All the four companies registered in Bengaluru were being used to persuade, harass and intimidate loan defaulters at various stages, Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. While the three centres in Hyderabad employed nearly 600 telecallers, the centres in Gurugram had over 500 people, all aged between 18 and 22 years. Explaining the overseas links of these companies, which appointed Indian nationals as dummy directors on behest of the Chinese, the city police chief said that these companies took instructions from their heads in Jakarta, Indonesia. “The entire operation of these loan apps appears to be run by Chinese nationals at the helm. Same was indicated during the investigation into the colour prediction gaming apps scam in which crores of rupees were transferred to shell companies, which were registered as NBFCs,” Mr. Kumar said. Police seized over 700 laptops, servers, computer systems and other electronic devices from the call centres of both the places. Stating that they would further shift their focus on the web of financial transactions, funding, and technology base, Joint CP (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said that they were analysing the data in a reserve process. Unlike the gaming scam where Chinese nationals were directly involved, here they have cleverly managed to keep Indians as the company leads to divert the attention of enforcement agencies, he said. Declaring the functioning of the apps as ‘typical financial fraud’, Mr. Mohanty said that the call centres in question were working for 30 apps and police were screening 10 bank accounts and 70 to 80 online wallets of these companies. Earlier, Cyberabad police announced the arrest of six people, including the CEO of an app-based instant loan company, for their ‘illegal’ operation and cheating borrowers. 18 bank accounts of the accused firms with a deposit of Rs. 1.52 crore, were frozen, Commisisoner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said. He said Cash Mama, Loan Zone, Dhana Dhan are some of the loan apps developed and operated by K. Sharath Chandra of Onion Credit Pvt. Ltd., who also owned CRED FOX Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Chandra started two offices with 110 employees, and his elderly mother Pushpalatha, who was also arrested, was one of the directors. His companies entered into agreements with nine Delhi-based NBFCs for Cash Mama and Loan Zone, while operations of Dhana Dhan were illegal, DCP (Crimes) Rohini Priyadarshini said. They have over 1.5 lakh customers and at least 70,000 active customers from across the country with an annual turnover of more than Rs. 40 crore. Chandra, who pursued his masters from the United States, started the app developing companies two years ago, after working as an accountant in a private firm here. Police also issued notices to all NBFCs and their managing directors. Google was asked to take down the applications because of their criminal activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/17-arrested-in-drive-against-loan-apps/article33398265.ece

23 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Retired officials urge PM to review Central Vista project||A group of 69 retired All-India and Central services’ officers on Tuesday wrote in an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they were dismayed at the way the Central Vista redevelopment project was going ahead and urged the government to review it in its entirety. The group, under the banner of the Constitutional Conduct Group, said it was dismayed at the way the government and Mr. Modi had “chosen to completely disregard the Rule of Law in the matter of the Central Vista redevelopment project.” They said various aspects of the project, from the inviting of designs and selecting a consultant to obtaining approvals, had been done in a high-handed manner. Eco clearances “Of particular concern is the manner in which environmental clearances were obtained for a plan which treats the green spaces and the built heritage of the Central Vista as an unnecessary hurdle to the achievement of objectives driven by monumental ambition,” the letter said. The retired bureaucrats said the government was going ahead with the new Parliament project while the matter was sub judice. Mr. Modi had laid the foundation stone for the project on December 10. “We believe that this was the height of impropriety when the very basics of the project were under challenge. While the case was sub judice, it was incumbent upon the government to await its outcome.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/retired-officials-urge-pm-to-review-central-vista-project/article33398279.ece
23 December 2020||Washington,||Modi awarded ‘Legion of Merit’ by Donald Trump||Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the ‘Legion of Merit’ by U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday for his role in advancing the India-U.S. relationship. The award was also presented to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. India, the U.S., Japan and Australia constitute the ‘Quad’ group of countries — seen as an alternative to Chinese dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. “President@realDonaldTrumppresented the Legion of Merit to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his leadership in elevating the U.S.-India strategic partnership,” U.S. National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien wrote on Twitter. The award was presented by Mr. O’Brien to India’s U.S. Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu, who accepted it on Mr. Modi’s behalf. “The President of the United States of America conferred the highest decoration, The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 21 December 2020. The award is in recognition of the Prime Minister’s steadfast leadership and vision for India’s emergence as a global power, and exemplary contribution made by him for the advancement of the India-United States strategic partnership and promoting global peace and prosperity,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. Mr. Morrison was presented the award for “addressing global challenges and promoting collective security” and Mr. Abe “for his leadership and vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” as per the NSA. The awards were received by the Australian and Japanese Ambassadors in Washington DC. The Legion of Merit, instituted in 1942 by former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces and also members of foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) Armed Forces and sometimes heads of state or government. The award is presented to foreign recipients in four categories: Chief Commander, Commander, Officer and Legionnaire. Other Indians who have won the award include Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, who received the Legion of Merit (Degree: Chief Commander) in 1949 from then U.S. President Harry S.Truman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-awarded-legion-of-merit-by-donald-trump/article33398308.ece
23 December 2020||Kolkata,||‘Fireflies’ to shine a light for bustards||The Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), along with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) India, has come up with a unique initiative — a “firefly bird diverter” for overhead power lines in areas where Great Indian Bustard (GIB) populations are found in the wild. The GIB is one of the most critically threatened species in India, with fewer than 150 birds left in the wild. A report by the Ministry, submitted to the National Green Tribunal in 2019, pointed out that power lines, especially high-voltage transmission lines with multiple overhead wires, are the most important current threat for GIBs in the Thar region, and are causing unsustainably high mortality in about 15% of their population. “Firefly bird diverters are flaps installed on power lines. They work as reflectors for bird species like the GIB. Birds can spot them from a distance of about 50 metres and change their path of flight to avoid collision with power lines. Smaller birds can change their direction [swiftly] but for larger bird species, it is difficult because of their body weight and other factors,” Anil Kumar, team leader of the GIB project undertaken by WCS India, told The Hindu . The firefly detectors have been installed along two stretches of approximately 6.5 km, selected between Chacha to Dholiya villages in the Pokhran tehsil after ground surveys and due consultations with the Rajasthan Forest Department. A total of 1,813 firefly bird diverters are being installed on this stretch — a model that has been endorsed by experts from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission’s (SSC) Bustard Specialist Group. The diverters are called fireflies because they look like fireflies from a distance, shining on power lines in the night. The selected stretch is opposite the Pokhran Field Firing Range, which offers a safe habitat to a breeding population of GIBs outside the Desert National Park Sanctuary in Jaisalmer. Kapil Chandrwal, Deputy Conservator of Forest, Desert National Park Sanctuary, said that high-tension wires being a reason for GIB mortality had been proven by different studies. “GIBs are one of the heaviest flying birds in India. Therefore, when they encounter these wires, they are unable to change the direction of their flight. Death in most cases is due to impact with the wires and not due to electrocution,” Mr. Chandrwal added. The diverter will not only save GIB but other species of large birds, including migratory birds. The Supreme Court of India, in a recent hearing, directed that power lines in GIB landscapes should be placed underground. Experts said the innovative firefly diverter installation could serve as an alternative means to species conservation. Experts say only Jaisalmer and Barmer districts in Rajasthan had a breeding GIB population in the wild. The bird can be found in very few numbers in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fireflies-to-shine-a-light-for-bustards/article33398299.ece
23 December 2020||Bengaluru,||RTCs to raise loans to pay PF and other dues||Cash-strapped road transport corporations that sustained huge losses this year after the outbreak of COVID-19 and recently saw employees stage a four-day strike, are now planning to borrow from banks to pay provident fund dues of employees and meet other working capital. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has approached banks to raise a loan of Rs. 230 crore to pay PF dues, gratuity etc., while the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has floated tenders seeking Rs. 150 crore loan towards working capital and partially to pay employees’ PF. The corporations will mortgage buses or other property to raise loans. BMTC has outstanding due of Rs. 320 crore towards payment of employee PF. Managing director C. Shikha said: “We planned to borrow before the outbreak of COVID-19 to make payments towards outstanding PFs, as payment delays attract high interests. Loan repayment will be done on a quarterly basis. Like in previous times, we will mortgage buses as per the terms and conditions of the banks.” Credit ratings She also maintained that the BMTC has improved its credit ratings and hopes for a reduction of interest rates charged by banks. In the previous fiscal, the BMTC had borrowed loans to induct 350-odd new diesel buses. However, for this financial year, citing poor finances and directions from the State government, the BMTC has decided not to procure new buses. However, it plans to induct and operate 2,000 new buses in the next fiscal, including 500 electric buses on a lease basis. Shivyogi C. Kalasad, MD of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), said due to COVID-19, the corporation has suffered over Rs. 1,500 crore revenue loss and can meet operational expenses that include fuel cost, maintenance and others, by borrowing Rs. 150 crore in the first phase and Rs. 100 crore later. “Compared to other corporations, our PF dues are not as high. However, due to huge revenue loss there is shortfall in money required for operational expenses. We are yet to recover from losses induced by the pandemic. At this stage, it is very difficult to predict when everything will be normal,” said the official. Cumulative borrowing In November, while requesting the State government to release funds to pay staff salaries, all four corporations had said that they require Rs. 2,234.92 crore for pending fuel purchase cost, PF, benefits of retired employees, and others. As of September, the corporations had cumulatively borrowed Rs. 1,569.33 crore from banks and financial institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rtcs-to-raise-loans-to-pay-pf-and-other-dues/article33398799.ece
23 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Technical glitch halts property registration||Registration of properties across Karnataka came to a standstill on Tuesday following a glitch in the Kaveri software. The server that handles the verification process for registrations using Kaveri software and the portal that the Revenue Department uses for registrations developed a technical snag on Monday evening. Most of the 252 sub-registrar’s offices in the State saw long queues of people wanting to register their properties, to no avail. It was only around 6.20 p.m. on Tuesday that the problem was fixed and the registrations opened for the day, with only 10 minutes left for the work to close for the day. K.P. Mohan Raj, Inspector-General of Registrations and Commissioner of Stamps, said now that the issue was sorted out, registrations would resume on Wednesday. Senior officials in the department said though the issue was flagged to the Centre for Development for Advanced Computing (C-DAC) on Monday itself, precious time was lost, leading to halting of registrations for an entire day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/glitch-halts-property-registrations/article33398482.ece

Addressing reporters after visiting the Tirunelveli junction bus stand under construction as part of the ‘Smart City’ programme ahead of her electioneering in the district, Ms. Kanimozhi said the manifesto would be prepared after soliciting views of people from various walks of life, including those in the southern districts. Asked about Makkal Needhi Maiam’s manifesto, which has promised salary for homemakers and laptop for every house with high-speed internet connectivity, among other pledges, Ms. Kanimozhi said, “I can speak only about our manifesto which will be ready by January-end.” On the government’s decision to give Rs. 2,500 as ‘Pongal gift’ to families having rice ration cards, the MP said ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, DMK president M.K. Stalin had been appealing to the government to give Rs. 5,000 per family to help them tide over the crisis. The ‘Pongal gift’ had been announced since the CM had started his election campaign, she charged. “But the people of Tamil Nadu, who are keen on seeing the DMK in power again to enjoy good governance, will not waste their votes this time by casting them in favour of some other party,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dmks-manifesto-will-be-ready-by-the-end-of-january-kanimozhi/article33398833.ece
23 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||I was barred from visit to U.P. school, says Sisodia||Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia was on Tuesday allegedly prevented from visiting a government school in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh police. The AAP leader said he had landed in Lucknow after accepting a challenge by Uttar Pradesh Education Minister Satish Dwivedi, who recently in a war of words between the two parties, had invited Mr. Sisodia to visit his State to compare the models of education in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. As quoted by a news agency, Mr. Dwivedi had on December 15 invited Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Deputy Mr. Sisodia to visit schools in Uttar Pradesh, and said it would open their eyes. ‘Can’t roam free’ On Tuesday, after attending a press conference, Mr. Sisodia’s car was not allowed to pass by the police following which he spoke to a senior police officer on phone, kept on speaker mode. “I can’t roam free in Lucknow? Am I a criminal,” Mr. Sisodia asked the police officer on the phone. He told the journalists that the police commissioner had told him he needed to seek permission if he wanted to roam freely in the Uttar Pradesh capital. Mr. Sisodia alleged that the police were preventing him from visiting the school as the government wanted to hide the “Yogi Model”. “They don’t want us to see the schools. It means BJP government, Yogi Model...is admitting that even the schools in the capital [Lucknow] are bad,” Mr. Sisodia said from his car. Mr. Sisodia said he had come to Lucknow, accepting Mr. Dwivedi’s challenge, to debate on “Kejriwal Model vs Yogi Model”. He had reached Lucknow with AAP’s U.P. in charge and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh. Mr. Sisodia also showed an 18-month-old video on the condition of schools in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-was-barred-from-visit-to-up-school-says-sisodia/article33398856.ece
23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Farmers to take a call on govt. offer for talks today||He added that the agitation would be further intensified and the unions would write to the Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom to persuade Prime Minister Boris Johnson to not to accept the invitation for the Republic Day. The Working Group of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination Committee, in a statement, said the Agriculture Ministry’s letter showed that the government was disinterested in solving the demands of the farmers. ‘Flawed objectives’ “The problem in the laws lies in their objectives where the corporates will have legal rights to engage farmers in contracts and to stock and black-market food...The Agriculture Minister has deliberately twisted facts on the talks and claimed modesty and open mindedness. The facts are that AIKSCC and all others have sent lakhs of representations for repeal which the government has ignored,” said the statement. All-India Kisan Sabha finance secretary and former CPI (M) MLA P. Krishna Prasad said the government, and not the farmers, was responsible for the stalemate. He argued that Union Agriculture Minister Narendar Tomar and Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had, in a meeting on December 5, assured the farmer unions to discuss their demand for withdrawal of three laws with the Cabinet and get back to them on December 9, but Home Minister Amit Shah intervened to offer clause-by-clause discussion. “The Home Minister has no role in the discussions since it was not a law and order problem. If what Mr. Shah said was the opinion of the Cabinet then why were the two ministers kept out of the meeting,” asked Mr. Prasad. He added that the government holding parallel discussions with the farmer organisations, which are not part of agitation, was “morally wrong” and a deliberate attempt to show that farmers unions were divided. ‘Laws are pro-farmer’ Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, in an interaction with the members of the International media from the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of South Asia, reiterated that agricultural reforms were in the interest of farmers and would bring about a new era in Indian agriculture. He added that government has had many rounds of talks with farmer unions and was willing to continue the dialogue on contentious issues, clause-by-clause, with an open mind. The Minister reiterated that the reform laws was not an overnight decision but it had gone through more than two decades of deliberations, suggested by numerous experts and recommendations by varied committees and groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-to-decide-on-discussions-today/article33398261.ece
23 December 2020||Bengaluru,||HC rider on transactions under farm land ordinance||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday said that any further steps taken based on the Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated on November 2 to ease the norms on purchase of farm land by non-agriculturists, would be subject to further orders to be passed by the court. The court also directed the State government to notify this to the parties concerned with such transactions. It was hearing a batch of PIL petitions questioning the constitutional validity of the Ordinance. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the interim order while hearing petitions filed by Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Hasiru Sene, All -India Kisan Sabha, Bharatiya Kisan Sangha, Karnataka Pradesh, Hind Mazdoor Kisan Panchayat, and others. The Bench said it could not pass an interim order staying an Ordinance, which has the safe force of enactment by a legislature, in view of the apex court’s judgments. The Bench stated that the court could not pass an order restraining the legislature from taking up a Bill placed before it and also could not direct the Governor not to take further action on the basis of a Bill passed by both Houses of legislature. Raising several legal issues, the petitioners contended that the amendments would affect the farming community, particularly small farmers. They said the removal of restrictions would result in private companies taking over agricultural lands and later converting them for non-agricultural purposes as no ceiling was fixed in the Ordinance for purchase by private entities. The Ordinance amended the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, which had imposed severe restrictions on the purchase of agricultural lands, making it difficult for persons without such lands to purchase them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-puts-rider-on-transactions-based-on-farmland-ordinance/article33398263.ece
23 December 2020||SANGAREDDY,||Three die, two fall ill after consuming roti||Three persons died and two others fell ill after consuming rotis prepared at home. The condition of the two who fell ill after consuming the rotis is serious. The incident took place at Palvatla village in Vatpally mandal of Sangareddy district late on Monday night. According to the police, one Shankaramma of the village died on December 13. It was suspected that Shankaramma got some jowar flour from someone in the village, prepared rotis, consumed them and died, apparently due to food poisoning. Some of the family members ate rotis prepared from the remaining jowar on Monday. After that, three of the family members — two admitted at Sangareddy government hospital and one at Gandhi Hospital — died while two others were admitted to a private hospital at Hyderabad and their condition is stated to be critical. Those who died were identified as Sushila (60) Chandramouli (55) and Srisailam (45). Two others, Anasuya (50) and Saritha (45) are undergoing treatment at the Hyderabad hospital. All the family members staying outside the village came to attend the last rituals of Shankaramma and got food poisoning after consuming the jowar rotis. Fortunately, those who preferred to eat rice at the rituals were saved from the poisoning. It was alleged that the staff at the government hospital demanded bribe and collected a portion of the amount for conducting the post-mortem of Sushila and Chandramouli. However, with the intervention of higher officials, the amount was returned to the family of victims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/three-die-two-fall-ill-after-consuming-roti/article33398273.ece

The positive samples were sent to the National Centre for Disease Control for detecting the new strain, she said. With the new guidelines, several hundred passengers were tested at various airports. The process took many hours, resulting in chaos and confusion at several airports, including Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan detailed the comprehensive guidelines not just for those arriving from the U.K. till the travel ban comes into force at midnight, but also for passengers who came from, or through, the U.K. from November 25 to December 23. Mr Bhushan said passenger lists will be shared with the States and Union Territories so that their samples are collected for testing. “Contact tracing will be done in positive cases,” he said. He added that all passengers coming from the U.K. between December 21-23 will be subjected to RT-PCR test on arrival and in case of a positive sample, it is recommended that spike gene-based RT-PCR test should also be performed by an appropriate laboratory. The Ministry’s guidelines mandate that if the genomic sequencing of a positive patient from UK indicates the presence of new variant of SARS-CoV-2, then the patient will remain in a separate isolation unit while necessary treatment as per the existing protocol will be given. International travellers from the U.K. who arrived in India from November 25 to December 8, will be contacted by District Surveillance Officers and advised to self-monitor their health. The SOP explains that passengers testing positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility in a separate (isolation) unit coordinated by the respective State Health Authorities. They would earmark specific facilities for such isolation and treatment. “Necessary action to send the samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune or any other appropriate lab for genomic sequencing will be initiated at the facility level ,” notes the SOP. However, if the genomic sequencing indicates the presence of new variant of SARS-CoV-2 then the patient will continue to be treated at a separate isolation unit.

The regional parties described the results as a people’s verdict against the Centre’s decision to scrap the special status of J&K in August last year.  “The DDC election results are encouraging. The result is a clear message of the people that they don’t accept the changes made by the BJP on Article 370. We have faced every obstacle, illegal detentions, agency threats and pressures, our candidates were locked up to stop them campaigning and from all this we are emerging victorious,” NC vice-president Omar Abdullah said.   In a series of tweets, Ms. Mufti said: “DDC results have made it clear that people of J&K voted en masse for the PAGD thus rejecting the unconstitutional decision to abrogate Article 370. They have overwhelmingly supported PAGD, which stands for restoration of J&Ks special status.” The BJP, however, described the results as a “victory for democracy” and said it was “significant for the party to establish base in Kashmir too”. “There were forces who did not want democracy to take roots in Kashmir. First and foremost, the DDC elections is a win for democracy. Two, the BJP party that had around 5,000 votes in Kashmir has over 3.5 lakh membership today and was evident from the victories there,” senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Kavinder Gupta said.

The SIT has arrested the accused from Jadupur village and secured his custody for further questioning. The murder triggered a political controversy after the parents tried to immolate themselves in front of the Odisha Assembly last month. Opposition BJP and the Congress had come out with all guns blazing to corner the Naveen Patnaik government.

23 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Governor says no to Kerala House session||The State government has not received the gubernatorial consent to convene the Assembly on Wednesday to "discuss and reject" the new Central farm laws. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has reportedly asked the government to convince him of the "emergency" that warranted an extraordinary one-day session. He had assented to the convening of the Assembly on January 8 for the Budget session. Merit questioned The government had sought the approval of Mr. Khan to convene the Assembly to pass a unanimous resolution against the Centre's farm laws. The Governor reportedly questioned the merit of the request. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has deemed Mr. Khan's action as unconstitutional. The Governor has no discretionary power in the matter. The government enjoys a clear majority in the Assembly. The Governor cannot deny it the right to assemble the House. Mr. Khan's "refusal" to grant permission to gather the Assembly seemed to have set the stage for another tug-of-war between Raj Bhavan and the State government on whether the legislature could challenge the constitutional validity of the acts of Parliament. The matter had come to a head in January when Mr. Khan felt the government had overreached itself by passing a unanimous resolution in the Assembly against the Centre's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar portrayed the Governor's refusal as extraordinary. Deputy Leader of the Opposition K. C. Joseph, MLA, said the Governor had exceeded his constitutional bounds. The summoning of the Assembly was the inalienable prerogative of the government. The Governor was ill-advised to deny the Cabinet, he said. Opposition charge Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the MLAs should convene in the Assembly lounge and pass the resolution against the farm laws to protest against the Governor's undemocratic action. Bharatiya Janata Party State president K. Surendran, sole BJP legislator O. Rajagopal and Union Minister for External Affairs V.

23 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||TS Power staff urge govt. to protect their interests||Telangana Electricity Engineers Association (TEEA) and Assistant Engineers Association (TEAEA) have requested the State government to explore possibilities of resolution to the issue of division of employees between the power utilities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana so that injustice is not caused to Telangana employees. Self-respect meet The two engineers associations and other employees of the power utilities participated in a self-respect meet here on Tuesday after the recent Supreme Court verdict on the division of employees upholding the report of the Justice D.M. Dhamadhikari (One Man) Committee. They expressed dismay over the apex court view stating that it had denied natural justice to Telangana employees who were subjected to discrimination in combined AP. Speaking at the meet president of TEEA N. Shivaji alleged that the One Man Committee had acted only to benefit the AP employees at the cost of Telangana staff. He appealed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy and the managements of the power utilities to find a solution to the issue so that injustice was not done to them (Telangana employees). He observed that the apex court verdict had reiterated the history one more time that every system including courts would render injustice to Telangana employees on any dispute between AP and Telangana staff. He also cited the example of Srikrishna Committee report, particularly Chapter 8 of it, to explain how the systems work against the interests of Telangana. Unfortunately, the trend was continuing even after formation of Telangana State and the AP power utilities had won the case in the apex court on technical grounds as the Telangana utilities’ arguments for natural justice in the background of separate statehood demand fell on deaf ears, Mr. Shivaji said. He felt that the apex court verdict had made it clear that none of the arguments by Telangana side were given any weightage as both the One Man panel and the apex court had made up their mind based on GOs issued in combined AP. Both the One Man panel and the apex court did not give any credence to the A.P. Reorganisation Act and the process for division of employees of public sector undertakings and government employees, the functionaries of the two association said. They pointed out that the apex court had allowed the plea of AP utilities to change the initial ‘final’ report of the One Man panel and dismissed the plea of Telangana utilities on the revised ‘final’ report.  The apex court verdict had reiterated one more time that every system including courts would render injustice to Telangana employees on any dispute between AP and Telangana staff. N.

23 December 2020||Lucknow,||3 more held under new U.P. ordinance||Police in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh have arrested three persons under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. The three accused, identified as Bal Chand Jaiswal, Gopal Prajapati and Neeraj Kumar, were allegedly holding a prayer meeting in the house of Tribhuvan Yadav, when a resident nearby lodged a complaint against them accusing them of trying to convert people to Christianity. 12 FIRs filed With this, at least 12 FIRs have been registered under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, and 43 persons have been arrested since November 27. The arrests in Azamgarh were made by Didarganj police. Station House Officer Didarganj Santosh Singh, when asked if the police had intervened, said the complaint was filed by the person who was allegedly being converted. Earlier, 13 persons were arrested in Sitapur, 10 in Mau, four in Gautam Buddha Nagar, six in Etah, three in Azamgarh, two in Moradabad (both are out on bail), one each in Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Bijnor, Kannauj and Hardoi. Two persons accused of trying to convert a Hindu woman to their religion in Muzaffarnagar got relief from the Allahabad High Court which ordered a stay on their arrest last Friday. The ordinance lays down strict action, including cancellation of registration of social organisations conducting mass conversions. Mass conversions would invite a jail term of not less than three years and up to 10 years and a fine of Rs. 50,000. The ordinance mainly envisages that no person shall convert, either directly or indirectly from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion. The onus to prove that the conversion has not been done forcibly will lie on the person accused of the act and the convert, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-more-held-under-new-up-ordinance/article33398297.ece

He urged people who experienced symptoms not to avoid testing. “Stay careful. It is important to wear masks,” he said. Nearly 83% of the tests were done at government laboratories, he said, adding that people could walk in and get tested at night, too. The number of active cases stood at 9,391.

23 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Koyambedu flower market traders want timings extended||The flower section at Koyambedu market started functioning since Monday, after nearly eight months. This was the last section of the market waiting to be reopened at the market. Sales have picked up at the market as most shops have shifted to the market, said merchants. However, traders want the working hours of the market to be extended till 5 p.m. The flower market was the first section to be shifted out of Koyambedu during April-end when the market turned into COVID-19 hot spot. Members of the Koyambedu Wholesale Flower Merchants Association said 600 flower shops functioning at various places of the city, including the Vanagaram temporary market, have moved back to Koyambedu. They have been instructed to follow safety norms and unauthorised shops were not allowed. Although the market has been receiving limited stock of flowers owing to rains and mist this month, merchants made brisk sales as there was demand for flowers. The price of jasmines touched Rs. 900-Rs. 1,000 a kg. The market received only up to one tonne jasmine flowers from neighbouring districts as they were out of season. Chennai mostly received roses and marigold from places such as Salem, Krishnagiri, Hosur and parts of Andhra Pradesh. But these were sold at double the normal price because of low yield and high demand, said the merchants. A. Manoharan, a flower wholesaler, said: “Our business hours begin only around early morning hours unlike other sections. The market management committee must consider extending working hours till 5 p.m. for retailers to complete purchase.” Many issues, particularly encroachments, have been resolved. However, most shops were operating without proper drinking water facility. The authorities concerned must shift shops opened along Kaliamman Koil Street, he added. Traders wanted buses to have a stop at the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/koyambedu-flower-market-traders-want-timings-extended/article33398816.ece
23 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro Rail to hold phase I extension trial run on Dec. 26||Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) will start trial runs on phase I extension in the northern parts of the city from Saturday. It plans to throw it open to public by January end. On Friday, the locomotive will run on the 9-km stretch from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar, which has both underground and elevated stations. Subsequently, a train will be operated on Saturday, according to CMRL officials. “On Thursday, equipment called ‘structure gauge’ will run through this stretch and then the locomotive and the train. The structure gauge is to ensure that the stations are built with the right measurement without any infringement. Even if there are any infringements, it can be found and corrected so that the locomotive engine or the train don’t suffer any damage during the trial runs,” an official said. The trial runs with trains that begin on Saturday will continue until the stretch is operationalised by January end. Sources said that a signalling test would be carried out on Sunday or Monday. “During these trial runs, the functioning of different systems will be checked on a daily basis and the glitches that emerge will be resolved at this stage itself,” another official said. Though the CMRL has been planning to open this stretch to the public next month, sources said it would be challenging to finish the construction of all stations by then. “Then, we have to get the certification from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety. It may be quite difficult to finish the whole process by the end of January,” another source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-rail-to-hold-phase-i-extension-trial-run-on-dec-26/article33398830.ece
23 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘EC will take steps to ensure inducement-free elections’||Pointing out that Tamil Nadu elections always have the element of “expenditure sensitivity”, Secretary General of the Election Commission of India (EC), Umesh Sinha, on Tuesday said comprehensive preparation would be done to make the elections inducement-free and influence-free. Mr. Sinha, who was in Chennai with a high-level delegation to assess the poll preparations, told journalists that a strict network of surveillance would be established for the purpose of conducting elections free of inducement and influence. He said the Election Commission had a meeting with enforcement agencies of the State and Central government. “The influence by way of money or goodies or liquor or other things has to be stopped and the Commission will come out with heavy hands against those entities who try to influence the voters,” Mr. Sinha said. He released the guidelines for VVPAT and the CD for creation of awareness. Mr. Sinha said he had asked Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer, Satyabrata Sahoo, to work with other stakeholders, civil societies and educational institutions to launch a good awareness campaign so that voters do not get induced. Noting that elections in Tamil Nadu had been peaceful by and large, he said the Commission would prepare security management issues, law and order problems and identify the vulnerable pockets. “Vulnerability mapping of each and every police station is done. Intimidators will be identified and the exercise will address weaker sections if they have any problem,” he explained. Asked about the request of the ruling AIADMK for holding early elections, he said many factors would be considered while finalising the date. “May 24, 2021 is the day when the expiry of the [term of current] House happens. We will take a call when it comes. It is too early to predict the date,” he said. Asked about the demand of political parties that elections should be held in a single phase, he said the inputs will be given to the Election Commission. Mr. Sinha said there was a plan to increase the polling stations in the State and all the polling stations that had more than 1,000 voters would be split. “If possible there will be a separate room on the same premises or in the nearby area,” he said. He said all the preparations had been done keeping in mind that COVID-19 could remain during the election. “We are happy to witness the declining trend and in Tamil Nadu it has been contained to a great extent. Personal protective equipment, masks and sanitisers would be kept,” he said. The Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar had been asked to visit the State to share his experience on how they prepared for a COVID-19 safe election. All polling stations must have facilities such as ramp, wheelchairs and volunteers to help elderly people and people with physical disabilities, waiting areas with proper sheds so that people need not stand in queue in summer. Medical kits, ORS and ambulance facilities should be provided as well. Postal ballot Mr. Sinha said the option of postal ballot would be provided to those aged above 80 and people with disabilities in the 2021 Assembly election. Asked about the doubts raised by some political parties over the transparency of ballot votes, he said a proper protocol would be developed for the purpose and to find out whether a particular person had applied for postal vote. “Our polling official will go to their place. It will be like a mobile polling station and they will be able to vote in their own place with [COVID1-19] protocol and safety measures. If political parties want to send their representatives, they are most welcome,” said Mr Sinha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ec-will-take-steps-to-ensure-inducement-free-elections/article33398421.ece
23 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MNM, Congress jostling for ‘Centrist’ space in T.N.||Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan’s attempt to lay claim to the political legacy of former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran drew severe criticism from the AIADMK. But his other comment, that he considers himself to be ‘Gandhi’s B team’, went under the radar. Some political observers feel Mr. Haasan’s habit of extolling Mahatma Gandhi and invoking the idea of “unity in diversity” makes him an ideal Congressman. A few in the MNM hope that the Congress and Mr. Haasan could work together. Contending that there were a lot of ideological similarities between the MNM and the Congress, MNM general secretary C.K. Kumaravel claimed that the grand old party had lost its relevance in State elections. The Congress, according to him, remains relevant only in national politics. “When people vote in the Lok Sabha election, they consider the Congress. But in a State election, they [Congress] are not as relevant. People in Tamil Nadu don’t like the high-command approach visible in national parties,” he claimed. He said there was a possibility of the two parties working together. “Definitely, synergy is possible. If their leadership approaches our leader, he will take a call then,” he added. Despite agreeing about the ideological similarities between the Congress and the MNM, All India Congress Committee in-charge for Tamil Nadu, Goa and Puducherry Dinesh Gundu Rao said the Congress would not be negatively impacted by the MNM. ‘In DMK alliance’ “Ideologically, I don’t think we have any differences. As far as alliance goes, we have been in an alliance with the DMK and other parties for a long time. The question only arises when Mr. Haasan wants to join our alliance or we want to quit it. We are not looking to leave the alliance [with the DMK],” he said. Asked if the Congress was wary of Mr. Haasan, he said, “The Congress has its own space in Tamil Nadu. Those who don’t like the communal ideology the BJP represents, those who are against the AIADMK, and those who want a new government… will vote for the DMK-Congress alliance. I don’t see Mr. Haasan making much of an impact on our vote bank.” “Whether he is individually strong enough to make a difference…that is one thing. If you don’t have that strength, you should think of being with people who are closer to your ideology. We may be sharing the same space but people are going to look at what difference being alone would make ,” Mr. Rao added.

23 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Activists complain about encroachment of marshland||Activists and nature enthusiasts are worried as a portion of the Pallikaranai marshland, inside the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT) at Sholinganallur, has been encroached by some firms. The portion of the land, adjoining the marshland, was allotted to ELCOT a decade ago. “However, slowly some firms started encroaching the waterbodies by dumping construction debris. Some portions of the wetland have disappeared already,” said Seshan Ezhumalai, a 72-year old member of Environmental Monitoring Administration Investigation (EMAI), who has been fighting to conserve nature for many years. He said the waterbody was a source of sustenance for ducks and other water birds. “Until a year ago, I spotted flamingoes, varieties of ducks, purple moorhen and other winged friends. There were a lot of ducks in adjoining areas and now everything has come to the waterbodies in ELCOT. It was a beautiful place to visit,” T. Murugavel, another member of EMAI. However, over the past one year, some firms have started encroaching it. “We have to stop this. I will approach the Madras High Court to stop the encroachment and conserve the waterbodies. Many waterbodies, including those in North Chennai, have been encroached. This will lead to a dip in water level and biodiversity will be disturbed. During monsoon, it will lead to flooding,” added Mr. Seshan. He pointed out that the numbers of birds visiting Pallikaranai marshland had reduced drastically this year. “From October to May, there used to be many birds. This time we don’t see many of them,” he lamented. Sources in Forest department said the area comes under ELCOT. “We do nab those who hunt birds, but we are not able to do it officially. We have been asking them to hand over the waterbodies to us,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/activists-complain-about-encroachment-of-marshland/article33398814.ece

From baggage transportation to providing support services to airlines on tarmac, ground handling companies offer a host of services. Airport sources said the existing agency’s tenure ends this month. “The contract period got over and the firm was given extension till the end of this month. Another firm is likely to take over from next month,” an airport source said. But airlines have informed the Airport Authority of India (AAI) that such a sudden change would impact flight and cargo operations and even flight schedule and passengers as well. “They are unhappy and say there should be at least a transition time for the other company to take over. Talks are going on. It is not clear when the new company may take over,” another source said. From procuring additional equipment to manpower, there is a massive amount of work involved for the new company before taking over. An abrupt takeover would affect them, say airlines. Disruption feared “There are nearly 600-700 flights a month the agency will have to handle and for this, it will need to procure additional equipment, manpower and train its staff. This will take a minimum of 3-6 months. “If this is done in a rushed manner, then, the impact could even extend to some flights getting cancelled leading to disruptions for passengers,” an airline official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/airport-may-see-new-ground-handling-agency/article33398827.ece

In a statement, the artistes, including writers Mu. Ramasamy and Mangai, film actor Pasupathy, theatre artistes Pralayan and Hans Kaushik and dancers Madhusree and Anoushka Kurien, said they were perturbed by the manner in which these laws were hastily passed during the COVID-19 pandemic without a proper consultation with the stakeholders. These laws that aim at altering the legal framework of India’s agricultural policies would gravely impact small holders and marginal farmers. “Dismantling the minimum support price system will leave them extremely vulnerable to competition from large corporate houses. Disabling the right to legal recourse, by exclusion of adjudication by the judiciary, is unprecedented and smacks of authoritarianism,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/artistes-back-farmers-stir/article33398834.ece

Balakrishnan, said here on Tuesday. 10,000 teams Mr. Balakrishnan told reporters that 10,000 teams formed by the party would distribute nearly 50 lakh pamphlets calling for the ouster of the AIADMK government in the State, rejection of the BJP, and change of government in the State. The teams would meet people in rural and urban areas. The CPI (M) leader alleged that the AIADMK government had discarded the welfare of the State and its people and was supporting the BJP government at the Centre only to remain in power. The policies of the Central government were against the welfare of the farmers and workers, he said. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the CPI (M) urged the government to give Rs. 5,000 a month on each PDS card in the State as compensation as there were many people without work. But the Chief Minister did not agree to it. Now, he has announced Rs. 2,500 cash gift for Pongal. The Chief Minister announced it at the launch of his election campaign keeping in mind the Assembly elections. The CPI (M) continued to insist that the government give Rs. 5,000, he said. Mr. Balakrishnan said that if actor Rajinikanth started a political party it would not affect the electoral prospects of the DMK alliance. Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam would only split votes. That is why Mr. Haasan’s party is BJP’s “B” team, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-m-to-launch-state-wide-door-to-door-campaign/article33398480.ece
23 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Hike in steel, cement prices affects government contract works||The Coimbatore Corporation Contractors’ Association has said that government civil contract works across the State are hit because of the steep hike in steel and cement prices. The Association pointed out that the price of steel, which was Rs. 36 a kg was now Rs. 55 a kg. The prices of TMT rod, caustic iron and bearing iron have also gone up. Further, cement prices have spiralled in the last six months. In the last three months alone, the price of steel increased by Rs. 10,000 per tonne. Due to the price hike, construction of small houses under the Government subsidy scheme were severely affected. While government contract works are carried out for a profit of 5 %, the project estimates are likely to escalate 45 % because of the input price increase. Contractors who have been contracted through e-tender are most affected by the price hike. If the State and Central governments fail to control the price hike, the contractors have to face huge losses, the Association said. Contractors in various government projects, including the Public Works, State Highways and Rural Development agencies, are affected. At the State level, it is estimated that contract works worth about Rs. 3,000 crore awarded by various Departments of the government are hit. The Association has written to the Central and State governments in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hike-in-steel-cement-prices-affects-government-contract-works/article33398843.ece

The party’s meeting was held here on Monday in which its State Deputy General Secretary and Tiruppur MP K. Subbarayan took part and explained the decisions taken in the meeting. A resolution passed in the meeting urged the Centre to roll back the recent hike in LPG cylinder price that was increased by Rs. 100 in the past 15 days. “Saying that the government is providing subsidy, the price of LPG has doubled, causing hardship to people,” the resolution said. The resolution said that in the absence of alternative fuel, people were forced to spend more on cylinders. Another resolution wanted the three farm laws revoked as it favoured only the corporate companies. The resolution also expressed solidarity with the protesting farmers in Delhi from November 26 and condemned Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for his continuous support to the laws. The Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, envisaged withdrawal of all subsidies which would affect the household, power looms and farmers. Hence the bill should not be passed, the resolution said. A resolution said the State government was keen on privatising the electricity board and it attempted to outsource the maintenance of substations in the State. The government should hold talks with the protesting workers and arrive at a solution, the resolution urged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-urges-centre-to-roll-back-increase-in-lpg-price/article33398461.ece

23 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Name boards of archaeological sites installed at five places||Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has installed name boards to indicate the location of 12 prominent archaeological sites across the district at five public places with an aim to create awareness of preserving these sites and promote tourism. Deputy Director of Archaeology R. Sivanandam said that the name boards had been erected at prominent public places – M.G.R. Bus Stand at Mattuthavani, near airport, Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple complex, Thirumalai Nayak Palace and opposite the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. The name boards indicate the location of 12 archaeological sites recognised by either Archaeology Department or Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) – Thirumalai Nayak Palace, Yanaimalai, Arittapatti, Tirupparankundram, Mangulam, Kunnathur, Tiruvadavur, Keelavalavu, Alagarmalai, Keezhakuyilkudi, Kongar Puliyankulam and Keeladi excavation site. The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court had earlier directed the ASI and Archaeology Department to install name boards of archaeological sites at prominent sites. “This was done as part of the State-wide initiative of the department. Our aim is to promote the less prominent archaeological sites in the district,” he said. Although the installation of name boards at five public places was a welcome step, there was a need to have a multi-dimensional approach to promote the archaeological sites in the district, said G. Vasudevan, an executive committee member of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. “Separate brochures with directions and detailed information about important archaeological sites can be distributed at the railway station, airport and hotels. A separate website on important archaeological sites of the district must be created to promote tourism,” he added. Most of these archaeological sites lacked basic infrastructure, said K.P. Bharathi, programme leader, DHAN Foundation. “There was a need to build toilets and provide drinking water facilities at these sites. Proper approach roads also have to be constructed to ensure easy access to these sites,” he said. Mr. Vasudevan said that boards with detailed information on the significance of the archaeological sites had to be installed at these sites. Tourism interpretation centres could also be established at these places by engaging local people, suggested Mr. Bharathi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/name-boards-of-archaeological-sites-installed-at-five-places/article33398936.ece
23 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC restrains SPP from discharging his duties||After certain allegations were made against a Special Public Prosecutor for the Madurai Special Court under the Essential Commodities and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday restrained him from discharging his duties as SPP. The court was hearing the petition filed by advocate B. Pandiarajan of Madurai. He said that he regularly appears before the Special Court. He complained that Special Public Prosecutor P. Seetharaman was not performing his duties properly and this resulted in many accused in NDPS cases to walk free. The petitioner sought action be taken against the SPP. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi taking cognisance of the submission observed that it was alleged that the SPP would get final reports from the police and not file them on time before the court in order to enable the accused to get statutory bail for extraneous considerations. In one particular case, the court had taken a serious view of the SPP’s conduct and had recorded his undertaking that he would ensure that the final reports would be filed on time. However, he has continued to repeat the same and has not changed his attitude, the court observed. Taking note of the fact that in 43 NDPS cases, the accused were granted statutory bail as the final report was not filed on time, the court said that prima facie the SPP was not discharging his duty properly and therefore should be restrained from continuing. The court directed the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption to look into the details of the wealth amassed by him and his family members and file a report before the court. “This is only one instance. We do not know how many such people are functioning like this”, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-restrains-spp-from-discharging-his-duties/article33398933.ece

When the tank runs dry, people worship ‘Purusha Mirugam’ found on top of the sluice, as there is a belief that it could bring a spell of rain. The two check dams across the Vaigai – Sitranai and Peranai – have great historical significance. Peranai was built during the Pandya period and renovated under the colonial rule. Inscriptions about Sitranai are found at a temple in Kuruvithurai. Madurai was an important trade centre. As part of the tour, the participants also travelled to caves with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions at Keezhakuyilkudi, Muthupatti, Karungalakudi and Meenakshipuram (Mangulam). The inscriptions at Mangulam date back to the third century BCE. The cave at Karungalakudi has a rock art depicting a bull. A sculpture of a Tirthankara can be found in Muthupatti cave.

23 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||When will university for Indian medicine be set up, HC asks||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to submit the dates and events pertaining to the steps initiated towards the establishment of a university for Indian Medicine at Chettikulam in Tirunelveli district, as per an earlier direction of the High Court. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the court in an order dated 2016 had already issued a direction to establish the university for Indian medicine. No steps have been initiated in this regard even after four years. The State has to respond to the issue on December 23, the judges said. In 2016, the court had directed the State government to examine the feasibility of relocating the Siddha Medical College and Hospital to a land of a larger extent, where the institution could be developed into a State of the art institution with a possibility of elevating it to the status of an University. In the present case, the court restrained the authorities from demolishing existing buildings and other places of common amenities in the college premises, to put up new buildings in the name of expansion. The funds could instead be utilised for the establishment of the new university in Chettikulam, the court said. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by S. Vijai Vikraman, a former student of Siddha Medical College and Hospital, Palayamkottai. He sought a direction to restrain the authorities concerned from demolishing the existing buildings on the premises to build a new building.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/when-will-university-for-indian-medicine-be-set-up-hc-asks/article33398436.ece

Narayanasamy said here on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters after chairing a meeting of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) here, he said the SDMA decided to allow celebrations and gatherings in compliance with COVID-19 prevention norms. The meeting discussed an order issued by Collector Purva Garg on December 18 announcing that her office would not allow celebrations and gatherings to mark the upcoming festivals. The Chief Minister said the order was based on a Supreme Court judgment related to a fire accident and had nothing to do with COVID-19.

The court would hear a petition on Wednesday. Similarly, Christians could celebrate Christmas by following the norms. The Pongal could be celebrated by observing social distancing norms and other measures. Hotels could conduct normal events with a limit of 200 persons. A decision on the New Year celebrations at hotels would be taken only after further discussions.

But non-regular staff have to settle for much less,” said a lady conductor, who has been deployed on routes to Karaikal, Nagapattinam and ECR-Chennai. “The pay we take home is as low as Rs. 8,000, even after working for eleven years. We have resorted to a strike as we can’t put up with this injustice any more,” she said. On Tuesday, AINRC MLAs T.P.R. Selvame and N.S.

23 December 2020||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||Vehicle owners must remove bull-bars, crash guards: Collector||The district administration has directed vehicle owners to remove bull-bars and crash guards fixed in their vehicles as such extra fittings have been banned by the Union government. “Bull-bars and crash guards endanger the safety of passengers of the vehicles and those of other road users. Hence, they have been banned by the Union government through a notification issued in December 2017. The Madras High Court, while hearing a case, has also directed stern action against the use of such fittings,” Collector P.Uma Maheswari said in a press release. The use of such extra fittings change the design and dimensions of the vehicles and could transfer the crash energy from the crumble zone directly to the vehicle’s body and passengers in case of a crash. Bull bars and crash guards have been banned under Section 52 of the Motor Vehicles Act. They may also affect effective functioning of sensors of air bags meant for protecting passengers. They cause severe damage to the chassis of other vehicles, in case of a collision, and thereby increase the chances of fatalities. Besides, the extra fittings also increase the dimensions of the vehicle from the original manufactured structure, posing a threat to other road users, Ms.Uma Maheswari said urging vehicle owners to remove them immediately. Failure to do so will attract stern action from officials of the Police and Transport departments under Section 190 and 191 of the Motor Vehicles Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vehicle-owners-must-remove-bull-bars-crash-guards-collector/article33398414.ece

In a press release, L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (Buffer Zone), said the chairman of the committee, retired judge K. Venkatraman, would look into the complaints of the land owners, most of whom own resorts, in the Sigur plateau. Those who wish to submit their recommendations to the committee can list their grievances in detail and submit supporting documents to the committee. The residents have been asked to take four copies of the documents they wish to submit, translate these to English and submit after properly numbering their representations. They have also been asked to submit an affidavit, along with three copies to the committee. The documents can be submitted to the committee during the normal working hours and days between 10.30 a.m. in the morning and 5 p.m in the evening at the office located along the Gymkhana Club Road in Fingerpost, Udhagamandalam.

23 December 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Compensation for crop loss at initial stage under consideration||Farmers of Kuzhimathur hamlet at Thiruvaiyaru taluk in Thanjavur district will soon be the first to get compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana scheme for crop loss suffered during initial days of cultivation. Over 300 acres of paddy crop, just transplanted, at this revenue village submerged in water due to a sudden and heavy downpour this month. The water remained on the field for more than three to four days and efforts to drain the excess water went in vain.The transplanted crop perished, pushing the farmers into gloom. Subsequently, the issue was brought to the notice of the district administration and the insurance company implementing the PMFBY scheme in Thanjavur district at a meeting held last week at the Collectorate. Participating in the meeting, farmers’ representatives in the District Crop Insurance Coordination Committee demanded that the new provision included in the crop insurance scheme this year be invoked to decide the compensation amount for the Kuzhimathur farmers who had insured their crop. Cauvery Delta Farmers Association president A.K. Ravichandran and other representatives wanted the insurance company to invoke Section 5.1.2 of the PMFBY scheme covering yield losses due to non-preventable risks such as drought, dry spell, flood, inundation, widespread pests and disease attack, landslides, fire due to natural causes, lightning, storm, hailstorm and cyclone to calculate the loss. “When we insisted that half the total amount spent by the farmers to raise and sustain the crop till it got inundated in rainwater be extended as compensation, officials agreed to peg the compensation amount to around 25% of the amount,” Mr. Ravichandran said. However, the officials informed the farmers’ representatives that the exact amount of compensation could be arrived after field inspection, which was conducted at Kuzhimathur on December 21. The final amount to be disbursed as compensation to the farmers would be announced by month-end and credited in their bank accounts later, official sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensation-for-crop-loss-at-initial-stage-under-consideration/article33398399.ece
23 December 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||DMK makes baseless charges, says CM||The DMK, unable to digest good response to the ‘Pongal gift hamper’ announcement and the assistance of Rs. 2,500 to rice cardholders, was making baseless allegations against the AIADMK rule in a vain attempt to divert people’s attention, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said while speaking to reporters at the airport her eon Tuesday. Reacting to the “corruption list” submitted by DMK president M.K. Stalin to Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK that could not prove in courts the corruption charges it had earlier levelled against the AIADMK government had come up with similar charges once again. After the courts rejected the DMK’s charges terming them an attempt to gain political mileage, the Opposition had submitted a list to the Governor. While almost all former Ministers of the DMK were facing corruption charges and disproportionate assets cases, the party chief was making false allegations against the AIADMK. Justifying the State government’s decision to give Rs. 2,500 as ‘Pongal gift,’ Mr. Palaniswami said the decision to enliven the poor families during the festival was taken based on the recommendations of the Rengarajan Committee. He said there was no foul play in awarding road/bridges contracts to a company, reportedly owned by his relatives. “After submitting online tenders, the company became the successful bidder and paid online the Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) or gave bank guarantee. Every aspect of this tendering system is put in place in a transparent manner. I have no role in this connection and did not know if my relative was bidding to bag the tender,” he said and listed out the “inflated contracts” awarded during the DMK regime for laying roads between Arcot and Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Ramanathapuram, and between Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi. He said the State had attracted industrial investments to the extent of Rs. 60,000 crore even during the pandemic “thanks to investor-friendly policies”. On the DMK’s target of winning 200 Assembly constituencies in the ensuing poll, Mr. Palaniswai said they could even fix the target of winning 300 seats. “But the people, who have witnessed the DMK’s corrupt and authoritarian administration, will never support it as they (DMK men) are working for their people (families) and not for the people of Tamil Nadu. After Karunanidhi, Stalin has become the DMK president and is dreaming of becoming the CM. After Stalin, his son Udhayanidhi will be the DMK chief and will dream of becoming the CM with the support of his father. But the people hate the DMK’s dynasty politics so that they will never support it,” he said. While asserting that the people landing at Chennai airport were being screened and quarantined even as the COVID-19 variant threat was looming large, the CM appealed to the public to wear masks. “This is the only effective way available before us now to protect ourselves from the viral infection”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-makes-baseless-charges-cm/article33398448.ece

23 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Come Pongal, 2.4 MW solar plant may be on the go||Tiruchi Corporation plans to commission the 2.4 MW solar power plant at Panchapur on the outskirts of the city before Pongal. Installation and inter-linking of solar panels, construction of a power room and laying of cables are the major components of the Rs. 13.5-crore project. It is among the major projects being undertaken under the Smart City Initiative. A Chennai-based company, which was awarded the contract, is said to have completed nearly 90% of the work. A total of 7,440 solar power panels have been installed and inter-linking them is under way. Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that a team of electrical engineers were working on linking the solar panels. Similarly, bay extension work to connect electricity with the grid at the sub-station at MGR Nagar had been undertaken. “Almost all major works of the project have been completed. Only fine-tuning is pending. They are expected to be completed within two weeks. Chances are bright for commissioning the plant before Pongal,” Mr. Sivasubramanian said. A team of Non-Conventional Energy Sources of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) inspected the plant a few days ago to check the efficiency of the installation works. The team was expected to submit its report shortly. Once the Corporation received the green signal to connect the electricity with the grid, it would commission the plant. Mr. Sivasubramanian said the civic body had 18 high tension (HT) connections. Of them, 10 were for pumping stations of the underground drainage project and eight for supplying drinking water in the city. It consumed 22,000 MW hour unit a year and paid Rs. 16.57 crore a year on account of electricity charges. The solar power plant could meet 4,000 MW units a year and could help the civic body save Rs. 2.23 crore annually. It would be adjusted with power bills. The Commissioner said the contracted company would take care of operation and maintenance of the plant for 10 years. It would employ a team of personnel for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/come-pongal-24-mw-solar-plant-may-be-on-the-go/article33398405.ece

23 December 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||DMK helping people in distress: Kanimozhi||The DMK will keep its election manifesto ready by January-end, its women’s wing leader Kanimozhi said on Tuesday. Addressing reporters after visiting the Tirunelveli Junction bus stand under construction as part of the ‘Smart City’ programme ahead of her electioneering in the district, she said the manifesto would be prepared after soliciting views of people from various walks of life including those in southern districts. Asked about Makkal Needhi Maiam’s manifesto that promises salary for homemakers, laptop for every house with high speed Internet connectivity, she said: “I can speak only about our manifesto, which will be ready by January-end.” On the State Government’s decision to give Rs. 2,500 as Pongal gift to families having ‘rice ration cards,’ the MP said the DMK president M.K. Stalin was appealing to the Tamil Nadu Government ever since the COVID-19 outbreak to give Rs. 5,000 per family to tide over the situation. After remaining silent on the issue, the Pongal gift had been announced since Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had started his election campaign. “But the people of Tamil Nadu, who are keen on seeing the DMK in power again, will not waste their votes this time in favour of some other party. The DMK is helping the people in distress, particularly during the pandemic and its victory has been guaranteed,” she said. Commenting on the ongoing construction of the Tirunelveli Junction bus stand, she said the work was getting dragged for more than two years owing to poor planning and execution and the delay had badly hit traders who had shops in the bus terminus and the public. When asked about the case registered against her for organising the protest against the LPG cylinder price hike in Thoothukudi on Monday, she said such coercive measures would never deter the DMK cadre. Ms. Kanimozhi later interacted with the women at Gangaikondan, who shared their agony being caused by liquor, inflation and unemployment particularly after the pandemic outbreak. When she met the dhobis even as they were washing clothes at the Tamirabharani at Vannarpet in Palayamkottai shortly after noon, the labourers were surprised on seeing her. While spending a few minutes with them, she listened to their grievances. Besides visiting a couple of families affiliated to the DMK that have lost their breadwinners, the MP met traders, farmers, academics, sanitary workers and the youth during her campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-helping-people-in-distress-kanimozhi/article33398450.ece

Subbarayan demanded closure of the Tasmac outlet at Vavipalayam on Tuesday, as residents hoisted black flags in the locality condemning the outlet’s functioning. In a petition to District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan, the MP said the residents of Vavipalayam have opposed the Tasmac Shop No. 3942 since its inauguration in August. Following this, officials from the District Administration including Assistant Commissioner (Excise) and Tasmac District Manager assured the residents in writing on August 21 that the outlet will be relocated within 90 days, else it will be closed permanently, the petition said. However, the Tasmac outlet continues to function in the same location even after four months, Mr. Subbarayan said, urging the officials to close the shop at the earliest. According to A. Ramasamy, former district panchayat councillor and a member of the Struggle Committee formed against the Tasmac outlet, the residents of Ward No. 18 at Vavipalayam within Tiruppur Corporation limits have been opposing the outlet since August 15. “We already have two [Tasmac] shops in the area which are only one km apart,” he said and questioned the need for a third outlet. An additional Tasmac shop might increase the frequency of road accidents in the area, he alleged. Many residents of Vavipalayam hoisted black flags atop their residences and shops to show their opposition last week. “We will continue to protest till the Tasmac shop is closed,” Mr. Ramasamy said. A Tasmac official, on condition of anonymity, said that the owners of the building that houses the tasmac shop got a stay order from the Madras High Court on November 30, as the court found the request to shift the shop to be “politically motivated.” The shop is not located close to the existing two outlets and has not caused “any disturbance” to the public so far, the official claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-mp-residents-demand-closure-of-tasmac-outlet/article33398845.ece

23 December 2020||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Evict the corrupt, Kamal urges voters||Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan on Tuesday called upon the people to eradicate the corrupt who had plundered the State. Launching his election campaign in Villupuram, he said the time had come for the people to ensure that the corrupt were thrown out so that the future generations could be saved. “The MNM has entered politics to ensure clean administration and honest politics. We are enjoying the overwhelming support of the electorate, particularly women and youth, who will ensure the much-awaited change — clean administration in Tamil Nadu,” he said. “During the freedom struggle, the battle cry asked the colonial rulers to quit India. But after Independence, the country had been looted due to corrupt practices and the apt slogan now is to evict the plunderers. People must take all this into consideration and ensure a clean government,” he said. Referring to the tall claims by the State government that Tamil Nadu had emerged as the numero uno State in the country in various sectors, Mr. Haasan said the reality was different. Alleging that the State ranked number one in corruption, illicit sand mining and violation of human rights, he said a revolution had begun and the time had come for this anti-people government to be removed. The MNM would remain the voice of the farmers, weavers and honest people who had been sidelined by the government, he said and added that the party would select its candidates for the upcoming election with utmost care and caution. “If any allegation is made against a candidate, I will lose no time to recall him and this will be one of the conditions for selection of candidates,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/evict-the-corrupt-kamal-urges-voters/article33398997.ece

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. delays payment to water supply operation and maintenance contractor||When it comes to paying contractors, Coimbatore Corporation, it appears, is in default. Sources said that be it the solid waste management contractor, operating out of Vellalore, or the drinking water supply maintenance contractor, the Corporation has delayed payment. No disputes At least with the solid waste management contractor, the Corporation has had a few disputes. But with the contractor in-charge of operating and maintaining drinking water supply in the old area – 60 wards, the Corporation had no dispute but still delayed payment. Sources said the civic body owed the contractor, Suez India Pvt. Ltd., around Rs. 70 crore for 2019 and 2020. At the start of the 24x7 drinking water supply project to revamp water distribution network in the 60 wards, the Corporation also handed over the operation and maintenance of the existing distribution network to the company. This was in January 2019. Since then, the Corporation had not paid the contractor company, which had taken over the responsibility of attending to leaks and regulating supply to various areas. To operate and maintain the water supply, the contractor company had deployed around 150 valve operators, fitters, helpers and engineers at the over-head tanks.  The sources said the contractor company’s labour deployment was far higher than what the Corporation had deployed. The Corporation had since moved its staff to added areas. Retaining labour Since January 2019, the company had attended to 10,500 leaks and improved water supply in several pockets in the city while carrying out repair work. But with the Corporation delaying payment, it was becoming difficult for the company to retain the labour to carry out the maintenance work. The sources said the Corporation had thus far not paid because it had to meet out the operation and maintenance charges from its revenue – tax, rent and lease collection. The slow pace of collection had impacted the payment. Fund But when it came to paying Suez India Pvt. Ltd. for the 24x7 drinking water supply project, the Corporation paid from the funds the Central and State governments had contributed and therefore there was not as much delay as paying the operation and maintenance charges.  With the 2020-21 financial year’s end only three months away and tax collection picking up, the sources said the Corporation would clear at least a part of the pending Rs. 70 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-delays-payment-to-water-supply-operation-and-maintenance-contractor/article33398841.ece

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Sun drying platforms at harbour||As a first step towards hygienic production of dried fish that would fulfil parameters for export, the Fisheries Department is in the process of establishing raised concrete platforms for drying at Nagapattinam harbour. Six platforms, each 20 metre wide and 30 metre long, will be ready for use by the end of next month, according to officials. The National Fishing Development Board, as part of the Blue Revolution initiative, lays thrust on establishment of platforms for sun drying and solar drying. Sardine dried in Nagapattinam district has substantial market in Kerala. However, since the fish is dried on sand, the hygiene factor comes in the way of exporting the commodity. Dry fish production is yet to evolve as a mainstream economic activity, but the department has made a beginning by establishing the platforms, Amal Raj Xavier, Joint Director of Fisheries, Nagapattinam, said. The fishermen are conversant with salting and sun drying, the least expensive salting method of preservation, to prevent fish from enzymic decomposition, bacterial action, and oxidation. However, according to traders, the fishermen need substantial training to scale and fillet large-sized fish, and score the flesh into small strips. Exporters are particular about the fish being dried in open sunlight in a clean place away from pollution and traffic, and use of potable water for washing, a trader said. Earlier this year, the National Institute of Technology-Puducherry, Karaikal, developed a solar-powered dryer for hygienic manufacture of dry fish. A double-slope solar dryer weighing 1.5 tonnes that was developed by the institution and gifted to fishers in Kottucherrymedu hamlet can process 300 kg to 700 kg of fish. It is made of galvanised iron and coated with anodised paint to withstand the corrosive effects of salinity caused by proximity to the sea. On its part, Tamil Nadu Dr. Jayalalithaa Fisheries University, Nagapattinam, has been sensitising fishers to business opportunities in dry fish products through workshops. During 2018, the university established Metro Fish Processing Incubation Facility at Keechankuppam village with funding from the State government under the National Agricultural Development Project scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sun-drying-platforms-at-harbour/article33398428.ece

The initial estimates are around 2,974 persons,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. “Though we need to test only those who arrived from December 9 to 23, we plan to test all and their primary contacts as a measure of abundant caution, in addition to the procedures outlined in the SOP. If they had been positive, they could have passed it onto their primary contacts. This sort of ring-fencing is being planned. We are testing the 15 persons who have been identified to have been sitting three rows behind and three rows in front and in the adjacent seat as it is a must,” he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan inspected the arrangements made at the Chennai airport to test passengers returning from the U.K. Persons can contact the Health Department’s round-the-clock helpline — 104 — for further details. The Health Secretary added that persons returning from abroad were required to undergo a RT-PCR test 96 hours before the travel and be under home quarantine. “Even if they tested negative, they could pick up the infection during travel. Following the detection of the new strain in the U.K., the Centre and the World Health Organization have issued guidelines. The Chief Minister has directed that all persons who returned from the U.K. be tested on the fourth day,” he said. “The Greater Chennai Corporation has a patient management system in place. With the nod of the Home Department, we monitor the movement of the returnees. We are also conducting fever surveillance,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-sample-sent-to-virology-institute/article33398417.ece

Of the three, two are siblings. The boys aged 14 and 16 years were accommodated at the railway children open shelter after being produced before the Child Welfare Committee.

23 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. unlikely to change plan to reopen schools from January 1||The State government is unlikely to immediately postpone the plan to reopen schools from January 1 for some classes. The State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) that met on Tuesday in the light of the new strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerging, has recommended that the government should wait and watch the situation for the next four weeks and then take a call. TAC sources told The Hindu that it was too early to roll back the government’s decision on schools reopening as of now. “Mutation of any virus is natural and all that we now know is that the new strain is highly contagious, 70% more than the original virus. However, there is no change in its virulence and symptoms. It is a dynamic situation,” sources said. “Also, with no case infected with the new strain being detected so far, we do not know whether the new strain will wreak havoc or whether the existing situation will continue. All the members opined that any decision reopening of schools should be taken after studying the situation in the next three-four weeks,” sources pointed out. “Moreover, with nearly 50% of the State’s population having been exposed to COVID-19 so far, we are hoping cross immunity will be there to a large extent. There is no reason to panic as of now,” asserted a senior TAC member. The State government announced two days ago that classes for SSLC and 12th Standard would begin from January 1. It had also announced that the ‘Vidyagama’ scheme, a continuous learning programme, would also resume for students of Classes 6 to 9 from January 1. Night curfew Even as Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa ruled out the possibility of introducing the night curfew in Karnataka, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar told reporters that the TAC would discuss introducing the night curfew in the light of the new strain. Replying to reporters on whether Karnataka would follow Maharashtra that has imposed a 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. night curfew till January 5 in Mumbai and other cities, the Chief Minister said: “There is no such proposal now.” Mr. Sudhakar said a decision on introducing night curfew will be taken based on the TAC’s recommendation in consultation with the Chief Minister. However, TAC sources said night curfew was not taken up for discussion at all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-unlikely-to-change-plan-to-reopen-schools-from-january-1/article33398508.ece
23 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Proposal to take college affiliations at Kannada University draws ire||The cash-strapped Kannada University, Hampi, is exploring ways to mobilise resources on its own. A proposal to seek the government’s nod to take affiliations from colleges in the newly carved-out Vijayanagara district, to this end, has caused outrage among teachers at the university and those formerly associated with it. Kannada University is a unique university dedicated only to research in 1991 by a special Act passed by the State legislature. Thus, it is a unitary university with no colleges affiliated to it. Affiliations, however, are a major source of revenue to other universities. The proposal to take affiliations from colleges in Vijayanagara was discussed at a meeting of the teachers’ association on Monday, sources said. The university has been dependent on the State government for resources since its inception. However, allocations from the government have dried up in the past three years. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, speaking to The Hindu recently, said, “Self-financing is the best solution in the long term. The university needs to mobilise resources on its own too.” Vasappa Badigera, president of the teachers’ association, said the proposal was discussed as one of the solutions to become financially self-sustaining. However, he said there was widespread opposition to it at the meeting. “Taking affiliations from colleges will change the research orientation of our university and will also bring us out of the ambit of the special law. Moreover, we are a Kannada university and do not have corresponding departments to those in colleges to take their affiliation,” he said. Matter of preservation That such a proposal was even discussed has drawn the ire of many. Noted linguist K.V. Narayana, formerly associated with the university, said there had been opposition even to starting postgraduate courses at the university and teachers had foiled earlier attempts to bring the university under the ambit of the Karnataka Universities Act, 2000. “This is the only such university in the State dedicated to language and research. Its character must be preserved at any cost. Taking affiliations from colleges would only ruin it,” he said. The root of the problem lies in the reduction of grants to the university from the State government over the past three years. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation. The lack of funding has come under severe criticism from noted writers and political opposition. “It is inhuman to starve the university of all financial resources, which is effectively murdering it. If there are issues at the university, the government needs to address them, not stop funding it. If that is what the government wants to do, it should make its stand and reasons public and shut the university down,” said Purushothama Bilimale, a former professor at the varsity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proposal-to-take-college-affiliations-at-kannada-university-draws-ire/article33398515.ece

Minister today||A delegation of traders from Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) across the State will meet Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar on Wednesday over the increased RMC market cess. APMC traders observed a one-day bandh in all yards in the State on Monday and had plans to join the farmers’ stir on Wednesday. “We will meet the Minister now and decide on our course of action,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce andIndustry. APMC traders had to pay 1.5% market cess on the sale of agricultural produce, which was passed on to the buyers. However, when the State government brought in amendments to the Karnataka Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act, 1966, allowing for private markets, traders opposed the amendments arguing that the market cess in APMC yards, not applicable to private markets, would make them lose out in the competition. APMC yards across the State observed a bandh in July, demanding the abolition of market cess and the introduction of 0.2% service charge for yard maintenance. The State government then slashed the market cess to 0.35% and APMC traders withdrew their strike. However, the State government recently hiked the market cess again to 1%, triggering protests by traders. “We feel cheated by the government. When we opposed the APMC Bill, they reduced the market cess to 0.35%. Now that the Bill is passed and enacted as law, they have again increased the cess, going back on their word. Our demand is a uniform cess for both APMC and private yards to ensure a level playing field,” Mr. Lahoti said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/apmc-traders-to-hold-talks-with-coop-minister-today/article33398634.ece

The portal was integrated to the Bhoomi portal of the State for fetching and validating land details. It will eliminate visit of farmers to sub-registrar offices. Rajeev Chawla, Additional Chief Secretary, e-governance, said that this was the latest initiative from the government to bring all the farmers in the State with land and other details under a single portal. In this portal, all the farmers will be registered and given a FID Number. Using this number, the financial and lending institutions can access the land details of the farmers as well as their borrowings and take a quick decision on lending to the farmers depending on their requirements. All financial institutions would be brought on to the portal so that at one place, all the data pertaining to the loans of the farmers would be available, he said. Niraj K. Verma, Chief General Manager, NABARD, said FRUITS portal was the first of its kind in the country.

Yediyurappa on Tuesday and urged him to consider implementing it through the LIC again. The Chief Minister told the officials to discuss the issue with Finance Department officials and work out the “best plan” they could offer to girl children belonging to families falling below the poverty line. The revised scheme envisages financial assistance to a maximum of two girl children born in a BPL family by issuing an insurance bond whose maturity value will be given to the girl at the age of 21. The girl child will get Rs. 1.27 lakh, and the amount may be used for pursuing education. Though the government had been implementing the scheme through the LIC since its launch in 2006-07, of late the LIC had reportedly expressed its unwillingness to implement the scheme because of the reduced rate of interest. The LIC had asked the government to deposit the difference in amount. Thus, the Cabinet decided to implement it through India Post, said an official release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-asks-lic-to-work-out-best-plan-for-girl-child/article33398642.ece

23 December 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||No candidates, so no polling in Kodi Gram Panchayat||Kodi Gram Panchayat under Brahmavar taluk in Udupi district where elections had been scheduled in the first phase on Tuesday did not go to the polls as there were no candidates in the fray in the entire panchayat. People in the 12-member panchayat boycotted the polls on two issues and ensured that there were no candidates in the fray. Among the issues one is related to the non-grant of title deeds and the other is linked to the delay in the construction of a fisheries jetty on the backwaters of Seethanadi river. Krishna Poojary P., a former member of the panchayat, told The Hindu that the government has not given “hakku patra” (title deed) to 431 houses built in the jurisdiction of four wards of the panchayat. The houses were constructed, since 1960s. The government officials have cited rules of the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) which are coming in the way of granting title deeds. But since houses have been built even before the CRZ rules came into force, the government can give one-time relaxation and grant title deeds, he said. Mr. Poojary said that the government has not completed the construction of the jetty also citing the rules of the CRZ. In addition, no dredging has been taken up in the jetty to remove the silt accumulated over the years. Hence, none from the panchayat contested, he said. Additional Deputy Commissioner, Udupi, B. Sadashiva Prabhu said that though three candidates had filed their nomination papers, they withdrew them later. Hence, there were no candidates in the fray. Mr. Prabhu said that a re-notification to conduct the elections to the panchayat is likely to be issued by the Election Commission after some time. Till then, an administrator will manage the panchayat. Kodi was among te 67 gram panchayats in Udupi district where elections had been scheduled in the first phase. As there were no elections there, 66 gram panchayats in the district went to the polls in the first phase. The Additional Deputy Commissioner said that 11 of the total 12 candidates in Barkuru Gram Panchayat in the same taluk in Udupi district have been elected unopposed. Hence, election was conducted to only one seat on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-candidates-so-no-polling-in-kodi-gram-panchayat/article33398952.ece

23 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||State second in country in leopard numbers||Karnataka — home to a high density of tigers — now harbours the second highest number of leopards in the country after Madhya Pradesh, according to a new report. The ‘Status of Leopard in India, 2018’ report released on Monday reinforces Karnataka’s position as a pre-eminent wildlife State that has some of the highest number of tigers, elephants, and now leopards. The report released by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, noted that Karnataka has 1,783 leopards and the results are in sync with similar studies on the spotted cat conducted by wildlife biologists in the State. The leopard estimates by the National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India were based on sampling in forested habitats in tiger range areas of the country and did not cover other habitats known to harbour leopards — mainly in coffee and tea plantations and other landscapes. Hence the actual leopard population could be higher and these numbers should be considered as minimum, as per the Ministry. While the minimum number of leopards for Karnataka is pegged at 1,712, the maximum is reckoned to be 1,854, as per the new study. The Western Ghats landscape harbours 3,387 leopards of which 86 are in Goa, 1,783 in Karnataka, 650 in Kerala and 868 in Tamil Nadu. The study revealed that leopards were recorded across much of the dry forests of central Karnataka region. In the Western Ghats landscape in Karnataka, leopards were found in the forests covering Haliyal, Kali Tiger Reserve, Karwar, Honnavar, Madikeri, Kudremukh, Shettihalli Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhadra, and Chikkamagaluru forests. Leopards were tracked in the forests covering southern Karnataka forests, including Virajpet, Nagarahole, Bandipur, BRT Hills, M.M. Hills, Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, and Bannerghatta National Park. Human-leopard conflicts The report noted that growing human population and increasing fragmentation in the landscape increased human-wildlife interactions and the coffee estates surrounded by forests were frequently visited by leopards and were a major hub for human-leopard conflicts. A similar study exclusively on leopards conducted in Karnataka by a team of wildlife biologists led by Sanjay Gubbi pegged the leopard population in the State at around 2,500. These numbers are higher as the study covered the non-forested areas, including habitats outside the reserve forests, rocky outcrops, and private land, besides covering Thimmalapura Wildlife Sanctuary, Jayamangali Conservation Reserve, and leopard habitats across Tumakuru, Ramanagaram, Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Bhadravati, Ballari, and Chitradurga forest divisions. Karnataka harbours 524 tigers as per the 2018 estimates and nearly 7,000 elephants, which is almost 25% of the total elephant population in the country. Ajai Misra, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said the report was based on the data collected during tiger census conducted in 2018 and has been processed using the same methodology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-second-in-country-in-leopard-numbers/article33398514.ece
23 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||GP polls peaceful in Mysuru, other districts||The first phase of gram panchayat elections in the region passed off peacefully with all four districts – Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu – witnessing a good turnout of voters. Amidst the COVID-19 scare, voters, though disregarding the pandemic rules particularly social distancing norms, enthusiastically voted in the elections. It concluded at 5 p.m. with the fate of the candidates sealed in ballot boxes. In all the districts where the GPs went to polls, polling went brisk as the day advanced with the voters turning up at booths in groups, especially women voters. In Mysuru district, 148 GPs in Hunsur, K.R. Nagar, Periyapatna, H.D. Kote and Sargur taluks went to polls. Six GP seats received no nomination and therefore no elections were held for those seats besides those where unanimous election of members had taken place. For 2,174 GP seats, there were 6,186 candidates. Polling was peaceful in all 974 booths. Long queues of voters were seen in many booths even as the polling began on a slow note and gained pace as the day progressed. In view of the pandemic for avoiding crowding, the maximum of number of voters in each booth had been limited to 1,000. The poll percentage at 3 p.m. in Mysuru district was 62.63. The elections in Madikeri and Somwarpet taluks in Kodagu also saw brisk polling. In many booths, senior citizens took the support of their children and grandchildren to cast their vote. A 95-year-old woman cast her vote at Suntikoppa with help of her son. A voter turnout 61.82% was recorded in Madikeri and 52% in Somwarpet taluk at 3 p.m. At the end of polling at 5 p.m., Mandya recorded a poll percentage of 85.96%. The village-level polls usually attracted attention and curiosity which was evident in most villages where the polling was held. Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh cast her ballot at Doddarasinakere village in Maddur taluk. Barring Gundlupet in Chamarajanagar district, the voter turnout was overwhelming in Chamarajnagar taluk with 67.02% polling recorded till 3 p.m. Gundlupet recorded 57.25% turnout. The final poll percentage from Mysuru, Kodagu and Chamarajanagar districts would be released after compilation and this may take some time as data was being collected from all booths, according to the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gp-polls-peaceful-in-mysuru-other-districts/article33398630.ece
23 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Coordination emphasised to minimise forest fire damage||Senior officials and field staff drawn from Bandipur, Mudumalai and Wayanad held a meeting to coordinate their activities to contain forest fire during the ensuing summer. The inter-State coordination meeting was conducted at Bandipur on Monday and is reckoned to be an annual affair involving the staff of the three national parks and tiger reserves. S.R. Natesh, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said that other issues related to joint patrolling to maintain an upper hand over potential poachers was also discussed though the thrust of the meeting was on coordinating their activities during an outbreak of fire during the forthcoming summer. “We want to ensure that there is adequate communication and cooperation of staff from all the three forest areas to prevent the spread of fire from one region to another and prevent or to minimise the damage caused by fire,” said Mr. Natesh. While the issue of forest fire preparedness dominated the meeting, there was also thrust on the imperatives of intelligence sharing and joint patrolling, weed eradication etc. This was followed by a demonstration by fire services personnel on forest fire control. Karnataka shares about 210 km of forest boundary with both Tamil Nadu and Kerala, according to Mr. Natesh and coordination was imperative to deal with both forest fires and the menace of poachers. The meeting is reckoned to be significant as all the three forests Bandipur, Mudumalai and Wayanad – have a history of forest fires that tend to break out with unceasing regularity during summer. Wet weather due to depression and cyclone in the Bay of Bengal during late November and early December is expected to ward off the onset of the fire season by a few days. But the authorities say the nature of the forest being dry deciduous the vegetation is expected to go dry soon and hence they have to be cautious about any outbreak of fire. Meanwhile, preparedness by way of clearing the vegetation and their controlled burning along the demarcated areas – fire lines – and which act as “fire breaks”, is expected to be completed by the end of this month. Bandipur has a fire line of 2,828 km and this is critical in ensuring that a fire outbreak in one part of the forest does not spread to another region. In 2019, a major fire spread over a few days devastated nearly 15,000 acres of forest in Bandipur. This was attributed to lack of fire fighting preparedness.  We want to ensure that there is adequate communication and cooperation of staff from all the three forest areas to prevent the spread of fire from one region to another and prevent or to minimise the damage caused by fire.S.R.

23 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||HC stay on demolition of buildings welcomed||The Karnataka High Court’s interim stay on demolition of Devaraja Market and Lansdowne Building proposed by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has come as a shot in the arm of conservation in the city. Though it is a temporary reprieve pending final disposal of the petition, heritage activists have welcomed the stay and pointed out that there is no immediate danger of demolition. They said the stay will be perceived as a disapproval of the manner in which the local body brushed aside the advise of the heritage committee members who were not taken into confidence. N.S. Rangaraju, convener, INTACH, Mysuru, and one of the members of the heritage committee said though it is an interim order, it is a big relief as demolition cannot take place until disposal of the case. What is important is that the order will serve as a caution to the local authorities in case they entertain similar thoughts with regard to other buildings most of which have no protection. Though Mysuru has nearly 500 heritage structures, only 198 buildings have been notified and have a semblance of protection, he added. In case of the Devaraja Market and Lansdowne Building, though the multiple committees of heritage experts spoke in favour of conserving the market, the MCC brushed aside their views and favoured demolition. “The immediate fallout of the High Court stay is that it has strengthened the Heritage Committee,” according to Rangaraju who is also a retired professor from the Department of Ancient History and Archaeology, University of Mysore. Eichnur Kumar, a heritage activist and member of the Heritage Committee, said MCC was displaying an unusual haste in the manner in which it wanted to go ahead with the demolition. But thankfully the High Court order means that the elected body cannot bulldoze alternative views or opt for demolition of heritage structures without considering other views, he said. “Some of the buildings may not be architecturally unique but they are associated with important persons whose contribution to the cultural fabric of the city is immense,” Mr. Kumar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-stay-on-demolition-of-buildings-welcomed/article33398622.ece

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Ecosystem in an extraordinary year||The pandemic offers four big environmental lessons in an urbanising world. First, biodiversity conservation gains urgency due to zoonotic disease risks. Next, local disease outbreak can break out globally. Third, poor migrants are disproportionate bearers of risk burdens. Last, the pandemic’s risks are an unparalleled environmental reset opportunity. But more specific and related conservation and sustainability patterns and indicators emerged. From Baltimore to Barcelona to Bengaluru. Pollution and carbon emission decreased. Economic inactivity forced an urban de-population. Nature reportedly healed. Opportunistic environmental policy dilution occurred. Positive and negative, these offer learning opportunities for Karnataka and Bengaluru. The human cost When India locked down from March 24 till May 31, livelihoods were upended as millions of people ‘reverse’ migrated to their villages, including women whose participation in migrant labour had doubled between 2001 and 2011. Suspended and sparse transport saw migrants undertake a ‘walking marathon’ of shaming distances from Delhi to Bihar, Bengaluru to Andhra Pradesh. Over three lakh migrants left Bengaluru on special Shramik trains. This out of six lakhs in Karnataka who registered on the Seva Sindhu portal. Reports now claim that these trains spread the virus to rural India. Climate change and natural calamities like drought due to salinity in West Bengal’s Sundarbans, or flooding in Bihar’s Kosi river had forced people to migrate to Bengaluru and other south Indian cities to earn a livelihood. As the pandemic took hold, migrants returned to climate-stressed natives. Welfare schemes like free foodgrains and cash transfers have mitigated suffering. But migrants remain a precarious class vulnerable to climate and disease risks. Even as India must enhance and diversify rural resource bases, Karnataka must rethink Bengaluru’s endless expansion. While it does, it must legislate meaningful welfare schemes ensuring the dignity of migrant labour. Pollution, conservation The lockdowns were an energy moratorium. The suspension of surface transport, production, and commercial activities, reduced global carbon emissions. In May, climate scientists measured emissions against 2019 levels and detected reduction. India had a four-decade emission drop. In the long run, this unprecedented carbon crash is a ‘blip’. But the lockdown offered emission and pollution mitigation prospects. Bengaluru’s air quality index was ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ compared to the same period in 2019. Around June’s Environment Day, scientists noted air quality gains and ‘mother nature’s recovery’. Lockdowns, they felt, could be an emergency measure in future to mitigate severe pollution episodes like Delhi winters. Encouragingly, air quality actually improved in a ‘severe’ episode in an ‘unlocked’ Bengaluru. The three Deepavali days experienced 30.34% decrease in Air Quality Index compared to 2019. Awareness about air pollution and COVID-19 severity and a High Court order on green cracker use were responsible. A longer learning is in order. Will a ‘corona-less’ 2021 Deepavali see higher cracker use? Or will a past ‘cracker-less’ experience become a trend? But an obvious and reinforced learning is that public transport needs State investment and citizen patronisation. Confirming to global urban patterns, a locked-down Bengaluru saw more avian activity. Reduced air and noise pollution, and human movement meant more bird presence. People observed finches, starlings, sunbirds, parakeets, and bee-eaters. Enhanced human perception in a quieter time also helped sense chirpy activity. Sustainability scientists pointed to quality of life possibilities afforded by this brief respite. And alternative lifestyles it helps imagine. Nature ‘heals’, ‘reclaims’, ‘detox’, and ‘cleanse’ are some ways that the media headlined this environmental moment. The lockdown triggered nostalgia for older Bengaluru and stimulated sustainability prospects for the future. The lockdowns have propped work from home as a sustainability practice for the future. Big tech and the government are toying with this arrangement as the norm. But. as with any environmental solution, the benefits and burdens are disproportionate. During the lockdown, distress calls to government and NGO helplines for domestic, child and elder abuse increased. Domestic violence is morally and legally unsustainable. The lockdowns, and curtailed house, senate and parliamentary activity were a political opportunity worldwide to dilute environmental safeguards. Even as Bengaluru assessed its sustainability prospects, the city’s environmentalists expressed concern over the draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020. New conditions that dilute development and industrial regulations posed pollution and deforestation prospects for Karnataka’s cities and its Western Ghatian mountains. The lockdowns are a lesson for urban-centric policy. An urbanising India under climate change is a high-risk trajectory. A smart city means being inclusive, and open to interdisciplinary science and sincere activism.  (Siddhartha Krishnan is a sociologist and historian of conservation and sustainability.

23 December 2020||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Steps to check stray dog menace in Alappuzha||Authorities are planning to strengthen the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme to check the stray dog menace in Alappuzha town and other parts of the district. Following an increase in the incidents involving street dogs in the Alappuzha municipal area, District Collector A. Alexander recently chaired a meeting to chalk out a strategy to control the stray dog population. Mr. Alexander directed the officials concerned to initiate measures to tackle the problem by effectively implementing the ABC programme. At present, the district has two ABC centres functioning at Mavelikara and Kanichukulangara. Officials said more such centres would be set up in the district. The setting up of an ABC centre in the Alappuzha municipal area is in the final phase and it is expected to be made operational soon. Anti-rabies vaccination “The implementation of the ABC programme will be strengthened. The help of animal welfare NGOs too will be sought. Further, the Animal Husbandry Department officials will visit coastal areas and administer anti-rabies vaccines to dogs,” said an official, adding that in the case of sterilisation of dogs the respective local bodies would have to bear the amount. The stray dog menace has become a major issue in the Alappuzha municipality and several other parts of the district in recent times. In September 2019, stray dogs attacked and injured more than 30 people in Alappuzha town in a span of a few hours. Following this, several measures were announced to tackle the problem, but stray dog numbers remain high. Waste management According to officials and experts, apart from implementing the ABC programme, proper waste management is also the need of the hour as it will help address the issue to a large extent.  One of the main reasons for the increase in stray dog numbers is the dumping of garbage and slaughter waste in public places. The stray dogs feed on the waste dumped in the open. As part of the ABC programme, sterilised dogs will be provided special care before being released back at the place of their capture after affixing ear tags for identification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-check-stray-dog-menace-in-alappuzha/article33398580.ece

23 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||KMTA to work on smart parking, eco-friendly commute||The Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA) has zeroed in on three critical projects that have to be implemented in the next six months. Smart parking, revision of the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) (readied in 2015 by Kochi Metro Rail Limited - KMRL), and promotion of non-motorised transport (NMT) are the core areas for which brain-storming will be done. “We have identified the need for smart parking, aided by a new parking policy, as a priority area, since haphazardly-parked vehicles are a menace. Obstructive parking has worsened in the post-lockdown period owing to higher influx of private vehicles,” official sources said. The revision of CMP involves a relook at parking regulations in the Greater Kochi area. Aimed at clamping down on parking on narrow roads and junctions, efforts are on to encourage land owners to open pay-and-park lots. Start-up firms could help considerably in this regard, by readying a simple platform. “Discussions were held with players who specialise in making available apps that help zero in on unoccupied slots in pay-and-park facilities. The KMTA will not operate any such facility. We are looking for a technical partner to launch an app, which will bring service providers and motorists under a common umbrella, they said. The emphasis will be on unmanned parking lots, where payment can be done with the help of say, a QR code. Those having space to park 50 cars and above could post personnel to streamline parking, they added. Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) has readied plans for a multi-tier parking lot at Kacheripady, while KMRL too is considering a similar system, it is learnt. The third area that the KMTA will lay emphasis on is NMT. Here, focus will be on hewing out more space for pedestrians and cycle tracks as part of the Street for People campaign. CSML too is working on similar initiatives. The proposed North-South Corridor linking Ernakulam Junction and Town railway stations will be restricted to NMT and perhaps e-autos as part of sustainable urban transport initiatives, sources said. Efforts are on to introduce at least 100 e-autos in Kochi by the third quarter of 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmta-to-work-on-smart-parking-eco-friendly-commute/article33398923.ece

Donors are difficult to find in some cases, and efficacy is uncertain, doctors said. Dr. A. Fathahudeen, pulmonologist and nodal officer for COVID-19 care at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, says, “It is difficult to know if administering plasma therapy works, since different medications are given simultaneously. Reports from all over the world and the ICMR study say that it is not as effective as initially expected. It used to be administered to all patients with significant symptoms and was used extensively in Kerala earlier. But more recently, it is being gradually phased out because of its unproven efficacy.” The Health Department had issued a revised advisory “to optimise the evidence-based use of convalescent plasma therapy” earlier this month. The advisory says that the benefits of CPT in reducing the severity of the disease, duration of hospitalisation, and mortality depend on the concentration of specific antibodies in convalescent plasma. A potential donor should, therefore, have sufficient concentration of antibodies in plasma. The Health Department advisory says that the PLACID study by ICMR and another study in the Netherlands on the use of CPT had observed that most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralising antibody titers when they are admitted to hospital. Administering CPT to patients who already have antibodies is considered futile. A potential recipient must not have the Immunoglobulin G antibody, and this is to be confirmed through a test. Administering CPT to patients within three to seven days of showing symptoms and no later than 10 days, is key, the advisory says. At PVS Hospital, CPT is still being administered, said a doctor associated with the hospital. “It is essential for donors to have been symptomatic when they had the infection. Antibody tests are expensive and usually not done to check for antibody presence,” the doctor says. Potential donors are to weigh over 50 kg and can donate 14 days after symptoms have resolved, even if they have not tested negative. A health official who has been coordinating the plasma donation process for PVS Hospital says that donors are few now. “A few months ago, the IMA had conducted a camp for donations, and plasma was stored at the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre at the Aluva District Hospital. Since the stock ran out, the district control room has been contacting patients who have recovered now. It is a tedious process, since several patients have been reporting post-COVID issues like persistent body pain and might not be willing to donate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/doctors-doubtful-about-efficacy-of-plasma-therapy/article33398915.ece
23 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||UDF introspects on civic polls||It was a day of confessions and introspection for the Congress and the UDF partners in Kochi. While representatives of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the Kerala Congress (Joseph) came down on the Congress for the role played by party rebels in the defeat of UDF candidates, Congress leaders pointed fingers at front partners, especially the League, for their failure to placate rebels in West Kochi. The meeting felt that the flawed selection of candidates, rebels, and the presence of V4 Kochi robbed the UDF of at least 10 to 15 seats in the Kochi Corporation. Congress leaders conceded that a few party rebels, who enjoyed the clandestine support of some party leaders and workers, pulled the rug from under the UDF candidates in many local bodies of the district. The Congress, it was conceded, underestimated the might of V4 Kochi. The party failed to foresee the fact that the non-political formation could eat into its vote share. The votes mustered by the formation were instrumental in ensuring the defeat of some UDF candidates. The League leadership came under criticism from Congress leaders for failing to mollify party rebels, including T.K. Ashraf, who won by defeating all political formations. Though the State leaders of the League were apprised of the threat posed by rebels and the possibility of them ruining the party for the UDF in Kochi Corporation, the obstinate stand adopted by some local leaders culminated in a poll debacle in the West Kochi region. The party lost around six seats due to a host of factors in the region, it was reported. The shifting of loyalty of the Kerala Congress faction led by Jose K. Mani from the UDF to the LDF had little impact on the poll outcome, as the faction loyal to Mr. Joseph made better gains in the district, it was reported. The general impression of the meeting was that the front fared well in the district except in the Kochi Corporation. K.P. Dhanapalan, KPCC vice president, presided over the meeting, as the UDF district chairman, Dominic Presentation, was in quarantine after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. DCC president T.J. Vinod, MLA, too did not turn up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-introspects-on-civic-polls/article33398927.ece

Even though the number of FLTCs in schools was higher initially, it dropped to just 15, as many of them were closed down following a dip in COVID-19 cases. The Education Department said the district administration had already taken steps to shift FLTCs from school campuses. “It is the responsibility of the district administration and the Health Department to ensure that FLTCs are shifted ahead of the partial reopening of sessions,” it added. Protocol Disinfection of classrooms and auditoriums will be undertaken by the local bodies concerned. Cleaning will be done as per the Health Department protocol. The Education Department will ensure that the premises are properly sanitised before allowing students into campuses. Besides, parent-teacher associations and school councils will monitor the work. The local bodies concerned should be alerted if shortcomings are noticed in the disinfection process. Meanwhile, Education Department officials said they had not received any complaints about delay in clearing waste generated by FLTCs on campuses. The local bodies are responsible for the timely clearance of biomedical waste as per the agreement with the Indian Medical Association Goes Eco Friendly (IMAGE). But some school managements fear that the delay in clearing waste may trigger a health hazard, and that they will not be able to resume classes according to the current schedule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/efforts-under-way-to-disinfect-campuses/article33398918.ece
23 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Managements unaware of protocols||The lack of awareness among school managements on the safety protocol to be followed ahead of the partial reopening is likely to put the authorities in a fix. The Education Department has made it clear that students should not be made part of the cleaning activity on campuses. A directive in this regard was issued following reports that students had joined teachers and other staffers in cleaning up school premises and giving a fresh coat of paint to classroom walls. The Health Ministry guidelines clearly state that students should not be involved in any cleaning activity for health and safety reasons. Directives Senior Health Department officials informed that students will not be permitted to visit campuses till their partial reopening on January 1. Stringent directives will be given to school managements to ensure that students are not part of cleaning work, they said. The Indian Academy of Paediatrics had recommended sharing of authentic information on COVID-19, including its symptoms, and the need to maintain physical distancing with all staff members, parents, and students. The entire community should be well-informed about the new standard operating protocols, it said. Schools should open in batches with older students joining first. Students should attend sessions in different shifts / alternate days. Classrooms should be well ventilated by keeping doors and windows open. Outdoor spaces Outdoor spaces should preferably be utilised to conduct classes. A distance of at least one metre should be strictly maintained between two individuals on the school premises, according to the guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poor-awareness-a-cause-for-concern/article33398919.ece

Sustainable power generation to lessen the project’s carbon footprint will be looked into at a later stage. Alternatives like installing solar panels atop buildings and floating pontoons could be tried out. Already, the Kochi metro sources 60% of its entire power requirements from solar panels installed over metro stations and at the coach depot in Muttom,” KMRL sources said. After the roll-out of twenty-three 100-seater ferries in 2021, the metro agency will place order for fifty-five 50-seater ferries, as part of the Rs. 747 crore Water Metro project. The battery-operated aluminium ferries will need phenomenal amount of power, especially since all the 78 vessels will be air conditioned. Diesel generators will be relied on only in the event of a shortfall in power from batteries. Solar power generated by panels at the ferry terminals will be given to the KSEB, and they will provide an equivalent as required to charge batteries, they added. On whether the ferries will have solar panels on the roof, as was done in Aditya — India’s first solar ferry operated by the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) on the Vaikom-Panavally route, the sources said it might not be feasible. Water Metro vessels will attain speeds higher than Aditya and will have a sleeker design, with a smaller roof area. Meanwhile, KMRL has stepped up efforts to acquire land for Water Metro terminals. While much of government-owned land has been acquired, there has been delay in acquiring private land. This might result in the jetty at Eroor not being ready, when the first vessel begins service on the Vyttila-Kakkanad route in early 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-metro-may-emulate-kochi-metro-on-solar-power-use/article33398922.ece
23 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Verdict brings relief to 2 chemical analysts||The conviction of the accused in the Sister Abhaya murder case has ushered in some sense of relief to two women, both chemical analysts, who worked on the case. R. Geetha, the then Joint Chemical Examiner, and her colleague M. Chithra, technical assistant of the Chemical Examiners Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram, went into hiding after a media trial, court cases, and suspension from service following allegations of tampering with the chemical analysis documents in the case. The tests carried out at the lab were significant as it threw light on the question whether Sr. Abhaya was sexually harassed. It was the reports related to seminal stains in the vaginal swab and smear of Sr. Abhaya that brought trouble for them. “Trouble started in 2007 after some media reports that we tampered with the vaginal swab and smear reports of Sr. Abhaya. It took almost seven long years to prove our innocence. Later, a court exonerated us,” Ms. Geetha told The Hindu . The Flourence and Barberio tests to identify seminal stains on vaginal swabs of the slain nun gave wrong and confusing results. These primary tests were not universally accepted ones and cannot be treated as conclusive ones for seminal stains. The microscopic examination of swabs is the confirmatory test, Ms. Geetha said. Internal politics If sperm is present, its head and tail could be identified under microscopic examination. In the case of Abhaya, the microscopic test turned negative. The initial entries made in the worksheet were wrongly construed as corrections and manipulations to aid someone. It was the internal politics in the organisation that led to the leaking of the false news, which resulted in untold miseries, she said. “After the court case and the non-bailable arrest warrant, we went into hiding. Later, we were interrogated at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. However, all investigations proved our innocence,” she said. “I lost my prime and precious seven-and-a-half years of life due to the wrong news and subsequent developments,” said Ms. Chithra. “I do not want to revisit those days of suffering and humiliation, which were the outcome of some nasty internal politics,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/verdict-brings-relief-to-2-chemical-analysts/article33398601.ece

He was addressing the media at Pastoral Orientation Centre ahead of Christmas. Divisive strife, including within churches, has become common now. Freedom and independence are often misused for personal gain even now, and it reminds one of king Herod ordering the killing of all infants below two years of age, soon after Christ’s birth. The rise in addiction to drugs and liquor, abortions, scams, and cyber crimes is adding to people’s insecurity, he observed.

The arrested are Suneesh, 30, Ajeesh, 35, of Palakkad, Sulfy, 36, of Mulavukad, and Nidhin Kumar, 30, of Idukki. They had allegedly stabbed a homoeo clinic employee in the city for having posted on his Facebook page a photo with a woman from Palakkad. The police said the woman and the petitioner became friends when they were working together at a hospital in Palakkad, before he was transferred to Kochi. However, he was reportedly in touch with the woman over phone, much to the chagrin of her husband. The petitioner allegedly continued his phone calls and posted his pictures along with that of the woman on his Facebook page. This infuriated her husband who allegedly gave Ajeesh a contract for Rs. 1.50 lakh to murder him. Subsequently, the gang reached Kochi. They waited in a car on December 18 and allegedly stabbed him multiple times before fleeing. Since the petitioner told the police that he did not know the assailants, the police concluded that it was a contract work. They launched a probe revolving around CCTV footage that led them to the assailants’ vehicle and eventually to them who were hiding at various places in Kozhikode and Palakkad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/four-held-on-charge-of-undertaking-contract-to-kill/article33398929.ece

Other demands included support for small-scale industrial units, provision for emigration clearance and cruise terminal at the Kollam port, completion of the National Waterway, health tourism facilities and a permanent task force for palliative care. Talking about the delay in completing various projects in a time-bound manner, he said the reasons would be examined and measures would be taken to rectify the issue. “But the government could complete several major projects.

Prime witness ‘Adakka’ Raju, whose statement turned out to be a crucial evidence, said he was extremely happy that ‘‘my child got justice’’, while Abhaya Case Action Council convener Jomon Puthenpurackal said truth can never be sabotaged. Former Deputy Superintendent of Police, Central Bureau of Investigation, Varghese P. Thomas, who first established through his probe in 1993 that it was a murder, said his stand had been vindicated. Mr. Biju Thomas, who is currently abroad, told TV channels that due to ‘pressure’ from the Church and political leaders justice was delayed in the case. Sister Abhaya's parents, Ayakarakunnel Thomas and Leelamma, died in 2016 while continuing their legal battle for ensuring justice for their daughter. Mr. Puthenpurackal, who fought for the case in the streets as well as in courts, said it was God who worked in the form of Raju. It had been proved that no one can sabotage truth using their money power and political influence. "This is a verdict with God's own signature on it", he told reporters. Mr. Varghese Thomas, who took voluntary retirement in protest against the pressure exerted on him to submit a closure report concluding it was a case of suicide, welcomed the verdict. Tears welled up in the eyes of Mr. Thomas as he spoke about the troubles he had to face during the course of the investigation. "My stand has been vindicated. This is the victory of truth. I stood for truth. The verdict is a prize for standing for truth," he said. He had taken voluntary retirement from the CBI when he had 10 more years of service left.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gods-intervention-abhayas-brother/article33398611.ece

Sister Abhaya has finally received justice, he believes. “I am saying this as her father, my child has finally got justice and I am happy now,” Raju said soon after the CBI court found the two accused in the case guilty of murdering the nun. While the murder confounded investigators at different levels for generations, Raju, alias Adakka Raju, a former petty thief who was arraigned as a witness in the case, never gave up hope. Having broken into the convent to steal something on the morning of Abhaya’s death, he was tortured for days together to own up the crime by police officers. The torture, according to him, was followed by a flurry of promises, varying from a job offer to his wife to a huge sum as compensation to the family. But he did not budge, so sure that the truth will be out one day. When the trial began last year, Raju told the court about the pressure exerted by the Crime Branch to “confess to the crime that he never committed”. And it was yet another statement from Raju that he had seen Fr. Jose Poothrukayil, Fr. Thomas M. Kottoor, and Sister Sephy climbing the stairway at the rear of the convent in the wee hours of the day the crime was committed that proved crucial in the investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/my-child-has-got-justice/article33398604.ece

The party secured 22.82% of the total votes polled in the civic body elections. Comparatively, BJP candidate A. Prakash Babu got 15.53% of the total votes in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, while party nominee K.P. Sreeshan got 22.51% in the Kozhikode North segment in the 2016 elections. Similarly, Satheeshan Kuttiyil of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) got 16.55% in the Kozhikode South segment. Kozhikode North and Kozhikode South segments form a major part of the Kozhikode Corporation, apart from some wards in the Assembly segments of Beypore and Elathur. Corporation divisions 1-16, 39-40 and 42-51 fall under the Kozhikode North Assembly segment, while divisions 17-38 and 41 come under the Kozhikode South Assembly segment. At the same time, the vote share of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) went up in the civic body polls as compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but declined when compared to the Assembly polls. In the case of the United Democratic Front (UDF), the vote share climbed down when compared to the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls. The LDF vote share in the Kozhikode Corporation is 44.06% and that of the UDF, 31.79%. LDF nominees bagged 49 seats in the 75-member corporation council, while the UDF and the NDA got 14 and seven seats respectively. The remaining five seats have been won by Independents backed either by the LDF or the UDF. The increase in the BJP’s vote share also signals that the two segments in the civic body will certainly witness a three-cornered contest in the coming Assembly polls. CPI(M) candidate A. Pradeepkumar, legislator of Kozhikode North, who lost the Lok Sabha polls, received 37.92% of the votes polled. At the same time, he had secured 48.40% in the Assembly polls. For the Congress, its nominee M.K. Raghavan got 45.97% in the Kozhikode Lok Sabha constituency, while P.M. Suresh Babu of the Congress just got 27.38% in the Assembly election. Likewise, IUML candidate M.K. Muneer got 43.12% and Abdul Wahab of the LDF, 37.66%. The erstwhile merged grama panchayats of Beypore, Elathur and Cheruvannur- Nallalam were merged with the Kozhikode Corporation on the eve of the local body polls in 2010. Then the LDF had barely scraped through with seven more seats than the UDF. It had won 17 out of the 20 wards in these three merged grama panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-corpn-sees-rise-in-bjp-vote-share/article33398527.ece

According to the Health Department, major FLTCs in the district are at the Lakshadweep Guest House where 122 people are housed on Tuesday, National Institute of Technology-Calicut where 53 people are staying in two buildings, IQRAA Covid care centre (79), and Government Homoeo College, Karapparamba (62). Regular classes It is learnt that the NIT-C management has urged the district administration to spare its hostel buildings, where FLTCs are functioning now, from January when the institution expects to start regular classes for a section of students. A final decision is awaited. The Lakshadweep Guest House FLTC is under the Government General Hospital, which is functioning exclusively as a COVID-19 hospital. With the authorities planning to open up more services from next month, some patients may have to be shifted elsewhere. As on Tuesday, 139 people are undergoing treatment at the hospital. Though the authorities had made preparations to have more FLTCs, such as the one at Sarovaram Biopark, in anticipation of a surge in the number of cases, the need for them did not arise. There is a drop in the number of patients at the Government Medical College Hospital too. As on Tuesday, only 208 people are undergoing treatment there. As many as 219 people were there on November 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fall-in-number-of-fltcs-covid-care-centres/article33398529.ece

The garden is expected to bring about drastic changes in the food habits of many families from Kottoor, an adopted village of KVK, Peruvannamuzhi, according to a statement issued on Tuesday. A team of officials from KVK, a subsidiary of ICAR-IISR, has completed distribution of vegetable seeds and training programmes for 25 families in the panchayat. The KVK has also included three anganwadis in the panchayat under the scheme with the aim to ensure supply of nutritious food to children, adolescents and pregnant women in the region. “Nutrition gardens are sustainable models for food security,” said Santhosh J. Eapen, director of ICAR-IISR. “It is an affordable means to ensure healthy food and balanced nutrition in our rural livelihoods,” he added. The project under the Smart Nutrition Village scheme aims to ensure nutrition for all children. It is a year-long project, through which locally available and indigenous seeds are supplied to families so that they can grow vegetables in their kitchen gardens and ensure uninterrupted supply of vegetables. The KVK officials have completed training programmes for beneficiary families in vegetable cultivation, organic farming, vermicomposting and other agriculture related topics. The project is under way in Muthukadu and Naduvannur grama panchayats also. As the beneficiary families are offered vermicompost units along with the seeds, they will be able to generate fertilisers for their requirement from the kitchen waste. The KVK is also promoting integrated farming models for residents and many have started rearing poultry and goats along with the cultivation of vegetables. The KVK will also carry out a survey among the beneficiary families to review whether the nutrition garden is helping them improve their nutrition intake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nutrition-gardens-growing-in-kottoor/article33398526.ece

Pradeep on the National Highway 66 near Karakkamandapam was found tampered with immediately after the incident. An analysis of the vehicle tracking data by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has revealed that the vehicle location tracking device installed in the vehicle as part of the GPS was snapped after the incident after parking the vehicle away from NH 66. Sole custodian The MVD is the sole custodian of vehicle tracking data of the GPS-equipped motor vehicles stored in the State Data Centre housed at Technopark. Data from the real-time 24x7 GPS-based tracking and monitoring platform developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also accessible to C-DAC. The fully loaded vehicle, after moving at 20-30 km from the quarry, was found suddenly attaining a speed of 55 km at Karakkamandapam when it mowed down Mr. Pradeep, a visual and digital media journalist. Both the lorry and the motorcycle in which Mr. Pradeep was travelling were moving towards Balaramapuram side when the accident occurred on the busy NH 66 corridor around 3.30 p.m. Despite the tampering A top official of the MVD privy to the vehicle tracking data told The Hindu that despite the tampering, the vehicle location tracking device of the lorry was functional using the in-built battery till the police traced the vehicle and took it into custody. The CCTV footage recovered by the City police revealed that the journalist was hit by the lorry. The footage grabbed by the CCTV camera installed at the Karakkamandapam traffic signal shows that the vehicle was seen taking a right turn at the signal point. Doubts expressed The tampering of the GPS has come to light soon after Sreeja, wife of Mr. Pradeep, expressed doubts over the genuineness of the accident and disappointment at the direction of the probe into the accident. The police had not approached the MVD for the vehicle tracking data of the lorry, the official said. It is for the investigators to look into why the GPS of the lorry was tampered with immediately after the accident and on the increase in speed of the lorry all of a sudden to 55 km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gps-of-mini-lorry-found-tampered-with/article33399029.ece

Mr. Chennithala was inaugurating a Raj Bhavan march organised by the United Democratic Front (UDF) on Tuesday in solidarity with the protesting farmers. Mr. Chennithala said the new laws would end all benefits being enjoyed by the farmers for years. These laws, which would end the system of Minimum Support Prices and destroy agricultural marketing societies, were framed for the benefit of some monopolies. To aid corporates The only aim of introducing these laws was to open up the country’s agricultural sector for the corporates. Implementation of the same would sound the death knell for Indian farmers and lead to a crisis in the agricultural sector, he said. Dangerous He said the moves to take over land from farmers and hand it over to monopolistic corporates for contract farming were dangerous. The march led by Mr. Chennithala included Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran, senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy, All India Congress Committee general secretary K.C. Venugopal, UDF convener M.M. Hassan, UDF constituent party leaders P.J. Joseph, Anoop Jacob, A.A. Azeez, N.K. Premachandran, Mons Joseph, Shibu Baby John, Beemapally Rasheed, C.P. John and others.

With the chairperson seat reserved for women councillors belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SC), one of two first-time councillors B.K. Sreekala and C.S. Sreeja who were elected from Valiyamala and Paramuttom wards respectively will be nominated for the top position. In Kudumbashree The councillors, both in their thirties, have been members of the CPI (M)-feeder All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA). While both have also been active members of the Kudumbashree movement, Ms. Sreeja has also worked as an ASHA worker. According to CPI(M) Nedumangad area committee secretary R. Jayadevan Nair, a final decision on the LDF’s chairperson-nominee will be taken at the party’s meeting on December 27, a day before the elections to the top posts will be held in the council. This will be the third time in the history of the local body that it will be led by a woman councillor, following the footsteps of former legislator A. Nabeesa Ummal and Lekha Vikraman who had come to the fore in 1995 and 2010 respectively. Going by the LDF convention, the vice-chairman’s post is usually allotted to the CPI as during the previous term when Lekha Vikraman held the position. However, the CPI’s below-par performance this time has prompted a reassessment. The CPI only held three of the 27 seats that the LDF managed to win at the polls. While senior CPI leader S. Raveendran was tipped to become the vice-chairman, CPI(M) sources now claim that senior CPI(M) leader and former standing committee chairman P. Harikesan could be nominated to the post. Dominated by women For the first time, the municipal council will be dominated by women councillors — 25 out of the council’s total strength of 39. These include 16 representing the LDF, five the United Democratic Front (UDF) and four the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  One of two first-time councillors B.K. Sreekala and C.S.

23 December 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||2020 a forgettable year for Prakasam ryots||The year 2020 began on a sour note for the farming community in drought-prone Prakasam district, thanks to unseasonal rains in January. To further compound matters, the year ended on an even worse note with Cyclone Nivar flattening crops in over 2.25 lakh acres, leaving all sections of farmers in heavy losses. Not a single section of farmers, be it growers of red gram or cotton or tobacco or chilli or bengal gram, were spared by the weather gods. In between, the COVID-induced lockdown pushed the farmers to the edge as it coincided with the peak of the marketing season for tobacco, chilli and bengal gram, among other commercial crops. Hopes of farmers in perennially drought-prone district soared as they received timely rains, and began cultivation of various crops in earnest after a dry spell of eight years in the last decade. But when the skies opened up, the wet spell continued unabated both during the Khariff and Rabi cropping seasons, leaving the farmers to grapple with the ever-increasing cost of farm inputs and fluctuating fortunes at the agri-markets. This too at a time when they were yet to adapt to the three Farm Acts enacted by the Centre. The January rains put paid to the hopes of tobacco growers, adversely affecting grade outturn as well as productivity. Then came the lockdown to combat coronavirus during the peak of marketing season in summer, recalls All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee district convener Ch. Ranga Rao. Just when the growers were struggling to find buyers, the State government, for the first time in several years, directed MarkFed to intervene in the market and provided them the much-needed relief. ‘Sleepless nights’ Chilli growers were also in an unenviable position as heavy rains dashed their hopes of taking advantage of the buoyancy in the market which had remained subdued in the previous years but went northwards thanks to increase in demand for the spice crop globally. Though Asia’s biggest chilli market in neighbouring Guntur district remained shut during the early phase of the lockdown, traders made personal visits to the farms and cold storage units to lap whatever available stock was there with the farmers. Encouraged by this, the farmers grew the spice crop in a big way. “We spent sleepless nights in the wake of the virus attack on our crops . The untimely rains in December dashed all their hopes of getting any decent returns,” lamented a chilli grower R. Venkata Subbaiah from Pamidpadu village. Farmers who have taken up red gram cultivation in a big way in the district, where Khariff and Rabi cropping seasons overlap, are at their wits’ end as the crop had suffered irreparable damage in the wake of continuous rains. The government should immediately release input subsidy and settle crop insurance claims without delay for the ryots to go for replantation of tobacco and other crops wherever possible and recoup the losses at least partially, said Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangam district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/2020-a-forgettable-year-for-prakasam-ryots/article33398972.ece

BJP leaders demanded that Mr. Parthasarathy step down from his position in the TTD before attending events pertaining to other faiths, claiming that it involved the religious sentiments of crores of Hindu devotees. At a press conference here on Tuesday, the party’s State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy displayed a controversial poster being circulated on social media in which the MLA is named as the chief guest. Similarly, the invitee for the event is N. Satish, trust board member of Indrakeeladri Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Devasthanam in Vijayawada. “What message will this send to Hindus if people from revered temples attend such festivities? Is it a tacit invitation to the gullible among Hindus to convert their faith?”, Mr. Reddy asked, adding that BJP workers would obstruct Mr. Parthasarathy at Alipiri and prevent him from attending future meetings of the TTD trust board at Tirumala if he went ahead with his plans to attend Christmas festivities. Warning to employees Claiming that several TTD employees were ‘discreetly practising’ Christianity while merely professing to be Hindus, the party issued a veiled warning that it would be on the lookout for such employees and would lodge a complaint with the Vigilance Department. “Those drawing salary from Lord Venkateswara’s coffers need to abide by the law,” he said. While maintaining that he had nothing to do with people of alien faith employed at TTD, he said the party had always maintained that such employees be sent on deputation to other departments in the government, without any harm to their service record. Last year, the TTD had already identified and issued a show-cause notice to such employees, but the issue hit a roadblock with the latter moving the court. “The TTD has a fully-equipped law department, which should take up the issue with due seriousness to take the case to its logical end,” he demanded. Tirupati Parliamentary constituency in-charge S. Dayakar Reddy and media committee member G. Pushpalatha took part.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-warns-ttd-board-member-against-taking-part-in-christmas-festivities/article33398271.ece
23 December 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Over 3,000 devout take part in ‘padayatra’ to Tirumala||The three-day ‘padayatra’ undertaken by a number of over 3,000 devotees, led by former Rajampeta MLA Akepati Amarnath Reddy, on the ancient forest route originally used by saint poet Tallapaka Annamayya to Tirumala temple ended on Tuesday. Government whip and Rayachoti MLA Gadikota Srikanth Reddy also joined the procession at Kukkaladoddi, the last village at the intersection of Chittoor and Kadapa districts, from where the hilly terrain begins. Mr. Amarnath Reddy, who has been undertaking the Padayatra on this less-explored route for several years, has been vociferously demanding that the government recognise the route by developing facilities for the devout. As it is currently an unofficial trekking path, any devotee entering Tirumala from this side of the forest is deemed as an intruder. “The TTD should recognise the route taken by none other than the great Annamacharya over 500 years back,” he told The Hindu . The procession, which was largely peaceful, kicked up a row on the third and last day when a drone hovered over the members when they crossed Papavinasanam point on Tirumala hills. The TTD has banned the use of drones by private persons on the hills citing security reasons. Mr. Amarnatha Reddy said he had no knowledge of deployment of drones as his intention was only to complete the ‘padayatra’ successfully. Contacted by this correspondent, Mr. Srikanth Reddy admitted to have sighted the drone, but denied knowledge of who could have used it. The TTD security sleuths who sighted the drone hovering over prohibited space, seized and erased the content recorded by it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/over-3000-devout-take-part-in-padayatra-to-tirumala/article33398347.ece

23 December 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Denial of entry to RSS vehicle to Tirumala hills kicks up a row||BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy demanded an explanation from the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) authority after the security personnel deployed at the Alipiri point denied entry to a vehicle belonging to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to the Tirumala hills on Monday. The incident came to light on Tuesday after a video surfaced on the social media and it sparked a protest in the Bharatiya Janata Party quarters. Mr. Bhanuprakash Reddy sought to know on what basis the vehicle belonging to the social organisation was stopped at the Alipiri check point. What the rules say There is a ban on entry of vehicles that explicitly bear the names, images and insignia pertaining to political parties. Such vehicles may be allowed after the controversial names are erased. “But, the RSS is not a political party,” argued Mr. Bhanuprakash Reddy. When contacted by The Hindu , TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy said that the vehicle in fact carried the words ‘BJP RSS’. The security personnel tried to remove the word ‘BJP’, when the ‘R’ in the subsequent word got accidentally torn off. “We will take action against the personnel concerned if the act was found to be a deliberate one,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/denial-of-entry-to-rss-vehicle-to-tirumala-hills-kicks-up-a-row/article33398798.ece
23 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Be cautious while taking loan online’||Many people, who borrowed loans online, are approaching the police alleging harassment by the microfinance organisers. With the number of victims increasing, the government is taking measures to prevent harassment from microfinance app organisers. “Taking advantage of the financial crisis in the wake of COVID-19 for the last few months, microfinance apps offer loans to people. They target the unorganised sector workers and private employees who have lost livelihood due to the pandemic,” said a police officer. A few customers, who borrowed loans online, lined up at the cyber crime police stations. However, police received only a few complaints and took up investigation. DGP D. Gautam Sawang said the microfinance apps were being operated from Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida and other places from Northern India. Some complaints have come to our notice, he said. “Most of the victims are women. Police will launch a special drive to prevent harassment by the online app organisers ,” Mr. Sawang told The Hindu on Tuesday. Threat calls “I installed an app a few days ago which offered Rs. 7,000 loan to me. Immediately, a person spoke in Hindi and asked me to fill the format, which I did. After sometime, Rs. 5,700 was credited to my account, and after three days the organisers started asking me for repayment. They threatened to send messages and posts to my friends and relatives accusing me as a fraudster. Finally, I paid Rs. 8,500 in just a week,” said a loanee. A woman approached the Guntur police to complain about the harassment of app organisers on Monday. Interestingly, the private money lender who offered loan to the woman called at the same time and threatened her. He used highly abusive and insulting language. “Online apps such as – Cash Wallet, Instant Cash, Quick Money, Star Credit – are luring the private employees. Organisers are collecting Aadhar, bank account numbers, contact phone numbers, email IDs, PAN No., and other details before transferring the amount,” said another victim. ‘Ignore prank calls’ “Police are tracking the phone numbers and making efforts to trace the micro finance app organisers. We request the public not to respond to prank calls, open unknown apps and go for easy money,” a police official investigating the case said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/be-cautious-while-taking-loan-online/article33398351.ece

VIT-AP vice-president Sekar Viswanathan attributed the success of the placements of the very first batch to the high quality of students and faculty, a strong curriculum and industry-institute collaborations. “The novel concept of ‘engineering clinics’, whereby students from different disciplines execute industry-strength projects right from the first semester, has tremendously impressed industry executives,” he said. Vice-Chancellor S.V. Kota Reddy said to help students benefit from the placement opportunities, VIT-AP had incorporated into the final semester a ‘Cooperative Education Programme’ which gave students the opportunity to explore and refine their potential career path. “The experience the students gain from this long internship period narrows the gap with the industry, builds valuable industry connections, broaden their perspectives and helps them acquire the skills and knowledge required to face the professional world. This co-op makes them strong contenders ready for their job role,” he explained. Mr. Viswanathan thanked the recruiting companies for reposing faith in VIT-AP and recruiting in big numbers in the first year of campus placements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vit-ap-student-bags-plum-job-of-rs-20-lakh-per-annum/article33399010.ece
23 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP seeks probe into ‘political branding’ of SHE Team vehicles||Alleging that the vehicles of police SHE Teams in the Guntur district were painted with the flag colour of the ruling YSR Congress Party, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has demanded action against the move. In a letter to Director-General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang on Tuesday, TDP State president K. Atchannaidu urged the latter to take stringent action against the officials responsible for it. “Guntur Urban SP launched the vehicles on December 21. Using the flag colour of a political party on government vehicles is wrong. A senior police officer in a responsible position got openly involved in the launch of the vehicles painted with colour of the ruling party,” said Mr. Atchannaidu. He recalled that the previous TDP government had provided around 800 vehicles to strengthen the SHE Teams as part of women protection measures. “Now that the State government allowed some vehicles to be painted with the party colour, it is evident that its focus is on publicity only, not on the spirit of public service,” said the TDP leader. ‘Public money wasted’ The Supreme Court had already found fault with the government with regard to painting government buildings with the colour of the YSRCP. The government had wasted public money of Rs. 3,500 crore in this regard, he said. Stating that the Police Department should be free of such illegalities, Mr. Atchannaidu demanded that the DGP order a detailed probe and initiate against those responsible for ‘political branding of the police vehicles.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-seeks-probe-into-political-branding-of-she-team-vehicles/article33398978.ece

23 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS govt. using PR institutions for corruption: Uttam||The Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief and Parliament member N. Uttam Kumar Reddy lashed out at the TRS government, accusing it of turning the elected representatives of Panchayat Raj institutions and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) into symbolic entities with no powers or say in the decision-making process. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has completely crushed Gram Panchayats and other institutions by ending their relevance just to have his say. The State government was using Panchayat Raj institutions and urban local bodies for corruption, he said. He was addressing a day-long Satyagraha Deeksha at Indira Park, organised by Rajiv Gandhi Panchayati Raj Sanghatan to highlight the neglect of PR institutions and urban local bodies and their elected representatives by TRS government. The Deeksha was also addressed by CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, MLAs Seethakka and Jagga Reddy, former PCC presidents V. Hanumantha Rao and Ponnala Lakshmaiah, working president Ponnam Prabhakar, AICC secretary G. Chinna Reddy, former Ministers Mohammed Ali Shabbir and J. Geeta Reddy, Panchayati Raj Sanghatan State in-charge Kiran, PRS State convener Dr Palvai Harish and others. The TPCC chief alleged that the KCR government was harassing the elected representatives of Congress party, especially in rural areas of Telangana. He said that the Congress party would not tolerate the harassment of the TRS party. He advised all the elected representatives of Congress to get in touch with PRS State convener Dr. Harish and other leaders if they are ever subjected to any kind of harassment or discrimination by the TRS government. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that TRS leaders were looting the Gram Panchayats by taking commission from agencies for purchase of tractors, LEDs and other items. He said Panchayats were being forced to purchase the tractors through selective contractors. He said that the State government has been making claims of constructing Rythu Vedikas and Shamshana Vatikas across Telangana. But no bills have been released so far for those works. Mr. Vikramarka said the government was forcing officials not to follow the protocol and neglecting the elected representatives of the Congress party and this was nothing but hitting at the dignity of the representatives. Such attitude was not only illegal but also inhuman, he felt. Mr. Ponnala Lakshmaiah said the officials were deliberately not paying the bills for developmental works done by the Congress Sarpanches, ZPTCs and other elected representatives. They were blindly following the orders of the TRS party leaders rather than performing their Constitutional duties. He warned them to mend their ways. The Congress leaders also paid tributes to senior leader Motilal Vora who passed away on Monday. They observed two-minute silence as a mark of respect for the former CM of Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-govt-using-pr-institutions-for-corruption/article33398797.ece
23 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Extortion case may be filed against ‘loan sharks’||Jagityal police are seeking legal opinion to ascertain if any other sections of law, in addition to abetment to suicide, can be invoked against the mobile phone bank loan app operators accused of driving a person to suicide in the district. A chicken centre owner Ravinder ended his life in Varshakonda village of Ibrahimpatnam in the district allegedly unable to bear harassment of the loan app operators. He consumed pesticide on November 30 at home. The 30-year-old man died while undergoing treatment on the night of December 9. Ibrahimpatnam police of Jagityal district registered a case of abetment to suicide. The victim had availed loans ranging from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3,000 from different apps. They included Snapit and KreditBee. The mobile loan app operators started calling up his friends, relatives and numbers of persons saved in his mobile phone. He reportedly received calls threatening to take ‘serious action’ against him. They allegedly intimidated him stating that they would morph photographs of his family members and put them online stating that he had defaulted loan payment. Address of one of the callers was traced to Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad but it turned out to be fake. Investigators suspect the calls were made from Gurugram. Dedicated teams are working on different clues of the case to catch the persons responsible for Ravinder’s suicide. “It is yet to be ascertained if these mobile loan apps have legal basis. Even if they are legal, there are guidelines to be followed for recovery of money,” Jagityal Superintendent of Police Sindhu Sharma said on Tuesday. They cannot make phone calls at odd times. They are not supposed to insist for loan repayment when the loanee is occupied with functions like wedding. “Imposing interest rate more than legally permissible and forcible collection amounts to extortion,” the SP said. Legal opinion was sought on registering cases of extortion and criminal intimidation against mobile loaning app operators in this case. Meanwhile, a person approached Jagityal police for facing similar harassment from mobile loaning app operators. A second case was registered based on his complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/extortion-case-may-be-filed-against-loan-sharks/article33398871.ece

23 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Chinese man set base in city’||Hyderabad police have leads on a Chinese national coming to the city to set up his operations on app-based instant loan companies with local businessmen with a promise of high profits sharing. Having his base in Gurugram, the Chinese national got two or three loan apps to recover call centres set up in Hyderabad and have overseen the operations of the existing centres. “We have a lead about a Chinese national visiting Hyderabad two or three months ago to set up new centres here and going back to his country,” Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. The foreigner, who is yet to be identified, is suspected to be one of the key persons behind the ‘unlawful’ operations of instant load app companies in the country. When the Cyber Crime police raided two call centres in Gurugram, apart from laptops and other digital devices, they also seized the passport photocopy of a Chinese woman, who was suspected to have headed those companies in question, before leaving for China, Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said. “The woman, whose passport’s photocopy was found in the Gurugram office, managed the teams there. A probe is on to identify her role in the fraud,” he said.  When asked about the quantum of money involved in the alleged fraud, Mr. Mohanty said, “The investigation is in the basic stage. We will come to know about the money trail after analysing their bank accounts, online wallets and data from the seized devices.” These companies have a corporate style office set-up employing hundreds of youngsters for minimum salaries. Police also found that these companies, which are funded by Chinese firms, were getting day-to-day instructions from the operators in Jakarta, Indonesia, who in turn would report to these ‘bosses’ in China. “With so many layers of operations, getting to the top is a very difficult task,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/chinese-hand-in-operations/article33398881.ece

23 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||New GHMC members’ names to be notified in Jan.||The Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) has decided to publish the names of newly-elected ward members (corporators) of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in the gazette after January 10 next, stating that the existing body cannot be dissolved before the expiry of its five-year term on February 10 next. According to highly-placed sources in the election body, they have arrived at the decision after scrutinising the provisions already in place. The provisions that have driven the TSEC authorities to the decision include – the first meeting of GHMC shall be held within a month of publication of names of elected members in the gazette, which would also enable the existing body to complete its term. Interestingly, the TSEC’s decision comes on the day, Tuesday, on which Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) submitted a letter to the election body to publish the names of newly-elected members in the gazette immediately. “In case the names of elected members are published in the gazette before January 10 next, the first meeting has to be held before February 10 next in which the election for Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts is held”, the sources said. Consequent upon the election of new Mayor and Deputy Mayor the existing body would get dissolved and the term of the new body would commence. The provision of election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor in the first meeting of the newly-elected ward members’ (corporators) council is mandatory as also the commencement of the five-year term of the newly-elected members from the date of the first meeting, as per the Constitutional and GHMC Act relating to indirect elections to the posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor. Explaining that the last ordinary elections to GHMC were held in January/February 2016, the TSEC authorities said its five-year term had commenced on February 11, 2016, and would expire on February 10, 2021. Article 243-U(3)(a) of the Constitution mandates the SEC to hold elections to urban local bodies (ULBs) before expiry of the existing body’s term and Section 7(1) of GHMC Act stipulates that elections to GHMC shall be held within three months before expiry of its term. Keeping in view such statutory provisions, the Telangana State Election Commission had notified elections to GHMC before expiry of its term on November 11 and the results were declared on December 4. Under Section 90(1) of GHMC Act the first meeting of the newly-elected members after ordinary elections including indirect election to offices of Mayor and Deputy Mayor shall be held within a month of publication of the newly-elected members’ names in the gazette, the Telangana State Election Commission sources said.

Working in association with the Agriculture Department and Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) for the last six months, the premier business school has come out with a report on ‘brand-building and marketing strategy for Telangana Sona rice’. The report was released here on Tuesday by Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy. Along with the Minister, Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, Vice-Chancellor of PJTSAU V. Praveen Rao, Prof. Madhu Viswanathan, Prof. D.V.R. Seshadri, Sundeep Jammalamadaka and Sridhar Bhagavatula of ISB were present on the occasion. The report prepared by the ISB is of the view that the awareness about Telangana Sona variety rice among consumers within Telangana was only 50% and it is even lesser outside the State. The report recommended implementation of an awareness strategy by involving digital, television and retail (kirana stores) platforms along with branding it as as a “healthy as well as tasty alternative” to daily consumption of rice. Speaking at the event, Mr. Niranjan Reddy said the objective of the effort being made was to take the farm produce of Telangana to national and international level and help the farming community realise maximum returns to their hard work. He pointed out the success story of Basmati variety rice stating that it was the Punjab government that had taken the variety to international level by branding it about 25 years ago. Further, he stated that it would require lesser water for cultivation compared to several other traditional and popular varieties and would reach harvesting stage 30 days earlier compared to them. Besides, it was suitable both for Vanakalam (Kharif) and Yasangi (Rabi) seasons. Earlier, it was cultivated only in 4 lakh acres, but this Vanakalam season it was raised in 10 lakh acres in Telangana and another 5 lakh acres in seven other States. A meeting was also conducted on the occasion on taking the farm produce of Telangana to international level by involving NRIs and creating awareness among them on the produce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/isb-moots-brand-building-for-telangana-sona-rice/article33398901.ece

23 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||FGG wants more food safety officers in GHMC||Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has urged the Minister for Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao to take steps for appointment of 20 food safety officers selected through the Public Service Commission and train them to tackle the rampant food adulteration in twin cities. In a letter to the Minister on Tuesday, FGG Secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy urged him to establish a central complaint cell in GHMC to receive food adulteration complaints from citizens and to attend to the complaints by sending flying squads. He also wanted setting up of one more lab to test the samples as it is a very time consuming process and the present lab is unable to cope with the work. Mr. Reddy reminded the government that the adulteration of food including ripening of fruits using chemicals was going on unchecked in the city. The FGG had made a number of representations since 2015 for appointment of food inspectors but things did not move fast, he said, pointing out that the High Court had directed GHMC to control artificial ripening of fruits through chemicals. Mr. Reddy said the Chief Minister had gone on record saying that out of compulsion and lack of alternate, we are eating adulterated food. He had directed officials to prepare an action plan to control food adulteration, Mr. Reddy reminded. He noted that food adulteration could be controlled through frequent inspection by food safety officers. In GHMC, as there were only three FSOs, they were unable to work effectively, he pointed out. After direction from the Chief Minister in 2016, the government sanctioned 26 FSO posts but it took nearly 30 months to select 20 candidates out of the sanctioned posts through the Public Service Commission, the FGG Secretary said. He lamented that for the last six months these selected candidates were waiting for postings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fgg-wants-more-food-safety-officers-in-ghmc/article33398872.ece

23 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Call centres in city used as ‘soft reminders’||Call centres of app-based instant loan companies operating from Hyderabad were primarily used for soft reminders for a couple of days when the payment cycle fires. This was the first stage of the ‘bucket’ method practised by the online micro financing companies to recover the loan amount from defaulters. Three-tier architecture The recovery operation is a three-tier architecture with levels ranging from ‘soft, hard, and raw’ reminders. While soft reminders were given from Hyderabad, the next level operation was carried out by special abusive teams in Gurugram. In the Stage-II, which starts after the fourth day, the telecallers would use filthy language, send fake legal notices and FIR copies to the borrowers to threaten them. Raw reminders are the highest humiliation and intimidating semantic exercises, where the targets writhe in pain and eventually are pushed to the wall under emotional stress, police said. “During this stage, they would call the family members, friends, and other contacts informing about the default and create WhatsApp groups defaming the loanees till the payment completes,” the investigators said. Explaining the operations of these firms, Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said there were so many layers of operations even in the payment of salaries. “The companies in question won’t pay their employees directly. They outsourced other agencies for disbursing salaries whose payment is done through UPI or in cash,” he said, adding that those companies have multiple bank accounts as a precautionary measure to not come under the radar of enforcement agencies. When asked if majority of mobile applications were developed by a same firm, Mr. Mohanty said, “Most of these apps have similar features when it comes to operations. However, we are yet to come to a conclusion on it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/call-centres-in-city-used-as-soft-reminders/article33398877.ece

23 December 2020||Bahadurgarh,||Community kitchen to toilets, hues of hospitality seen on NH 9||As an eight-kilometre-long blockade of “reinforcements” ready to march to the Capital steadily grows in number on the National Highway 9, residents from villages in Haryana’s Bahadurgarh and beyond are busy assisting and making thousands of farmers protesting against the farm laws feel at home. A community kitchen is being run by a wrestling coach. A posse of around 50 of his students are serving langar round-the-clock and providing bedding and warm clothes to fight the biting cold at night. A collective of 84 Haryana villages is making toilets, bathrooms and raw vegetables available to the agitating farmers from both Punjab and their home State. The Delhi-Rohtak road bears witness to several such hues of hospitality. Sub-city springs up For those unable to find space for their tractor trollies on the blocked carriageway leading to Delhi, a sub-city has sprung up at the Shining Star Sports Club, a semi-functional mall on the stretch heading towards Sampla, which has also thrown open its toilets and bathrooms to farmers and women in their families. “Our village witnessed the march of farmers from Punjabthe night they breached the cordons of security personnel on their way to the Tikri Border protest site. Many set up camp there but many, mostly the elderly among them, were left behind and stayed here. I couldn’t bear to see them cooking and making arrangements for themselves so I decided to set up langar,” said Virender Mandothia, popularly known as Bhullar Pehalwan, a wrestling coach. With carpets laid on the ground under two layers of cloth, in addition to two types of roti, vegetables, and mixed daal are being served at Mr. Mandothia’s “Pehalwan ka Roti Sabzi ka Langar” at the Pakoda Chowk in the Naya Gaon village since November 27. From his own resources as well as donations from some village residents and protesters, the community kitchen also provides salted lassi, tea, and snacks, including peanuts and dry fruits, to “his guests” across the road from the local protest site, which has a stage similar to the Singhu and Tikri Border protest sites. ‘50 helpers’ “I have around 50 pupils who come and help out during the busy hours — morning and night — there is no count of the people who come for tea, snacks, and lassi, but we end up using at least 4,500 disposable plates per day,” he said. “You will not find any politician’s son farming or in the Army, but you will find a farmer’s son doing both these jobs. The farmer provides everything except water that goes in every stomach — whether a human’s or an animal’s — every night. This is not the treatment they deserve,” he also said. Jagsir Singh from Punjab’s Barnala, one of the diners at the langar, said most villages had made arrangements to give lassi, apples, and bananas to protesters like him. “We offered them raw vegetables and other produce from our fields in return but they refused, saying their rules of hospitality didn’t permit them to take anything in return,” he said. As one returns to the highway, tractor trollies are parked for hundreds of metres on a service road as well as in the vicinity of two malls — one under construction and the other mostly uninhabited.   While women, mostly senior citizens, line up outside two restrooms on the ground level, the men climb up one to three flights of stairs to utilise those on the three consecutive floors at the far end of the Shining Star Sports Club. “This is the least we could have done,” said a local resident employed as a security guard near its gates. “I am the son of a farmer and so is the owner of this property; all of them [farmers] are like our family and we are doing for them what they would have done for us if they visited,” he said. Transit camp A few kilometres down NH-9 towards Sampla, a large banner proclaims that 84 villages belonging to the Dalal Khap or community have made arrangements for food, toilets, and bathrooms to showcase its support for the farmers’ agitation. Operated by the residents of the Luna Majra village where it is located, the transit camp, according to a local resident who only identified himself as “Mr. Dalal” explained it functioned on resources gathered from 84 villages across Haryana. “The Dalal Khap has mobilised everything from bedding and warm clothes to spices, fruits, and raw vegetables from the hinterland for those gathered here,” he said. “Farmers from Punjab bring along raw vegetables and we provide the spices to cook for and serve as many people as possible. There is no count of the number of people we feed,” he said. What, Jagdish Lal Cheema from Moga asked, could be a better testament to the unity of farmers from both states except food cooked with different ingredients provided by each consumed by them all. Sonu Dalal from Rohtak’s Bawani Khera village said local residents not only opened up their own bathrooms and toilets for those stopping at the camp but even helped with their laundry. “We can sustain ourselves and thousands of others like us not for months but even a year; we won’t move till the laws are removed,” he declared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/community-kitchen-to-toilets-hues-of-hospitality-seen-at-nh-9/article33398652.ece
23 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||From Ferozepur to Singhu on bicycle||Gurwinder Singh rode 420 km for four days on his bicycle and reached Delhi-Haryana’s Singhu border on Monday night. The 29-year-old from Ferozepur said he considers this protest a place of worship. Around 2.30 p.m. on December 18, Gurwinder, a daily wage labourer, began cycling to the Capital, covering himself in a sweater, a hoodie and a thick shawl traditionally called loi . “We have one bike at home but there are two others who drive it and there are also little children. For their needs, the vehicle should be there. Buses and trains would have been expensive. So, I sat on my cycle and started,” he said. Gurwinder wanted to join the protest as early as the fifth day, but was caught in other engagements like setting up tents for weddings. He also had to convince his family. “My wife asked me why I need to go. I told I have to go no matter what. Then finally, my father intervened and allowed me,” he said. Back home, his 11-month-old twin sons Gurnoor and Harnoor await him. But he explained the reason he set out to the protest site. “Wherever there is ‘sangat’ [huge groups of people], the presence of Sikh Gurus Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh is felt. I don’t have land. I work for people who are farmers. I had to come here and mark my presence,” he said. Night halts Every day, he rode till about 10-11p.m. On the first day, he reached Ludhiana and spent the night at a petrol pump. “I’ll never forget the night in my life. It was so cold and I only had a loi to cover myself. At one point, I also thought that I should go back home,” he said. The second day, he reached a place in Ambala were langar sewa was under way. He ate and slept at the same place. However, Gurwinder was spotted by a group of people travelling to the Singhu border. ‘Carrying flag’ “They spotted me because of the flag I was carrying. They stopped, gave me a blanket and a little cash which I spent for meals at dhabas. I also bought a pair of socks,” he said. On the third day, he reached Karnal where he a spent a night outside a shop and around 9 p.m. on day four [Monday], he reached the border. Gurwinder plans to head back home on Wednesday and will reach by weekend – on his bicycle, which is his companion back home as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-ferozepur-to-singhu-on-a-cycle/article33398647.ece
23 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Not official voice of farmers’||In the second edition of Trolley Times — a four page newsletter in Punjabi started by a group of youngsters — published on Tuesday, they stated they are not the official voice of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. In a column explaining ‘What is Trolley Times’, they said: “Trolley Times is not the official paper of Kisan Morcha. Our intent, without malice and ulterior motive, is to simply represent peoples’ voices. We are aware that partisan publishing representation can create rifts in the movement. The newsletter is made to clarify the real news amidst fake news.” Dalit representation On page 2 of the newsletter on Tuesday is a story of a woman, authored by freelance journalist Sangeet Toor, regarding the Dalit representation at the protest. The story is of a 23-year-old Dalit woman, Kulvir Kaur, (name changed) fromSangrur district in Punjab,who wanted to pursue Bachelors in Education but because of a fee increase in reserved category, she couldn’t. She instead completed her Masters in Arts from distance learning after which she got involved in daily-wage labour work with her mother. “Do you go for protests?” the author reportedly asked the woman. “We are the kind of the political part who can’t do as they like,” the woman said. The woman is reported to have said that if she went for protests, the society will start talking about her and her marriage will become difficult. Kulvir told the author that she wants to take part in the protest but she has seen how her mother and other women from the community are treated by the police and other authorities. Loose translation of the story written in Punjabi quoted the woman as saying: “To register their names in the history, to mark their presence in a historical movement and then to return home for a decent life are privileges many of our sisters simply do not have. Their desire is their participation”. Voices of unheard Jasdeep Singh, an editor at Trolley Times, said the reason to publish the story is “to be able to give space to underrepresented voices”. Ms. Toor said she had met many labourers and members of Dalit community who wish to take part in the protest but can’t. “The women said that if a young woman from their community participates, a campaign to malign her image will be started by the village office-bearers,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/not-official-voice-of-farmers/article33398645.ece

23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Yamuna monitoring panel raises several issues on river pollution||The Yamuna Monitoring Committee, in its fifth report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), has raised multiple issues due to which the river is still polluted, including several agencies missing deadlines related to cleaning the river and internal problems of the organisations. The committee said in its report that in some cases the developments have been “better than expected” and to some extent the lack of progress at other places can be attributed to several officers being on leave sporadically, financial and administrative approvals getting delayed and a loss of momentum because of the pandemic. The YMC noted that the works to clean the river was “nowhere near the achievement of the milestones and timelines laid out by NGT”. The committee, headed by former Delhi Chief Secretary Shailaja Chandra and retired NGT expert member B.S. Sajwan, was formed by the NGT in July 2018. About the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), which is supposed to handle sewage generated in the city, the report said: “YMC has found the system of monitoring ineffective. There is no evidence that bottlenecks had been brought to the notice of the Board and of the government or the intervention of higher authorities sought.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/yamuna-monitoring-panel-raises-several-issues-on-river-pollution/article33398857.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Air in Delhi now ‘severe’||The air quality of Delhi and Noida deteriorated to the “severe” category on Tuesday and Gurugram’s was in the higher end of the “very poor” category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The national capital’s air quality is likely to deteriorate on Wednesday. “AQI is forecast to further deteriorate to the ‘higher end of the very poor category by Dec. 23 and Dec. 24 with quite a few regions may even experience severe AQI for a shorter time period, especially during the early morning,” said government-run monitoring agency, SAFAR. The speed of surface-level winds is “low” and westerly in direction and the winds are likely to further slowdown, which will aid in the accumulation of pollutants. Faster surface winds help in the dispersion of pollutants. The effect of stubble burning on the city’s air quality was low, but mixing height, which is the height from the ground level up to which pollutants can be dispersed, was “low”. This also leads to the accumulation of pollutants near the surface. The AQI of Delhi was 418 on Tuesday, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/air-in-delhi-now-severe/article33398654.ece

23 December 2020||Mumbai,||HC: possession of dead animal’s skin not an offence under MAPA||Possession of a dead animal’s skin will not amount to an offence under the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act (MAPA), 1976, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court has said while quashing an FIR against a man for possession of skins of dead cows. The MAPA prohibits slaughter, purchase, sale, import, export and possession of beef. A Division Bench of Justices V.M. Deshpande and A.S. Kilor passed the order on December 14 while hearing a petition filed by Shafiqullaha Khan Ashfaqullha Khan seeking to quash a July 2018 case registered against him under provisions of the MAPA for alleged possession of 187 skins of cows in a van he was driving. The FIR against Mr. Khan was registered at Shivaji Nagar police station in Buldhana district. Mr. Khan was booked under Sections 5A (prohibition on transportation of cow, bull or bullock within the state for purpose of slaughter), 5B (prohibition on transportation of these animals outside the state for purpose of slaughter), and 5C (prohibition on possession of flesh of cow, bull or bullock). The Bench in its order said that the provisions of the Act prohibited purchase and sale of cows, bulls or bullock for slaughter and possession of flesh of any cow, bull or bullock. “There are no allegations that the applicant was transporting or exporting cow, bull or bullock for the purpose of slaughter. There are also no allegations that the applicant purchased or sold or otherwise disposed of or offered to purchase or sell or dispose of cow, bull or bullock for slaughter,” the court said. It added that thus no offence constituted against Mr. Khan. “There is no doubt that the skin is not covered under the provisions of the MAPA. Thus, there is no prohibition for the possession of skin of dead animals,” the court said, quashing the FIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-possession-of-dead-animals-skin-not-an-offence-under-mapa/article33398571.ece

23 December 2020||Mumbai,||Farmers stage protest at BKC||As farmers from across Maharashtra started travelling to Delhi to join the ongoing agitation against three new farm laws, farmer organisations on Tuesday staged a protest outside the office of Reliance Industries at Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai. The demonstrators were led by farmer leader Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, Maharashtra’s Minister of State and Prahar Sanghatana leader Bachchu Kadu, and Left parties. “The three farm laws brought in by the Central government are only to help capitalists like Ambani and Adani. It has no intention to benefit farmers but to make them slaves. We will not let that happen,” Mr. Shetti said. The protesters also burned Jio SIM cards as the police had barricaded the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmers-stage-protest-at-bkc/article33398574.ece

The prison authorities were asking her to wear the convict’s uniform of green sari even though she was only an under-trial accused, she said in her petition. The court asked the prison authorities to submit a reply on January 5.

23 December 2020||Navi Mumbai,||One-year-old from SA undergoes liver transplant||For a slightly more than one-year-old Nayum from South Africa, the battle against a congential condition called biliary atresia began soon after his birth. A few days after he was born to Wazir Khan and Vasila Saiyed in October last year, Nayum was diagnosed with jaundice. “Since jaundice is very common in newborns, we started treating him for that. It was when he became two-month-old that doctors found out about his condition,” Ms. Saiyed, who also has a seven-year-old daughter and a four-year-old son, said. After further tests to find the reason behind the prolonged jaundice, doctors opined that he needed a Kasai surgery. “Kasai surgery usually helps one third of the children with this condition. But in Nayum’s case, it didn’t help him and the situation worsened with two episodes of internal bleeding and heavy weight loss. A liver transplant was must,” Dr. Ravi Mohanka, chief surgeon and HoD, liver transplant and HPB surgery, Global Hospital, Mumbai, said. A relative of Ms. Saiyed had undergone a liver transplant in India and the family was keen on getting it done in that country as well. But what troubled Nayum’s parents, other than the startling discovery about their son’s health, was making travel arrangements in the middle of a pandemic. “I do not have anyone in India while my wife has relatives in Gujarat. We spoke to multiple teams in various hospitals and finally decided on Global Hospital for the transplant. The challenge was to travel in the time of COVID-19. Besides, with my passport expired and my son not having a passport added to my problems,” Mr. Khan, a banker by profession, said. Mr. Khan said that the Indian embassy was very helpful and granted them visas in one week’s time. In July 2020, Dr. Prashantha Rao, senior consultant, lead–cadaveric liver transplant, Global Hospital, told the family that the transplant needed to be done within two months. While the family was figuring out a way to reach India, the baby had a second episode of internal bleeding on October 15. Finally, they arrived in India on October 23, and the liver transplant surgery was performed on November 25. What came as a solace to the family was that Mr. Khan could be a donor. “The patient came to us after a failed Kasai surgery for biliary atresia. After clinical tests, the father was found to be a suitable donor and he agreed to donate part of his liver to save his child,” Dr. Mohanka said. It was decided to perform hepatectomy (surgical removal of part or entire liver) using a minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery technique. “A total laparoscopic donor hepatectomy is a safe and feasible option as it helps ease pain, reduce blood loss and morbidity, and ensures lesser complications and quicker recovery. This procedure is cosmetically good for a young donor. All of these will encourage more donations,” Dr. Mohanka said. Nayum, who weighed seven kg before the surgery, has gained more than one kg after the procedure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/one-year-old-from-sa-undergoes-liver-transplant/article33398573.ece
23 December 2020||Kathmandu,||Nepal’s ruling party appears headed for split||The ruling Nepal Communist Party on Tuesday appeared to be headed for a split after the warring factions held separate Central Committee meetings, with Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli announcing a new 1,199-member committee to organise the party’s general convention in an effort to strengthen his hold on it. Mr. Oli, who is also one of the two chairmen of the ruling party, announced the new committee during a meeting of the party’s Central Committee members close to him, at Baluwatar, the Prime Minister’s official residence, the Kathmandu Post reported. The members of the newly-formed general convention organising committee took oaths in the presence of the Prime Minister. The meeting also decided to remove Naryan Kaji Shrestha as the party spokesperson. Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali, a Standing Committee member, was appointed as the new spokesperson of the party, said Binod Shrestha, a Central Committee member. Nepal on Sunday plunged into a political crisis after Mr. Oli got the President to dissolve Parliament, a controversial move amidst a prolonged tussle for power between him and former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ within the ruling dispensation.  The newly-formed committee adds 556 members to the existing 446-member Central Committee of the ruling party. Addressing the Central Committee members of his faction, Mr. Oli said that it would not make any difference to the party if some leaders quit. Convention in November In the meeting, Mr. Oli also proposed to hold the party’s general convention from November 18-23 in Kathmandu next year. Earlier, the party’s convention was scheduled from April 7-12 next year. The rival faction led by Mr. Prachanda also held a separate central committee meeting in Kathmandu. Former Prime Ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal and former Agriculture minister Ghanashyam Bhushal were among the senior leaders who attended the Central Committee meeting of Prachanda-led faction. Nearly two-thirds of the 446 members of the Central Committee of the party were present in the Prachanda led faction’s meeting. However, a formal split of the party is yet to be announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nepals-ruling-party-appears-headed-for-split/article33398259.ece
23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||China slams U.S. over Tibet Bill, S. China Sea ‘trespass’||The United States and China on Tuesday sparred over Tibet and the South China Sea, with new moves from Washington marking the start of the last month of President Donald Trump in office fuelling fresh tensions in an already fraught relationship. On Tuesday, China hit out at the U.S. for passing the Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA), a landmark legislation that calls for the opening of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa and also underlines U.S. backing for the Dalai Lama to determine his successor. The Act said such decisions “should be made by the appropriate religious authorities within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition” with the “wishes of the 14th Dalai Lama... [playing] a determinative role”, and described “interference” in the succession by China as “a clear violation of the fundamental religious freedoms for Tibetan Buddhists and the Tibetan people”. With the Act, the U.S. will back the choice made by the Dalai Lama, even as China has made clear it would anoint its own successor, just as it did by naming its own 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 as Gyancain Norbu, rejecting the Dalai Lama-backed candidate, Gedhun Choekyi Nima, aged six at the time, who has not been seen in public since. China said it “resolutely opposes” the “adoption of Bills containing such ill contents on China”. “Issues related to Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong concern China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They are China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. “The Chinese government is determined in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests. We urge the U.S. to stop meddling in our domestic affairs under those pretexts, refrain from signing the bills or implementing the negative contents and items in them that target China and undercut China's interests, so as to avoid further damaging overall China-U.S. cooperation and bilateral relations.” ‘Momentous landmark’ The passing of the TPSA, which will have to be signed into law by Mr. Trump, was welcomed by the “government-in-exile” in Dharamsala and its leader or Sikyong Lobsang Sangay, who described it as “a momentous landmark for the Tibetan people” and said “by passing the TPSA, Congress has sent its message loud and clear that Tibet remains a priority for the U.S”. China also slammed new moves by the Trump administration to add 58 Chinese companies to a list of firms that it says have links to the Chinese military and to restrict visas for Chinese officials linked with human rights abuses. “The U.S. has been abusing state power and national security concept to suppress and contain certain foreign companies by applying measures such as export control,” Mr. Wang said, adding that the U.S. was “weaponising its visa policy to impose various visa sanctions on Chinese individuals citing so-called issues related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, religion and human rights”.  Naval dispute Both sides also clashed over the South China Sea, with the Chinese military on Tuesday saying it had “warned” a U.S. destroyer sailing in waters off the disputed Spratly islands (called Nansha by China). “On December 22, the US guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain trespassed into the waters adjacent to China’s Nansha islands and reefs without Chinese government’s permission, and the naval and aerial forces of the Chinese PLA Southern Theater Command conducted whole-process tracking and monitoring on the U.S. destroyer and warned it off,” said Air Force Senior Colonel Tian Junli, spokesperson for the PLA Southern Theater Command, accusing the U.S. of “seriously violating China’s sovereignty and security, and gravely undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea”. This was the ninth freedom of navigation operation conducted this year by the U.S., the most in the past five years, according to South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank, reported the Communist Party-run Global Times .

The previously undisclosed conversation came as London and Brussels try to thrash out a last-gasp post-Brexit trade deal and scramble to respond to a new strain of the novel coronavirus detected in the U.K. Mr. Johnson and Ms. von der Leyen are pressing to break a logjam over fishing rights with just nine days to go before Britain leaves the EU single market and customs union. The two sides are haggling over the cut EU fishermen would take to their current catches in Britain’s rich waters and the length of a transition period to phase in the changes. The talks have risked being overshadowed by the crisis over the new coronavirus strain found by London, that has seen countries in Europe and around the world cut travel links to Britain. The EU is scrambling to come up with a coordinated response after cross-channel traffic was left snarled as France shut down entry for passengers and goods. Ambassadors from the bloc’s 27 members are to meet later Tuesday to try to hammer out a plan to allow cargo to start moving again and EU nationals to return home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-pm-eu-chief-discussed-brexit-covid-19-situation/article33398256.ece

The government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been inching towards collapse for weeks and now the right-wing incumbent looks set to face a re-election battle as his long-awaited trial on corruption charges gets under way next year.   The coalition, led by Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud and his rival Benny Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party, has until the start of Wednesday to pass a 2020 budget or Parliament will automatically dissolve. Mr. Gantz demanded the government pass a budget covering both 2020 and 2021, arguing Israel needs stability. But Mr. Netanyahu has refused to endorse a 2021 budget. On Sunday, Blue and White said it had an agreement with Likud on a Bill to buy more time to pass both the 2020 and 2021 budget. But after yet another war of words between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz, Parliament rejected the Bill on Tuesday, with lawmakers voting against the coalition proposal 49 to 47.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-on-the-brink-of-fourth-poll-in-two-years/article33398251.ece
23 December 2020||Rabat,||Kushner joins flight from Israel to Morocco||The first Israel-Morocco direct commercial flight landed in the North African kingdom on Tuesday to mark the latest U.S.-brokered diplomatic normalisation deal between the Jewish state and an Arab country. U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House advisor Jared Kushner was on board along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s National Security Advisor Meir Ben Shabbat. The U.S.-Israeli delegation was welcomed at the airport by Moroccan officials, ahead of a programme that includes a meeting with King Mohammed VI at the royal palace, and a visit to the grave of Mohammed V. The trip is aimed at showcasing the Trump administration’s achievements in Middle East diplomacy, weeks before Mr. Trump is replaced at the White House by President-elect Joe Biden. Morocco became the third Arab state this year, after the UAE and Bahrain to normalise ties with Israel under U.S.-brokered deals, while Sudan has pledged to follow suit. Speaking at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport, Mr. Kushner said the country’s recent string of breakthrough deals marked a step towards a more normal co-existence between Jews and Muslims. “The state we have lived in for the last 75 years, where Jews and Muslims have been separated, is not a natural state,” he said before getting on the plane, which was painted with the Hebrew, Arabic and English words for “peace”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kushner-joins-flight-from-israel-to-morocco/article33398253.ece

23 December 2020||Geneva,||UN rights expert urges Trump to pardon Assange||A UN rights expert on Tuesday urged outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump to pardon Julian Assange, saying the WikiLeaks founder is not “an enemy of the American people”. WikiLeaks “fights secrecy and corruption throughout the world and therefore acts in the public interest both of the American people and humanity as a whole,” Niels Melzer wrote in an open letter. “In pardoning Mr. Assange, Mr. President, you would send a clear message of justice, truth and humanity to the American people and to the world,” said Mr. Melzer, the UN special rapporteur on torture. “You would rehabilitate a courageous man who has suffered injustice, persecution and humilation for more than a decade, simply for telling the truth,” he added. Mr. Assange, 49, is currently being held in the top-security Belmarsh jail in London awaiting a January 4 decision by a British judge on a U.S. extradition request, in a case seen by his supporters as a cause celebre for media freedom. The Australian publisher faces 18 charges in the U.S. relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 500,000 secret files detailing aspects of military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Belmarsh conditions Mr. Melzer has previously condemned the conditions at Belmarsh, saying the “progressively severe suffering inflicted” on Mr. Assange is tantamount to torture. In his letter on Tuesday, Mr. Melzer wrote: “I visited Mr. Assange ... with two independent medical doctors, and I can attest to the fact that his health has seriously deteriorated, to the point where his life is now in danger.” He noted that Mr. Assange suffers from a respiratory condition that makes him more vulnerable to COVID-19, which has infected several Belmarsh inmates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-rights-expert-urges-trump-to-pardon-assange/article33398257.ece
23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||COVID-19 and limits of political accountability||The year no one saw coming — 2020 — and that few will mourn as it passes into the history books, has upended a great many truisms of political life. Writing in this daily, (“Troughs and crests in the pandemic response”, April 25, 2020), I described the COVID-19 pandemic as a governance stress test that would expose how poorly prepared the world’s governments were. Eight long months later, the results are indisputable: they failed the exam, and how. Not all failures were equal though. Facing the hardest test imaginable, some struggled despite sincere efforts — see Japan, Germany, Norway, for example. But less forgiveable are the failures of leaders who quit immediately, resorting to mocking the exam and pretending that it was a figment of other people’s imaginations, to burying their heads in the sand even as the evidence of their abdication of responsibility was witnessed by body bags stacked in freezer trucks outside hospitals whose morgues were overflowing. Spectacular failures, response This being 2020, though, nothing is as we might have predicted. Thus, not only did some of the world’s most powerful leaders fail spectacularly to do their sworn duty to protect all their citizens, but they also paid little to no cost for abandoning us. If anything, in some instances, they appear to have been rewarded for their defiance of reality and ignorant embrace of quack science and alternative facts. The presidential elections in the United States frame a fascinating paradox: even as much of the world stared aghast at the abject failure of the world’s most powerful nation to mount any resistance to the novel coronavirus, many Americans decided to vote for an incumbent under whose contemptuous watch as many lives are being lost daily as were killed in the September 11, 2001, attacks. In other countries, too, leaders enjoy uncontested popularity even as the virus scoffs at their efforts to contain it. Across the Atlantic, Boris Johnson, whose apparent haplessness in high-stakes negotiations is exceeded only by the incoherence of his coronavirus response, swung between flirting with pursuing herd immunity in March to, now, just three days after calling just such a decision ‘inhumane’, “cancelling Christmas” for the United Kingdom. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro has elevated his attacks on science to levels defying parody. Last week, while stating irresponsibly his refusal to be vaccinated, even as his own government has launched a national vaccination campaign, Mr. Bolsonaro suggested that the vaccine might turn people into crocodiles. In India, draconian lockdowns of limited efficacy and the sight of millions of our fellow countrymen desperately walking hundreds of miles back to their villages, the scapegoating of minority communities and the dubious distinction of having the second largest number of cases, have scarcely dented Prime Minister Modi’s popularity, or, vide Bihar, even the power of his brand. And, then, of course, is Vladimir Putin, who has been little seen, or heard from, even as the virus rages unchecked across Russia whose citizens are voting with their feet against a vaccine whose efficacy and safety are inadequately understood given the opacity of Russia’s protocols. Mr. Putin is a dictator, cloaked in the flimsiest veneer of legitimacy granted by a fawning media and by ritualised elections in which he faces no credible opposition. And, yes, Mr. Trump lost decisively in November, though U.S. President-elect Joe Biden must confront the reality of a nation deeply divided, with almost half the population grasping at conspiracy theories about the election and questioning the science of vaccines, with a significant minority elevating Mr. Trump to cult-leader status. But Mr. Modi, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Bolsonaro retain the reins of power firmly. How come? Why are citizens willing to reward populist leaders who fail their people? Analysis and propositions The question requires us to confront the limits of political accountability in democracy, and to grapple with deeper, even existential, challenges to democratic control of politicians. Three propositions frame this analysis. First, while folk theories of democracy privilege retrospective accountability, that is the notion that voters use elections to render judgement about the incumbent’s record, the reality is we vote prospectively, granting leaders we believe represent people like us a mandate to govern in our name. Put differently, we vote against candidates who we fear will elevate our opponents to our disadvantage. A vote for Mr. Trump in 2020 was as much a rejection of some imagined socialist hellscape to be delivered by a Biden administration as it was an endorsement of Mr. Trump or his record in office. In Bihar, Mr. Modi campaigned that voting for his opponents was a vote for those against people saying ‘ Bharat Mata ki Jai ’ or ‘ Jai Shri Ram ’. Populist leaders grasp this visceral insight, offering voters stark choices between good, honest patriots battling anti-national elements, and the ‘ tukde tukde gang’. Nuanced, evidence-based consideration of policy alternatives might set the pulses of academics and pundits racing, but is a feeble antidote to the addictive jingoism peddled by populist demagogues. Second, disease, unlike war, does not offer a clear enemy to target. Public health advice that emphasised the need for personal responsibility — stay home, wear a mask, wash your hands — underestimated the challenge of collective action predicted on hundreds of millions of individual responses. If each of us is responsible for our own health, then getting sick is our own fault. Why should those unafraid of a mere virus be required to sacrifice? Do not blame us for your pain, blame China, rang the coordinated messages of government-funded IT cells and bot armies, amplifying racist and xenophobic memes across social media. Fading empathy Third, the coronavirus pandemic reveals the poverty of our collective ability to empathise with those we do not see. Like the uncounted deaths caused by air pollution, heat waves, or malnutrition, those dying from COVID-19 do so out-of-sight, alone. Reduced to data points, their deaths affect us less each day. Innovative data visualisation efforts initiated by news and academic organisations, once bookmarked in our web browsers and religiously referenced for daily updates, are now barely read by a global public inured to more data. Exponential growth is near impossible for the human brain to comprehend: in March, that Italy had crested 50,000 cumulative cases was international news; today alone the U.S. will record four times as many new cases. But even as the victims of the virus die considerately out of plain view, the economic devastation wrought by lockdowns is felt by us all. Grateful though we may be for being spared illness, we attribute that good fortune to our own responsible choices. But the loss of income and livelihood must be blamed on someone, and the same leaders whose indecision and ineptitude make draconian shutdowns necessary, redirect our anger elsewhere: on foreigners, on minorities, on globalists, on science, and especially on the institutions of government. Trust no one other than me, the populist incants, for I alone can save you. Some action If there is a bright side, it is that the playbook of blaming economic downturns on others is limited in its efficacy. Citizens might be willing to give politicians an ATKT [Allowed To Keep Terms] for inadequate responses to a once-in-a-century pandemic that humbled even the richest, most powerful nations of the world, but prolonged economic suffering demands government remedy more immediately. Feverish efforts to squeeze all available policy levers to stimulate economies reveal the urgency politicians are feeling to deliver something, anything, to increasingly restive populations. It will be cold comfort to the dead and grieving, but perhaps the people will eventually have the last laugh over the populists. One must hope so, for without some measure of accountability, democracy loses its power, and so do the people.

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Playing a game of brinkmanship in Nepal||On Nepali Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s recommendation, President Bidhya Devi Bhandari has dissolved Parliament before completion of its five-year term. Intra-party conflict, Mr. Oli’s egoistic behaviour, and lack of organisational management are the reasons for this catastrophe. Mr. Oli felt that he had no other option but to dissolve Parliament as his party detractors who outnumber him in all organisational layers — Secretariat, Standing Committee and Central Committee — had pushed him to the wall after he defied most of the directives given by the party. Moreover, following the integration of the two communist parties — the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) led by Mr. Oli and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ — last year, a strange leadership arrangement was made wherein both Mr. Oli and Mr. Prachanda were to serve as chairmen of the new Nepal Communist Party (NCP) until the next party convention. The deal made by the two party supremos for sharing power failed to materialise when Mr. Oli didn’t adhere to the agreed informal agreement. All other party dissenters led by former Prime Ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal also joined the Prachanda faction believing that Mr. Oli was going too far in flouting all the decisions of the party. Myth of stability Mr. Oli’s decision to throw the country into yet another electoral vortex has busted the myth of stability that seemed to reign in Nepal since the election three years ago. The new development has proved that a mechanical victory in an election alone does not provide stability if other factors that are essential for democratic governance are found to be lacking. Since a leader’s orientation and commitment are crucial for laying the foundation of democracy, he or she is expected to adhere to the minimum standards for building the system. Nepal has suffered a lot due to myopic decisions of political leaders who cannot see beyond their own selfish interests and short-term gains. Disgusted with political uncertainty and with political parties wrangling with one another, all of which halted the development of the country as well as the consolidation of democratic institutions, the Nepali people provided a huge mandate in the last election, almost two-thirds, to the newly formed NCP hoping that the government would run the country for its full term. Now their hopes have been belied by Prime Minister Oli whose decision is bereft of constitutional, political and circumstantial rationale. The Constitution of Nepal (2015) has almost blocked all channels for the dissolution of Parliament. Parliament can be dissolved if all the options enshrined in the Constitution for formation of government are exhausted. Mr. Oli’s failure to manage party affairs and his crisis of governance seemed to have pushed him to take this risky plunge. A small effort on his part could have averted the disaster. Intra-party conflict The NCP’s intra-party conflict is not ideological as all factions have accepted multi-party democracy despite their banners of Marxism-Leninism and Maoism, which are used by the Left parties to maintain their political identities. ‘Multi-party democracy’, or the communist slogan of Janata ko Bahudaliya Janbad , had been adopted by the late Madan Bhandari on the eve of the parliamentary election held in May 1991. The new incarnation of the Maoist party also accepted a multi-party system but didn’t embrace the Unified Marxist–Leninist’s version of Bahudaliya Janbad preferring instead to refer to Naulo Janbad (new democracy). It was nothing more than a jugglery of words in order to retain the respective positions of Marxist-Leninist and Maoist. Considering it as ideological, both the parties had agreed to settle this issue in the next NCP general conference. Governance problems The Oli government’s dismal failure to deliver, stories of scandals and corruption that dominated headlines, and eroding public faith in the capacity of governance also provided anti-Oli grist to critics in general. The test of any government lies in its capacity to deliver, and Mr. Oli’s populist commitments and promises didn’t work over a period of three years. On the contrary, the Prime Minister himself defended the alleged corrupt elements, including his ministers, saying the allegations were yet to be proven. People wanted fair investigation into various charges of corruption and the roles of middlemen who influenced Mr. Oli’s decisions for awarding project contracts, but the Prime Minister, in his characteristic manner, ridiculed genuine criticism. Although politicians are not left unscathed for their alleged indulgence in corruption, nepotism and patrimonial style, Mr. Oli seemed to be guided by a typical psyche of self-righteousness. The fallout of Mr. Oli’s decision is likely to turn the clock back. This means that the heydays of political instability will return along with the trend of fragmentation of political parties. This is mores so in the context of the NCP with each party/ individual being denounced as a traitor. Such a blame game is taking place after the artificial integration of the two communist parties. Their unity didn’t last long due to factionalism promoted by the power seekers. Mr. Oli wanted to be the real power centre, and the other leaders of Nepal, especially Mr. Prachanda, weren’t willing to accept that. Nepal has experimented with all forms of government — majority, minority, first party led-coalition, no party government (led by Chief Justice Khil Raj Regmi), and now the first communist government with nearly a two-thirds majority. But no government since 1990 has completed its full tenure of five years. Mr. Oli, who came to power with tall talk about stability and progress, lost direction when he took the decision of putting down his detractors. And he took that decision when the country is passing through a difficult time. The Constitution, to cite a former Chief Justice of Nepal, Kalyan Shrestha, has become the victim of political tricks and conspiracy. Mr. Oli’s reckless decision has not only threatened the new republic but also halted the prospect of development. With the country already grappling with the challenges of COVID-19, the new election will have multiplying effects. There seems to be no guarantee of stability and progress in Nepal.

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Put the farm laws on hold, uphold farmers’ rights||The Supreme Court’s recent suggestion to form a joint panel to look into the demands of the agitating farmers, has given a breather to the government, although such an offer, made officially at the outset, was rejected by farmer groups as a “dilly-dallying tactic”. Farmers’ representatives see a moral victory in the Supreme Court’s observations, in that the top court did not outright reject their demands or the right to protest. Agriculture producers are demanding a total repeal of the new reforms-oriented laws that provide for setting up private markets outside of designated mandis , allow contract farming without government regulation and also lift stockholding limits for farm produce.  Although the Court did not go into the merits of the demands, its intervention paved the way for farmers to challenge the constitutional validity of the central government enacting laws on agriculture, which is a State subject. A group has been formed on how to approach the matter legally. Be that as it may, the starting point of farmers’ demands in relation to the new farm laws was for mandatory payment of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for notified farm produce in private markets to be set up. Among other objections is the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act that provides for lifting of stock-holding limits on essential commodities. Under the new Act, any trader, company or agri-business, etc. will be able to store unlimited quantities of say, wheat, rice, sugar, onion and potato, for any period of time. Hoarding is normally related to speculation for profit that hits farmers and consumers alike. The government did not concede these demands in its proposals to the agitating farmers, which escalated the problem. Together, the new farm laws enable a private entity to control and monopolise the market. They can hold sway over not only the rate a farmer will get for his/her produce but also influence the market price at which the end-product will reach retail consumers. It’s about corporatisation But more importantly, the mechanisation and corporatisation of agriculture, that is at the centre of the reforms-oriented laws, is the threat to the survival of 56.7% of the total workforce and 86.08% of small and marginal operational landholding farmers (as per the Tenth Agriculture Census, 2015-16) engaged in farming activity in the country. Without adequately skilling, training and empowering the small and marginal farmers to become competitive on their land holding of less than two hectares, the government brought the new laws through the ordinance route, and that too when the country has been preoccupied and grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Reforms and governments Reforms in the agriculture sector have been an on and off process with successive governments since the economic liberalisation in 1991 and more so, under the subsequent World Trade Organization (WTO) norms. And, even though the WTO seems to be collapsing under its own weight from an unequal set of rules that favour developed countries, India and the other developing countries fought for a ‘peace clause’ to pursue country-specific food security policies in keeping with their socio-economic responsibility. Domestically, however, parties in opposition, in their time, raise objections to reforms in the farm and retail sectors. Having set a target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022, the Modi government seems to be in a hurry. Yet, it is important in the value chain to start from the backward linkage, i.e., the farmer, the last man as Gandhi would say. Will that last man benefit from these reforms? Or should there be efforts to lower input costs to make farming remunerative for producers? Instead, farmers are now faced with new amendments to the Electricity Act which propose to fully privatise distribution of power, a crucial input in farm irrigation. At present, payment of MSP for notified commodities even inside designated mandis is not mandatory. As a result, a majority of farmers are short changed. Without the backing of the law, there is no guarantee against this in the new markets that are being conceived — and what is agitating farmers. Fragmented landholdings have become a problem for big ticket farming seeking economies of scale in a competitive market. The government is banking on its reforms-oriented formation of producer companies as a panacea for all ills in the small and marginal farm sector. It has fixed an ambitious target of setting up 10,000 Farmer-Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2023-24 which must be registered as a company or a cooperative to run farming as a business. Dovetailed into this plan is the requirement for an FPO to hire the services of an experienced resource institution as promoter. The promoter can belong to private companies or a non-governmental organisation arm of mega companies or agri businesses which claim know-how on availing government grants, tax rebates and can leverage official schemes. Thus, an agri business can have its foot in the door even before a FPO is registered. Government guidelines facilitate this. Even though the idea was floated almost two decades ago when company law was amended to enable this, only 881 FPOs have been registered so far. Significantly, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an affiliate of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, has backed guaranteed payment of MSP to farmers so that growers are not exploited by big procurement companies. Need for consensus For now, it will be appropriate for the government to put on hold the implementation of contentious pieces of legislation and initiate widespread, transparent and participative consultations with all stakeholders including gram panchayats to arrive at informed decisions by consensus. Whatever be the criticism of the National Advisory Council set up during the previous United Progressive Alliance regime, it played a significant role in making “pro-people” the rights-based National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the National Food Security Act. Such acknowledgement of farmers’ rights is the need of the hour.

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Five years since Paris, an opportunity to build back better||December 12 marked the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement. The international community, including the European Union (EU) and India, gathered at the Climate Ambition Summit 2020 to celebrate and recognise our resolve in working towards a safer, more resilient world with net-zero emissions. A world we can be proud to leave to our grandchildren. During the past five years, the determination of the global community has certainly been tested and, in the past few months, we have all been hit by a virus with a potentially long-lasting impact on our society and economies. Green recovery In the midst of this pandemic, is it realistic to call for stronger global action to fight climate change? We believe that the case is more valid now than ever. Faced with overwhelming scientific evidence, a more pertinent question might be: Can we afford to let things worsen? The science is irrefutable: for future prosperity, we must invest in greening the global economy. We cannot afford not to do so. Post-COVID-19 recovery needs to be a green recovery. Back in December 2019, the European Commission launched the European Green Deal — a new growth model and roadmap to achieve climate neutrality in the EU by 2050. Our- “Next Generation EU” recovery package and our next long-term budget earmark more than half a trillion euros to address climate change. To reach climate neutrality by 2050, on December 11, EU leaders unanimously agreed on the 2030 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels. This will further accelerate the fast decrease in the costs of low carbon technologies. The cost of solar photovoltaics has already declined by 82% between 2010 and 2019. Achieving the 55% target will even help us to save €100 billion in the next decade and up to €3 trillion by 2050. No government can tackle climate change alone. We will pursue all avenues to foster cooperation with partners from all around the world. India is a key player in this global endeavour. The rapid development of solar and wind energy in India in the last few years is a good example of the action needed worldwide. Working with India The EU and India are committed to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. India has taken a number of very significant flagship initiatives in this respect, such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Leadership Group for Industry Transition. India and Team Europe are engaged to make a success of the forthcoming international gatherings: COP 26 in Glasgow on climate change and COP 15 in Kunming on biodiversity. There is a sense of global momentum emerging towards keeping the promise of the Paris Agreement and securing our future on this planet. Five years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever that the international community comes forward with clear strategies for net-zero emissions and to enhance the global level of ambition for 2030. Together with the delivery of the $100 billion of climate financing to countries most in need, these will be deliverables for the climate negotiations when they resume at COP 26 in Glasgow next November. Team Europe will continue to work closely with India on green investments and the sharing of best practices and technologies. We can avoid the most dramatic impacts of climate change on our societies. Our global, regional, national, local and individual recovery plans are an opportunity to ‘build back better’. We owe it to the next generation who will have to bear the burden of climate change and pay off the debt of the recovery. Good public policies are indispensable but not sufficient. We will also need to foster small individual actions to attain a big collective impact. This is the snowball effect we need starting from the Paris Agreement. With climate neutrality as our goal, the world should mobilise its best scientists, business people, policymakers, academics, civil society actors and citizens to protect together something we all share beyond borders and species: our planet.

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Mayhem in Nigeria||The recent release of scores of abducted school boys is doubtless a huge relief for Nigeria, where families often have to contend with bandits holding innocent civilians hostage for a ransom. The childrens’ return to freedom is but a temporary reprieve for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, whose response to the decade-old Boko Haram jihadist insurgency has come under increasing scrutiny.  Failure to combat insurgency A former army general and military ruler in the 1980s, Mr. Buhari, now in his second term, has repeatedly insisted that Boko Haram has been defeated. But the many splinter groups that have emerged, the deaths of about 36,000 people, and the displacement of nearly two million tell a different story. Casualties from landmine explosions, banned by the United Nations in 1997, in Nigeria are the fifth highest in the world, according to the Mines Advisory Group. The gruesome abduction of over 600 boys on December 11 night, reportedly carried out by proxies of Boko Haram, in Katsina in the country’s north-western region shows how the organisation has expanded into new territory. The ghastly incident was a chilling reminder of the 2014 kidnapping of 276 girls in the town of Chibok in the north-eastern Ekiti province. Many of them are still missing. The massacre of at least 110 rice farmers and fishermen in November, coinciding with local elections in the north-eastern State of Borno, is the most brutal incident this year, according to Nigeria’s UN humanitarian coordinator. Abuja has sought to deflect responsibility for the sectarian campaign that has exploited religious divisions between the Muslims in the north and Christians in the south. Comparing the decade-long challenge to the 1967 Biafran civil war, former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2012 admitted to Boko Haram’s infiltration into Nigeria’s legislative, executive and the security services. He initially played down the 2014 Chibok abductions, whereas the country’s First Lady at the time dismissed the outcry against the horror as discrediting her husband’s re-election prospects. The national security adviser in 2015 blamed cowardice by soldiers for the army’s failures, while admitting that new equipment had not been procured for several years. Contrast this with the assessment of the regional leaders. In 2014, the Borno State Governor was quite candid in saying that Boko Haram was better equipped than the Nigerian army. Last August, the current Governor of Borno pointed to sabotage within the military as the reason for the failure to combat the insurgency. By November 2018, the situation had worsened for the government, with the killing of some 100 Nigerian soldiers on the country’s border with Niger. A Boko Haram faction called the Islamic State in West Africa Province claimed that it had carried out the attacks, which put the government under increased spotlight. But even as Nigeria’s House of Representatives and the Senate have called for the heads of the armed forces, appointees of Mr. Buhari, to step down, the latter has maintained that the decision was a presidential prerogative. Crackdown on protests The official stance of denial stretches beyond tackling insurgency. This was evident in the crackdown on countrywide protests in October demanding the disbanding of the infamous federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The unrest, which was triggered by visuals going viral of one of the SARS officers shooting down a man in Lagos city, left at least 15 people dead, according to Amnesty International. The Special Weapons and Tactics Team that has replaced SARS is seen as a cure worse than the ailment. Regulators slapped a fine on media houses that covered the indiscriminate shootings by security forces and blocked the accounts of financiers of the protests. Last year, prominent global charities engaged in humanitarian relief were accused of collusion with the insurgents and expelled. Two decades since the return to democracy, Nigeria must do more to uphold the rule of law. garimella.subramaniam@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mayhem-in-nigeria/article33398246.ece
23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Pandemic resilience||The report of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs calling for a comprehensive Public Health Act, as a response to the extreme stresses caused by COVID-19, is a welcome call to reform a fragmented health system. When the pandemic arrived, National Health Profile 2019 data showed that there were an estimated 0.55 government hospital beds for 1,000 people. Prolonged underinvestment in public health infrastructure thus left millions seeking help from a highly commercialised private sector with little regulatory oversight; the situation was even worse in rural areas, where care facilities are weaker, and urban workers fled to their villages, afraid of the cost of falling sick in cities. Acknowledging these distortions, and the inadequacy of existing legal frameworks, the panel has called for an omnibus law that will curb profiteering during such crises and provide robust cashless health insurance. Its indictment of the feverish commerce surrounding health-care provision, however, can serve a larger purpose if it covers overall system reform, addressing the structural asymmetry created by misguided policies. India has committed itself to covenants such as the Sustainable Development Goals, but continues to evade making the right to health a full legal and justiciable right under the National Health Policy. Among the committee’s observations is the absence of insurance cover for many and oversight on hospitals to ensure that patients are not turned away in a crisis such as COVID-19. While the panel is right to view this as a breach of trust, one of the pandemic’s impacts has been a staggering rise in premiums, especially for senior citizens, of even up to 25% of the insured value. What is more, the insurance regulator, IRDAI, set 65 as the maximum age of entry for a standard policy earlier this year, affecting older uninsured citizens. Such age limits must be fully removed. The answer to creating an equitable framework lies in a tax-funded system, with the government being the single and sole payer to care providers. This is a long-pending recommendation from the erstwhile Planning Commission, and should be part of any reform. The government, as the single-payer if not sole care provider at present, would be better able to resist commercial pressures in determining costs. This is equally applicable for central procurement of essential drugs, which can then be distributed free. Legal reform must provide for a time-bound transition to universal state-provided health services under a rights-based, non-exclusionary framework, with States implementing it. Private arrangements can be an option. COVID-19 has exposed the dangers of excessive reliance on private tertiary care. The corrective lies in raising public spending to the promised 2.5% of GDP on public facilities that are universally accessible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pandemic-resilience/article33398232.ece
23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Delaying the inevitable||The government has kicked the can down the road by deciding to keep in abeyance critical provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 till March 31, 2021. To recap, because of the large-scale economic hara-kiri triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, the government had raised the threshold of loan defaults that would spark off insolvency proceedings from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1 crore on the day of the lockdown’s announcement — March 24. It had indicated that if things did not improve by April-end, the suspensions of certain sections of the IBC for six months could be considered to prevent companies at large from being forced into the insolvency process for a ‘ force majeure ’ default. An ordinance, in June, indefinitely barred the initiation of insolvency proceedings both, voluntarily or by creditors, for defaults arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of six months that could be stretched to a year. When the initial six months of forbearance under the IBC expired, it was extended till December 25. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s pronouncement now, of a further suspension, would mean the one-year limit permitted by the law is fully used up. The government must make it clear that this is the last such window of respite, even as the necessity for a blanket suspension of IBC at this point in time is not as apparent as it was in the first or second quarter of 2020-21. Stretching the IBC’s abeyance, for one, does not square up with the government’s proclamations of a firm, V-shaped economic recovery. Finance Ministry mandarins have repeatedly talked up growth prospects by flagging indicators returning to pre-COVID-19 levels, in several sectors. Surely, businesses in those sectors need no longer be sheltered from exits if they are not competitive. The government, by now, should know which sectors continue to remain in trouble. And if it is concerned about small and medium businesses, it could tweak the default threshold limit a tad higher, while letting bankruptcy processes function again for larger loan accounts. But a catch-all suspension could burden banks further and does not appear to have enthused industry either. One reason could be that the suspension also cuts off businesses’ ability to voluntarily enter insolvency — for many, post-COVID-19 operations may not seem viable. Denying them an exit route so as to cut their losses, while their assets shed value is a lose-lose proposition for both borrower and lender. A more nuanced approach would have been better for banks, businesses and the economy. Delaying the inevitable would mean greater financial stress ahead, as the restructuring and recovery of bad loans shall get tardier and future growth momentum would be punctured at the cost of understating present systemic stress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/delaying-the-inevitable/article33398233.ece

It, of course, leaves the sensational story of the varying fortunes of the rupee exchange at an abrupt stage, at a stage, that is to say, where the rupee, having reached the topmost point up the steep, had begun to slip down the slope on the other side with a velocity which the very heavy sale of Reverse Councils, meant to check it, only hastened its downward course. The story, however, affords to the student of currency and exchange interesting lessons, the more so as this surprisingly downward movement took place in a year and at a period when the balance of trade in favour of India was a very marked record. In the year under report, the gross exports of private merchandise amounted to 327·08 crores. Against this is to be set the figure for the gross imports of private merchandise which was 208·00; or, excluding from this, as we must do, the figures for Government transactions which are not settled through private remittances and do not affect the balance of trade, the imports amounted to, we note, 200·8 crores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/currency-operations-from-an-editorial/article33398242.ece

The Sangam should pave the way as a pioneer for developing this broad outlook, she said. She suggested that the Sangam should tape-record the nearly 700 and more of Thyagaraja’s songs, with the help of musicians who could render them faithfully, as it would be a source of permanent sustenance to generations to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/spread-of-bhakti-through-music/article33398243.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||‘Centre to set up development finance entity in 3-4 months’||The government plans to set up a Development Finance Institution (DFI) in the next three to four months with a view to mobilise the Rs. 111 lakh crore required for funding of the ambitious national infrastructure pipeline, according to Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda. “We need a development financial institution as infra financing needs patient capital, and banks are currently not suited for lending for long-term projects which do not generate any cash for years,” he told PTI . Even deepening the bond market with regard to infrastructure financing was a matter receiving the Centre’s attention and there was a need to do something more in order to have a robust bond market for infrastructure financing, he said. “To provide funding, to enhance credit rating of projects, a DFI is needed, and we are actively working on it, and soon such an institution will be in place. We are in the process of finalising details such as shareholding of the government and whether such a body will be formed through a statute. “The DFI will be a catalyst, and would fund projects where others are not willing to enter because of the risks involved,” he said. The DFI should become a reality may be by the end of the current financial year or early next year, he added. In her last Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to set up DFIs for promoting infrastructure funding. About 7,000 projects have been identified under the National Infrastructure Pipeline with projected investment of Rs. 111 lakh crore during 2020-25. The DFI, Mr. Panda said, would have a key developmental role apart from the financing role. Prior to liberalisation, India had DFIs engaged in development of industry. ICICI and IDBI, in their previous avatars, were DFIs. The country’s oldest financial institution IFCI Ltd. too had acted as a DFI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centre-to-set-up-development-finance-entity-in-3-4-months/article33398230.ece

23 December 2020||MUMBAI,||Indices gain 1% in pullback as IT, pharma stocks lead recovery||The equity markets on Tuesday rebounded with a 1% gain following a rise in IT and pharma stocks, a day after benchmark indices crashed 3% on fears of a new strain of the COVID-19 virus. Buoyed by global cues, the indices opened in positive territory, slumped soon after, but bounced back in the second half. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 453 points or 0.99% to 46,007 points. All sectoral indices that fell on Monday were back with gains. Top Sensex gainers included HCL Tech that rose 5.09%, Tech Mahindra (4.33%), Infosys (3.78%), PowerGrid (2.67%) and Sun Pharma, which climbed 2.64%. The NSE Nifty 50 index also rose 1.03% to 13,466.30 points. Sameet Chavan, chief analyst (Technical and Derivatives), Angel Broking said, “The second half turned out to be excellent for the markets; we witnessed V-shaped recovery. IT stocks were the real charioteer and once again came to the rescue.” “For the next couple of days at least, the index is likely to remain in a slightly wider range before deciding its next path. The ideal range [for the Nifty] would be 13,600 to 13,100, where the lower range should be seen as a sacrosanct support,” he added. Other analysts said the volatility in the market would remain high in the near term due to strict lockdowns and with travel restrictions impacting economic recovery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/indices-gain-1-in-pullback-as-it-pharma-stocks-lead-recovery/article33398217.ece

With this, Racing Team India will become the first squad of all-Indian drivers to compete globally in the world of endurance racing. The Asian Le Mans Series, to be held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi on February 5-6 and February 19-20, comprises four races spread over two race weekends. Each race lasts four hours. The Indian team will drive an ORECA 07 car in the LMP2 class, and have technical support from the Championship-winning Algarve Pro Racing Team. “I have been dreaming of going back to Le Mans for a few years now. This is probably the most exciting project in my career as a racing driver,” said Narain. “We have a young and fledgeling team and it will, no doubt, be a big test for us, but I am confident of doing well.” Gautam Singhania, a member of the FIA (Federation Internationale de l’Automobile) World Motor Sport Council, will lead Team India with JK Tyre as one of the commercial partners. The Bengaluru-based Arjun Maini’s experience in endurance racing will come in handy for the team, having driven for Algarve Pro Racing Team in the 2020 European Le Mans Series (ELMS). “I am glad to be back to racing so soon after the 2020 European Le Mans season, and I do believe that Algarve Pro Racing Team, the defending Asian Le Mans Series champion, gives us the best possible chance of securing an entry to the 24 Hours of Le Mans,” said Maini.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/narain-to-lead-team-india/article33398366.ece
23 December 2020||Adelaide,||Chin up, Kohli tells his boys||India captain Virat Kohli left Australian shores on Tuesday after a pep talk to his beleaguered teammates, handing over the mantle of leading the side to Ajinkya Rahane in the remaining three Tests. Kohli is returning to India to attend the birth of his first child in January. Before boarding the flight back home, Kohli encouraged his boys to give their all in the remainder of the series, which the visitors trail 0-1 after the heavy defeat in the opening Test. Positive frame of mind The idea behind organising the pep talk was to keep the players in a positive frame of mind heading into the crucial Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. India lost the lung-opener here inside three days after crumbling to their lowest Test score of 36. The second Test is scheduled to be held at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground from December 26-30. Kohli, who has been leading the Test team since 2014, urged his players to show intent and express themselves on the field without any inhibitions. While Kohli has departed for India, his white-ball deputy Rohit Sharma is quarantining in Sydney. Kohli was India's best performer with the bat in the series opener, top-scoring with a sedate 74 in the first innings before being run out following a misunderstanding with Rahane.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chin-up-kohli-tells-his-boys/article33398317.ece
23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Summer of 42 to the Winter of 36, but there’s no need to panic||The Goldilocks principle — from the story of the little girl who found the third bowl of porridge (and chair and bed) in the bears’ house “just right” — explains how life exists on earth. It is just the right distance from the sun, has just the right mix of gases in the atmosphere, the right temperature for the formation of water and so on. One way to understand India’s 36 all out in Adelaide is by applying the Goldilocks principle. Australia’s fast bowlers bowled a length that was just right, swung the ball just enough, and the batsmen did just enough to nick it. It was a freakish coming together of circumstances. What was surprising was that it should occur in our time, when coaching is ‘scientific’ and the computer is a crucial member of every squad. Technology and data mining ensure there are no secrets at the highest level. You can overanalyse such a freakish occurrence. To dismiss a team, you need to bowl just ten wicket-taking deliveries. Usually such deliveries are spread out over a day or two. Theoretically, these could be bunched together at the start of an innings. Or, as in Adelaide, stretched over 21.2 overs. No extravagance Australia’s bowlers displayed no extravagance, and that was the key. No awe-inspiring swing or breathtaking bounce. Such control was poetic — concise, taut, nothing wasted. The bat is 10.8 cm at its widest. A ball has to move just over 5cm to beat the middle and take the edge. A little more, and it will miss the edge altogether. Cricket is a game of centimetres; pitch the ball up a few centimetres and you have the batsman in two minds. Should he go forward or back? Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood did just that. Batsmen were caught in no-man’s land, undone by the consistency. Australian bowlers might bowl better than this in future, for fewer wickets. That is the nature of the game. As they sent India crashing, there were few oohs and aahs to indicate near-misses or edges that carry to the boundary. Every snick was held, five of them by wicketkeeper Tim Paine; every attempt at breaking away — as with Kohli’s — went to hand. When India fell for 42 at Lord’s in 1974, their previous lowest, the top five read: Sunil Gavaskar, Farokh Engineer, Ajit Wadekar, Gundappa Viswanath, Brijesh Patel. Not far behind the current line-up: Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane. “Geoff Arnold and Chris Old bowled five good balls which got our five top batsmen,” Gavaskar said of that occasion, “after that there was no resistance.” Something similar can be said about the Adelaide fiasco. There is no need to panic. Questions will be asked about the batsmen’s defensive technique, and just how much it has been eroded by T20 cricket across the world. Top bowlers can exploit the slightest weakness, as Australia did with Shaw’s uncertainty over the incoming delivery. Or Agarwal’s. Conservative approach Questions need to be asked about team selection. In modern sport, decisions have to be made quickly. India were conservative, sticking with a team that played the last Test 10 months ago, and ignoring current form (in any format). The best performers in the white ball matches in Australia — K.L. Rahul, T. Natarajan, Hardik Pandya — had confidence coming into the Test series, but will now have a more difficult task if picked (Pandya is back home). The man picked to replace father-to-be Virat Kohli — whether Rahul or Shubman Gill — deserved to start the series. Questions must be asked about the fielding — crucial catches were dropped. This can’t be the new India Kohli says he is representing. Questions ought to be asked about the role of the Board of Control for Cricket in India too. The confusion over the fitness of Rohit Sharma meant the batsman was not available for the Test. Ravi Shastri had said Rohit needed to leave by the end of November, but he left only on December 15 with a two-week quarantine to follow. Ishant Sharma was ruled fit by the BCCI on November 27 but unfit to tour. Perhaps he is being rested with England series — home and away — to follow. Injury-management is meant to help the national team, not hinder it. Kohli admitted in Australia that he was baffled. The loss of Mohammed Shami will hit the team. His arm was fractured by Cummins, who was brilliant on the day. But it was distressing watching him aim at Shami even as the batsman was backing away. The honour code regarding bouncers to rival fast bowlers seems to have gone out of the window. But to watch the world’s No. 1 bowler attacking a No. 11, rather than the stumps was pathetic. It is not a sight one wishes to see on a cricket field.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/summer-of-42-to-the-winter-of-36-but-theres-no-need-to-panic/article33398323.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Sindhu hopeful of travelling from UK to Thailand||Unfazed by the worsening COVID-19 situation in England where she is training right now, world champion shuttler P.V. Sindhu, on Tuesday, said that she remains hopeful of travelling to Thailand for tournaments in January despite countries increasingly banning flights from the UK. Sindhu, who has qualified for the Tokyo Olympics, has been training in London for the last two months and is scheduled to play her first tournament since the break in Thailand. She will have to be in Bangkok by January 3 to compete in the two Super 1000 events (January 12 to 17 and January 19 to 24). “I plan to travel in the first week of January. There is no travel ban from UK in Thailand, so I can travel from Doha. The idea is to use the Gulf route to reach Thailand,” said Sindhu, who is managed by sports management firm Baseline Ventures. More contagious Several countries around the world, including India, have imposed bans on flights on the UK because of a new and seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus in England. The 25-year-old had left for London in October to focus on her nutrition and fitness at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI) and also has been training alongside British shuttlers Toby Penty and Rajiv Ouseph at the National Training Centre. “Thankfully, my training is going on pretty well. The national centre is not closed. It is run as a bubble centre, so I have been able to practise ahead of the events in Thailand," Sindhu said. The Thailand leg will mark the return of international badminton but the country has been dealing with pro-democracy protest movements and has recently seen a spike in COVID-19 cases as well. Last Saturday, health officials in Thailand reported 548 new cases, most victims being migrant workers of the seafood industry in Samut Sakhon province, 34 kilometres southwest of Bangkok. Increasing cases “Cases in Thailand are also increasing, so there is uncertainty about Thailand event too, we really hope that things are under control and the event goes ahead. We need badminton to restart just like other sports,” said Yashwanth Biyyala, Director, Athlete at Baseline Ventures. The Sports Ministry had recently approved Sindhu’s request to have her personal physio and fitness trainer accompany her to three tournaments in January. Sindhu last competed in March when she participated in the All England Championship, following which all tournaments were either cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-hopeful-of-travelling-from-uk-to-thailand/article33398368.ece

23 December 2020||London,||Abraham helps Chelsea sink West Ham||Tammy Abraham hit a quickfire late double on Monday as Chelsea beat West Ham 3-0 to reignite its Premier League challenge after consecutive defeats. The Hammers proved tricky opponents at an empty Stamford Bridge, but lacked the firepower to hurt Frank Lampard’s men, who led early through Thiago Silva’s bullet header. Moves to fifth Chelsea enjoyed a strong start to the season before losses to Everton and Wolves checked its progress but the victory at the London Stadium lifts it to fifth spot. Champion Liverpool has opened up a five-point gap at the top of the table but behind it, just seven points separate second-placed Leicester from 11th-placed Wolves. West Ham had the ball in the net in the seventh minute after a cleverly worked free-kick, but Declan Rice was denied by the off-side flag after an impressive finish from a tight angle. Three minutes later Chelsea was in front when Silva powered home a header from Mason Mount’s corner. The Brazilian found the net from close range after a well-timed run, leaving West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski rooted to the spot. Timo Werner had a golden chance to double the lead in the closing minutes of the first period, but got the ball caught under his feet and Fabianski saved comfortably. David Moyes’ team made life uncomfortable for the home side after the break but did not make the most of its regular forays despite the introduction of forward Said Benrahma. It was made to pay when Abraham, back in the starting XI, doubled Chelsea’s lead with 12 minutes to go, settling its nerves and ending his own drought. Two minutes later Chelsea was 3-0 up when Abraham fired home from a tight angle. Earlier, Burnley beat Wolves 2-1 to climb out of the Premier League’s relegation zone, thanks to goals from Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood.  The results: Chelsea 3 (Silva 10, Abraham 78, 80) bt West Ham 0; Burnley 2 (Barnes 35, Wood 51) bt Wolves 1 (Silva 89-pen) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/abraham-helps-chelsea-sink-west-ham/article33398388.ece

23 December 2020||Tokyo,||Tokyo Games cost revised to $15.4 billion, up 22%||The official cost of the postponed Tokyo Olympics has increased by 22 per cent, the local organising committee said on Tuesday in unveiling its new budget. In an on-line news conference, organisers said the Olympics will now cost $15.4 billion to stage. This is up from $12.6 billion in last year's budget. Added expenses The added $2.8 billion is the cost of the one-year delay. Added expenses come from renegotiating contracts and measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The Olympics is to open on July 23, 2021. The Paralympics follows on August 24. Audits by the Japanese government over the last several years, however, show the costs are higher than officially stated and are at least $25 billion. Tokyo said the Olympics would cost about $7.5 billion when the IOC awarded the games in 2013. A University of Oxford study earlier this year said Tokyo is the most expensive Summer Olympics on record. Japanese government entities are responsible for all of the costs except for $6.7 billion in a privately funded operating budget. "The IOC and TOCOG (Tokyo organising committee) want the public budget to appear as small as possible not only to guard against public criticism, but also to not discourage future candidate cities," Franz Waldenberger, director of the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, wrote in a recent paper examining Olympic costs. Organisers in October announced cost reductions of $280 million, cutting out frills including hospitality offerings. However, no cuts have been made to the sports programme with a full complement of 11,000 athletes and tens of thousands of officials, judges, and sponsors expected to attend. Decisions about fans and preventive measures for the pandemic are expected to be rolled out in 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tokyo-games-cost-revised-to-154-billion-up-22/article33398377.ece

23 December 2020||Los Angeles,||NBA won't jump the line for vaccine, says Silver||Commissioner Adam Silver said on Monday the NBA would not "jump the line" for the COVID-19 vaccine as the league prepared to tip off its new season amid a surge in coronavirus cases across the United States. Wait our turn Speaking on a conference call ahead of the start of the 2020-2021 season on Tuesday, Silver emphasised the NBA would "wait our turn" to obtain the vaccine, which began to be administered for the first time last week. Silver said he hoped NBA players and staff would eventually play a role in helping to assure the public of the benefits of getting the vaccine. "It's my hope that when we are eligible, members of the NBA community will want to get vaccinated and it's our plan to be involved with governmental efforts in terms of public messaging as to the benefit of taking the vaccine," he said. The new season will take place with teams playing in their home markets, a move that represents myriad logistical challenges for the NBA and its 30 teams. Silver said playing an entire season in a bubble-like environment was deemed "untenable" but insisted he was confident of health and safety protocols put in place to mitigate the risk from the virus. "We would not be opening our season if we did not believe it was safe and responsible to do so," he said. However, keeping in mind possible contingencies, NBA chiefs have released a schedule of games only for the first half of the abbreviated 72-game season, and will finalise the second half of the calender at a later date. Bumps along the way "We do anticipate there will be bumps in the road along the way," Silver said. "We're waiting to see how this plays out before issuing the second half of the season. We know it's possible we may have to reschedule games along the way."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nba-wont-jump-the-line-for-vaccine-says-silver/article33398390.ece
23 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Nihal, Gukesh and Rakshitta reach final||Nihal Sarin came up with twin knight-sacrifice to nail a dramatic 1.5-0.5 win over Italy’s Sonis Francesco to become the third Indian, along with D. Gukesh and Rakshitta Ravi, to reach the gold-medal matches of FIDE Online World Cadet and Youth chess championship on Tuesday. Playing in the under-18 section, Sarin drew the first game with black pieces. In the second, the talented Indian displayed his preparation in sacrificing both knights on the 14th and 17th moves, claimed his rival’s queen for a rook but then marshalled his remaining resources brilliantly to win in 47 moves. The second seeded India now plays Armenia’s Shant Sargsyan, seeded four. Sarin had to play his semifinal on Tuesday because his scheduled clash with Peru’s Narayana Hepler Ramirez on Monday was put on hold after the latter was found in violation of the tournament's fairplay policy. Ramirez was later disqualified and Sonis replaced him. On Monday, Gukesh reached the under-14 final after beating Dennis Lazavik 2-1. Gukesh won the first but lost the second. In the deciding Armageddon game, Gukesh gained a winning position but eventually drew. Since he played with black pieces, a draw was enough for him to advance to the final against Russian talent Volodar Murzin. In the girls’ under-16 semifinals, sixth seed Rakshitta stunned second seeded Russian Leya Garifullina 1.5-0.5 after winning the first game in 45 moves. In the final, Rakshitta plays fourth seeded Chinese Song Yuxin. The only Indian to lose in the semifinal was nine-year-old Mrinmoy Rajkhowa, who did not know the technical rules in the deciding Armageddon game and lost a completely drawn position on time to Finek Vaclav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nihal-gukesh-and-rakshitta-reach-final/article33398372.ece

Hope everything goes well with the baby, and pass on my best to your wife,’” said Smith at a virtual press conference facilitated by the series’ official broadcaster Sony Network. “To stand up and want to go home for the birth of his first child, it's a credit to him,” said Smith.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hope-everything-goes-well-with-the-baby/article33398313.ece
23 December 2020||ADELAIDE,||Let it go and move on, Smith to Indians||Australian batting star Steve Smith had a word of advice for the Indians who were battered into submission in the first Test — “let it go and move on”. The duo of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins proved hot to handle as India was shot out for its lowest Test score of 36 in its second innings of the Day-Night Test and went on to lose by eight wickets. “Look, the other day we just saw some pretty incredible fast bowling. It is probably the best I've seen our bowlers bowl collectively for about five years,” said Smith at a virtual media conference hosted by official broadcaster Sony. “The lengths they were hitting were impeccable. Sometimes that happens, you get a good ball and you nick it... you got to let it go and move on, and try and keep yourself in a positive mindset,” said the 31-year-old. Asked what he thought India’s mindset would be after such a huge defeat, Smith said: “Every individual is different... the way they take their dismissals, how they think about the game after it's finished. It’s important to keep moving forward, look at what you could have done better.” Saini, Siraj have quality Though India will miss top pacer Mohammed Shami, Smith felt that India has quality bowlers in Navdeep Saini and Mohammed Siraj. “I think they’re two quality bowlers who can have good Test careers. Obviously they are missing Ishant (Sharma) as well, a big loss for them in terms of experience,” said Smith.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/let-it-go-and-move-on-smith-to-indians/article33398318.ece

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Veiling power of ajnana||Advaita philosophy emphasises the oneness of God, soul and the universe. So it holds ajnana as being responsible for the Dvaita bhava, that is, the perception of diversity that is contrary to its fundamental teaching. Ajnana is also shown to be the cause for man’s bondage and suffering. In the text Naishkarmya Siddhi, the acharya shows that by using one’s discrimination, it is possible to realise how ajnana takes refuge in the atma’s jnana swaroopa and distorts its true nature, pointed out Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal in a discourse. For instance, all of us know we are ignorant. The claim that ‘I am ignorant’ is accepted as normal. In the Chandogya Upanishad, Narada tells Sanatkumaras that he knows many sastras and his knowledge is substantial but yet he is not knowledgeable of the atma swaroopa. The atma in the jiva is self effulgent and is the essence of jnana. It is jnana swaroopa. The body mind complex of the jiva, like a pot, is of the anatma category and hence by nature ignorant. A pot is a jada vastu, and cannot have jnana. It does not need ajnana to make it ignorant nor can it be assumed that it can ever gain jnana. Neither can it gain ajnana as it is already of the nature of ajnana. Since ajnana cannot take recourse in any aspect of the anatma group it superimposes itself on the jnana swaroopa of the atma. Ajnana uses the atma as its refuge and object and causes a strange effect on it. So, the jiva appears like an ajnani and goes through the pressures of samsara. The oft quoted example of the rope which is not recognised as such and is instead seen as a snake explains the repercussions arising from such a fundamental mistake. The confusion is removed when the ajnana is dispelled and the true state of affairs is clearly perceived.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/veiling-power-of-ajnana/article33398309.ece

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Into the writer’s world||When Anna Todd spent her childhood days burying her nose in The Baby-Sitters Club and Goosebumps , little did she know that millions would read her books someday. She is now a published author with several books and films to her credit. She started her writing journey on Wattpad, an online platform that publishes user-generated stories, which helped her publish her first book, After, in 2014. It was all uphill from there. Two of her novels — After and After We Collided — were adapted to films and she went on to write 10 more since. Despite mixed reviews, After We Collided , which had a limited release in theatres and is currently streaming on Netflix, became a success at the box office. “If I wasn’t a writer, I have no idea what I would be. I would probably have an office job and would be daydreaming of being a writer”, says Anna, replying via e-mail. You found your love for books and writing at a very young age, who were your favourite authors growing up? I have been an avid reader since I can remember and started really loving to read through Harry Potter. I remember waiting to check the books out at my school library as they were released. I also loved classic literature, Jane Austen, The Bronte Sisters, Hemingway. My love for reading really bloomed from them and it definitely shaped the way I write characters and plotlines. Everyone loves a classic trope.  You have mentioned that your writing journey began on Wattpad. How did the platform help you become a published author?  Wattpad was a creative outlet for me. It was a place where I felt like I could publish my writing, even though I didn’t think anyone would actually read it at the time. It’s such a safe and free place for creatives and without it, I wouldn’t have published my work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/into-the-writers-world/article33398543.ece

In the second season of the show, which streams on Disney+ Hotstar from December 24, Anu Chandra confesses to killing her husband. Kirti, who has been a part of films like Pink , Mission Mangal , Uri: The Surgical Strike and Blackmail , found playing Anu Chandra to be a challenge. “She comes with a lot of baggage and has a personal history that drove her to do what she did,” says Kirti, admitting that she spent a lot of time understanding the character. “A lot is going on in her life and I had to show that painful journey. Her pain has to reflect on my face,” she adds. As part of her role preparation, the actor spent time with a psychiatrist couple to understand the trauma that victims like Anu Chandra go through. “Specialists can best explain the dynamics of a relationship that Anu was in. To be able to emote in front of the camera, I would personally have to be convinced of [the character]. I am not the kind of actor who would come unprepared. Playing complex characters is fun and challenging; it actually scares me sometimes,” she says. She calls herself an “inquisitive actor”. “I like to ask questions and seek explanations. That is how I am. I like assimilating and analysing to be convinced of what I am told.” While Kirti loves her work, she ensures travelling does not take a backseat. Though she made the best use of her time at home during lockdown, she escaped to the mountains the moment travelling was made possible. “I love my time in the hills and love to travel whenever I can. I started travelling in August with all the safety precautions,” she adds. She also engages frequently with over a million of her followers on Instagram. “I think our followers definitely want to see us minus the makeup and are keen to know what do we do offscreen. My hair care routine which I shared during the lockdown got a lot of traction,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/playing-complex-characters-can-be-scary/article33398541.ece

23 December 2020||December 23 2020 00:00 IST,||Shakespeare slam||Till four months ago, eight-year-old R Vishakan barely knew who William Shakespeare was. Then, Saturday night changed it all for the class II student of Mahatma CBSE School in Madurai. “I want to read and perform the Bard’s works,” he says playfully, after winning second prize in the junior mono act competition of Shakespeare’s plays conducted by the India chapter of Helen O’Grady International, an organisation that has been globally promoting personal development through drama for 40 years. What made the flagship annual event — The Battle of the Bard — more challenging this year was its online format due to the pandemic. However, that did not lessen the enthusiasm of contestants, says Arpita Mittal, CEO of the Perth (Australia)-based organisation’s India chapter. Vishakan’s delighted parents say, but for the online competition (posters of which they came across accidentally), their son would not have been exposed to the works of the celebrated playwright at this impressionable age. “He does not have stage fright and can memorise things fast, so we made him participate to keep him off gadgets,” says M Renganathan of his son, who enrolled in Helen O Grady’s workshop on dramatics for a week. From his school day memories of studying Shakespeare, Renganathan chose Shylock’s role in Merchant of Venice for his son to enact. The three-minute video clip was filmed on his phone. “We saw Vishakan enjoy his rehearsals. The instinct that the big announcement could be in his favour strengthened when the international panel of judges expressed their awe at an eight-year-old’s memory and acting skills during the virtual prize ceremony,” he adds. More than 750 entries from 22 States were submitted and the panel of eight Indian judges short listed 10 best in each category: mono act and monologues/soliloquy for juniors (eight to 12 years), seniors (13 to 20 years) and open category (for those above 20 years). Helen O Grady’s international directors from Malta, Morocco, Ireland and South Africa further shortlisted five nominations in each category and announced the final winners. Vishakan was the youngest contestant and Achuthan Kumar, at 70, was the oldest awardee. The first two years of Shakespeare slam were held as inter-school competition across multiple cities. Tamil Nadu with 52 submissions debuted at the competition this year and gave three winners in a list of 15. “So many people with a joy and wonder for Shakespeare found a place of connection,” says Arpita, who established the India chapter in Mumbai in 2003. “The brilliant performances by the participants reflect that the appetite for literature and understanding of Shakespeare has not diminished,” she says. Adds Archana Dange, TN operations head, “Shakespeare is an integral part of our school learning, yet our students are put off by his works largely because the way it is taught in schools.” Winners are entitled to participate in the Shakespeare School Festival held annually in Cape Town every September. This year’s winners will have to wait and count on their luck depending on the COVID-19 situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/shakespeare-slam/article33398552.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. begins contact tracing passengers with U.K. travel history||The Delhi government has directed officials to trace and test all passengers who have travelled from the U.K. in the last 14 days and the process has started in the city, according to authorities. Also, five people who have travelled from the U.K. have tested positive for the virus, said Genestrings Lab in a statement on Tuesday. The company is conducting mandatory RT-PCR tests for passengers from the U.K. arriving at the Delhi airport. “The new mutation is spreading fast in the U.K. According to the data, there has been a rapid spurt in cases, around 30,000 cases per day,” Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said. He said that the reason behind the fast spread of virus in Delhi in March-April was that lots of people travelled from abroad to Delhi. “All the people who are travelling via the U.K. are being tested at the airport, and those travelling on international flights are required to carry a test report with them. Our strategy for this is that we will identify all those who are based out of Delhi in the past two weeks, and conduct door-to-door testing for them. I request everyone to wear a mask, because that is the only way to stay safe, no matter the strain,” Mr. Jain said. The people who have travelled from the U.K. in the last two weeks are being tested and asked to undergo 14 days of home quarantine. “At the airport, people are tested and once their result is out, the ones whose result is negative are asked to undergo 14 days of quarantine and the people who are positive are being moved to Lok Nayak Hospital,” a Delhi government official said.

23 December 2020||Ghaziabad,||Mixed response to PM’s AMU speech||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) evoked a mixed response on the campus. Mirza Asmer Baig, Professor of Political Science, AMU, said the Prime Minister talked largely in generalities and that specifics were lacking in his speech. “Muslims of India have a great affinity towards AMU. So when you are engaging with Muslim intelligentsia, they were expecting the PM to touch upon issues that concerned the community in the last couple of years, particularly the Citizenship Amendment Act and the minority character of the university. The PM did say that the government would not be found lacking in supporting AMU and appreciated the core values of the university, but a little more tangibility would have helped,” said Prof. Baig. He felt the PM probably refrained from specifics because it could have annoyed his core constituency, which could have considered it appeasement of minorities. ‘Data off the mark’ On the data Mr. Modi presented on the reduction in the school dropout rate of Muslim girls, Prof. Baig said it seemed off the mark, but this was not a time to flag minor things. “We should take this gesture as a positive move. It was on the lines of the speech he made after getting elected for a second term, though we are still waiting for it to be actualised on the ground,” he added. Ali Nadeem Rezavi, Professor of History, AMU, said, “Our PM said everything he had to say without acceding anything in return.” He felt the subtle message was that AMU was a national institution so there was no question of its “minority character”. He held that the PM had used the occasion to forward the National Education Policy, which Prof. Rezavi thought was going to “destroy higher education in India”. “The Delhi University Teachers’ Association has already come up with strong counter to it,” he said. The positive, he said, was that the “riff-raff BJP leaders” would now probably abstain from criticising the AMU. “It was good that the PM was concerned about the education of minorities. It would be good if he thus implemented the Sachar Commission Report,” said Prof. Rezavi. Many students felt the PM had indulged in what is called “dealing” in AMU parlance. “He praised us for our past, something that the AMU administration does all the time. Young students don’t want to live in nostalgia. There was very little about what he could do for us today,” said Talha Manan, a student in the Education Department. ‘Task juvenile’ Mr. Manan said students liked the way the Education Minister recited the AMU Tarana, the university song or anthem, but many felt the task that the PM gave to students — to conduct research on freedom fighters — was rather juvenile. “Anyway, hostels don’t do research, departments do,” he said. Another student requesting anonymity said he liked the way Mr. Modi had praised the role of the AMU in fighting the pandemic. “It showed that if the government backs the university, we could play a vital role in nation-building,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mixed-response-to-pms-amu-speech/article33398568.ece

The overall positivity till now was 7.79%, as per the bulletin. Tuesday’s positivity is also the lowest in months. There were 5,833 containment zones in the city as on Tuesday. Reducing beds The Delhi government has also formed a committee to give recommendations on reducing the number of hospital beds reserved for COVID-19, according to an official order issued on Monday. Out of the total 18,786 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 84.6% were vacant as on Tuesday. The committee has been asked to submit its recommendations on Thursday. Earlier in the day, resident doctors of Lok Nayak Hospital protested in the hospital campus for the second day, demanding the government to start non-COVID-19 treatment at the hospital in a phased manner. The hospital was converted into a COVID-19 treatment facility at the beginning of the outbreak and is the largest Delhi government-run COVID-19 facility. Keshave Singh, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association of the hospital, said that student doctors are not getting training in any other diseases apart from COVID-19, as the hospital is a dedicated facility and it has been affecting their studies. The RDA has been writing letters to the Delhi government for the last three months to start non-COVID treatment in a phased manner and has even met the Health Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/capital-records-less-than-1000-covid-19-cases-for-second-day/article33398356.ece

23 December 2020||JAIPUR,||Cong. to select executive body soon||A relatively small executive body of the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee is likely to be appointed here by December-end, ahead of the expansion and reshuffle of the State Cabinet. The claimants to different positions have been making rounds of New Delhi for the last one week to meet the party leaders. PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, who met AICC general secretary in-charge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken on Sunday, said here that a small number of organisational appointments would be made this month, followed by the release of a larger list next month. The latter will include appointments to the district and block-level committees. The AICC had dissolved all working committees, departments and cells of the PCC during the political turmoil in July this year. Mr. Pilot was sacked as the PCC president and Mr. Dotasra appointed in his place. With the reconstitution of the ruling party’s executive, new appointments will be made to the posts of general secretaries, vice-presidents and secretaries. Mr. Dotasra, who is also the Education Minister, said senior leaders would be given important positions, while the youths may be appointed as PCC secretaries. Mr. Pilot also met Mr. Maken in New Delhi for two hours on Monday, giving rise to speculation that his opinion had been sought. The faction supporting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is alert on the issue of appointments, as the party leadership faces the task of giving adequate representation to all sections. After its formal appointment, the PCC executive may be expanded on the basis of feedback received from the State’s seven divisions. According to party sources, while Mr. Maken will try to strike a balance between the rival factions, the MLAs who worked hard in the polls for urban bodies, Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis would expect to get their aides and confidantes adjusted at important positions in the party structure. Mr. Maken is also scheduled to visit Rajasthan in the month-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-to-select-executive-body-soon/article33398565.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||AAP takes out padayatras in 272 wards to inform public about BJP ‘scam’||Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday took out ‘padayatras’ in all 272 wards of Delhi against the alleged Rs. 2,500 crore ‘scam’ in BJP-ruled municipal corporations, the party said. AAP workers met people and informed them about the alleged scam during the rallies. “AAP on Tuesday brought the matter of BJP-ruled corporation’s scam of Rs. 2,500 crore before the citizens of Delhi. AAP is turning this case of misappropriation into a mass movement,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said. He said that through these rallies, the party reached out to the citizens of Delhi and told them about the “corruption” in the BJP-ruled municipal corporations. “We told them about how the BJP-ruled corporations has completely ruined Delhi and how the BJP made the corporations bankrupt. We also apprised the citizens about the garbage mountains created by them and the corruption of the BJP councillors,” he added. In a related development, Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said that the Urban Development Department had asked for details of the income and expenditure of the three municipal corporations, but the corporations have denied sharing any details.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-takes-out-padayatras-in-272-wards-to-inform-public-about-bjp-scam/article33398361.ece
23 December 2020||New Delhi,||AAP wants BJP to expel Bidhuri over remarks||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday attacked the BJP over the alleged “foul language” used by BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri about the farmers protesting at the Delhi’s borders. “If the Prime Minister does not expel South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri before sunset for using such foul language, it means [Mr.] Bhiduri has acted on the directions of the Prime Minister,” AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said. Contradictory statement He said that on one hand, the Union Agriculture Minister has said that the government was ready for talks, but on the other hand, an elected MP of the BJP was openly “abusing” the farmers. “Please don’t disrespect our farmers. The sons of the farmers are defending our country at the borders, and these farmers are fighting at the Delhi’s borders for their rights. These are people who are ready to give the supreme sacrifice and yet this is what they get to hear in return?” Mr. Chadha said. “The Prime Minister has said that he wants to double the income of the farmers, but leave aside double income, you’d rather make the farmers become slaves of these four industrialists,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-wants-bjp-to-expel-bidhuri-over-remarks/article33398363.ece
23 December 2020||GUWAHATI,||HC orders ‘composite floor test’ in BTC||The Gauhati High Court on Tuesday ordered a “composite floor test” in Assam’s Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) on or before December 26. The court also barred the new executive council formed by a three-party alliance, including the BJP, from taking any major decisions till the matter is resolved. The single-judge Bench of Justice Suman Shyam passed the order after hearing a petition by the BTC’s former chief executive member Hagrama Mohilary and other leaders of his political party. The petitioners had challenged the constitutional validity of the appointment of Pramod Boro as the Council’s chief executive member, Gobinda Basumatary as his deputy and three others as executive members. Mr. Boro’s United People’s Party Liberal, BJP and the Gana Shakti Party had formed a post-poll alliance to take control of the Council. The court ruled that on the day of the test, to be convened by the Assam Governor, Mr. Boro and Mr. Mohilary or someone projected by his party will have to prove majority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-orders-composite-floor-test-in-btc/article33398566.ece

23 December 2020||GUWAHATI,||53% turnout in rural, civic polls in Arunachal||An estimated 53% voters turned out for the panchayat and municipal polls in Arunachal Pradesh on Tuesday, State Election Commission officials said. The turnout was attributed to cold conditions that kept most people indoors until around noon. SEC Secretary Nyali Ete said polling was largely peaceful barring an incident at a booth in Kamle district where supporters of a political party poured water over the ballot boxes. Re-polling at this booth has been scheduled for December 24. Ballot papers were used for the panchayat polls while electronic voting machines were used for the Itanagar Municipal Corporation and the Pasighat Municipal Council polls. “We expect the voting percentage to increase as reports from polling booths in remote areas are yet to come,” Mr. Ete said. Tuesday’s voting was said to be “cosmetic” as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has already won more than 63% of a total of 8,705 panchayat and municipal seats unopposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/53-turnout-in-rural-civic-polls-in-arunachal/article33398569.ece
