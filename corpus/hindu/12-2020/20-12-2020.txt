20 December 2020||CHANDIGARH,||More Punjab farmers head for Delhi to join protesters||Even as tens of thousands of farmers are camping on the borders of Delhi to protest against the Centre’s farm laws, a large number of farmers and labourers from Punjab are all set to march to Delhi in the coming week to ensure that the ongoing agitation does not lose steam. The Bharatiya Kisan Union-Ekta-Ugrahan (BKU-U) and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) announced that batches of farmers and labourers from across Punjab will start moving towards Delhi so that the build-up on the borders keeps swelling. ‘Honouring sacrifice’ “The sacrifices of the people who were martyred during the ongoing agitation will not go waste. These sacrifices have made people more determined to take the struggle to its logical end,” said Sukhdev Singh, general secretary of the BKU(U). “Gatherings will be held on December 20 in Punjab’s villages to pay homage to these martyrs and the memorial processions will continue on December 21, 22 and 23. Thereafter, a block-level tribute function will be held on December 24. On December 26, a contingent of 15,000 protesters will march from the Khanauri border, and on December 27, another 15,000 farmers will start the march from Dabwali,” Mr. Saran said. BKU(U) president Joginder Singh said a ‘Delhi-Chalo’ campaign committee has been formed to strengthen the Delhi morcha (rally).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-punjab-farmers-to-head-for-delhi/article33376261.ece
20 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||UDF partners drive Cong. into a corner over debacle||Coalition partners reportedly drove the Congress into a corner on Saturday on the charge of conducting a faltering campaign that caused the United Democratic Front (UDF) substantial, but arguably preventable, losses in the local body polls. UDF leaders who met here to examine the election debacle overwhelmingly felt that the Congress had not recognised the last-minute tactical changes made by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) during the campaign. For one, the LDF had tactfully withdrawn Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan from the active poll scene after he became a magnet for Opposition attacks. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also cut a low profile to make his office appear less of a target for rival parties. The LDF had seized the initiative early and the Congress could not match it. The Indian Union Muslim League fared better in North Kerala. The LDF recruited anganwadi, Kudumbashree and ASHA workers along with COVID-19 volunteers to campaign for LDF candidates, especially women. The Congress could not harness the advantage of such outfits which had built trust over time within their respective communities. Moreover, the LDF deployed an estimated 2,500 Independent candidates to dilute the anti-government sentiment ratcheted up by the Opposition. LDF workers marked their presence at ration and food kit distribution centres. They led community kitchens. The UDF partners also blamed the Congress for ill-informed candidate selection, which seemed guided more by the compulsion to appease local group satraps than by the winnability factor. The Congress reportedly drew flak for delaying the announcement of scores of candidatures till the penultimate day of filing of nominations, thus ceding an early-bird advantage to the LDF. The UDF leaders also reportedly sought the intervention of the Central leadership of the Congress to “rebuild” the party’s bridges with various social organisations. Kerala Congress (Joseph) leader Mons Joseph, MLA, claimed there was no centring of “Kerala Congress” votes in favour of the LDF as claimed by Jose. K. Mani. He argued that Mr. Mani had lost votes in Idukki and Kottayam. His seat share in Pala fell from 17 to nine. Mr. Mani lost three panchayats and several municipalities to the UDF. IUML leader P.K. Kunhalikutty said the Congress could not effectively spotlight the LDF’s “tie-up” with the Social Democratic Party of India in 62 panchayats. The UDF will convene again on June 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/udf-partners-drive-cong-into-a-corner-over-debacle/article33376561.ece
20 December 2020||Kolkata,||Bengal sees mass defection to BJP at Amit Shah’s rally||West Bengal on Saturday witnessed one of the biggest political defections in recent times, with a host of Trinamool Congress leaders, including former Minister and heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, joining the BJP at a rally addressed by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The defectors however, were not limited to the ruling Trinamool Congress. Apart from six MLAs and one MP of the Trinamool, one legislator each from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India and the Congress also broke ranks to join the BJP. Besides Mr. Adhikari, who represents the Nandigram Assembly seat, the other Trinamool MLAs are Banashri Maity, MLA from Kanthi Uttar; Biswajit Kundu, MLA from Kalna; Saikat Panja, Monteshwar MLA; Silbhadra Dutta, Barrackpore MLA; Sukra Munda, MLA from Nagrakata; and Dipali Biswas, Gazole MLA. Sunil Kumar Mondal also switched sides. Tapashi Mondal, CPI(M) MLA from Haldia; Ashok Dinda, CPI MLA from Tamluk; and Sudip Mukherjee, Congress MLA representing Purulia, also joined the BJP as did a number of district-level leaders of the Trinamool Congress, including some from the minority community. Mr. Adhikari’s move, which comes after months of speculation over his political future, is seen as the most significant political development ahead of the 2021 Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mass-defection-to-bjp-at-shah-rally/article33376259.ece
20 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||SCTIMST-NHM standoff puts lives of many infants in balance||The lives of hundreds of infants with serious congenital heart disease (CHD) is hanging in the balance as the National Health Mission (NHM) and the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) are engaged in a war of words over reimbursement of medical bills for corrective surgeries done for the infants under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK). Since 2014, under the RBSK, a national initiative, thousands of children with congenital defects from across the country have undergone complex surgeries in tertiary care speciality centres such as the SCTIMST and selected empanelled private hospitals in the State. Change in MoU terms However, a change in terms of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the SCTIMST and NHM and the latter’s refusal to blindly reimburse the bills produced by the SCTIMST any more have resulted in a stalemate wherein several children with serious congenital defects are now being turned away. Matters reached a head last week when two infants from Tamil Nadu with critical CHD who required emergency surgeries were refused admission at the SCTIMST. The infants had to be admitted to the newborn unit at SAT Hospital and an interim procedure done to buy time. Under the original MoU, the NHM had agreed to pay treatment bills at rates fixed by the SCTIMST. However, issues began when the RBSK introduced package rates for various procedures. Treatment package “The issue was flagged by the NHM in 2018 that bills can be paid only as per the treatment package rates. We then did a cost comparison analysis and found that for almost every surgical procedure, the rates charged by the SCTIMST was 20-100% higher. However, all our empanelled private hospitals are willing to do the surgeries at the RBSK package rate,” a senior NHM official told The Hindu . In 2018, over 900 surgeries were done under the RBSK, in 2019 over 1,200 and this year till November over 900. Since January last, the NHM has been refusing to foot the bills submitted by the SCTIMST, unless they matched the RBSK package rates. “The outstanding payment due from the RBSK to us now stands at Rs. 20 crore, which has pushed the SCTIMST into dire straits. We are now under severe pressure from our suppliers of surgical consumables. We have been doing very complex paediatric surgeries under the RBSK,” a senior doctor at the SCTIMST said. “The SCTIMST has not been able to justify its high cost of procedures when corporate hospitals are willing to go by the RBSK package rates,” the NHM spokesperson said. State Plan fund Another outstanding issue that the NHM has brought up is regarding the treatment of children from other States. The RBSK is run with Central-State share in a 60:40 ratio. The NHM is utilising Rs. 10 crore from the State Plan fund and Rs. 15 crore from the Centre, which is the Central share for offering free treatment to children within the State. “Almost 40% of the children treated under the RBSK at the SCTIMST are from other parts of the country. This is a drain on our resources because all States have its own RBSK funds at their disposal. We have now paid Rs. 10 crore out of the pending payments to the SCTIMST for cases from within Kerala at the RBSK package rates,” the NHM official said. When the MoU between the NHM and SCTIMST was renewed in October this year, the latter dropped a chunk of the cardiac procedures under the RBSK as well as all neuro procedures. Painful situation “This situation has been quite painful for me because if we turn these infants away, 90% will not survive. There has to be some solution or the RBSK should set up a Central fund so that all children from across the country can be helped,” Baiju S. Dharan, head of cardiac surgery, SCTIMST, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sctimst-nhm-standoff-puts-lives-of-many-infants-in-balance/article33376567.ece

20 December 2020||CHENNAI,||Homeless children have no access to education during pandemic||As many as 71 out of 100 homeless children in the city have no access to any form of education during the COVID-19 pandemic, says a study by the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC). The IRCDUC was conducting relief work during the pandemic in Broadway and surrounding areas. “Many parents were complaining that their children were unable to study due to a lack of a television (where they could access Kalvi channels) or smart phones for online classes,” said Vanessa Peter, policy researcher, IRCDUC. Hence, the centre conducted a study among 100 children in Stringer Street, Davidson Street, Ratan Bazaar, Narayanappa Street, TNPSC Office Road, Lone Square and Devaraja Mudaliar Street. Out of the children observed, 52 were boys and 48 were girls. While 47% are in primary school, 46% are in middle and high school and 7% in higher secondary. Three children had dropped out of school during the pandemic. First-generation learners “Most of the children are first-generation learners and being homeless, they did not have access to televisions or smart phones for education. Many did not even know whether online classes were available or not,” Ms. Peter said. V. Sasikala, who lives on Davidson Street, said her son V. Vasudevan was a Class VII student. “He is a first-generation learner. As we don’t have smartphones, he does not have access to classes. He says he has forgotten everything now. I am worried as we are working hard for his future,” she said. While some volunteers are planning to mobilise smart phones and computers for the children, members of the homeless community feel it would be better if the government does something about it. A School Education Department official said if such issues were brought to the notice of School Education Minister K. A. Sengottaiyan, he would take some measures. “We can set up a desktop at a community hall and arrange for classes for these children. However, someone has to approach us with a letter and details,” the official said.

20 December 2020||New Delhi,||Third wave of COVID under control: Kejriwal||On a day when Delhi witnessed only 1,139 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city has fought a “war” against the pandemic and the third wave of infections is now “under control”. “Compared to the day when 8,600 cases were reported, today Delhi has 1,133 COVID-19 cases. In November the positivity rate in Delhi was 15%, which means that if we were testing a hundred people, then around 15 people were COVID positive. Today, if we are testing a hundred people, only one person is positive and the positivity rate is 1.3%,” Mr. Kejriwal said in a video statement on Saturday, before the final COVID-19 figures for the day were released. Saturday’s is the lowest new COVID-19 cases reported in a day in nearly fourth months. The last time the city saw less than 1,139 cases was on August 24, when 1,061 people tested positive. According to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government, 32 more deaths have been reported in the past 24 hours, taking the toll to 10,251. Of the total 6,15,914 cases, 5,95,305 people have recovered and there are 10,358 active cases. The overall positivity till now is 7.98%. Mr. Kejriwal said the first wave of the pandemic in Delhi was in June, the second in August and September, and the third began in October. ‘Citizens’ efforts’ “On one hand the pollution level of Delhi was increasing due to stubble burning in the neighbouring States and on the other the number of COVID-19 cases were also increasing. The citizens of Delhi took the situation very seriously and fought this battle against COVID as war. Today I am very happy to say that due to the efforts of the citizens the third wave of COVID pandemic in the Capital has come under control,” the Chief Minister said. He said Delhi was the first State to announce Rs. 1 crore financial assistance to the family of “COVID-19 warriors” who die in the line of duty. The Chief Minister also drew a parallel with New York. “In the first week of April, New York City reported 6,300 cases in one day. At that point of time it was the highest number of cases reported in a single day... COVID patients were lying outside the hospitals of New York and on the streets. But in Delhi when 8,600 cases were reported in a single day, even then the situation was under control,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/third-wave-of-covid-under-control-kejriwal/article33376404.ece

20 December 2020||New Delhi,||Revamp on hold amid calls for Rahul’s return||After a nearly five-hour marathon meeting of senior leaders — including key members of the group of 23 (G-23) dissenters — at party president Sonia Gandhi’s 10 Janpath residence on Saturday morning, the Congress decided to to hold a chintan shivir (brainstorming conclave) on the lines of the Shimla and Panchmarhi meetings to decide on its future. However, such a brainstorming session will be held only after the COVID-19 pandemic situation improves, said sources. Rahul for elections Saturday’s meeting on the lawns of 10 Janpath saw renewed calls for Rahul Gandhi to take over as party president. However, stating that he was willing to work towards strengthening the party, Mr. Gandhi is learnt to have stressed on the importance of choosing a new party chief through organisational elections, the process for which has already started. This was the first time Ms. Gandhi met senior leaders including those from G-23 in person since the pandemic restrictions kicked in. In August, the G-23 leaders had written a letter to Ms. Gandhi arguing for “collective leadership,” organisational revamp, internal elections, decentralized decision-making process and the need for an ‘active and full-time leadership’. Though none referred to the letters, the dissenters reiterated that elected and representative bodies were key to the party’s revival. From the G-23, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma, former chief minister of Haryana, former Maharashtra chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan former union ministers Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor, party’s legal department chairperson Vivek Tankha attended the meet. A key member of the rebel group, Kapil Sibal, however was not present due to pre-scheduled travel abroad. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former union ministers A.K. Antony, P. Chidambaram, Ambika Soni, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, general secretaries Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ajay Maken, Pawan Kumar Bansal, Harish Rawat and Bhakta Charan Das were also present.

Chandrababu Naidu purportedly asking his partymen to file cases against the policemen at different places has gone viral, sparking off protests from the police officers’ associations. In a statement on Saturday, AP Police Officers’ Association State president J. Srinivasa Rao said, “It is unfortunate that a senior politician has been instigating his followers and cadres to adopt wrong and deceitful practices, and methods for some months now.” The video clip shows Mr. Naidu asking his partymen to bring pressure on the policemen by registering cases online. ‘Misuse of facility’ “It is really sad that a leader is asking his partymen to misuse the facility created by the Police Department for rendering service to the people, more so for the common man and vulnerable sections of society,” said a senior police officer. The association also said that the AP Police had won an unprecedented 108 national awards for use of technology and bringing in innovation, transformation and change towards a more transparent, accountable and efficient delivery of police services during the last one year. The IT-enabled services would help the common people access the police services from the safe environment of their homes, it said. The AP Police won the second place in the use of Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), it said. “Police have played a crucial role in the criminal justice system in which the police, the prosecution, the judiciary, the forensics and corrections (jails) are the stakeholders,” the association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tdp-chiefs-comments-in-video-clip-kick-up-a-row/article33376250.ece
20 December 2020||SALEM/CHENNAI,||CM announces Rs. 2,500 gift for Pongal||On a day he launched the AIADMK’s Assembly election campaign, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced a Pongal cash gift of Rs. 2,500 for each of the 2.06 crore rice cardholders in Tamil Nadu. The cash and a gift hamper will be distributed from January 4. The measure is expected to cost the exchequer around Rs. 5,500 crore. The cash support alone would cost the government Rs. 5,150 crore. The cumulative cost of the hamper, containing raw rice and sugar of 1 kg each, a full piece of sugarcane and 20 g of cashew nuts, dry grapes and cardamom, will be at least Rs. 350 crore. The rationale behind the decision, according to Mr. Palaniswami, is, “Thai Pongal is an auspicious day for Tamils. This year, many have lost job opportunities owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the delta region, many have suffered because of cyclones and severe rain.” Opening an Amma Mini Clinic at Irupalli in Salem, the Chief Minister said that dhotis and sarees would also be given to beneficiaries. All of these would be distributed through ration shops. All of these would be distributed through ration shops. The authorities would distribute tokens to all family cardholders with details of when they should visit the shops to collect the gift. He denied DMK president M.K. Stalin’s charge that the gift was announced with a selfish motive. Last year, the government had offered a Rs. 1,000 cash incentive. “Mr. Stalin was the one who demanded that the government offer cash relief during the pandemic. Now, when announced, he is changing his stand. People should beware. Even a chameleon would change its colour only after a short time,” he said. Anyone who stops welfare schemes meant for the poor has never won, he said. In late 2019, when the government offered a cash support and a gift hamper for Pongal 2020, the number of rice cards was around 1.98 crore. At that time, the government had sanctioned around Rs. 2,400 crore. For the Pongal festival of 2019, the government had set aside about Rs. 2,237 crore. After the outbreak of COVID-19, a cash support of Rs. 1,000 each was given to the cardholders in April this year and another Rs. 1,000 to the people in the badly affected districts in June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-announces-rs-2500-gift-for-pongal/article33376324.ece

The ASI put a cap on the number of visitors when it reopened the monuments to the public in July after closing them due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March. The order stated that the cap on visitors had been removed. However, the superintending archaeologist, with the concurrence of the District Magistrate, could decide how many people be allowed per day. The ASI also ordered the restarting of sale of physical tickets, which had been stopped to prevent COVID-19 transmission, at monuments where there were problems with the network and QR code for online sale. The ASI also decided to restart the sound and light shows at monuments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/asi-lifts-cap-on-visitors-at-protected-monuments/article33376725.ece

20 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Isaac begins work on his 12th Budget||Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has commenced work on presenting his 12th State Budget, also the last Budget of the present Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. The Cabinet recommended to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Thursday to convene the 18th session of the 14th Legislative Assembly from January 8. The Budget will be presented on January 15 during the last session of the Assembly. The notifications for the Assembly elections in the State are expected from the Election Commission of India in March. Official sources said the Budget would be a vote-on-account for four months resembling a full-fledged Budget. This time, the government will distribute the report of the Expenditure Committee during the presentation of the Budget. New challenges For Dr. Isaac, the challenge is to meet the aspirations of the people, especially youngsters, keep the development trajectory up, and help the LDF return to power by breaking the electorate’s trend of alternating between the LDF and United Democratic Front (UDF) every five years in the State. A fresh perspective, putting the State on a higher development path, and renewed emphasis on higher education could be the salient points in the Budget. In view of the COVID-19-induced social distancing norms, the usual pre-Budget discussions were organised by the Finance Minister online this time. Talks with trade union leaders, farmers, and Vice Chancellors of universities have been completed. On Friday, despite meetings of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] secretariat and the LDF, Dr. Isaac continued to work on the Budget from his office in the Secretariat. He is likely to move to Inspection Bungalow, Vizhinjam, his preferred place for Budget preparation, for the final touches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/isaac-begins-work-on-his-12th-budget/article33376560.ece

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||At the forefront of the farmers’ agitation||For almost three weeks, farmers have been protesting on the outskirts of Delhi, demanding the government withdraw the farm laws. The agitation has gained momentum with more and more farmers joining in despite the government’s call to end the protests. While several farmers’ unions from different parts of the country have joined the agitation, it is mainly spearheaded by organisations from Punjab and Haryana. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the largest farmer unions in Punjab, has been at its forefront. The BKU (Ugrahan), along with the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) and 30-odd other farmer unions, has been holding the protests under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. The BKU (Ugrahan), led by former soldier Joginder Singh Ugrahan, has a significant hold among farmers in the Malwa region, also known as “the cotton belt” of Punjab. The union, founded in 2002, has been on the street protesting against the government’s agriculture policies ever since the farm ordinances were promulgated in June. In September, the Centre passed three farm Bills in Parliament, replacing the ordinances, which, according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have empowered the farmers. But the BKU (Ugrahan) and the other protesting unions have rejected the government’s claims, terming the Bills “anti-farmer” and demanding their withdrawal. In August, the BKU (Ugrahan) launched a five-day campaign in about 600 villages in Punjab to “inform” the public about the “ill-effects” of the farm ordinances. Led by Mr. Ugrahan and Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, a former teacher who took an early retirement from his job to take up the cause of farmers, the union vowed that it would not allow leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and others who supported the ordinances to enter any village in the State. The protests quickly gained momentum in the State, which is called the “bread basket of India”. Agriculture is the main lever of Punjab’s economy, which produces 17.4% of India’s wheat and 11.32% of its rice. Sit-ins In September, the BKU (Ugrahan) stepped up the protests. They staged a sit-in outside Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s Patiala residence as well as Shiromani Akali Dal patron and former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal’s house in his ancestral village Badal. It also launched a ‘rail roko’ agitation, disrupting train services in the State. The protesters started shaking up Punjab politics even before they launched the ‘Dilli Chalo’ campaign. In September, immediately after Parliament passed the three Bills by voice vote, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Parkash Singh Badal’s daughter in law, resigned from the BJP-led government as the Food Processing Industries Minister. Within weeks, Sukhbir Singh Badal, Harsimrat Kaur’s husband and the president of the Shiromani Akali Dal, announced that the party was ending its decades-long alliance with the BJP over the farm laws. The Congress-led government of Punjab also voiced its strong opposition to the laws. With the support of almost all non-BJP political factions in Punjab, the farmers took the protest to the borders of Delhi. Mr. Ugrahan has been camping at Delhi’s Tikri border with thousands of his followers since later November. The BKU (Ugrahan) was at the centre of a controversy after its members demanded the release of jailed activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others on December 10, the Human Rights Day. The government immediately seized on the incident and said the “so-called” farmers agitation has “almost got infiltrated by leftist and Maoist elements”. The BKU (Ugrahan), however, remained unapologetic. “We did nothing wrong. We had just organised an event demanding their (jailed activists) release on Human Rights Day on Thursday,” Sukhdev Singh, Punjab general secretary of the union, said on Monday. But other unions were not of the same opinion. They distanced themselves from these demands of the BKU (Ugrahan) and asked the outfit to stay focussed on the collective protest’s demands. Another union at the forefront is the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which has a substantial following among marginal and small farmers and agriculture labourers in the Majha and Doaba regions of Punjab. Like the BKU (Ugrahan), the KMSC had also started its agitation in June, by staging sit-ins outside collectorates in several districts against the farm ordinances. On September 7, members of the KMSC started a campaign to “court arrest” and on September 24, it kicked-off a ‘rail roko’ agitation. While most other unions lifted their blockade on train services on November 24, the KMSC continued their protests, especially in Amritsar’s Jandiala. Led by its president Satnam Singh Pannu and general secretary Sarvan Singh Pandher, the KMSC has got the key points of the three farm laws translated into Punjabi and distributed over 1,00,000 copies among the farmers and workers. Its leaders have repeatedly said they would not accept anything other than the withdrawal of the three farm laws by the government to stop their protests. More factions There are more BKU factions in the agitation. The BKU (Ekta-Dakaunda), led by Buta Singh Burj and Jagmohan Singh, has been working on issues surrounding the rising agrarian crises, and has demanded a farm loan waiver. Protest leaders admit that Jagmohan Singh, who had worked in the cooperative department of the Punjab government, had played a key role in bringing over 30 organisations under one roof in the protest against the farm laws. The BKU (Rajewal), led by Balbir Singh who formed his union in the 1990s, is another group in the fold. In Haryana, it’s the Gurnam Singh-led faction of BKU (Chaduni), which is in the driver’s seat. After parting ways with the BKU (Tikait) in 2012, Gurnam Singh has been working on farmers’ issues, having built substantial influence in State’s sugarcane belt. The BKU faction led by Rakesh Tikait, son of noted farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, has also joined the protest. In the 1980s, the BKU founded by the senior Tikait in Uttar Pradesh, became a force to reckon with in north Indian States, but it later split into about 50 different factions. But many of these factions have now come together to protest against the farm laws. When the Supreme Court on Wednesday proposed the setting up of a committee of farmer leaders from across the country, it mentioned the BKU. “The committee can talk and resolve this issue. Secure the names of some farmers’ unions who want to join... It should include the BKU and other leaders.” Despite many rounds of talks, neither the unions nor the government has shown any willingness to compromise. The farmers have stuck to their demand for repealing the laws, while the government has maintained that the laws are good for both farmers and the economy. Meanwhile, the protests are set to intensify with more farmers getting ready to travel to the borders of Delhi.  In Focus  The BKU (Ugrahan), one of the largest farmer unions in Punjab, has been on the front line of the agitation since June when the government promulgated the farm ordinances  The unions have translated the key points of the farm laws into Punjabi and distributed them among farmers, challenging the government's narrative about the laws  Besides BKU (Ugrahan), other BKU factions, such as BKU (Tikait) from U.P. and BKU (Chaduni) from Haryana, have also joined the agitation   Farmers’ unions in Punjab started the agitation when the ordinances were promulgated by staging sit-ins in front of government offices and launching ‘rail roko’ campaigns||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/at-the-forefront-of-the-farmers-agitation/article33376230.ece
20 December 2020||Kolkata,||Amit Shah hits back at ‘outsider’ jibe||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday took a swipe at the Trinamool Congress’ “outsider” jibe at the BJP, saying freedom fighter Khudiram Bose belonged as much to India as he belonged to Bengal. “Those who indulge in petty politics in Bengal, I have come to tell them that Khudiram belongs as much to India as he belongs to Bengal,” said Mr. Shah, who visited the village of the freedom fighter in Paschim Medinipur district. Remembering martyrs The Minister, who is on a two-day visit to the State, noted that December 19 was the day of martyrdom of Ramprasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh. “Pt. Ramprasad Bismil was as much a person from U.P. as he was from Bengal. Those who had sacrificed their lives in the freedom struggle would have never have imagined such petty politics. One has to rise above such ‘petty politics’,” he observed. Earlier in the day, Mr. Shah visited the house where Swami Vivekananda was born in north Kolkata. The ideals of Vivekananda were very relevant in the present times than in the times he lived, he said. Mr. Shah had lunch at a farmer’s home in Paschim Medinpur district. He was accompanied by State BJP president Dilip Ghosh and the party’s vice-president Mukul Roy. “Had delicious food for lunch at Shri Jhunu Singh ji and Shri Sanatan Singh ji’s home in Belijuri village, Midnapore (West Bengal). Grateful to the entire family for such warmth, affection and love,” Mr. Shah tweeted, thanking the family for the lunch. In his earlier visit to the State last month, he had lunch with a Matua and a tribal family. Mr. Shah will visit Visva Bharati, Santiniketan, the university set up by Rabindranath Tagore, on Sunday. Later in the day, speaking at a public rally in Midnapore where he joined the BJP, Suvendu Adhikari targeted the Trinamool Congress for its “outsider” (bahirgata) remarks directed at the BJP leadership. ‘Bengal is inclusive’ “In Bengal, they are calling Amit Shah an outsider, Kailash Vjayvargiya an outsider, Amit Malviya an outsider. As I had said before, we are first Indians and then Bengalis. I will not allow inclusiveness of Bengal to be destroyed,” he stated. Ordinary people built the Trinamool Congress brick by brick selflessly, but the party is now filled with individuals who do not bother about anyone but themselves, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amit-shah-hits-back-at-outsider-jibe/article33376228.ece
20 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘Standoff amid pandemic exposed China’||The military standoff with India along the LAC amid the COVID-19 pandemic showed China’s poor intentions, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday. Mr. Singh, who presided over the Combined Graduation Parade held at Air Force Academy (AFA), Dundigal, around 45 km from Hyderabad, said India believed in solutions for any issue peacefully and through talks. “We don’t want conflict but peace. However, we will not tolerate any harm to the country’s self-respect. We are well equipped to give them a befitting reply,” the Minister said, addressing the newly-commissioned Flying Officers of the Indian Air Force. “This is the new India; we are no longer weak. We are capable of answering any transgression, aggression and unilateral action at the border, though the main aim remains dialogue over conflict,” he said, adding that India has found the support of many countries. Mr. Singh said both India and China were engaged in bilateral and diplomatic talks to solve the issue, adding, “Let me repeat, we don’t want conflict but peace. We are prepared to face any situation.” Attacking Pakistan for its “nefarious acts” at the border despite losing four wars, the Minister said, “In the western sector, our neighbour Pakistan is still fighting proxy wars through terrorism despite losing four wars against us.” Referring to the air strikes at Balakot, Mr. Singh said such episodes showed the valour of the Indian Air Force in effectively dealing with terrorism. “The Indian Air Force has a glorious history. It has always displayed gallantry. From the Annexation of Goa in 1961 to the Battle of Longewala in 1971 and to the recent Balakot air strikes, all these episodes will be considered as golden chapters in our country’s history,” he said. Armed forces were not only dealing with terrorism within the country but even taking action beyond the borders, which showed India’s firm intentions against terrorism, Mr. Singh said. He felicitated the security forces and said they alertly countered these attempts. He told the young officers that they were fortunate to be sentries of one’s country. “I believe all of you will do justice to your duty,” Mr. Singh said, asking them to prepare for both cyber and air space strikes. The war is much beyond traditional borders, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-exposed-by-standoff-amid-virus/article33376181.ece
20 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||33 protesting farmers died in 3 weeks: union||The All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) on Saturday claimed that 33 farmers have lost their lives over the past three weeks during the ongoing agitation against the Centre’s agriculture marketing laws. Condolence meetings will be held under a joint front of farmer unions at more than one lakh villages on Sunday, the AIKS said. In a press statement, the AIKS said “Shraddhanjali Diwas” (Homage Day) would be observed across the country on Sunday in response to a call from Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a joint front of farmer unions, to pay tributes to the farmers who died during the agitation since November 26. “As per records, 33 farmers participating in the struggle died since November 26 due to accidents, illness and hostile weather conditions. The farmers and all sections of the people will pay homage to them from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on December 20 by organising condolence meetings, human chain and garlanding the photos of the departed in more than one lakh villages across the country,” the press statement said. In reply to the recent open letter to farmers by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, the All-India Kisan Sangarsh Co-ordination Committee (AIKSCC) on Saturday released a response addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Tomar, saying the attack launched by them against the demands of the farmers and their movement over the past two days showed they did not sympathise with the farmers and had no intention to resolve their problems. The letter also put forth a point-by-point rebuttal of various claims made by Mr. Tomar in his letter. Responding to Mr. Modi’s comments on ASSOCHAM foundation day that farmers had started reaping benefits of agricultural reforms, farmer leaders accused him of repeating “untruths” and questioned his intentions for raising the issue at an association of industries. Bharatiya Kisan Union president Rakesh Tikait said Mr. Modi speaking about the benefits to farmers from the platform of an industry body created doubts. “If farmers are benefited, he should talk to farmers. But he is talking to businessmen about it.” AIKS general-secretary Hannan Mollah said farmer leaders had countered Mr. Modi on his claims at a function in Madhya Pradesh, but he was repeating the “same untruth repeatedly”. On the Supreme Court’s proposal for the formation of a committee, he said setting up of committees did not help and is an old tactic of governments to delay things. In a related development, former Union Minister and BJP leader Birender Singh in Haryana came out in support of the farmers and held a sit-in at Jhajjar on Friday. He said the sit-in was held under the aegis of “Chhotu Ram Vichar Manch”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/33-protesting-farmers-died-in-3-weeks-union/article33376203.ece
20 December 2020||MANGALURU,||Work on Bengaluru Ring Road soon||Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said two packages of Bengaluru Ring Road were among the 11 projects being awarded for commencing work immediately. He was speaking after laying foundation stone and dedicating to the nation 33 national highway projects of 1,197-km length in Karnataka together worth Rs. 10,904 crore through videoconferencing. Mr. Gadkari said the four-lane 80 km Bengaluru Ring Road from Dabaspet to Hoskote via Doddaballapur (NH 648) would be constructed at a cost of Rs. 2,755.88 crore in two packages — Dabaspet to Doddaballapur and Doddaballapur to Hoskote. The Ring Road, Mr. Gadkari said, would significantly reduce traffic burden on Bengaluru city besides augmenting economic activities in its vicinity. It would also connect the upcoming multi-modal logistic park at Dabaspet, he added. The Minister said DPR was under progress for Bengaluru Satellite Town Ring Road, estimated to cost Rs. 10,000 crore. Mr. Gadkari said the first of the Rs. 7,000 crore six-lane Bengaluru-Mysuru highway project packages would get completed in February 2022 while the second package in September 2022. The Minister said work on the two-lane with paved shoulders highway between Belikeri-Kumta-Sirsi (58.92 km) would start shortly and get completed in December 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs. 440.16 crore. Work on six-lane bridge across Phalguni (Gurupura) river in Mangaluru on NH 66 (Rs. 69 crore) would start immediately. All these were being undertaken by the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI. He urged the State government to expedite land acquisition for highway projects and noted that over 14,000 arbitration cases that were pending before revenue authorities were hindering infrastructure projects in Karnataka. The Minister declared open the four-lane 120 km Chitradurga-Hosapete NH 50, four-lane 188 km Kundapura-Goa border NH 66, two-lane 220 km Vijayapura-Humnabad-Kalaburagi NH 50, and five other projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/works-for-bengaluru-ring-road-project-to-be-awarded-soon/article33376321.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The ‘Islamic State’ in Africa||We are in an Islamic State, declared Abubakar Shekau in a 52-minute video, shot somewhere in northeastern Nigeria, in August 2014. The leader of Boko Haram, the Sunni jihadist group that had captured swathes of territories in the Borno and Yobe States, also said, ‘We have nothing to do with Nigeria.” He later declared allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-declared ‘Caliph’ of the Islamic State terror organisation, who was killed by American forces in 2019. Shekau’s claim came a few months after over 200 girls were abducted from a school in the town of Chibok in Borno by Boko Haram. The Chibok abductions—most of the girls are still missing—triggered a global campaign against the jihadists. Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, contested the 2015 presidential election, promising to defeat Boko Haram and restore security in the northeast. Mr. Buhari won and in his first term, he set up a regional coalition to fight the terrorists. The campaign was effective. Within a year, the Nigerian troops liberated most of the towns and villages Boko Haram had controlled and pushed the jihadists back to the Sambisa forest and the Mandara mountains. But the offensive did not defeat Boko Haram, who regrouped in the forest and started a relentless terror campaign in recent years. When Boko Haram claimed the abductions of hundreds of school boys in Katsina State in the northwest on December 11, many were surprised as the region was well outside the group’s area of operations. The government claimed that local “bandits” were behind the abductions. But Boko Haram had released a video showing the boys in distress, before most of them were released on Friday after talks between the authorities and the kidnappers. The jihadists said they carried out the operation as the school was providing “unIslamic teachings”. One of the boys released told the media that they were captured by “the men of Shekau”. The attack on schools and children is nothing new for the group. Boko Haram’s founder Mohammed Yusuf, a popular cleric based in Maiduguri in Borno, was a vocal opponent of Nigeria’s school system, which he called the “western education” system. In 2002, he set up a religious complex, including an Islamic school and a mosque, in Maiduguri, which attracted hundreds of young students from across the country. But Boko Haram, whose official Arabic name was ‘Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (People for the Propagation of the Prophet's Preachings and Jihad), was more than a group of preachers. The locals called them Boko Haram (which in the Hausa language means ‘Western education is forbidden’) because of their hardline opposition to the school system. Recruiting centre Yusuf wanted to “purify” the practice of Islam and create an Islamic State. The religious complex he founded became a recruiting centre. In 2009, he started an insurgency firom Maiduguri. The Nigerian troops responded with heavy force. They captured the group’s headquarters, killed hundreds of its supporters and militants, including Yusuf. They claimed that Boko Haram was finished. They were wrong. The group regrouped under Shekau. In 2015, it changed its name to the Islamic State's West Africa Province. Even after the Islamic State core was defeated in Iraq and Syria and its leader, Baghdadi, was killed, Boko Haram continued to remain a potent terrorist machinery. After retreating to the forest in 2016 in the wake of the government offensive, the jihadists started attacking security forces and civilians in 2018. The last two years have been deadlier for Nigeria’s security forces than any other period in the decade-long conflict, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign relations. Between June and November, more than 200 people have been murdered or kidnapped in and around Maiduguri. The kidnappings in Katsina, Mr. Buhari’s home state, were particularly embarrassing for the President who had come to power on promises of ending jihadist insurgency. Five years into his rule, Boko Haram is still standing strong, expanding its reach from Nigeria to Niger and Cameroon. And if they were actually behind the Katsina kidnappings, it suggests that they are now expanding their operations across Nigeria.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-islamic-state-in-africa/article33376232.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The long Russian arms in the skies||On December 14, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkey, a NATO ally, over its procurement of the S-400 Triumf long-range air defence system from Russia. Announcing a series of measures under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), Assistant Secretary for International Security and Nonproliferation, Christopher Ford, also cautioned other countries: “We hope that other countries around the world will also take note that the U.S. will fully implement CAATSA Section 231 sanctions and that they should avoid further acquisitions of Russian equipment.” In October 2018, India had signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia for five S-400 regiments. S-400 (NATO name SA-21 Growler) is considered one of the world’s most advanced air defence systems that can simultaneously track and neutralise a range of incoming objects spanning aircraft, missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) over very long ranges. It is especially suited to take down strategic aerial platforms like bombers, mid-air refuellers, reconnaissance aircraft and Advanced Early Warning and Control Systems (AWACS). Given their capabilities, the S-400 has emerged as one of the most controversial arms exports of Russia and a major point of contention between Washington and Moscow. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) missile defence project, development of the S-400 began in 1993 and eventually the testing of the system started in 1999. Designed by Almaz-Antey Central Design Bureau, the S-400 is a successor to the S-300 system and entered operational service in 2007. In 2015, it was deployed in Syria by Russia to protect its military assets and has also been deployed in Crimea. Fully mobile The S-400 is fully mobile and each system has a 3D phased array acquisition radar, which can track around 300 targets up to 600 km, a command-and-control centre, automatic tracking and targeting systems, launchers and support vehicles. Each system has four different types to missiles for up to 40 km, 120 km, 250 km and a maximum range of 400 km and up to 30km altitude. The different ranges and varying altitudes create a layered air defence net. An S-400 battalion has eight missile launchers, typically with four missiles each. India’s S-400 deal is well under way and initial issues over payment channels have been resolved. Russian officials have stated that deliveries would begin by 2021-end. The system would complement India’s indigenous Ballistic Missile Defence system developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation and create a multi-tier air defence over the country. Indian Air Force (IAF) officials have stated that the S-400 would be seamlessly integrated into the country’s existing air defence network. Given its long range, the system, if deployed towards the western borders, can track movements of Pakistan Air Force aircraft as soon as they take off from their bases. For the IAF, the high-end technology S-400 would give a fillip and make up for its falling fighter aircraft squadrons in the medium term. Former Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa had on several occasions termed the S-400 air defence systems and Rafale fighter jets “game changers” for the IAF. Globally, there has been a growing interest for the S-400 with several countries expressing interest in the system. In addition to Turkey, in July 2018, China became the first export customer to receive the S-400 and got sanctioned by the U.S. under CAATSA. India, in addition to S-400, has signed several other major defence deals with Russia. India is also acquiring several high-end military platforms from the U.S., which includes P-81 maritime reconnaissance aircraft, AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and CH-47(I) Chinook heavy lift helicopters, and recently leased two MQ-9B Predator high altitude long endurance drones. In addition, negotiations are in an advanced stage for procurement of the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System. While Trump administration has not invoked CAATSA sanctions so far, it is not clear if the U.S. would continue to do so. The issue would come up before the incoming Joe Biden administration most likely when India starts taking the deliveries next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-long-russian-arms-in-the-skies/article33376234.ece
20 December 2020||Ghaziabad,||PM Modi’s AMU outreach sparks debate on campus||News of Prime Minister Narendra Modi accepting the invitation of the Vice Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University to be the chief guest at its centenary celebration on December 22 has sparked debate on the campus. While the university administration is busy projecting the virtual address as a historic event, there is a section of students and teachers that is looking into the deeper meanings of the PM’s outreach to the centre of Muslim intelligentsia which has often been described as a hub of anti-national activities by his party’s members, including the local Member of Parliament. With no election round the corner, some feel the Prime Minister could use the opportunity to repair his perceived reputation as a statesman as his credibility as a protector of minorities is allegedly under a cloud on the global stage. A senior professor, requesting anonymity, reminded that the virtual visit was happening at a time when not only Muslims, even Sikhs are feeling alienated after the government’s position on farmers’ protest. “What he says would be closely watched globally. He might use the platform to engage with the Muslim world,” he said. Sir Syed’s example There are some who are invoking university founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan to remind how he engaged with the British government even when it was against Muslims. “We must try to tell the government that we are followers of Sir Syed and will cooperate with the government but not with any party’s ideology,” said Razaullah Khan, retired professor and former president of AMU Teachers’ Association. Then there are those who feel that the government might be thinking of projecting VC Tariq Mansoor, who is said to be close to some RSS leaders, as the new face of Muslims. Ansab Aamir, a student of Engineering faculty, who actively participated in the anti-CAA protests in 2019, said the participation of the Prime Minister in the centenary celebrations needs to be celebrated but the person holding the position was not somebody who could be praised unanimously. “He is the same person against whom a large number of the students of AMU were protesting against last year. He is the same person who is pushing laws that are detrimental to the identity of Muslims. And this institution is the beacon of that very identity.” Talha Mannan, a student of Education department, said as AMU was a space for debate and discussion, the session should have been opened to students. “The students are concerned about the events that have unfolded in the last six years, especially with regard to the AMU as it faced unprecedented State oppression in December 2019. They would like to pose some questions to the PM because he remained largely silent on last year’s protests against the CAA. There is an atmosphere of insecurity among students and if he doesn’t address that, then who else will?” he said. A group of teachers has issued a release asking the AMU fraternity to rise above politics to make the centenary celebration a success. Sources in the administration feel that the PM might offer something big for the education of Muslim women. “A proposal regarding establishment of a centre for professional studies for women is pending in the Education Ministry,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-modis-amu-outreach-sparks-debate-on-campus/article33376407.ece
20 December 2020||Thiruvananathapuram,||Kerala’s virus cases on the rise again||The COVID-19 case graph is beginning to rise again in the State, post local body polls, as had been anticipated by public health experts and epidemiologists. On Saturday, the cumulative case burden of the State crossed the seven lakh mark to reach 7,00,158 cases. The new cases daily, which had been contained between 4,000 and 5,000 for the past few days, went up to 6,293 cases on Saturday when 59,995 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. The test positivity rate also climbed to 10.49%, indicating that disease transmission could be intensifying. The number of recoveries reported on the day was 4,749. The active case pool in the State which had been steadily and slowly declining climbed back to 60,396 cases, while the total recoveries in the State touched 6,36,814. Health Minister K. K. Shylaja said that the next two weeks would be crucial for Kerala, as the State’s COVID-19 disease curve, which had been on a plateau since the last week of October, was expected to rise again. The State could be entering a new phase of the epidemic, she added She said that while this rise or surge in cases was anticipated immediately after the local body polls, how far the graph would rise was something that remained to be seen. Despite the government directives regarding the maintenance of strict COVID protocols during the local body election campaigning, especially the warnings on maintaining physical distancing and avoiding large congregations, people seemed to have taken things easy. The impact of the relaxations during the poll campaigning is slowly beginning to surface as cases have already begun to rise in many districts, Ms. Shylaja said. She appealed to the public to be on guard and to avoid congregations and other crowded public places as far as possible and to maintain all safety precautions. Death toll On Saturday, the State’s cumulative toll rose to 2,786 with the addition of 29 more deaths to the official list of COVID deaths. Alappuzha and Palakkad accounted for six deaths each, Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur four each, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Kozhikode two each, while one death each was reported by Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Wayanad. Official figures put the number of critically ill COVID patients in various ICUs in the State at 820, with 233 requiring ventilator support. Of the 6,293 new cases reported in Saturday, 6,220 are locally acquired infections with the source of infection remaining untraced in 593 cases. The number of health-care workers who contracted COVID is 49. In 73 cases, the authorities reported a history of travel outside the State. Among districts, the northern districts continue to have the highest number of cases, with Kozhikode reporting 777 cases, Malappuram 657, Thrissur 656, Kottayam 578, Alappuzha 465, Kollam 409, Palakkad 390, Pathanamthitta 375, Thiruvananthapuram 363, Kannur 268, Wayanad 239, Idukki 171, and Kasaragod 119 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keralas-virus-cases-on-the-rise-again/article33376193.ece
20 December 2020||Kolkata,||‘Any exploitation of Sentinel Island will wipe out tribals’||Any exploitation of the North Sentinel Island of the Andamans for commercial and strategic gain would spell the death knell for its occupants, the Sentinelese, a most secluded, particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) who reside in complete isolation on the island, the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) has said. In a policy document, which comes almost two years after American national John Allen Chau was allegedly killed by the Sentinelese on the island, the AnSI says the “right of the people to the island is non-negotiable”. “These rights are unassailable, non-negotiable and uninfringeable. The prime duty of the state is to protect these rights as eternal and sacrosanct. Therefore, their island should not be eyed for any commercial or strategic gain, for if it were to happen, it surely would be a death knell for its occupants,” the policy document said. The Sentinelese, with a population of about 50 to 100 on the North Sentinel Island, are not only among the most isolated of nearly 70 PVTGs across the country, but also among the five in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands which include the Great Andamanese, the Onge, the Jarawa, and the Shompens. Along with maintaining the territorial integrity of the North Sentinel Island, the document also calls for building a knowledge bank on the Sentinelese. Since ‘on-the-spot study’ is not possible for the tribal community, anthropologists suggest the ‘study of a culture from distance’. Speaking to The Hindu , M. Sasikumar, Deputy Director of AnSI and among the few anthropologists who have circumnavigated and conducted an aeriel survey of the North Sentinel Island as late as 2015, said this is first detailed policy draft for the Sentinelese island, prepared at the request of the Andaman and Nicobar Administration. “The Andaman administration had written to us to come up with a policy document. Then all of us who have worked on the tribe sat together, held discussions and prepared the policy. We have sent the policy to the Andaman administration for their consideration.” Mr. Sasikumar said. The document calls for an insightful study of the ‘journal’ of John Allen Chau who spent a couple of days on the island, encountered the Sentinelese from close proximity and registered his observations. According to Mr. Sasikumar, Chau’s 13-page diary — parts of which are illegible and has sketches of the settlements — is an extremely important anthropological document. Chau had handed it over to the fisherman who transported him to the island in November 2018, a day before he was killed. “We don’t know what is happening in the island. During the British period M.V. Portman had visited it, followed by few anthrolpologists of the AnSI after independence in 1967 and then it is this American (Chau). These are the only occasions when outsiders have landed on the island. The rest have been observing the inhabitants from a distance,” Mr. Sasikumar said. Goodwill missions The anthropologist said that till the 1990s, there were goodwill missions whose contact was limited to standing in shallow waters around the island at a distance and offering gifts to the members of the tribe. The policy document suggests that members of the goodwill missions should be interviewed for what they remember seeing during their circumnavigations as also fishermen from Wandoor, Manglutun, Chidiatapu, and others, about their visits to this island and any meeting with the tribal community. The AnSI has published the policy inputs in a paper titled ‘Draft of the Policies for Great Andamanese and Sentinelese’ published in their journal, recently. Along with Mr. Sasikumar, Vinay Kumar Srivastava, Director AnSI, anthropologist Umesh Kumar, Shiv Kumar Patel and Priyanka Airi Goyal are co-authors of the document. “Though both Sentinelese and Great Andamanese are classified as PVTG, the tribes live in two completely different contact situation. While in the case of the Sentinelese their contact to the outside world is almost nil, the Great Andamanese had decades of exposure to the world outside their Island,” Mr. Sasikumar explains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/any-exploitation-of-sentinel-island-will-wipe-out-tribals/article33376216.ece
20 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Karnataka to reopen schools, colleges||After a series of meetings, the Karnataka government on Saturday announced that schools and pre-university colleges will reopen their doors to students of Class X and II PU from January 1, 2021. A limited number of classes will be held in small batches in a staggered manner to prevent and limit the spread of COVID-19, the government said. The decision came at the end of an hour-long meeting convened by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday. The Chief Minister, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar and Minister for Health K. Sudhakar met with heads of various departments and other experts. The decision, based on the recommendations of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), was greeted with cautious optimism as both class X and II PU students are preparing for board examinations. Mr. Suresh Kumar, however, clarified that it was not compulsory for students to physically attend classes on campus. “They may continue with online classes. For the benefit of students, lessons are also being telecast on DD-Chandana, while also being available on Samveda platform on social media,” he said. School managements are waiting for clearer guidelines and SOPs (standard operating procedures), but a majority were of the opinion that a phased and controlled resumption of classes is the way forward. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, welcomed the government’s decision. He, however, stressed on the need for SOPs. “In urban areas, many children are dependent on transport to get to school. When the SOP is being drawn up, it must cover this aspect as well,” he said. He added that it was important for the curriculum to be fixed given that the board exams are fast approaching. “The other big challenge before us and the Education Department is to decide on the curriculum, cutting down the syllabus for the examinations, deciding when to hold examinations, the duration, etc.,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-to-reopen-schools-colleges/article33376196.ece
20 December 2020||New Delhi,||‘India’s COVID-19 fatality rate is among lowest in the world’||Observing that despite festivals in the month of October-November, no new surge of COVID-19 cases had been observed in this period due to comprehensive testing, tracking and treatment policy implemented on the ground, the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday said, “India’s COVID-19 pandemic growth is currently at 2% and case fatality rate (CFR) is amongst the lowest in the world at 1.45% now.” Chairing the 22nd meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19, he said, “India’s COVID recovery rate has peaked to 95.46% while the strategy of testing 1 million samples has decreased the cumulative positivity rate to 6.25%. But there is still a need to diligently maintain COVID appropriate behaviour at a time when the country is at the cusp of authorising the first set of vaccines.” Vaccination drive He also expressed the need for an expeditious vaccination drive to cover all the target populations, estimated to be around 30 crore. Briefing the GoM on requests for vaccines received by the Ministry of External Affairs from 12 other countries, Vinod K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog provided a detailed presentation on critical aspects of vaccination. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “People in States/UTs with a vibrant public healthcare system are tracked and encouraged to be tested by grassroots health workers, which inhibits the progress of COVID in the patient to an advanced stage, which allows these States to keep their fatality rate at minimum.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indias-covid-19-fatality-rate-is-among-lowest-in-the-world/article33376218.ece
20 December 2020||New Delhi,||India, Nepal political parties improve ties as leaders meet||The latest visit by the leader of the Foreign Affairs department of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to Nepal is expected to open a new level of interaction among the political parties of Nepal and India, leaders on both sides have remarked. Dr. Vijay Chauthaiwale’s visit to Kathmandu earlier this month took place after Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla held a discussion with his counterpart in Nepal on November 26 during a two-day visit, which helped in normalising relationship with Nepal after months of turmoil. During his visit to Kathmandu, Mr. Chauthaiwale met with Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel. Following the meeting held last week, Mr. Chauthaiwale said on social media, “It’s a pleasure to be in Kathmandu on the invitation of general secretary of Nepal Communist Party and Finance Minister Shri Bishnu Paudel ji.” The visit was significant as the ruling Nepal Communist Party has been at loggerheads with several leaders of the BJP in U.P. and Bihar. This tussle was complicated further because of certain remarks by the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Mr. Chauthaiwale’s outreach found support from D. Raja of the Communist Party of India, who has been a part of the political dialogue between India and Nepal over the last two decades. “It’s a welcome sign. There should not be any bar on the communication among political parties between the two sides. We have always maintained frank discussion with Nepalese political parties, cutting across ideological lines. This was interrupted only in the most recent years because of political obstructions from certain sides,” Mr. Raja said, emphasising the need for dialogue between the political parties of India and Nepal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-nepal-political-parties-improve-ties-as-leaders-meet/article33376206.ece

Mr. Beniwal contested and won from Nagaur, the lone Lok Sabha seat that the BJP conceded to his party, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party. In his resignation, Mr. Beniwal said many of the issues raised by him in the Parliamentary Committee meetings were ignored. “I had raised various people-centric issues with the committees I was part of in Parliament. It is sad that action has not been taken on the issues. There is no justification for committees in the parliamentary system if action is not taken,” Mr. Beniwal said in his resignation. He further said, “As the issues remained unheard and due to the farmers’ agitation, I am tendering my resignation from the committees.” Mr. Beniwal was a member of parliamentary committees on industries; petroleum and natural gas; and petitions. At a press conference earlier in the day in Jaipur, Mr. Beniwal also announced a farmers’ march to Delhi on December 26 to express solidarity with the stir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-ally-sides-with-farmers-quits-3-govt-panels-in-protest/article33376212.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Visva-Bharati mulls action against teachers’ body||Visva-Bharati appears to be contemplating action against a vocal teachers’ body that recently brought to light a controversial claim made by its Vice Chancellor about a call he supposedly received from Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. During a virtual meeting with faculty members on December 9, Vice Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty openly claimed that he had received a call from Professor Sen, who introduced himself as “Bharat Ratna Amartya Sen” and requested that hawkers around his Santiniketan house not be evicted as his daughter, who visited Santiniketan often, would be inconvenienced. Following this, Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA) president Sudipta Bhattacharyya emailed Professor Sen and he denied making any such call or request to the Vice Chancellor. The Nobel laureate’s reply, which became public, also said that the “Visva-Bharati often interferes too much with the normal life of ordinary people, of which setting up walls to interfere with ways and passages of people is a good example.” Visva-Bharati has served a show-cause notice on the VBUFA president, accusing him of interacting with the media without approval of the authority and in violation of office orders/notifications. “You are hereby requested to explain why such acts of yours should not be treated as indiscipline, insubordination and violations of service conditions and conduct rules/regulations and why disciplinary action should not be taken against you,” said the notice, served on Friday on the VBFUFA president, who is a professor of economics and politics. Simultaneously, a notification was issued on the Visva-Bharati website asking faculty members to let the university know whether they were formally associated with the VBUFA. They are required to respond by Monday; in case they don’t, then — according to the notification — “it will be presumed that they are not linked with it.” The VBUFA, formed in January 2014, is a voluntary association of faculty members of Visva-Bharati University and has 320 members. It is scheduled to hold a general body meeting on Saturday evening. According to sources, they are most likely to agree on not responding to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/visva-bharati-mulls-action-against-teachers-body/article33376631.ece
20 December 2020||Kochi,||Police give clean chit to Mar Alencherry in land deal||The police team probing the alleged irregularities in the controversial land deal by the Syro-Malabar Church has submitted a report before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, saying that there is nothing that points to a conspiracy or undue gains by Major Archbishop Cardinal Mar George Alencherry in the episode. The team has reached the conclusion that the Church decided to sell land at six places, including at Ernakulam, in order to repay a Rs. 58-crore loan that had been taken to start a medical college at Mattoor. The decision was taken after due consultations with the stakeholders concerned, including the Church’s finance council. There was no move to undervalue the said land. The controversy arose after a section within the Church, who were mainly opposed to the worship pattern from outside Ernakulam (the cardinal hails from Changanassery) and the mode of spending the revenue from Church-run hospitals, raked it up, it says in the report submitted in November. Under this circumstance, the allegation of criminal conspiracy does not hold good and the case ought to be closed, by considering the case as ‘mistake of fact,’ the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-give-clean-chit-to-mar-alencherry-in-land-deal/article33376592.ece
20 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||Registration of non-agri properties back to old system||In the face of strictures passed by the High Court on registration of non-agricultural properties, the State government on Saturday reverted the process “for the time being” to the old system using the Computer Aided Administration of Registration Department (CARD) which was in vogue since 1996 in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. A release of the Chief Secretary said the High Court had stayed mandatory slot booking facility for registrations while permitting registrations without insistence on Aadhaar details. Slot booking So, the slot booking facility for non-agricultural registrations was kept in abeyance for the time being. However, registrations in respect of the slots already booked for December 19 and thereafter will be taken up on the date and time as per the slots already booked. In order to obviate any hardship and inconvenience to public, the Chief Minister had directed the registrations of non-agricultural properties in all Sub-Registrar offices from December 21 without insisting on advance slot booking and using CARD system for time being. The release added that 2,599 slots were booked since the commencement of booking services for registration of non-agricultural properties on December 11. As many as 1,760 registrations since their launch three days later were also completed. Meeting with bankers The government held a meeting with bankers on December 16 and organised a workshop for builders and developers on December 17. The slot booking facility was available for 23 different types of transactions like sale, mortgage, gift, development agreement, General Power Attorney etc. Five other services were ready for roll out. Apart from the court case, the registration of non-agricultural properties ran into technical problems with the software right from day one. However, the registration of agricultural properties continued uninterrupted from November 2 when it began. The Dharani portal to update both agricultural and non-agricultural properties was launched by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Oct. 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/registration-of-properties-back-to-old-system/article33376507.ece
20 December 2020||Nagpur,||RSS ideologue Madhav Govind Vaidya passes away||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue and the organisation’s first spokesperson Madhav Govind Vaidya died here on Saturday after a brief illness, his family said. He was 97. Vaidya, who had recovered from a coronavirus infection, died at a private hospital in Nagpur, his grandson Vishnu Vaidya told the Press Trust of India. The last rites will be held on Sunday. Vaidya, who became a volunteer of the RSS almost two decades after the organisation was set up, had seen it all during his eight decade-old association with it — the three bans, isolation, internal conflicts over joining politics, ferment and resurgence, changing power equations with the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the latter’s storming to power at the Centre in 2014. A former chief editor of the city-based pro-RSS Marathi daily Tarun Bharat , Vaidya became a member of the RSS in 1943 while at the Morris College in Nagpur. He was the first RSS pracharpramukh (spokesperson), a former editor of Tarun Bharat said. Vaidya was also a former Akhil Bhartiya Bauudhik Pramukh of RSS, he added. He wrote several books and also a column in Tarun Bharat for 25 years. In January this year, Vaidya triggered a controversy with his demand of dividing Maharashtra into four parts, and came in for attack from various quarters over it. In his condolence message RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat described Vaidya as a multi-faceted personality and an excellent journalist. “He had a major contribution in shaping the RSS’ ideology,” tweeted Union minister Nitin Gadkari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rss-ideologue-madhav-govind-vaidya-passes-away/article33376201.ece
20 December 2020||Chandigarh,||Opposition decries I-T raids on commission agents in Punjab||The Congress party, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday accused the Central government of adopting intimidatory tactics against arhtiya s (commission agents) supporting the agitating farmers against the farm laws. “The I-T raids were conducted at the premises of several big arhtiya s of Punjab within a span of just four days of issuing notices, without waiting for responses to the notices,” said Capt. Amarinder, dubbing it a clear debasement of the due process of law. Among the arhtiya s on whom the night-long raids were conducted in the presence of two bus-loads each of CRPF personnel were Vijay Kalra, president of the Punjab Arhtiya Association; Pawan Kumar Goyal, president of the association’s Samana Mandi; Jaswinder Singh Rana, Patiala district president of the association; Manjinder Singh Walia, Nawanshehar district president of the association; Hardeep Singh Ladda, Rajpura Mandi president of the association; and Kartar Singh and Amrik Singh, commission agents in Rajpura. A total of 14 commission agents across Punjab have received notices from the I-T Department. AAP State president and Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann termed the sudden spree of raids on commission agents by the I-T Department as a retaliatory step by the Centre. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that the sole objective of the raids on commission agents was to intimidate them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-decries-i-t-raids-on-commission-agents-in-punjab/article33376213.ece
20 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Prison population reduced by 10.42% between April and June’||A report released on Saturday by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) said the population in Indian prisons reduced by 10.42% from April to June due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report urged the State governments and prison authorities to continue the measures to decongest prisons. The report, titled ‘Responding to the Pandemic: Prisons and Overcrowding’, said that after high-powered committees were formed on the orders of the Supreme Court to reduce overcrowding, the occupancy in prisons of 22 States and Union Territories reduced from 107.8% on December 31, 2019 to 103.1% on April 1, 2020 and then to 93.3% on June 30. “However, a closer look at the prison-wise occupancy showed that 27% of the prisons in 19 States/UTs continued to be overcrowded,” a CHRI statement said. Speaking during the virtual launch of the report, retired Supreme Court judge Justice Madan B. Lokur said: “We talk about bail not jail, but the issue of prison overcrowding can be addressed at a much earlier stage… It is where the role of the investigating officer, the prosecution, the judge and the legal aid lawyer become very important.” Punjab and Haryana High Court judge Justice S. Murlidhar spoke about need for “constant upgradation and maintenance” of the technological interventions introduced during the pandemic, including the videocalling facilities for prisoners. Prisoners may not be able to speak frankly with lawyers and privacy for the videocalls must be preserved, perhaps using glass enclosures, Justice Muralidhar suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prison-population-reduced-by-1042-between-april-and-june/article33376222.ece
20 December 2020||Kolkata,||Trinamool Congress MP labels Suvendu Adhikari a traitor||Within hours of Suvendu Adhikari joining the BJP, the Trinamool Congress came out all guns blazing, targeting the former party heavyweight calling him a traitor and someone who was eyeing the chair of the Chief Minister. Senior Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha member Kalyan Banerjee launched the most scathing attack on his former party colleague, calling him a “traitor” and “coward”. “He [Mr. Adhikari] says he didn’t get enough respect in the Trinamool Congress. He had three ministries. He was the observer of four to five districts. What more did he want? The CM’s chair? That such a traitor can come up from the holy land of Medinipur is unthinkable for the people of Bengal,” Mr. Banerjee said at a press conference at the TMC headquarters. He dared Mr. Adhikari to contest from Nandigram in 2021. “Don’t change your seat in Nandigram. In the election, we will teach you a lesson... in the 2021 elections, there will be a storm which will be only Mamata Banerjee,” he added. Referring to Mr. Adhikari’s attack on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, Mr. Kalyan Banerjee said, “You are a coward, that is why you did not have the guts to call him by his name.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-congress-mp-labels-suvendu-adhikari-a-traitor/article33376225.ece
20 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Money-laundering case: High Court upholds proceedings against Katta, family members||In a setback to the former Minister Katta Subramanya Naidu, the High Court of Karnataka has upheld the proceedings initiated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him, his wife, and eight other family members on the allegation of money laundering. “There is absolutely no basis for the petitioners to seek quashing of the attachment and consequent confiscation proceedings initiated against them on the purported plea that the same is violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India. No legal right having been accrued in favour of the petitioners to hold on or to enjoy the proceeds of crime, the source of which cannot be explained by them,” the court observed. Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order while dismissing the petitions filed by Mr. Naidu, his wife K. Sowbhagya, and others questioning the proceedings pending against them under the Prevention of Money Laundering (PML) Act, 2002. The money-laundering case was initiated after Mr. Naidu, who was then a Minister, was prosecuted in the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board land scam under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. He was, however, discharged from the charge by the High Court in November 2016 and an appeal against his discharge is pending adjudication before the apex court. Contentions rejected The court rejected the contentions raised on behalf Mr. Naidu that he could not have been proceeded under the PML Act as the offence alleged against him under the PC Act was prior to 2009, when the scope of the PML Act was expanded to the offences committed under the PC Act. “The prosecution of the offender for his involvement in the process or activity connected with the proceeds obtained through the commission of a predicate offence cannot be said to be a prosecution based on ex post facto legislation,” the court said while observing that offence of money laundering is “a continuing offence”. It goes without saying, the court said, that the properties acquired by commission of any of the offences listed in the schedule of the PML Act at any point of time as long as they continue to be in the possession or enjoyment of the offenders render themselves liable not only for prosecution but also for adjudication and consequent confiscation unless they establish that they have legitimate source to enjoy the assets held by them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-hc-upholds-ed-proceedings-against-former-minister-katta-family/article33376281.ece

We do not ask for anybody’s religion. All are welcome,” said Mr. Singh. On a daily basis Around 400 metres of cloth was being procured from the village on a daily basis, volunteers at the kiosk said. “It takes around 8-10 hours to reach the border from our village. So every day, one batch is sent from there so that it reaches by the next morning. On the first day, we started at around 11 a.m. and more than 250 people turned up. On Saturday, we started at 10 a.m. and by afternoon 400 people had visited us,” said Mr. Singh, who is a farmer owning about 10 acres of land in his village.

The man, identified as Rashid, and his brother Salim were released from the district jail after spending almost two weeks behind bars. The brothers had been booked under Sections 3 and 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Mr Rashid and his wife Pinki had arrived at the marriage registration office in Kanth when they were allegedly handed over to the police by members of a right-wing outfit who opposed their marriage and heckled the woman. The FIR against the two brothers was lodged on the complaint of Ms. Pinki’s mother, a Bijnor resident, who alleged that Mr. Rashid induced and coerced her daughter into a marriage and took her to Kanth to convert her. She also said Mr. Rashid had allegedly concealed his Muslim identity from Ms. Pinki. However, following the arrest, Ms. Pinki, in a statement to the district magistrate, had refuted all allegations against her husband. She said that as an adult aged 22, she had married him of her own will on July 24 in Dehradun, where the two were working, before moving to Mr Rashid’s home in Kanth. She also dismissed her mother’s charge that Mr. Rashid had tricked her into marriage. In its report, the police told the court that they could not find sufficient evidence against Mr. Rashid and Mr. Salim during the investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/moradabad-man-brother-get-bail-after-two-weeks/article33376214.ece
20 December 2020||Mumbai,||Bombay HC quashes abetment to suicide case||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court recently quashed an FIR against three students charged with abetting the suicide of a colleague. “They are young and their future will be destroyed if they are asked to face trial for this charge,” it said. A division bench of justices T.V. Nalawade and M.G. Sewlikar was hearing a criminal application filed by three students — Sayeeshdarshan Kanala, 21, Sanket Adlak, 22, and Piyush Dawkar. The complaint filed by Sushil Khawase had alleged that his daughter, a final year B.E Computer student, hanged herself on May 24, 2019 and that the three accused were responsible for her suicide. Mr. Khawase said he was examining some articles of his deceased daughter on May 27 and he found a two-page note. According to him, Mr Kanala and his friends had defamed his daughter. He said Mr. Kanala had left his daughter for a new girl friend and this disturbed her mentally. He alleged that his daughter believed that her private photographs had been leaked after her electronic devices were hacked, driving her to suicide. However, the court was informed that an expert’s report had said there was nothing to indicate that the girl’s laptop was hacked. On the other hand, her college record showed that she had failed her last semester. “The applicants are young and their future will be destroyed if they are asked to face trial for the aforesaid offences on the basis of material discussed above,” the court said. “It is also uncertain how much time will be required to complete investigation. This court holds that the applicants cannot be prosecuted for the offence of abetting the suicide of the deceased.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-hc-quashes-abetment-to-suicide-case/article33376226.ece

20 December 2020||MANGALURU,||Kidnapped boy rescued within 48 hours in Kolar||The kidnapping case of an eight-year-old boy from Ujire in Dakshina Kannada on Thursday was solved within 48 hours with the district police arresting six persons and rescuing the boy in Kolar early on Saturday. Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmi Prasad said that the grandson of a retired Indian Navy employee, A.K. Shivan, was kidnapped in Ujire, at about 6.36 p.m. on Thursday. Four persons in a car kidnapped the boy while he was walking with Mr. Shivan near their house on Car Street. Later, the family received a call at about 6.50 p.m. from a Madhya Pradesh-registered phone number demanding 100 bitcoins (Rs. 17 crore) and later also received WhatsApp messages demanding the bitcoins for releasing the boy. Mr. Prasad said that the four took the boy to Madikeri, Mandya, and then to Bengaluru. Then they left for Kolar and stayed there in a house with the boy. The police who came to know on Friday night about their whereabouts, rescued the boy early on Saturday and arrested six persons with the help of the Kolar police. Of them, two were arrested for providing shelter to the four directly involved in the kidnapping. Mr. Prasad gave the names of the four kidnappers as Ranjith, 22, Devalakere village, Mandya; Hanumanthu, 21, Kodikere village, Mandya; Gangadhara, 25, Vadanthahalli village, Mysuru, and Kamal, 22, Doddammana Halla II Cross, Bengaluru. The police also arrested Manjunath, 24, from Koorna Hosahalli, Kolar, and Mahesh, 26, from the same village. The boy and the kidnappers were found in the house of Mahesh. The Superintendent of Police said that a third party, for whom the police are looking for, had hired them to kidnap the boy by promising them Rs. 7 lakh.  The police are verifying whether the kidnappers had any criminal history with cases against them in the State. The kidnappers had allegedly surveyed Car Street area in Ujire for about 10 days before the crime. Mr. Prasad said that they had demanded bitcoins as they had come to know from the third party that the family had done a bitcoin transaction some time ago. He said that four special police squads were constituted to crack the case. The accused were produced before a court in Kolar on Saturday. The police are suspecting the involvement of three more persons in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kidnapped-boy-rescued-within-48-hours-in-kolar/article33376251.ece

Mr. Adhikari’s move which comes after months of speculation of his political future, is being seen as the most significant political development ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections. The Trinamool Congress’s biggest challenge seems to be keeping its flock of leaders together as Saturday’s developments are likely to trigger more defections. Shah attacks Mamata Speaking at the rally, Mr. Shah said the tsunami which he was witnessing in West Bengal, would leave Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee alone by the time elections are held. Attacking the Trinamool chief, he said, “Mamata ji is alleging that the BJP is trying to break the party. I want to ask you, is the Trinamool Congress your original party or did you defect from the Congress and found the Trinamool Congress?” Addressing the rally, Mr. Adhikari said he was joining the BJP not to give directions to State BJP leaders, but to work as an ordinary worker carrying flags, and painting graffiti if required. There cannot be development in the State as long as the same party does not head the government at the State and the Centre, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mass-defection-to-bjp-at-amit-shahs-rally/article33376197.ece

He, however, informed the leaders that the process of holding organisational elections, including to the post of the party president, is currently under way. Party veterans like Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath raised issues about the old guard versus young turks in the party. Mr. Gandhi responded by stating that he valued their contributions and acknowledged that many of them had worked with his father. He, however, is said to have stressed on the need to make space for younger leaders and the need to bridge the communication gap, said a source. This was the first time Ms. Gandhi met senior leaders, including those from G-23, in person since the pandemic restrictions kicked in. In August, the G-23 leaders had written a letter to Ms. Gandhi arguing for “collective leadership,” organisational revamp, internal elections, decentralised decision-making process and the need for an “active and full-time leadership”. Though none referred to the letter, the dissenters reiterated that elected and representative bodies were key to the party’s revival. From G-23 letter writers, Mr. Azad, Deputy Leader Anand Sharma, former CMs of Haryana and Maharashtra Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, former Union Ministers Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor, and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha attended. Former Union Ministers A.K. Antony, P. Chidambaram, Ambika Soni; Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot; former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath; general secretaries Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ajay Maken, Pawan Kumar Bansal, Harish Rawat and Bhakta Charan Das were present. Two key general secretaries — K.C. Venugopal, in-charge of organisation, and Randeep Surjewala, communications chief, considered close to Mr. Gandhi — were not part of the meeting. “Discussions were held on a positive note where leaders talked about how to strengthen the party at all levels,” Mr. Bansal said. A party leader said that while dissenters didn’t have any objection to Mr. Gandhi’s leadership, leaders like Ms. Soni, Mr. Maken, Mr. Rawat, Mr. Antony, Mr. Gehlot urged the former party chief to take over the reins again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/revamp-on-hold-amid-calls-for-rahuls-return/article33376198.ece

To ensure that the farmers in villages can reach global markets digitally, we are working on providing broadband connectivity to every village,” he said. Mr. Modi referred to rural opportunities like organic farming and herbal products that could be promoted by industry bodies around the world.

20 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||ED attaches assets of Farooq Abdullah||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth Rs. 11.86 crore of former J&K Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah in a money laundering case linked to the alleged misappropriation of over Rs. 45 crore from the J&K Cricket Association (JKCA) funds. The attached properties include three residential houses located on Gupkar Road in Srinagar, Tangmarg’s Katipora, and Bhatindi in Jammu, respectively; and commercial buildings on the posh Residency Road in Srinagar. Land parcels at four different places in J&K have also been attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED alleged that Dr. Abdullah’s residence on Gupkar Road and commercial buildings on Residency Road had been constructed on State land obtained on lease. Responding to the development, Dr. Abdullah’s son Omar Abdullah on Saturday tweeted: “My father has seen the media reports regarding attachment of his properties in the ongoing investigation in to the JKCA matter. Not surprisingly the media was tipped off regarding the seizure before he had received any official notice or documentation.” Stating that the attached properties were largely ancestral dating from the 1970s, with the most recent one built before 2003, Mr. Omar Abdullah said: “There can be no justification for the seizures because they fail the very basic test of having been acquired as the proceeds of the ‘crime’ being investigated.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-assets-of-farooq-abdullah/article33376204.ece

The order by the single-judge Bench of Justice Suman Shyam was based on a petition by leaders of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), which had emerged as the single largest party in the BTC elections held on December 7 and December 10. BPF president Hagrama Mohilary and some of his party colleagues had challenged the constitutional validity of the swearing-in of a few BTC members, including that of Pramod Boro as the council’s Chief Executive Member. Alleging violation of Election Rules, 2004, the petitioners said the Governor should have invited the BPF to prove majority as it had won 17 of the 40 seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/put-council-governance-on-hold-says-hc/article33376405.ece
20 December 2020||Ghaziabad,||Four booked under new U.P. ordinance||The Gautam Buddha Nagar police arrested four persons, including three women, on Saturday for allegedly enticing people to convert to Christianity. The leader of the group, Anmol, is a South Korean woman living in Surajpur under a fictitious name, the police said. The four, including Seema, Sandhya and Umesh Kumar, have been booked under Section 295 (a) of IPC and Section 3/5 (1) of Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020. “We received a complaint from Anita Sharma, a resident of Surajpur, that this group had been offering the locals money and other temptations to convert. They went to her house on Saturday and asked the family to dispense with idols. Ms. Sharma approached the neighbours and they called the police,” said Pradeep Kumar Tiwari, SHO, Surajpur. He said the three members of the group had converted to Christianity and are Scheduled Caste persons. “It seems Anmol is associated with a missionary group. The other three hail from Prayagraj,” said Mr. Tiwari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-booked-under-new-up-ordinance/article33376256.ece
20 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Police raid offices of loan apps||Cracking the whip against erring online loan apps for alleged harassment of debtors, Cyberabad police swung into action and conducted raids on the offices of certain companies, which incidentally turned out to be call centres. So far eight cases against such companies were registered in Hyderabad while six and one each were booked in Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates respectively. The harassment by these companies has so far claimed at least three lives in Telangana, with the latest being the death of a 29-year-old techie from Rajendranagar. As P. Sunil’s death created furore across the State, the Cyberabad police swiftly acted against the companies indulging in harassment of the loanees. Confirming the latest development to The Hindu , Cyberabad Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crimes) Rohini Priyadarshini said that their sleuths conducted raids at the offices of companies. “One of them is an app developing company, while the rest are call centres. So far we have not made any arrests,” she said.  However, Ms. Priyadarshini said that they served notices on the micro financiers and asked them to appear for questioning. So far, the Cybercrime police of Cyberabad Commissionerate registered six cases. Police said that they have identified at least 60 such instant loan mobile apps which were not registered or recognised by the RBI as Non-Banking Financial Company and their operations were unlawful. High returns When asked how the companies in question managed to get funds to disburse loans instantly, the DCP said that some NBFCs are ‘pumping’ money for high returns as promised by the mobile loan app firms. “Companies who are investing in such apps are also being verified and will soon be summoned for questioning,” she said, adding that one such NBFC operating from Delhi was identified. “Except for online harassment and humiliation, so far we have not received any complaint of physical harassment by the lenders,” Ms. Priyadarshini said. According to police, students, unemployed youth and homemakers have become victims of this harassment as many of them have taken loans from these firms without the knowledge of their parents or spouse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-raid-offices-of-loan-apps/article33376182.ece
20 December 2020||KOCHI,||Molestation of actor: images of suspects out||The police have published on their website the image of the two youths who allegedly stalked and molested a young actor at Lulu Mall in Kochi recently. The Kalamassery police said they had collected CCTV footage of the incident, following which the youths were identified. Their identity and whereabouts could not be verified since they managed to enter the mall without entering their phone number, a mandatory procedure in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts are on to verify their identity, the police added. The incident came to light after the actor narrated the incident on social media. The youths also reportedly tried to strike a conversation with her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/molestation-case-suspects-images-out/article33376183.ece

However, local authorities could decide if they want to limit daily entries. The ASI also ordered restarting of sale of physical tickets, which had also been stopped to prevent COVID-19 transmission. The ASI had put a cap on the number of visitors when it reopened the monuments to the public in July after closing them due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March. The order stated that the cap on visitors had been removed. However, the superintending archaeologist, with the concurrence of the district magistrate, could decide how many people be allowed a day. The ASI also ordered the restarting of sale of physical tickets at monuments where there were problems with the network and QR code for online sale.

20 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||IUML will sideline weak Congress in UDF, says Pinaryai||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday sought to widen the perceived fissures in the United Democratic Front (UDF) by stating that a weakened Congress was fated to become a subaltern part of the Opposition coalition. Mr. Vijayan waded into the apparent dissensions in the arguably embattled UDF leadership even as the alliance met here to make sense of its poor showing in the local body polls. In a Facebook post, Mr. Vijayan said the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) had pursued dominance in the UDF at the cost of an enfeebled Congress. Change in leadership The IUML has demanded a change in the leadership of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) rather audaciously. The IUML had robbed the Congress of its right to settle intra-party affairs. The party had, of late, gravitated towards radical Islamist ideologies, he said. The IUML had coerced the KPCC into entering into a pre-poll alliance with fundamentalist forces disregarding the All India Congress Committee (AICC), Mr. Vijayan alleged. The emergence of the IUML as the dominant party in the UDF indicated that the Congress-led coalition had changed colour and abandoned its secular values, he said. Mr. Vijayan’s attack came on a day when posters appeared in the capital supporting K. Sudhakaran, MP, to the post of KPCC president and amidst reports that minorities had shifted away from the Congress. It also seemed to pivot on KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran’s lament on Friday that some quarters had attempted to “isolate and attack” him for the poll debacle. Chennithala’s charge Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala responded sharply to Mr. Vijayan. He said the Chief Minister had brazenly attempted to divide the electorate into communal lines ahead of the Assembly polls. The secular credentials of the IUML were impeccable. Mr. Vijayan had tried to cast the UDF into irrelevance to aid the rise of the Sangh Parivar. He was in tacit understanding with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mr. Chennithala said. IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty said the IUML played by the book and has never dabbled in the internal affairs of its alliance partners. He challenged Mr. Vijayan to produce evidence to bolster the charge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iuml-will-sideline-weak-congress-in-udf-says-pinaryai/article33376186.ece

20 December 2020||Hassan,||Farmer trampled to death by elephant||A 35-year-old farmer was trampled to death by an elephant in a maize field at Kadubhaktarahalli near Doddabetta forest area in Alur taluk on Saturday morning. This is the first death in an elephant attack in Alur taluk since January 2018. K.R. Pradhan, a small farmer, was laying a pipeline on his field when he was attacked. He is survived by wife and two children. The local people informed the police and Forest Department about the incident. Villagers who had gathered at the spot demanded that the government capture all elephants in the region. A schoolboy died in an elephant attack at Kaduthali in Alur taluk on January 14, 2018. Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu that death due to elephant attack had been reported in Alur range after almost three years. “It is an unfortunate incident. We have been taking measures to avoid man-elephant encounters in the area,” he added. Officers of the department handed over a cheque for Rs. 2 lakh to the family of the deceased. The family would get another Rs. 5.5 lakh in the coming days. Operation So far over 60 people have died in elephant attacks in Hassan district. Residents of Sakleshpur and Alur taluks have been demanding that the government capture and relocate all elephants in the region. Mr. Sivaram Babu said a proposal to capture two elephants had been sent already. “I spoke to senior officers. I am hopeful of getting permission to capture two elephants, which have already been identified. We will launch the operation to capture them in a week,” he said. Already the department has radio-collared three elephants, which are leading three herds. “We have got permission to radio-collar one more. The radio-collars fixed to three elephants have developed technical glitches. We will replace them and fix it on one more,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmer-trampled-to-death-by-elephant/article33376191.ece

20 December 2020||ARIYALUR,TAMIL NADU||BJP leadership will decide on CM candidate: Murugan||Asserting that the National Democratic Alliance in the State, comprising the AIADMK and the BJP, among others, would continue, BJP State president L. Murugan said the national leadership of the party would decide on the alliance’s chief ministerial candidate. On Saturday, hours after Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami launched his election campaign, Mr. Murugan maintained that the BJP national leadership would decide which party would lead the alliance in the State. At an interaction with mediapersons in T. Palur, near Ariyalur, on the sidelines of a farmers’ meet, when a journalist pointed out that the AIADMK had already announced incumbent Mr. Palaniswami as its chief ministerial candidate for the Assembly election, Mr. Murugan said the BJP national leadership had to make a formal announcement on it. Asked whether the AIADMK was not interested in the alliance, Mr. Murugan said Mr. Palaniswami had said on Friday that the AIADMK alliance would continue.  Stating that he did not know why the State BJP’s ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ was banned, Mr. Murugan said the State government might have resorted to it due to the “tremendous response” the yatra generated from the people. Despite hurdles, the BJP successfully completed the yatra, he said. Mr. Murugan maintained that his party had already begun its election campaign through the yatra. It had covered 20 districts. In consultation with the national leadership, the dates of the formal election campaign would be announced, he said. To a question on seat sharing, he said it was too early to talk about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-leadership-will-decide-on-cm-candidate-murugan/article33376352.ece

20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Drive to restore Buckingham Canal scheduled to begin soon||Work on restoring the Buckingham Canal and the associated drains of Adyar and Cooum is set to begin shortly. Civic agencies, such as the Greater Chennai Corporation and line agencies, have been asked to start work on various projects associated with the rejuvenation drive. The work on waterfront development, channel improvement and solid waste management of the Buckingham Canal and 52 drains in the city will be taken up by the Corporation and the Public Works Department shortly. However, the work is expected to be delayed owing to the inadequate number of houses available with the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board. According to estimates, large parcels of land are expected to be cleared along the canals in areas such as Mylapore, Chepauk, Royapuram, Tiruvottiyur, Sholinganallur and Velachery. For example, residents in areas such as Neelam Basha Dargah slum in Triplicane have informed civic officials about the availability of large parcels of land that have been encroached upon. Hundreds of residents have constructed modern houses on land without patta in such areas. A few residents have also proposed the development of large waterfront projects to attract tourists to the area. But many residents have opposed the move. Just 247 households were identified by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in the Neelam Basha Dargah slum in Triplicane in the Chepauk Thiruvallikeni Assembly constituency. But residents said more houses had been constructed on government land, which were not yet covered in the restoration project. Mitigating pollution Following the administrative sanction for Rs. 1,281 crore this month for the project proposed by the member secretary of the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust (CRRT), officials have planned a holistic approach for restoring the waterways for mitigating pollution, resettlement and rehabilitation. At least Rs. 210 crore will be allocated for urban waterfront development along the Buckingham Canal. A budget of Rs. 192 crore will be allocated for waterfront development of drains of Buckingham Canal. Drains of the Adyar will get waterfront development at an estimated cost of Rs. 184 crore. Cooum drains will get waterfront development at an estimated cost of Rs. 29 crore. Solid waste removal will be carried out at an estimated cost of Rs. 131 crore. Channel improvement is estimated at Rs. 542 crore. At least 21,334 families along the Buckingham Canal and 52 drains will be resettled at an estimated cost of Rs. 3,339 crore. A total of 2,204 families have been identified along 21 drains of Buckingham Canal; 2,716 families along 23 drains of the Adyar; and 1,054 families along the eight drains of the Cooum. After the TNSCB carries out an enumeration, the numbers are expected to increase. The restoration of the Buckingham Canal will be completed in 2023.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drive-to-restore-buckingham-canal-scheduled-to-begin-soon/article33376332.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Collectors instructed to monitor colleges, hostels: Minister||Collectors have been instructed to monitor colleges and hostels across the State, in the wake of a COVID-19 cluster at IIT-Madras, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said. “The Health Secretary conducted inspections at IIT-M and Anna University. In Chennai, of the 8,000 samples lifted from colleges and hostels, the results of 210 have returned positive so far. Today, just one student tested positive. The situation has been brought under control. Any college that violates public health norms will face action,” he told reporters shortly after launching a few facilities at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). In Chennai, 97 colleges and 167 hostels are being monitored. Hostels and colleges should follow public health norms such as mask wearing and adhering to physical distancing norms, he said. When a number of developed countries had implemented lockdowns now, Tamil Nadu’s positivity rate stood at less than 2%, the Health Minister said, adding: “We have brought the situation under control in the State. There are chances for similar clusters to occur anywhere. In such circumstances, our rapid teams reach the spot, analyse and take the necessary steps. As a result, cases have come down drastically. This is Tamil Nadu’s strength.” Land for AIIMS When asked about the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Madurai, he said many political leaders waited for a chance to find fault with the State government. “If the Tamil Nadu government did not give land, how could they have taken up works to construct a compound wall at a cost of Rs. 7.5 crore? The government has given land. Due to COVID-19, the funding agency — the Japan International Cooperation Agency — could not visit the State and speed up the process. There are no other issues of delay,” Mr. Vijayabaskar said. To a question on government school students, who secured admission in private medical colleges being waitlisted as they could not afford to pay the fees, he said the Chief Minister had released Rs. 16 crore for the students through a government order. “The government will bear all costs, including on books and mess fees. After the ongoing counselling for admissions to MBBS/BDS courses under management quota ends, the second phase will be held next week. There are chances that the students will get admissions in the vacant seats,” he said. He said a grievance meeting was held with members of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association to look into pay-related issues. “We are holding discussions with the Finance Department. The government is considering the demands of the doctors, and will make an announcement soon,” he said. The views of government doctors, who took part in the protests last year, were also obtained and steps to withdraw all charges against them were being taken, he added. On the occasion, the Minister visited a 40-bed ward set up for homeless and abandoned patients at the RGGGH. The Minister also met a patient, a construction worker, who fell from a height of 15 ft, and sustained multiple injuries, including to the liver and intestine. The man had undergone a six-hour surgery at the hospital. The Minister also launched a healing garden for patients affected with cancer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collectors-will-monitor-colleges-hostels/article33376350.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Compilation of SC verdicts on labour jurisprudence released||Labour law practitioners need no longer dig into multiple sources in search of authorities that they could quote in support of their cases. Senior counsel S. Ravindran has come up with a compilation of 1,030 noteworthy Supreme Court judgments on labour jurisprudence in the format of a hard-bound book and also a compact disc with user-friendly content. Former Supreme Court judge F.M. Ibrahim Kalifulla released the book and the CD at a virtual function organised by the Labour Law Practitioners Association (LLPA) on Saturday. Justices T. Raja and S. Vaidyanathan of the Madras High Court, its retired judge D. Hariparanthaman and advocate T.S. Gopalan were the guests of honour. Mr. Kalifulla said labour law had several dimensions. It’s roots in the country could be traced back to 1850, about 170 years ago, when the Apprentices Act was enacted to enable children being brought up in orphanages to find employment when they came of age. Since then, the subject had evolved and adapted to changing times. Meticulous work He commended Mr. Ravindran for his meticulous work in compiling the judgments from 1953 to September 2020 after thoroughly analysing 13 of the major labour laws in the country. The former judge said the book and the CD were a must for judges, lawyers, law students, human resource professionals and trade union leaders. Mr. Hariparanthaman, a former practitioner on labour law, said the compilation was a first of its kind since it was a massive work done to bring all relevant judgments in one single book and CD. He also appreciated Mr. Ravindran for announcing that all proceeds from the sale of the book and the CD would go to the LLPA, Chennai. The former judge said the contents of the CD had been designed in a user-friendly manner with hyperlinks so that the users could easily access the relevant judgments and go through them at the click of a button. Now that the lawyers were increasingly becoming tech-savvy, he hoped that the compilation would be of immense assistance to them and serve as a ready reckoner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compilation-of-sc-verdicts-on-labour-jurisprudence-released/article33376680.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refuses to quash FIR booked against SC candidate||Cases related to false claims of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe status having been made to secure government jobs are very common, but the Madras High Court on Friday came across a peculiar case where a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste had allegedly claimed to be an Other Backward Class (OBC) candidate to secure the job of a lecturer. Justice P.N. Prakash refused to quash a First Information Report (FIR) registered against the former lecturer G. Suresh Kumar by the Puducherry Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (V&AC) unit based on a complaint lodged by the Principal of Pondicherry Engineering College, an institution promoted and fully funded by the Government of Puducherry, in December 2017. According to the complainant, the engineering college had, in 2007, invited applications for five posts of lecturers of which four fell under the Open Category and one under OBC category. The accused had obtained the job by producing a OBC certificate though he actually belonged to a Scheduled Caste and the issue came to light only in a vigilance inquiry. After joining the college as a lecturer, under OBC category, on July 3, 2007 and serving in the post for 51 days, the petitioner had resigned the job and left the college. However, the vigilance team got wind of the alleged crime and started sniffing around. It was only after its report was forwarded to the principal, the latter chose to lodge the complaint. Though the petitioner’s counsel assailed the FIR citing 10 years of delay in lodging the complaint, the judge said: “Unlike blue-collar offences, white-collar offences will not come to light that easily. Therefore, in the present facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be stated that there was delay in registration of the case by the police.” He also brushed aside the other argument that the police could have chosen to register a FIR suo motu instead of forwarding their report to the principal. The judge said the police possibly wanted the principal to verify the college records and then lodge a complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refuses-to-quash-fir-in-false-obc-claim-case/article33376357.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. will develop 1,000 Miyawaki forests||The Greater Chennai Corporation will develop Miyawaki urban forests at 1,000 locations across the city, said Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash. Speaking to mediapersons at the inauguration of a Miyawaki forest at the Omandurar Government Estate, he said the civic body aimed to increase forest cover from 17% to 25%. “Planting of 1,000 Miyawaki forests is our grand aim. We have completed 15 so far,” he said. Miyawaki forests have been developed in areas such as Sholinganallur and Mugalivakkam. On Saturday, 2,000 trees belonging to 25 species were planted on 10,000 sq ft of land on the premises of the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital (TNGMSSH), Omandurar Government Estate. “The Corporation will increase the number of parks from 675 to 1,000. Over 120 piers in bridges across the city will get vertical gardens before Pongal. Thousands of trees will be planted along the Cooum from Napier bridge to Paruthipattu by the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust at a cost of Rs. 36 crore as part of riverine plantation,” Mr. Prakash said. Residents in each neighbourhood will get spaces for walking near the Miyawaki forests, he added. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said volunteers had planted four layers of greenery, including a canopy layer, tree layer, sub-tree layer and shrub layer. This initiative would lead to reduction in temperature in cities, he said. Actor Vivekh, who participated, said the Corporation had been motivating NGOs in increasing the city’s tree cover. Help from volunteers TNGMSSH nodal officer Ananda Kumar said about 70 student volunteers, IT employees and civil services aspirants took up the job of digging and planting 2,000 saplings in the Miyawaki forest. “In order to popularise a cleanliness message and green concept among residents, the Omandurar Multi Super Specialty Hospital took up the initiative with Chennai Corporation and NGO Thuvakkam volunteers,” he said. Volunteers will maintain the trees for two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-will-develop-1000-miyawaki-forests/article33376330.ece

20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Driverless trains for phase II Metro project||Chennai Metro Rail will get its first driverless trains in three years for phase II. Unlike phase I, wherein the trains have four coaches, the phase II trains will initially have three coaches, and six coaches at a later stage. A three-coach train can accommodate 975 persons. Chennai Metro Rail has floated tenders for the design, manufacture, testing and commissioning of trains for a section of the project — the 26 km stretch from Light House to Poonamallee. Phase II also has two other corridors: Madhavaram-SIPCOT and Madhavaram- Shollinganallur. The first portion of the Light House-Poonamallee stretch — Poonamallee-Power House — has been planned to be opened in early 2025. The trains are likely to arrive by 2023. Thereafter, they will be tested and trials will start. One contract has already been awarded for starting construction of the Porur-Power House stretch. The contract for the stretch between Porur and Poonamallee will be awarded in a few weeks. According to the detailed project report of Chennai Metro Rail Limited, these trains will run at a maximum speed of 80 kmph. By 2025, 23 three-coach trains will be needed to start operations. When all the three corridors are opened and the number of passengers increases, six-coach trains will be deployed. As the first class has been scrapped in phase I itself, there will be no first class in phase II either. But there will be a facility for the women’s section alone, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/driverless-trains-for-phase-ii-metro-project/article33376337.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All-women police stations come under law & order DCs||The all-women police stations in the city, which were thus far handled by the Deputy Commissioner, Crime Against Women and Children (CAWC), will henceforth function under the Deputy Commissioners in charge of law and order. According to an order issued by city police commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, the all-women police stations will be monitored by the Deputy Commissioners concerned, through the range Assistant Commissioners, who will be in charge of routine administrative matters, including leave, daily station reports, inspection and visits. The Deputy Commissioners in charge of law and order will closely monitor the registration, investigation and trial of cases at the all- women police stations under their jurisdiction. Their senior officers, including the Additional Commissioners, will monitor the functioning of these stations. The annual confidential reports of the all-women police station inspectors shall be initiated by the Assistant Commissioners and will be reviewed by the Deputy Commissioners. Transfers and other administrative functions will be handled by the office of Joint Commissioners. The four Additional Deputy Commissioners, now supervising the functioning of the all-women police stations in four zones, through the Assistant Commissioners, will continue to do so and report to the Joint Commissioners concerned. They will attend meetings called by the Deputy Commissioner, Crime Against Women and Children. According to the order, the Anti-Child Trafficking Unit, the Investigative Unit of Crime Against Women and Children, the Anti-Dowry Cell, the Juvenile Aid Protection Units and women and child helplines will function under the Deputy Commissioner, Crime Against Women and Children. “The Deputy Commissioner, Crime Against Women and Children, will, however, be the nodal officer for coordinating issues related to crime against women and children and will monitor the cases, too. The officer will directly report to the city police commissioner. The officer shall also look after the welfare of the all-women police station staff and other women police personnel,” said a police officer. Sudha Ramalingam, advocate and women rights activist, said that though this decision might be an attempt to decentralise the functioning of the wing, it would lead to overburdening of the Deputy Commissioners. “They are already busy with bandobast duties and regular work, and it would be hard for them to focus on crime against women and children, which is a niche and sensitive area,” she said. With the upcoming election, things would only become difficult, she added. Andrew Sesuraj M, professor, Loyola Knowledge Hub for Excellence in Child Protection, felt that though the decision might have been made for administrative purposes, it defeated the purpose of a specialised wing for women and children. “All women police stations are meant exclusively for creating a positive environment for women and providing protection from gender-based and domestic violence and crime against children. If it is going to get mingled with law and order, the essence of creating a specialised wing will be lost,” he said. However, police officers are positive that the decision will improve the functioning of the all-women police stations. “We cannot single out crimes against women from other crimes or law and order issues. Everything is interconnected. It will be easier for the Deputy Commissioners to handle crime against women and children, too. Besides, if the commissioner wants, he can transfer important cases to the Investigative Unit of Crime Against Women and Children...,” a senior officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-women-police-stations-come-under-law-order-dcs/article33376336.ece

20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Survey to assess impact of rainwater harvesting on water table launched||Rain Centre, a city-based voluntary organisation, has launched a survey to assess the impact of rainwater harvesting in the city after the recent spells of rain this monsoon season. It has also invited residents to take part in the exercise to document rise in groundwater level and the effect of rainwater harvesting structures in recharging the city’s water table. According to data from Metrowater, the average groundwater level around the city has increased by 1.5 m to 2 m in December. Water tables in zones such as Ambattur, Alandur and Valasaravakkam zones has risen by 2.1 m. Volunteers of Rain Centre are engaged in a survey to find out the level of groundwater recharge and how the shallow aquifer has been replenished. The city has so far received nearly 104 cm of rainfall, which is 40% excess than its average of 74 cm for the northeast monsoon, according to the Meteorological Department. This season, the intense spells of rain were distributed over a few days. The intermittent rainfall gave time for rainwater to percolate into the ground, experts noted. The Rain Centre’s study also found that the shallow groundwater level was found at 7 to 8 ft. below ground, indicating the rainfall’s impact over the shallow layer of aquifer in several areas. The shallow layer tapped through open wells gets replenished quickly. Sekar Raghavan, the Centre’s director, said, “Residents who have an open well or could locate one in their neighbourhood may check its water level and inform us via email at sekar1479@yahoo.co.in or Whatsapp at 88381 21040.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/survey-to-assess-impact-of-rainwater-harvesting-on-water-table-launched/article33376443.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Reject recommendation to scrap quota in IIT faculty recruitment’||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has written to Union Minister of Education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank to reject the recommendation made by a committee to scrap reservation in the faculty recruitment at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). In his letter, he demanded that the Ministry bring out a White Paper on the implementation of the reservation policies at the IITs. It was Mr. Venkatesan’s question made earlier this year to the Ministry that brought to light that such a committee had been constituted. He has recently demanded information in Parliament on the action taken by the committee, but its recommendation was brought out by an activist through the Right to Information Act. Arguing that the committee that was formed to suggest measures for effective implementation of the reservation policies at the IITs had done something “diametrically opposite” to its mandate, Mr. Venkatesan said the recommendation was “retrograde” and went against the principles of social justice. He said the committee had not understood the principles governing reservation and had echoed the “Manu dharma” mindset by arguing that reservation was a hindrance to “excellence”. “I humbly suggest that the hindrance is caste and not reservation... In fact, reservation is a remedy, bringing in a large number of people for contributing to the development of society with excellence and output,” he said. Mr. Venkatesan said that even the alternative option provided by the committee that reservation be restricted to the cadre of Assistant Professor and a two-year research assistantship programme to improve enrolment of the reserved categories in the Ph.D. programmes were made with the ulterior motive of diluting reservation in the long run. He said that while data available in the public domain had spotlighted the poor status of implementation of reservation at the IITs, the committee’s claim that reservation policies were being implemented at all levels in student admissions raised doubt about its intentions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reject-recommendation-to-scrap-quota-in-iit-faculty-recruitment/article33376361.ece
20 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||The unusual early electioneering in T.N.||With AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami kick-starting his campaign for the 2021 Assembly election on Saturday, the State is witnessing an uncommon feature — that of leaders resorting to early launch of poll campaigns. The ruling party’s arch rival, the DMK, has already employed two of its prominent leaders — Member of Parliament K. Kanimozhi and youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin for the campaign. Party president M.K. Stalin will begin his road show on January 5. In the last week, Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan covered several southern districts, as part of his campaign. Several leaders said there were multiple reasons behind it. The pandemic and the consequent restrictions on the mobilisation of people were cited. “This has naturally created a situation where we require more time, both for covering different parts of the State and highlighting our [the ruling party’s] achievements,” said R.B. Udhayakumar, Revenue Minister and a member of the party’s media committee. There exists compulsion on the parties for sticking to the conventional method of campaigning as people expect leaders to visit them in their places at the time of election. “So we cannot afford to be unresponsive to the people’s expectations,” the Minister said. The traditional way A senior DMK leader said his party not being in power, nearly for 10 years, had made its members take the coming election more seriously than in the past. “Each of us in the party is keen on making it to power this time. This explains my party’s strategy,” he said. Though technology is increasingly being used for political work, the parties are aware that the traditional system of campaigning cannot be dispensed with. There are additional factors as well — the weakening of the Congress’ vote base over the years has given space for players such as Mr. Haasan and Rajinikanth, who is expected to launch his party in January. “When you find the MNM leader and Naam Tamilar Katchi founder Seeman going around seeking votes, an established party like the DMK cannot remain idle. You need to scale up and intensify your level of campaigning,” the leader said. He is expecting the campaign to pick up momentum from February. P. Ramajayam, political analyst, said in the past, the people’s focus on campaigns centred around personalities like M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, even though other leaders had also taken part. “This time, it is going to be diversified, and for this, you require time,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-unusual-phenomenon-of-early-electioneering-in-tamil-nadu/article33376348.ece
20 December 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Cash gift announced with election in mind’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had announced a cash gift worth Rs. 2,500 for rice ration cardholders only because the Assembly election was just four months away. Addressing party workers in Tiruvallur district, through videoconferencing, he said the Chief Minister had failed to release financial assistance when the pandemic snatched the livelihoods of the people. “He did not listen to us when we demanded Rs. 5,000 as relief for those affected. At least now he should release the amount,” he said. He said Mr. Palaniswami was extending the lockdown, periodically, because he feared the DMK would organise public meetings. Reacting to the Chief Minister’s allegations that he was not meeting people, Mr. Stalin said, “I am not sure whether the Chief Minister was sober because it was his government that banned public meetings.” He said the government was not able to digest the response to the fast organised by the DMK and its allies, in solidarity with the farmers protesting in Delhi, and hence had filed cases against the leaders. Recalling the help extended by the DMK to the people during the lockdown, he said the party was capable of doing what a government could not.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cash-gift-announced-with-election-in-mind-says-stalin/article33376353.ece

At present, works on underground sewerage scheme (UGSS), dedicated water supply scheme and underground cabling by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation are being carried out at various parts of the city. Besides, smart road works are also in progress in the old Corporation areas. Roads are dug in the middle for UGSS while one side of the road was dug for laying underground cables. This has turned many roads non-motorable and the residents and motorists face more hardship during rain. A resident at Periyar Nagar said road work had been in progress for over six months now and they were not sure when the works would be completed and the damaged road re-laid. “No board is placed to display the nature of the work or the date of completion of the project,” said V. Gokul Prasad, a resident. The residents should have been given prior information about the duration of the projects, he said. Many roads in the city, particularly in residential areas where UGSS and dedicated water scheme works are in progress, turn slushy and become dangerous for travelling during rain. Kavitha of Chinnamuthu Main Street said large-size pits posed a threat to people and children. Vehicle movement on the streets was also disrupted for many months. “The civic body should focus on re-laying the roads after completing the projects on each street,” she added. Corporation officials said most of the works were nearing completion and the roads would be re-laid after getting funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/re-lay-damaged-roads-in-erode-residents/article33376476.ece

Muthu Prabhakar Sera Pandian (27) of Vilathikulam in Thoothukudi district in an elephant attack during the survey at Singamalai forest area on December 17. Forest guard P. Pon Ganesan (29) suffered injuries in the attack. CPI’s Erode North District general body meeting was held at Sathyamangalam on Friday in which members said forest staff was regularly on patrol by risking their life without any protection against animal attacks. First-aid could not be provided and information about the attack also could not be passed on to their seniors immediately. They encountered dangerous animals in forest areas and hence anti-poaching watchers (AWPs) should be provided with arms, they urged. Also, they wanted the service of AWPs regularised. A resolution urged the government to provide Rs. 25 lakh solatium to the families of the deceased and also government job to one of their kin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-wants-forest-staff-equipped-with-arms/article33376473.ece

20 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Number of snakebite cases up at Government Rajaji Hospital||There has been an increase in the number of patients being treated for snakebite at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in November. Out of a total 99 patients who were treated for snakebite at GRH in November, there was one death. The increase in cases can be attributed to the rise in man-snake conflict during the monsoon. Dean J. Sangumani says that most of the cases were reported from rural areas and were either farmers or agricultural labourers.  Rise in calls Since the onset of monsoon, there was a rise in calls received by the forest department to rescue snakes, says District Forest Officer S. Anand. “In a single day, a maximum of eight snakes have been rescued by the forest department officials with the help of volunteers during this monsoon," he says. After a snakebite, a patient must rush to the hospital as soon as possible, says M. Natarajan, Head of the Department of Medicine, GRH. “The most important aspect is timely treatment of snakebite cases. The delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to physical disability or death,” he adds. However, the data from GRH shows that only 22 out of the total patients treated in November reached the hospital within four hours after a snakebite. A total of eight persons reached the GRH only after 24 hours. Many people in rural areas still tend to believe in myths and opt for unwarranted practices to treat snakebite, says P.R. Vishwanath of Oorvanam, a non-governmental organisation involved in snake rescue. “They do not reach a hospital unless the symptoms worsen,” he adds. Most of the snakebite victims are people from lower economic groups. “If a member of the family is affected by snakebite, then it can cause severe financial crisis to the entire family,” he adds. Dr. Sangumani says that after a snakebite the patient can undergo first aid at Primary Health Centres (PHC) and then rush to GRH. Although Anti-Snake Venom (ASV) shots are available at PHCs, in most cases the patients are asked to rush to tertiary health care centres, says Sakthivel Vaiyapuri, Associate Professor at School of Pharmacy, University of Reading, the United Kingdom, who campaigned for over a year across the State to create awareness of snakebite. As most PHCs don’t treat snakebite cases on time, patients take a long time to reach tertiary health centre, which worsens their symptoms, he says. Since private hospitals charge a hefty sum for treating snakebite, many poor parents cannot afford them, Mr. Sakthivel Vaiyapuri adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/number-of-snakebite-cases-up-at-government-rajaji-hospital/article33376454.ece
20 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Emission testing centres oppose restriction||The Motor Vehicle Emission Testing Centre Association opposed the restriction of buying equipment for their centres from only three companies in the State, which was imposed by the State Transport Commissioner. Its president R. Ramakrishnan told reporters here on Saturday that there are 26 companies in the State that manufacture equipment for vehicle emission testing centres after getting clearance from Automotive Research Association of India and International Centre for Automotive Technology based on The Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. However, only three of these companies had been permitted to sell the equipment, he added. This decision had increased the cost of equipment, he said. The government has decided to set up 3,000 vehicle emission testing centres across the State. But, emission testing centres will have to spend additional money due to restriction to buy equipment only from three companies. As a customer, we had the right to choose the company from where we would like to buy the equipment, he said. Whenever members of the association initiate setting up a new vehicle emission testing centre with the equipment approved by the Central government, the transport department officials orally reject the equipment purchased from the centre. However, the transport department officials do not give it in writing that they reject the equipment, he said. Therefore, the association urged the transport department to cancel the restriction of purchasing equipment from three companies. There are no such restrictions imposed in other States, he said. The association will extend its support for the lorry owners’ protest scheduled for December 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/emission-testing-centres-oppose-restriction/article33376679.ece
20 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC seeks govt.’s response to making officials accountable||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has asked the State government to come out with a positive response to the effective implementation of a government order (G.O.), issued a decade ago, with regard to ensuring accountability from every government servant at every stage and level, as recommended by the Administrative Reforms Committee. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the committee, under the chairmanship of former Madras High Court judge A.K. Rajan, had made certain recommendations to ensure a corruption-free and transparent administration. The recommendations were also accepted by the government. While accepting them, the government had requested all heads of departments to issue necessary orders to this effect, while delegating powers. Even though the G.O. was passed in 2010, none of the departments had taken any effective step to implement it, the judges said. “Every government servant is expected to act in accordance with the Acts, the rules and the G.O.s issued by the government, then and there. If Secretary-level officers have not complied with the orders of the government, how can we expect a common citizen to comply with such orders?” the court asked. Further, the judges observed that if a government servant was not complying with the orders of the government, the same could be treated as misconduct or unbecoming of the government servant, warranting initiation of appropriate departmental proceedings against them. ‘Law excuses no one’ “ Ignorantia legis neminem excusat, meaning, ignorance of law excuses no one — even a common man cannot plead that he is ignorant of the law. Unless the government comes out with an Act or rule on these recommendations, any circular or instruction issued in this regard will remain on paper alone, without effective implementation,” they said. “This court expects a positive response from the State government on the possibility of amending existing relevant Government Service Rules, for the effective implementation of the G.O.,” the judges said, seeking a response from the State on December 22. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-govts-response-to-making-officials-accountable/article33376383.ece
20 December 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea for compensation||A fact-finding team of Evidence, a non-governmental organisation, has urged the State government to immediately disburse Rs. 5 lakh each to the three Scheduled Caste boys, who were forced to remove their excreta allegedly by some caste Hindu youth in Perambalur district recently. Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, its executive director A. Kathir said that after the media reported the incident on December 12, a fact-finding team visited Sirukudal in Perambalur district. Investigations with the affected families suggested that the Maruvathur police station had registered cases under IPC and SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and arrested R. Abinesh, N. Silambarasan and S. Selvakumar, the three of the named accused. However, neither the Collector nor the Superintendent of Police visited the hamlet as mandated by the laws, its members claimed. The National Commission for SC/ST too did not visit the spot, villagers and affected families told the investigators, he said. When The Hindu checked, officials said that the SP had visited the hamlet and held inquiries. Under such circumstances, the three accused, who were behind bars, had approached the court seeking bail. When the case came up for hearing two days ago, the complainant, Chitra (one of the victim’s mother) had objected to the bail application. She had stated that the boys were under severe depression after they were forced to remove the excreta. She said that two of the boys had left the village for a relative’s house. The government should give compensation. The district administration should arrange for special counselling by trained psychologists for the boys as they were terribly disturbed after the incident. The parents too were upset over the remarks made by the caste Hindu youth, Mr. Kathir said. On December 11, when the SC boys, who had openly defecated in a portion of a land, which was being used as a playground by some of the caste Hindu youth in the hamlet, they were forced to remove them in a gunny sack. Using filthy words and abusing them, the youth had threatened them with dire consequences, according to reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-compensation-to-boys/article33376447.ece

The same was confirmed by the Centre during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition that sought to expedite the AIIMS construction work. Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian submitted that the foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 27, 2019. Subsequently, a proposal was sent to enter the 200 acres of land identified for the project. Further, 22.49 acres of additional land was identified for the project. In August, 2020, the State received a communication from the Centre to hand over the land. Following a communication to send the handover certificate, it was duly prepared and sent to the Centre for signing and returning the same on November 3. Communication in this regard had already been made, the AAG submitted. Confirming the same, Assistant Solicitor General L. Victoria Gowri submitted that the cabinet had approved the establishment of AIIMS at Thoppur at a cost of Rs. 1264 crore in 2018 and the project was to be completed within 45 months from the date of approval of the cabinet. The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was financing the project. The pre-investment work was at the advanced stage and the fact finding mission of the JICA representatives met in November. The loan signing agreement can go beyond December as per present situation. The next stage will be the signing of the loan agreement before March 31, 2021, the ASG submitted. Taking cognisance of the submissions made, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi asked as to why there was a delay in the project when the same was announced way back in 2015. The judges took note of media reports on an RTI reply that had stated that the State was yet to hand over the land for the AIIMS project to the Centre. The court said that it will pass detailed orders in the petition filed by K.K. Ramesh of Madurai who sought a direction to expedite the construction work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-govt-has-transferred-land-to-centre-for-aiims/article33376869.ece

He asked the students to avoid eatables that had high sugar and salt content. Always prefer vegetables and fruits over fast food, he said. He advised students to play outdoors to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Parents used to struggle to get their children back at home but now they had to push their children out as most of them are engrossed in the content on television or mobile phones. Avoid watching television or mobile phones before going to bed in order to beat stress and sleep better. Instead meditate for at least 20 minutes, he said.

Addressing party workers at Kanakachettikulam, from where the BJP commenced tour of all 30 Assembly constituencies to highlight the failure of the Congress government, he said the Congress wasted more than four and a half years in government.

20 December 2020||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK will win with highest majority’||Placing before the electorate the achievements of his government, AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday declared that the party would retain power with the “highest majority” in 2021. Launching an early campaign, after offering prayers at Sendrayan Perumal temple in Periyasorgai, in his Edappadi constituency, Mr. Palaniswami said that even if all DMK leaders campaigned in Edappadi, the party would still not be able to defeat the AIADMK in the Assembly election. He was referring to the recent meetings in Salem, addressed by DMK women’s wing leader Kanimozhi. “The AIADMK has been [cumulatively] in power for 31 years, the longest period. Dreams of our leaders M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa are being fulfilled by this government. The Opposition had said that this [Palaniswami] government will not last long, but our government is into its fourth year,” he said. He highlighted the handling of the pandemic, the cyclones and the drought; the attracting of numerous investment proposals; creation of the 7.5% horizontal quota for government school students in medical admissions, and the launching of the Kudimaramathu scheme among the major achievements of his government. The government, in its first year, battled severe drought and ensured water supply, he said. Besides, swift decisions were taken during successive cyclones, and Ministers were sent to the affected districts to monitor relief measures, and compensation was offered. Acting on the guidance of the State-appointed expert committee, WHO and the Union Health Ministry and taking effective measures had led to a reduction in the number of people testing positive for COVID-19, he said. The efforts had drawn appreciation from the Prime Minister. He said the government created history, procuring 32 tonnes of paddy in the delta region. “The Opposition leader [M.K. Stalin] is criticising us, asking about the schemes implemented by the government, and if anyone has benefited from it. But today, the State is amassing awards from the Central government,” Mr. Palaniswami said. The State received an award for water management, he said, asking what the erstwhile DMK government had done on this front. He said the Global Investors’ Meet in 2019 had led to 304 companies signing MoUs, committing to invest Rs. 3 lakh crore. During the pandemic, only Tamil Nadu attracted investment proposals for Rs. 60,000 crore. Through the Chief Minister’s special grievance redressal scheme, government officials met the people and addressed their grievances, he added. Edappadi, a fortress The Chief Minister, a four-time MLA from Edappadi, pointed out that the DMK had never won in the constituency in 43 years. He said wherever he went, people referred to him as ‘Edappadiyar’, and that fame belonged to the people. In the region, the Mettur surplus water scheme had been implemented, he said, appealing to the electorate to vote for the “two leaves” symbol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-will-win-with-highest-majority/article33376347.ece

20 December 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Delay in disbursement of loan under scheme irks street vendors||Delay in disbursement of loans by banking institutions has irked a section of street vendors who have registered their names under the Pradhan Mantri Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme in Kumbakonam Municipality. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing the special micro-credit facility for street vendors, where a collateral-free working capital loans of up to Rs. 10,000 of one-year tenure is offered to street vendors who have their names registered with the urban local bodies. In Kumbakonam Municipality, a total of 605 street vendors have enrolled their names and the certificate of vending (CoV)/identification card has been issued to them. Out of the 605 street vendors who have registered their names prior to April 1, applications for bank loans were submitted online by 540 and they have been forwarded to the respective financial institutions by the Town Vendors Committee. Meanwhile, on Saturday a group of vendors from New Bus Stand and Mahamagam Tank West Bank areas led by AITUC Street Vendors Union office-bearers took out a procession from Taluk Office to the Municipality protesting the delay in disbursement of loans. Speaking to The Hindu , senior civic body officials said all loan applications had been forwarded to the concerned financial institutions. Out of the total applications, 40% had been cleared and the loan amount credited in the accounts of the applicants. Some hiccups in online processing of PM SVANidhi loan applications seemed to have caused the delay in disbursement of loans and the issue was sorted out last week, they claimed. Further, the MHUA had granted permission to the Kumbakonam Municipality to add another 1,000 street vendors as beneficiaries of PM SVANidhi scheme so as to cover the maximum possible street vendors doing business in the civic body domain, sources said. As per the scheme, the loan was be repaid in 12 monthly instalments, which would not attract any prepayment penalty charges. Further, timely or early repayment would make the borrowers eligible for an enhanced loan amount in the next cycle of working capital loan disbursement. The borrowers could also receive around Rs. 1,200 per annum as ‘reward’ if they opted and carried on their business through the digital mode of transaction. Those engaged in the sale of vegetables, fruits, ready-to-eat street food, tea, pakoda s, breads, eggs, textile, apparel, footwear, artisan products, books/stationery and offering services such as footwear repairing, laundry services, and pan sales were eligible to avail working capital loan with an interest subsidy component of 7%. The interest subsidy would be available up to March 31, 2022, and it would be credited into the borrower’s account quarterly. The interest subsidy facility would be available on the first and subsequent enhanced loans up to March 31, 2022, and it would be credited at one go with respect to early repayment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-disbursement-of-loan-irks-street-vendors/article33376430.ece

20 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||It’s the season for home bakers in city||With Christmas just around the corner, home bakers in the city prepare for bake sales as many prefer home-made goodies for their low-key festivities this year. While many home bakers have scaled up their businesses over the lockdown, the home-made touch, convenience and the safety assurance are what customers prefer this time around, they say. From preparing traditional fruit cake and cookies, and the more exciting bakes such as truffles, tarts the bakers have their hands full trying to cater to the season's demand. Aishwarya Chellam Dhanaraju and her sister are a popular baker duo on local Facebook groups in the city. Posts about cakes and desserts on the groups always seem to mention them and their brand- Cake Doe. While she began baking as a hobby in March 2016 to satiate her niece's sweet tooth, she baked her first big order for sale much later. “The orders have picked up during the lockfown. I had baked brownies for a friend, who had, without my knowledge posted photographs of it on facebook. Through it, we received many orders for brownies, and eventually other desserts”" she said. The duo learned baking entirely on their own, from the internet. “There are recipes that work and then there are ones that flop. It takes a bit of trial-and-error before a successful balanced dessert,” Ms. Aishwarya said. Her sister does the troubleshooting and tweaks the recipes to taste. Her most popular desserts are macarons and brownies. The almond flour for the macarons and cream cheese for frostings are prepared at home to ensure quality and taste. Cake Doe's Christmas Hampers consisting of Royal British Christmas Cake, brownies, Red Velvet Jar, Scottish Shortbread, Vanillekipferl, Chocolate Bonbons and marshmallows are a big hit. They made and sold 30 such boxes last year, and are already preparing for more than twice the number this year. Customers can also customise the items in the box, Deepika, Aishwarya's sister said. People trust home bakers for food hygiene and freshness of the products. Also, while operating from home, you don’t have to look after the overhead expenses, or staff management and pre-order bookings make things a bit organised, she added. Another recently popular baker is Chef in A Box, Mallika Asif, a homemaker whose bakes such as saffron milk cake and chocolate tarts fly off the shelves. Her son, Salman Gilani does the social media marketing while she does the baking, Mrs. Asif confesses. “We had a family gathering in June when relatives encouraged me to start selling my desserts. With my son's help, we began to make and sell them through Instagram,” she said. Salman posts pictures of the day's desserts on their page and customers contact them and order it. “People love the cheesecakes and tarts because they are made from quality ingredients. We only make about 20 servings a day and it is all polished off by evening,” Mrs. Asif said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-the-season-for-home-bakers-in-city/article33376861.ece
20 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Civic body plans concrete paver blocks at Chathiram Bus Stand||Tiruchi Corporation plans to lay concrete paver blocks at the terminus being developed at Chathiram Bus Stand in the city. A Detailed Project Report has been prepared for the project and submitted to the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration of the State government for approval. According to sources, the civic body has sought a sum of Rs. 8 crore for the project, which will be implemented under the Smart City Initiative. The move is aimed at ensuring a smooth surface for operation of buses to various destinations from Chathiram Bus Stand. As per plan, pavement blocks will be laid on the entire plinth area of about two acres of the bus stand instead of asphalt road, which is susceptible to frequent damages particularly in the rainy season. The concrete paver blocks are said to be stronger. “We are awaiting administrative sanction. If it is accepted, it will be an important aspect of remodelling of the bus terminus,” a senior official said. The remodelling project, which is being executed at an estimate of Rs. 17.34 crore, is expected to be completed before March. The project that began in June 2019 is originally scheduled to be completed by May. Going by the progress of the construction work, the official said that it would be over by February. More than 80% of the work had been completed. Since the monsoon was expected to withdraw only by month-end, there might be further disruptions related to heavy rain. However, all works could be completed well in advance before the scheduled date. Chances were bright for inaugurating the remodelled bus terminus before the announcement of dates for the election to the State Assembly, officials indicated. The terminus will have 30 bus bays, a waiting hall for passengers, clock room, feeding room for lactating mothers, ticket counters, a food court and retiring room for police and bus crew. Construction of 33 shops were also part of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-body-plans-concrete-paver-blocks-at-chathiram-bus-stand/article33376432.ece

20 December 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Rally to create awareness of protecting birds||A 16-km-long cycle rally was organised here on Saturday to create awareness among the public of protecting birds, especially waterbirds, that descend on Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts in large numbers whenever there is a good monsoon, a time when the Tamirabharani feeds all the tanks with the rainwater. The Pothigai hills or Agasthyamalai, a part of Western Ghats, is a treasure for south Tamil Nadu as the Tamirabharani, one of the few perennial rivers in the State, originates from here. The Tamirabharani and its well-connected irrigation tanks have made Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts as the ‘Rice bowl and banana basket’ of south Tamil Nadu. There are over 700 system irrigation tanks in the Tamirabharani basin and they attract a large number of waterbirds during winter. ATREE’s Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre conducted a waterbird census in 2011 with the participation of locals to document bird species in the Tamirabharani wetland complex. It revealed that the tanks support thousands of waterbirds of more than 100 species. Many of them are migratory birds from northern Europe and Russia. These birds provide important ecosystem services like control of pests on agricultural fields and their droppings support good fish yield and increases crop productivity. Favourite haunts In the Tamirabharani basin, though Koonthankulam and Thirupudaimaruthur are popular for migratory birds, every census reveals that many other irrigation tanks such as Vagaikulam, Vadakku Kazhuvur, Manur, Vijayanarayanam, Perungulam, Karungulam, Arumugamangalam also attract a large number of birds. In Tirunelveli, Nainarkulam provides nesting habitat for oriental darter, little cormorant, Indian shag, grey heron and purple heron while Rajavallipuram, Palamadai and Kalkurichi tanks provide feeding habitats for a large number of migratory ducks and flamingos. To create awareness of biological wealth of the Tamirabharani basin and the need for conserving the habitats, ATREE’s Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre joined hands with Rotary Club of Tinnevelly, Nellai Nature Club, Nellai By Cycle and Arumbugal Trust and took out a cycle rally - ‘Pedal for Birds’ - which was flagged off by Collector V. Vishnu at Nainarkulam in the presence of Annadurai, Executive Engineer, PWD, Tamirabharani basin division, and M. Mathivanan, Senior Research Associate, ATREE, Manimutharu. The rally covered four important tanks - Nainarkulam, Rajavallipuram, Palamadai and Kalkurichi irrigation tanks, situated along a 16-km stretch. Over 60 cyclists participated in the rally and to encourage them Mr. Vishnu pedalled with them till Kalkurichi. “This is a very good event that needs to be organised frequently to create awareness among the public, especially among the younger generation, on conserving nature, mostly importantly wild animals and birds,” Mr. Vishnu said. Pictorial information boards on waterbirds were erected along Rajavallipuram and Kalkurichi tanks. A small birding session was arranged for the cyclists by the ATREE team comprising Patrick David, Maria Antony, and Vinod Kumar. The rally was coordinated by Hariprathan, secretary, Nellai Nature Club, and Mr. Mathivanan of ATREE.

20 December 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||A vision to churn out entrepreneurs||Collector V. Vishnu wants to make Tirunelveli district a hub for entrepreneurs. And his vision has brought hope to the large number of unemployed youth in this region. When he started his career as Sub-Collector of Cheranmahadevi, Mr. Vishnu organised special coaching classes with the help of volunteers to those preparing Tamil Nadu Public Service Examination. After being posted at Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation and being Director of Employment and Training, his focus turned to creating a skilled workforce. On coming back as Collector, Mr. Vishnu, the only one to be selected from India for Eisenhower Fellowship, chaired a meeting a couple of days ago to understand the profile of the workforce availability and steps to be taken to make them entrepreneurs or skilled workers. As per his plan, those who want to become entrepreneurs would be trained by experts in that particular trade. Others would be equipped with technical skills to meet the needs of the industry. The district’s multi skill development centre will be the nodal agency for the training programmes. Focus sectors Since farming is the predominant occupation in the district and making of traditional handicrafts and earthenware is gradually losing its sheen, the Collector wants to reinvigorate these areas. “We’ll make all-out efforts to market handicraft products across Tamil Nadu and also explore possibilities of exporting to other States and abroad with the help of e-commerce tools. Tirunelveli should become a trendsetter,” Mr. Vishnu says. He has asked bankers to give loans without cumbersome procedures to those who complete the entrepreneurship programmes. “I firmly believe that the initiatives we take in this direction will show the young aspirants a new world wherein they are the masters while their ventures ensure them decent revenues. On the other hand, we should have a stock of skilled workforce to meet the industry’s needs. With the tiny, small and medium industries to be started by these youngsters, we can give a new face to the district if we can achieve this in a time-bound manner as planned,” says Mr. Vishnu, an alumnus of National Institute of Technology-Tiruchi.

Addressing a meeting at Thippirajapuram near Kumbakonam on Saturday, Mr. Murugan said the Centre had taken efforts to improve the livelihood and financial status of farmers, It was extending Rs. 6,000 as annual financial assistance to farmers in the country. Around 41 lakh farmers in Tamil Nadu received the assistance. The Union government enacted three farm laws in order to fulfil the prime demand of the farmers seeking freedom to fix the price of their produce by themselves. This had remained a dream for more than five decades. Ironically, political parties that made election promises to fulfil the demand were now opposing the laws. He also chided the DMK and its allies for failing to explain what they claim to be “dangerous or disastrous effects” of the new farm laws. The meeting was organised by the BJP Thanjavur District Unit”“to dispel the misinformation being spread” by political parties against the three farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suicide-of-farmers-a-thing-of-past-due-to-centres-initiative-bjp/article33376442.ece

The authorities would distribute tokens to all family cardholders with details of when they should visit the shops to collect the gift. He denied DMK president M.K. Stalin’s charge that the gift was announced with a selfish motive. Last year, the government had offered a Rs. 1,000 cash incentive. “Mr. Stalin was the one who demanded that the government offer cash relief during the pandemic. Now, when announced, he is changing his stand. People should be careful. Even a chameleon would change its colour only after a short time,” he said. Anyone who stops welfare schemes meant for the poor has never won, he said. In late 2019, when the government offered a cash support and a gift hamper for Pongal 2020, the number of rice cards was around 1.98 crore. At that time, the government had sanctioned around Rs. 2,400 crore. For the Pongal festival of 2019, the government had set aside about Rs. 2,237 crore. After the outbreak of COVID-19, a cash support of Rs. 1,000 each was given to the cardholders in April this year and another Rs. 1,000 to the people in the badly affected districts in June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chief-minister-announces-rs-2500-gift-for-pongal/article33376344.ece

20 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Burns ward saw nearly 60 cases every month even during lockdown||Although the State-run Victoria hospital affiliated to the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) was converted into a dedicated COVID-19 facility ever since the pandemic hit Karnataka in March, the functioning of the Mahabodhi Burns Ward in the hospital has not been hit. Doctors said while nearly 60 new burns admissions were seen every month all through the pandemic, an equal number of patients visited the hospital for wound care (dressing) and follow-up treatment. The 54-bed burns ward is the only such government-run facility in the State. While the number of monthly admissions (during the pandemic) was about 30% of the total monthly admissions during the pre-COVID-19 days, doctors said most of the patients landed in a critical condition. “Despite the pandemic, we functioned as usual with all COVID-19 precautions in place. With just one skin donation, we had to manage using patches of skin from the patients themselves for grafting,” K.T. Ramesh, head of the department of plastic surgery in BMCRI, told The Hindu on Saturday. Pointing out that a majority of cases reported off late were due to accidental burns, Dr. Ramesh, who also heads the skin bank at the hospital, said, “The trend is gradually changing. We are seeing less number of suicidal and homicidal burns now.” ‘Homicide cases turned into accidental cases’ However, Satya K. of Vimochana, a women’s rights organisation that has been co-ordinating with doctors at the burns ward, said most homicidal cases were “turned into” accidental burns cases by the victims’ families. “Although they are registered as accidental burns, most cases are homicidal or suicidal attempts. What is worrisome is the fact that the number of women who suffer burn injuries are as high as 60% and almost all of them are associated with domestic violence. There is a hidden story behind every such case, but families hesitate to file cases. Victims lose family support as well as social security soon after they file a case against the offenders,” she said. Recalling a 21-year-old woman’s case, who was abused and harassed by her in-laws for dowry in Ramamurthynagar and was admitted to the burns ward on October 15, Ms. Satya said, “The woman had suffered 25% burns after her in-laws, along with her husband, allegedly poured kerosene and tried to burn her. There was a delay in filing a case. The family registered a case two days after her admission.” “Apart from dowry and suicide attempts, we have seen acid attacks during the pandemic,” said Donna Fernandes, secretary, Vimochana. Despite this, there has been no movement on the draft policy for prevention and treatment of burns and rehabilitation and empowerment of victims. The draft was jointly formulated by the State Health Department and Vimochana in 2017, she said.  The trend is gradually changing. We are seeing less number of suicidal and homicidal burns now K.T.

20 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Only three periods a day, with no more than 15 students per class||While students of class 10 and II PU will be allowed back on campuses from January 1, they will find the experience different from pre COVID-19 times. To begin with, only three periods a day will be held, and classes will be held for different standards on different days. Each class is to have no more than 15 students. This staggered approach to reopening schools, which the government announced on Saturday after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa held a meeting with Ministers and stakeholders, is based on the recommendations made by the Technical Advisory Committee. Every school will have to have an isolation room for children who have or develop symptoms like cold, cough and fever. Measures taken during SSLC examinations such as thermal screening and sanitisation (water and soap) will be put in place. The Departments of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj and Urban Development will take up sanitisation of classrooms in all government schools. Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar said that a decision on scheduling of board examinations and lessons, if any, are to be omitted and will be taken based on the number of days available to hold classes. “On DD-Chandana, the portions will be completed by this month end, and revision will begin from January,” he said. Vidyagama scheme The Vidyagama scheme under which students were able to come to school in small batches but was put on hold, will be restarted on January 1, but only for students from classes 6 to 9. Classes will be held in schools three days a week. The government had initially announced that it would be applicable to students across all classes, but introduced a cut-off based on the recommendations of the advisory committee. Earlier this week, the TAC had recommended that Vidyagama not be conducted for lower primary students (classes 1 to 5). Students who wish to attend them will have to get a permission letter signed by their parents that also clarifies that their wards do not have any symptoms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-three-periods-a-day-with-no-more-than-15-students-per-class/article33376318.ece

Yediyurappa on Saturday urged the party cadre to visit villages to create awareness on agricultural policies of the government. “The Congress has been trying to cause confusion among farmers even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been inviting farmers to resolve the deadlock. Despite our governments being pro-farmer and policies being in tune to double the farm income, confusion is being created,” he said while addressing the Raitha Morcha executive here on Saturday. “Ghulam Nabi Azad has said the Congress will have to sit in the Opposition for 20 years. This is the situation in the Congress and there is no leadership,” he added.The Chief Minister said, “We have to understand the situation and create awareness about the work done by us.” Justifies changes Justifying the amendments to the APMC Act, he said: “There was a situation in the past when farmers could not sell their produce outside the district. We had to fight against the system. Under the new system, farmers can sell inside or outside the APMC. Why should a farmer seek someone’s approval to sell his produce?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-visit-villages-create-awareness-on-farm-policies/article33376312.ece

20 December 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||These candidates stand out with their oath to stay ‘clean’||Amid news reports on lakhs being spent for the gram panchayat elections and candidates being auctioned for a price, six candidates of Honnetalu village in Thirthahalli taluk have taken an oath not to seek votes by offering money or liquor. Interestingly, all candidates are campaigning together for the elections scheduled for December 22. The candidates — Jayashree Nityanand, Jayaram, Geeta Dinesh Poojari, Sreelatha, Manjunath, and Kiran Raju — took an oath in a temple on Friday in the presence of senior citizens of the village. In the village of 560 votes, people elect for two seats.  Chethana Manassugar, a resident of the village, said the candidates were following the principles of Shantaveri Gopala Gowda, a socialist leader who contested and won from Tirthahalli Assembly constituency without spending money. “The villagers have resolved not to entertain party politics in the gram panchayat elections. All the candidates go door to door together and take a break for lunch in one of the candidate’s place. This might be surprising for people in other places,” she said. Ms. Nityanand said the election would be completed with no expenses. “This system should be an example for others,” she said. If not many, a few candidates have been campaigning similarly in some other parts as well. At Kalkere in Channarayapatna taluk of Hassan, contestant Vasudeva said, “Candidates supported by MLAs and major political parties are spending huge sums of money. But, I will not,” he said. He had worked as Hassan district president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India. Three of his colleagues with the background of working for the Left parties earlier too are contesting in Hassan district with a similar motto. Picture of contrast These examples stand out as special amid many stories of candidates distributing food kits, chicken, nose rings, and other gift items to voters. A resident of Channarayapatna taluk said, “One candidate has ordered nose rings in a jewellery shop in Channarayapatna. These items will be distributed on the eve of the polling day.” Several candidates have offered cash to women’s self-help groups. As the distribution of cash and gifts happen in small circles, officers of the State Election Commission fail to notice them, observed a resident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/these-candidates-stand-out-with-their-oath-to-stay-clean/article33376311.ece

20 December 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||AAP stages protest over hike in APMC cess||Condemning the Karnataka government’s decision to hike the APMC cess to 1% and seeking immediate withdrawal of the order, members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) staged a demonstration in Hubballi on Saturday. Led by AAP Dharwad district unit president Santosh Naragund, the protesters raised slogans and staged a demonstration in front of the Mini-Vidhana Soudha in Hubballi, which houses various government offices, including that of the Hubballi tahsildar. Addressing the protesters, Mr. Naragund said the hike in APMC cess was the impact of the three new farm laws promulgated by the Union government. At a time when the whole nation is opposing the three farm laws and the farmers launched a ‘Delhi Chalo’ seeking repeal of the laws, the Karnataka government has unilaterally hiked APMC cess, he said. ‘Unequal platform’ Mr. Naragund said that while APMC cess/user fee was considered more, those operating outside the market yards had no cess of fee to be paid, creating an unequal platform. Now, with a further increase in the cess/user fee, the government itself is indirectly forcing merchants and farmers to operate outside the market, which will ultimately disrupt the APMC system, he said, adding that this would ultimately lead to no government control over the farm market and injustice being meted out to farmers. A memorandum addressed to the Agriculture Minister was submitted to the taluk officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aap-stages-protest-over-hike-in-apmc-cess/article33376493.ece

Referring to the need for widening the two-lane bypass road between Hubballi and Dharwad into a six-lane road, considering the heavy traffic, Mr. Joshi said that the contentious issues between Nandi Highway Developers, owned by Ashok Kheny, and the government had been resolved now. “Nandi developers will be allowed to collect toll till the end of the tenure of their earlier agreement, and the plan is to begin widening of the road utilising the land acquired for the purpose. A Detailed Project Report is being prepared, and in the first week of January a high-level meeting involving senior officials of various departments concerned will be held to finalise the project,” he said. Mr. Joshi referred to the new projects being executed in Nagpur through the initiative taken by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and asked the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad to arrange a study tour along with Ministers and elected representatives to see whether those projects could be replicated in the region. Mr. Joshi said he would ask the municipal commissioner to study the charcoal unit project of NTPC to address solid waste management issues in the twin cities. He said that as the vaccine for COVID-19 was expected to reach India by the end of January 2021, it had been decided to hold a full-fledged parliamentary session in February. Speaking to presspersons after the function, Mr. Joshi also said that he would comment on the issue of the ‘APMC bandh’ called by APMC merchants only after a thorough look into the issue. Regarding former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s statement that his own partymen were responsible for his defeat in Chamundeshwari constituency, Mr. Joshi said that Mr. Siddaramaiah was defeated as he did not do any work during his tenure as Chief Minister. “His partymen may have been involved, but his defeat was guaranteed. Fortunately, the people of North Karnataka elected him. Otherwise, his political life would have ended,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proposal-on-lalit-kala-akademi-centre-in-hubballi-or-dharwad-approved-joshi/article33376497.ece
20 December 2020||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Kalaburagi officials directed to publicise welfare schemes||Expressing dissatisfaction with the poor implementation of the Special Component Plan (SCP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP), government schemes meant for members of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities respectively, Kalaburagi Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna on Saturday directed officials to come up with innovative programmes to make the intended beneficiaries aware of the benefits of schemes introduced for them. When the officials concerned pleaded helplessness to take the benefits to the doorsteps of the intended beneficiaries, saying that there were not enough people who had applied for the schemes, Ms. Jyothsna directed the officials to organise workshops and camps in such places where the beneficiaries were concentrated and make them aware of the schemes. “The schemes under SCP and TSP planned for 2020-21 should be completed before the end of the financial year. The grants released should not, for any reason, remain unutilised. If you, as you said, have not received enough applications under the schemes, you have failed to make the target group aware of them. You need to organise workshops and camps where the beneficiary groups are concentrated and make them aware of the schemes,” she said at a meeting held to review the implementation of SCP and TSP in the district at district administrative complex in Kalaburagi. When Shivasharanappa, Deputy Director of Women and Child Development, said no progress was made in the implementation of SCP and TSP in his department as the district-level committee had not approved the proposals, Ms. Jyothsna expressed her discontentment and directed officials to complete all the procedures and implement the pending proposals before the end of the second week of January. Noting a lack of coordination among officials in holding the meetings and implementing SCP and TSP, the Deputy Commissioner made it clear that holding meetings from time to time, getting the required approvals from the authorities concerned, and implementing the programmes were the responsibilities ofthe officers. P. Raja, zilla panchayat CEO, told Alla Bhaksh, Joint Director of Social Welfare Department, to submit a report on the progress of civil works taken up under SCP and TSP. Kalaburagi City Municipal Corporation Commissioner Snehal Sudhakar Lokhande and other senior officers were present in the meeting.  The grants released should not, for any reason, remain unutilised. If you, as you said, have not received enough applications under the schemes, you have failed to make the target group aware of them.

20 December 2020||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||‘Institutional deliveries will reduce mortality’||Taking note of maternal and child mortality as a result of deliveries at home instead of hospitals, Bidar Deputy Commissioner Ramachandran R. stressed the need of intensifying the sensitisation of communities on the benefits of institutional delivery. He was speaking at a programme organised by the Department of Health and Family Welfare on the importance of institutional deliveries at the conference hall of his office in Bidar on Saturday. “Non-institutional deliveries conducted at homes in the absence of medical expertise lead to complications and often end in the death of either of the mother or the newborn, or both. People in rural areas, because of backwardness, tend to go for deliveries at home and risk the lives of both mother and child. We, the government servants, especially those working in the field of health and family welfare and women and child development, have more responsibility to sensitise people on the benefits of institutional deliveries. We should ensure that all the deliveries are conducted by medical professionals at healthcare facilities,” Mr. Ramachandran said, appealing to people to cooperate with public servants on the issue and follow the advice given by health staff. “The ASHAs and anganwadi workers have a greater role to play in sensitising people and persuading them to prefer institutional deliveries to home deliveries,” he added. G.V. Reddy, District Health and Family Welfare Officer, said that an incentive of Rs. 700 in rural areas and Rs. 600 in urban areas would be given to those who go for institutional delivery, apart from free healthcare facility for both mother and child.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/institutional-deliveries-will-reduce-mortality/article33376499.ece
20 December 2020||Kalaburagi/Hassan/Yadgir,KARNATAKA||Many gram panchayat seat auctions go under the radar||The Karnataka State Election Commission countermanding elections to four constituencies at Byluru village under Sindigeri Gram Panchayat in Ballari district, where members were elected through “auction”, is perhaps only the tip of the iceberg. Many villagers and leaders admit that this practice is not uncommon. An inquiry has revealed that some prominent people of Byluru had held a meeting on the premises of Eshwara temple and decided to elect 13 members unopposed in return for payment of Rs. 51,20,000 to the village deity. Many instances Days prior to this incident, nine people were arrested for auctioning and choosing four members unopposed at Hosalli (EJ) in Sindhanur taluk. The arrests were made when video clips from the auction went viral on social media. According to sources in the village, resident planned auction to collect Rs. 10 lakh to develop the Devi temple which is in a dilapidated condition. However, villagers The Hindu spoke to sought to know what was “illegal” in what was done. “We just wanted a good building for the temple,” said a villager. At Bilaguli village under Ramanathapura Gram Panchayat in Arkalgud taluk, cases have been registered against 43 people on the charge of taking part in an auction for gram panchayat seats. Three seats of Bilaguli village were allegedly auctioned for an amount ranging from Rs. 3.5 lakh to Rs. 11 lakh at a meeting. A video clip of this meeting too had gone viral. Deputy Commissioner R. Girish said that elections would be held here on December 22 since others had also filed nomination papers for the seats. Asked if the candidates accused of taking part in the auction would be barred from contesting, the he said the allegation had to be proved in court. According to Gururaj Patil, a leader of Grameena Coolikarmikara Sanghatane which has fielded over 2,500 candidates in different gram panchayats across the State, in many cases where people are “elected unopposed” auctions would have taken place though they go under the radar. Auctions take place either inside temples or behind closed doors with limited members, he said. New modus operandi According to Mallesh, an activist from Ballari, some of the temple committees are adopting another method which is essentially an auction but avoids legal complications. In such cases, the village temple committees allows some candidates to file nominations and later asks all others, except the one who gives the highest amount of money to the temple, to withdraw nomination papers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-gram-panchayat-seat-auctions-go-under-the-radar/article33376309.ece

20 December 2020||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Mangalore Bar Association planning to build Vakeel Bhavan at new site||Skewing an earlier proposal to construct ‘Vakeel Bhavan’ on land that is under litigation, Mangalore Bar Association plans to build it on land of the judiciary opposite the District Court Complex. Bar Association president N. Narasimha Hegde and secretary Raghavendra H.V. told The Hindu that they would shortly approach the High Court of Karnataka seeking its concurrence for the allocation of 38 cents of land to the association for building the bhavan. It was in September 2012 that the then BJP government laid the foundation stone for constructing Vakeel Bhavan on 12 cents of land, 100 metres away from the district BJP office. Deputy Chief Minister and the then Public Works Minister C.M. Udasi laid the foundation stone for it. The then High Court judge K. Bhakthavatsala had participated in the function. It was proposed to build a five-storeyed building at a cost of Rs. 6 crore. The construction of the bhavan could not be taken up on the 12 cents of land as it was a Depressed Class manna land. The 12 cents were part of land donated by freedom fighter Kudmul Ranga Rao to the Social Welfare Department for the use of depressed classes. The department brought this to the notice of the then Deputy Commissioner, who ordered restoration of the land to the department. Mr. Hegde said the new land proposed is adjoining the St. Aloysius ITI and is behind the Kudmul Rangarao Pre and Post Matriculation Hostel for Girls from Scheduled Caste communities. Mr. Raghavendra said the bhavan is a long-pending demand of the 2,400-member association. Meanwhile, MLA for Mangaluru City South D.

Mr. Gadkari said while sugar production had been abundant (60 lakh tonnes in storage), there was less demand for it. Global price for sugar was at Rs. 22 a kg and in such a situation sugarcane farmers would be in distress if they continue to grow it. The government was finding alternative ways to utilise sugarcane and extracting ethanol was the best option to give good prices to farmers, Mr. Gadkari said. While a few vehicles running completely on ethanol have been launched in Maharashtra, tractor running completely on biofuel produced from biomass would soon be launched there. There is tremendous potential for using biofuel in Karnataka too where considerable quantity of sugarcane is being grown, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ethanol-production-from-sugarcane-juice-can-help-farmers-gadkari/article33376319.ece

20 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru holidaymakers opt for hill stations, beaches this New Year||Where are holidayers from Mysuru heading to welcome the New Year? If the sources in the tourism sector are to be believed, most are heading to Goa, hill stations like Wayanad, Ooty, and Coorg. People are opting to celebrate quietly with their near and dear ones amidst nature and in isolated tourist destinations. As hotels in Mysuru are not planning New Year’s eve celebrations with curbs imposed by the government for COVID-19 control, tour operators here are getting a lot of enquiries for bookings in hill stations and beach resorts in Goa. Mysuru Travels Association president B.S. Prashanth said inbound tourism had been hit while outbound travel was doing well especially for the year-end vacation and New Year’s eve. Post-lockdown, this is a welcome sign as the people are shedding fear and coming out to travel. Though Mysuru is not getting many tourists, a lot of residents are travelling out. The flight to Goa has come as a big advantage, he said. Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association president C. Narayana Gowda said none of the hotels in Mysuru are planning New Year parties. “The curbs were expected. Moreover, the celebrations used to be organised mostly for the locals even though tourists used to travel to Mysuru to greet the New Year as seen in the past, especially after the fireworks ushered in the New Year at the Mysuru palace.” He said occupancy continues to be poor but has improved compared to the last few months with nearly 25% of occupancy recorded. “Until a vaccine comes, we cannot keep hopes as tourists have become watchful and the curbs are bound to make them even more cautious,” he argued. Last year, the New Year’s eve holiday season had helped revive the tourism industry in Mysuru which was hit by protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Seeing the revival, many hotels offered events for New Year holidayers with music, games, unlimited snacks, and food besides other attractions. They also gave discounts in tariff. The pandemic has put a brake on the celebrations as the authorities are treading a cautious path even though the cases continue to fall. The warning by the health experts of any complacency could be expensive has put the government on the guard and imposed curbs on the revelry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-holidaymakers-opt-for-hill-stations-beaches-this-new-year/article33376717.ece

20 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah holds brainstorming session with Congress leaders||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday held a meeting with party leaders of Mysuru and the neighbouring Chamarajanagar districts to analyse the reasons behind the party’s waning popularity in the region and chalk out a strategy to make the party more acceptable to the people by the next Assembly elections. Sitting MLAs, former MLAs, and party candidates from all 15 Assembly constituencies of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts were part of the brainstorming session at a hotel in the city. Mr. Siddaramaiah reportedly expressed concern over the declining number of seats the Congress was winning in the two districts. Against the 11 seats the party won out of the 15 constituencies in both the districts during the 2008 Assembly elections, the party won 11 in the 2013 Assembly elections before coming down to just 5 during 2018. Mr. Siddaramaiah felt that party workers and leaders had failed to carry out enough publicity of the programmes and schemes of the Congress government among the public. Trivial issues had hogged the limelight in the media at the cost of the pro-people programmes implemented by the Congress government under Mr Siddaramaiah’s leadership, he said. Also, political adversaries, who were jealous of him returning to the Chief Minister’s post, had succeeded in projecting him as “anti-Lingayat” and “anti-Vokkaliga” and the party leaders had failed to check this misinformation campaign. He regretted that his adversaries had even tried to project him as “anti-Dalit” despite his programmes for the community. He rued that the proposal to extend the status of a religion to Lingayats was taken by his government only at the behest Lingayat organisations and Mutt heads and unfortunately, the same organisations and Mutt heads, who had spearheaded the movement, did not back the government’s move. Mr. Siddaramaiah was also disillusioned by the pro-BJP tilt of the media and felt the need to properly educate and create awareness among people about the “omissions and commissions of the BJP government”. He emphasised the need for party leaders to carry out awareness programmes through demonstrations and protests against “anti-people” projects of the BJP government. He called upon all party leaders, who had enjoyed power during the Congress rule, to speak out against the BJP’s “misrule”. Most sitting MLAs, including Anil Chikkamadu from H.D. Kote, Puttaranga Shetty from Chamarajanagar, R. Narendra from Hanur, Yathindra, R. Dhruvanarayan, former MP, H.C.

The JD(S) leader accused the Congress leader of having “internal pacts with rival parties” not only during the 2009–10 Assembly bypolls, but also during the 2013 Assembly elections. “With whom did he have an internal understanding in Koratagere and whose political future did he plunge into darkness,” Mr. Kumaraswamy tweeted, apparently referring the loss of the former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara from the constituency in the 2013 elections. Mr. Kumaraswamy said Mr. Siddaramaiah himself should quit the Congress for alleged anti-party activities during the 2013 elections. Also, he sought to ask why the internal pact as alleged by the Congress leader did not work in Badami Assembly segment from where Mr. Siddaramaiah won in 2018.  Reacting to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s repeated reference to the number of seats the JD(S) had won in comparison to those won by the Congress, Mr. Kumaraswamy challenged the Congress leader, “who is under the shade of a national party”, to build a regional party and win at least 10 seats in his own capacity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kumaraswamy-accuses-siddaramaiah-of-pioneering-internal-pacts-with-rival-parties/article33376313.ece
20 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Restaurants on road to revival||Restaurants in Mysuru are seeing improvement in business though not on the expected lines. Nevertheless, the hotel operators are happy that revival has begun and the industry may see better prospects the next year. Despite lifting of curbs a few months ago, most restaurants were empty with no customers, forcing many to down shutters unable to bear the loss triggered by the lockdown. “The fall in COVID-19 cases has made people confident. This has helped the industry too though families and kids are still not coming like earlier. But, parcel service is doing well. Once schools and colleges reopen, the business may go up,” said Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association president C. Narayana Gowda. Mr. Gowda, also a member of the Mysuru Wedding Hall Owners’ Association, said wedding halls are getting a lot of bookings for next year. After the initial hiccups, the number of weddings in choultries improved, bringing relief to property owners. “Wedding halls are giving discounts keeping in view the unprecedented situation produced by the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/restaurants-on-road-to-revival/article33376719.ece
20 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC to survey, geo-stamp properties in Mysuru||Properties coming under the limits of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) will be surveyed and geo-stamped for better and effective use of online platforms for payment of taxes. The MCC claimed that the exercise of surveying properties is being launched for the first time in the country. In this connection, the MCC has urged the public to cooperate with the staff of the MCC when they visit their properties for the survey, providing details and documents of the respective properties for making the initiative successful. MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said the area of the property, number of floors, and the use of the property would be surveyed and the three sides of the property would be photographed for geo-stamping besides, developing QR code for the properties. The QR code would be pasted on the property for use by owners and the MCC staff. “By issuing a QR code to each property, it becomes easy for the property owners to pay their taxes, including property tax, water bills, trade licence, avail Swach Survekshan info, and other useful services by scanning the code. This will also prevent people from visiting the MCC offices, as it helps them to get information directly from the digital platforms from the comforts of their homes,” the MCC said in a release here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-survey-geo-stamp-properties-in-mysuru/article33376714.ece
20 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||The partymen were from the segment, says Siddaramaiah||The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday sought to clarify that his chances in the 2018 Assembly elections from Chamundeshwari constituency were sabotaged by some partymen from the constituency and not elsewhere. Mr. Siddaramaiah told reporters in Mysuru that he was referring to his rout in the elections from Chamundeshwari in 2018 and hence the partymen also belonged to the same constituency. He sought to set aside speculations that the former Chief Minister was referring to State-level political leaders. He reiterated that there was an internal understanding between the JD(S) and the BJP during the polls. When his attention was drawn to the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy’s query on why the internal pact did not work in Badami, Mr. Siddaramaiah said such an understanding was not there in Badami from where he won. “They did not have such an understanding in all the Assembly constituencies. It was restricted to 29 constituencies,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/the-partymen-were-from-the-segment-says-siddaramaiah/article33376314.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Pandemic may go, but recovery will be halting||If one takes an economist’s lens to look beyond the death and despair of 2020, it is difficult to miss the shape of the letter K. Across the world, this shape has been seen primarily as a pattern of recovery where one section of the economy grows rapidly while the other declines equally sharply. In States like Karnataka, this pattern has already manifested itself in the way the pandemic has played out. The social distancing that the fight against the pandemic demanded, ensured a differential impact on industries. In IT and other industries where the challenge of distance could be overcome with technology, the negative impact was controlled. Some of these industries may have even gained by recognising that they had, out of habit, been bringing workers over great distances when they did not need to. In industries where the challenge of distance could not be overcome, especially manufacturing, the pandemic caused a dramatic decline. Multiple pressures The pressure on manufacturing, and other distance-challenged industries, came from multiple sources. There was the administratively imposed lockdown, which ensured they could not produce. After the lockdown was lifted some of the effects remained. Migrant workers – especially those from distant districts of north and east India – fled Bengaluru. In addition to these supply side constraints, demand also collapsed. With the global economy slipping into negative territory, the demand for export-related goods fell. And the Central government’s stubborn refusal to add more money to the economy, to make up for the loss of jobs, ensured that domestic demand too stagnated. There was some improvement in demand due to festival expenditure in October, but the signs are that the gloom has returned in November. It is tempting to follow the optimistic official view that this is just a bad year, and the economy would return to normal as rapidly as it declined: the much touted V shaped recovery. But for this to happen, several things would have to go perfectly right. Migrant workers would have to return as rapidly as they left. They would have to forget the fact that they were left to their own devices when the lockdown was imposed, often ensuring they walked hundreds of kilometres to reach home. While dire economic necessity in their villages may force some of them to indeed forget the pains of the last year and return to work in distant cities, a significant number of them are unlikely to do so. It would be no surprise if the economies of Bengaluru and Karnataka have to cope with a longer-term constraint on low-skilled labour. At the same time, there are pressures in the opposite direction on relatively higher skilled labour in the manufacturing sector. The constrained local and global demand for manufactured products increases the competition among manufacturing units for a share of the shrinking market. This could lead to pressures on workers in the organised sector to step up productivity per worker. This has already formed the basis for industrial disputes, such as the one in Toyota Kirloskar Motors in Bidadi. Informalisation To make matters more unpredictable, there is the longer-term problem of the informalisation of the formal sector. For some years now, companies have, in an effort to reduce labour costs, outsourced the lower end of their operations, beginning with security. The units to which these activities are outsourced rely on contractors to bring in unskilled labour to carry out these tasks. The extent of this outsourced work has grown, with some units even finding a place for them on the shop floor. The contractors who provide these workers typically source them through informal networks. These networks, with strong rural loyalties overriding commitment to the firm, can be quite volatile in the workplace. And as the manufacturing units simultaneously try various methods to reduce their wage bills, the sense of dissatisfaction can even explode into violence, as happened in the Wistron factory at Narasapura. The pandemic will, hopefully, fade away in the first half of 2021, but the recovery is likely to be more halting. It is possible that a sporadic recovery in manufacturing will be glossed over by a rapid recovery of the information technology industry. But as the recent industrial unrest has shown, an uneven recovery could have less predictable social and economic consequences.

To improve its ranking and performance, #ProjectShivajinagar was launched by MLA Rizwan Arshad and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad on Saturday. Under the project, door-to-door collection of segregated waste will be prioritised, followed by cleaning of critical black spots and beautifying them, apart from various other measures with the objective of making the ward garbage-free. Training given Around 250 volunteers, pourakarmikas, contractors, supervisors and auto drivers have already been trained. Mr. Arshad said that, in association with The Ugly Indian and BBMP, 10 huge black spots had been cleaned. On Saturday, the MLA, along with Mr. Prasad and others, beautified the spaces. “With extra lighting and seating arrangement, we hope to convert these black spots into recreational areas for the local residents,” he said. Mr. Prasad urged the residents to ensure that dumping of garbage does not resume in these spots. The MLA said that they had sought guidance from a non-governmental organisation called Marham, who had taken up a similar initiative in Old Delhi. Division of wards The ward had been divided into 14 blocks, each with 750 houses. Every block will have around 15 volunteers, who will go door-to-door to create awareness among citizens about segregation of waste at source and encourage them to hand over waste only to collection vehicles. They will be warned against dumping waste that could attract a penalty. Dustbins will be distributed to around 10,000 houses in the ward. This activity will be taken up from Monday, he added. Mr. Arshad said that a meeting will be held with all commercial establishments in the ward, from paan shops to high-end shops. “We will share with them the Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) on waste disposal,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shivajinagar-to-improve-waste-management/article33376289.ece

G. Jeevitha, mother of two girl children, said she still curses the fateful day on which she got married to her maternal uncle. “I was constantly harassed for not giving birth to a male child, until one day, in a fit of anger, my husband poured kerosene on me and burnt me in our house at Yelahanka in 2015. During the pandemic, I had to close down the small boutique that I was running,” she said. Saraswathi, 31, mother of two children whose husband poured acid in a fit of rage in March and later ended his life, said it would not have been possible to make ends meet during the past few months if not for help from Vimochana. Two male survivors, who had suffered accidental burns and lost their hands, were provided prosthetics with corporate funding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/survivors-tales/article33376293.ece
20 December 2020||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Thanneermukkom bund shutters closed||The shutters of the Thanneermukkom bund have been closed to prevent intrusion of brackish water into paddy fields. Officials said 89 shutters out of the 90 were lowered by Saturday afternoon. “The motor of one shutter developed a glitch and we are in the process of rectifying it. The shutter will be closed soon,” said an Irrigation Department official. Earlier, District Collector A. Alexander directed the Irrigation Department to down all shutters following a rise in water level in Kuttanad due to high tide. Impact of salinity An increase in salinity in Vembanad Lake will be detrimental to paddy cultivation in Kuttanad. Sowing for the ‘puncha’ season is progressing in Kuttanad and other parts of the district. So far, paddy has been sown in around 20,000 hectares, and another 7,000 hectares is expected to be brought under cultivation. Fishers’ objection Meanwhile, fishermen have come out against the move to close the shutters of the Thanneermukkom bund. On Friday, soon after authorities started to lower the shutters, a group of fishermen staged a protest. They said that the salinity level had not increased in the lake and lowering the shutters would impact the fish wealth. Warning Authorities have warned against any attempts to lift shutters by means of stones or logs of wood in order to facilitate fishing. The Irrigation Department has deployed staff to check the illegal operation of the shutters after closing it down.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thanneermukkom-bund-shutters-closed/article33376649.ece

In Thodupuzha, the local leadership burnt the effigy of Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) secretary Roy K. Paulose and a block president. They alleged that the two had supported rebel candidates and brought about the defeat of UDF candidates in the Thodupuzha municipality. Two rebel candidates won in the municipality, though it should have been an easy win for the UDF candidates, the leaders said. Many places in the district witnessed similar protests on Saturday. Five Kerala Congress (M) Joseph faction candidates too lost in the municipality. Joseph faction district president M.J. Jacob on Saturday said local-level Congress leaders openly worked for the rebel candidates. ‘Monetary benefit’ There were also allegations that three Congress leaders based in the High Range had colluded with the CPI(M) local leadership for monetary benefit to defeat the UDF candidates. A grama panchayat from which the UDF had won by a huge margin in the past two elections was captured by the LDF in the polls. The Congress leaders had received Rs. 25 lakh from the CPI(M) to defeat the UDF candidates there, it was alleged. A complaint in this regard was given to the KPCC, it is learnt. District Congress Committee president Ibrahimkutty Kallar said the Congress leadership would study the reasons for the defeat of the party candidates in its strongholds.

From disinfecting classrooms to the logistics involved in reopening hostels, the authorities have a lot of work to complete before starting classes as per the protocol prescribed by the Health Department. The new normal involves the stringent implementation of directives, including recording the temperature of students and ensuring that teachers and students wear masks and wash their hands frequently. The Higher Education Department has decided to resume classes partially from January 4 onwards. “We are exploring various options on how to resume classes as per the directives issued by the government. Reopening of hostels is a challenge as nearly 75% of the students are from outside districts and States,” said K.N. Madhusoodanan, Vice Chancellor of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat). “The partial reopening will be for the postgraduate departments in the initial phase as the number of students in the undergraduate B.Tech batches is on the higher side. We are looking at organising classes in batches in tune with the recommendations made by the authorities,” he said. Principals of aided colleges admitted that even partial reopening involved health risks as it was a Herculean task to adhere to the pandemic protocol on a daily basis. “The situation can be managed if the classes are being held for the postgraduate batches as the student strength is low compared to the undergraduate batches. This will require additional monitoring and staff deployment to ensure that the guidelines are implemented without fail,” they said. The higher educational institutions will have to step up capacity building of staff, parents and students by disseminating authentic information on the precautions and safety measures to be observed on campuses. Awareness will have to be created on COVID-19 symptoms and the importance of physical distancing, proper wearing of masks, hand sanitisation, and coughing and sneezing etiquette among staff members, students and parents. The stakeholders need to be well-informed about the new standard operating protocols.

Pushpa Latha Santosh in Ramamangalam panchayat in Ernakulam said she had been engaged in cultivating mushrooms even before the lockdown came into effect in March. Activity was restricted, but it was a means of supporting the family, she said on Saturday. Once the lockdown began and economic activities were constrained, she decided to get help from her friends and to make more elaborate arrangements for mushroom cultivation, she said. Sheena Sebastian in Chendamangalam too had been engaged in cultivating mushrooms since 2014. But, it was during the lockdown that she got help from friends and expanded the work. The Kudumbashree Mission has played a big role in helping out with supplies of seeds and supporting the entrepreneurs during the lockdown.

They worked till December 10 and the management issued them termination letters without prior notice or disciplinary action. It is unfair and against labour laws,” said union representatives. The hospital was started in 1970 under the Sree Narayana Trust and SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan is the current chairman of the trust. The INTUC, CITU and UTUC had launched an agitation in front of the hospital demanding reinstatement of the employees. SNDP Yogam Samyukta Samara Samithi had taken out a march and held a dharna on Friday. “If the employees are not reinstated, we will start an indefinite hunger strike in front of Mr. Natesan’s home in Kanichukulangara,” said the samiti officials. Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), who also conducted a protest meet, said a council would be formed to provide the employees political and legal support. “This is a violation of the principles of natural justice as the employees were not even served a notice. The move of the management is illegal and a clear violation of labour laws,” said BDJS general secretary Subhash Vasu.  40 permanent employees dismissed from Sankars Hospital, say unions||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dismissed-staffs-kin-plan-protest-in-front-of-hospital/article33376653.ece

20 December 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Hectic parleys on in Kottayam||Days after the results of the local body polls in Kottayam were announced, uncertainty continues over the formation of administrative council in four out of the six municipalities in Kottayam. While the Left Democratic Front and the United Democratic Front have a clear majority in Pala and Erattupetta respectively, the coalitions could not ensure the minimum numbers in the Kottayam, Changanassery, Vaikom, and Ettumanur municipalities to come into power. While the UDF holds the upper hand in the Vaikom and Ettumanur municipalities, the LDF has a slight lead in the Changanassery and Kottayam municipalities. However, the stance of the Independents is going to be most crucial for the coalitions coming to power in these urban bodies. Power-sharing pact Official sources said that informal consultations were going on in the municipalities to form the new council. For instance, both UDF and LDF have reached out to Bincy Sebastian, an Independent councillor in Kottayam, seeking her support to form the council. In Changanassery, consultations are going on in between the three Independents and the coalitions regarding a power-sharing agreement. The UDF that has won 11 seats in Vaikom requires the support of just one out of the two Independents to capture power. At the same time, the stance of the three Independents in Ettumanur becomes crucial for the UDF and the LDF, which have won 13 and 12 seats respectively. In panchayats Meanwhile, the LDF is expected to come into power in 39 out of the 71 panchayats whereas the UDF has won 20. The NDA has managed to obtain a clear majority in only one panchayat. In the remaining 11 panchayats, where none has a clear majority, Independents will decide the fate of the councils. At the same time, the LDF will be ruling all but one of the 11 block panchayats as well as the Kottayam district panchayat. The new members elected to the local bodies will be sworn in on December 21. While the chairpersons and vice chairpersons of the municipalities will be elected on December 28, the election of presidents and vice presidents of the panchayats will take place on December 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hectic-parleys-on-in-kottayam/article33376657.ece

Achuthan and his son and party’s district vice president Sumesh Achuthan for the failure of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the local body elections of the Chittur Thathamangalam municipality. The UDF lost the municipality to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for the first time in 70 years. Youth Congress leaders from Chittur said here on Friday that it was the wrongdoings of the Achuthans that reflected in the election results. They said that district Congress president V.K. Sreekandan, MP, could not be held responsible for the Chittur Thathamangalam debacle. Youth Congress parliament committee president Shafeek Athikkad, district secretaries N. Jithesh and K. Priya, joint secretary M. Ratheesh Babu, and Perumatty parliament committee president Firos Khan, said the Achuthans had unilaterally decided the candidates by avoiding those with considerable influence among the voters. “Efficient Youth Congress workers and people from the Dalit sections including former chairperson Sheeba were denied a ticket. The UDF system was destroyed by antagonising a prominent partner like the Indian Union Muslim League,” they said. Sumesh Achuthan’s statements against the forward communities too had led to the UDF rout in Chittur, they said, demanding that he be expelled from the party.

20 December 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||RT-PCR test mandatory for pilgrims from Dec. 30||From December 30, only those producing COVID-19 negative certificates will be permitted entry into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. Though an advisory by the State Health Department stipulated production of RT-PCR (reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ) results from December 27 onwards, the authorities have decided to extend its implementation on a directive by the Kerala High Court. While raising the number of permissible daily pilgrims to 5,000, the court also directed that COVID-19 negative certificates be insisted only from December 30. According to officials, the four days when the temple remains closed after the Mandala Puja on December 26 will be used for streamlining the RT-PCR testing facilities for the pilgrims. “They may undergo the test anywhere in Pathanamthitta, Thiruvalla or Chengannur, but will have to plan the onward journey to the Nilackal base camp in a way not to miss the slots booked in the virtual queue,” said an official of the Health Department. Testing centres Except the Regional Public Health Laboratory at Kozhencherry, all other RT-PCR testing units in the district are in the private sector. The rapid antigen testing units at Pampa, Nilackal and the Sannidhanam will continue to operate. “Since the RT-PCR tests can be conducted only in lab settings, the facility will not be available anywhere in the pilgrimage zone. But in case if the validity of a COVID negative certificate breaches its validity of 48 hours, the police may decide on whether to permit the person after conducting an antigen test or not,” the official said. Meanwhile, the authorities have limited to 100 the number of people taking part in the three-day procession carrying the Thiruvabharanam to be adorned on the idol of Lord Ayyappa during the Makaravilakku ceremony. The receptions to be accorded to the procession at various points en route to Pampa have been cancelled, said N. Vasu, president, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB).

Athira Krishnan I. finds it difficult to pinpoint the ‘spark’ that made her dream of establishing an informal school for girls deprived of education in north India. However, her resolve has gained momentum after she earned selection for a six-month-long mentoring programme by the University of Southampton following a thorough screening process. The 22-year-old postgraduate student has also dispelled certain wrong notions on the way. Ms. Krishnan, a second-year MSc Home Science (Extension Education) student of the Government College for Women in Thiruvananthapuram, competed with social entrepreneurship applicants of leading institutions in the country to gain selection for the ‘Spark India’ fellowship programme offered through the university’s Social Impact Lab for Indian students. “It has always been my dream to support girl children who have found it difficult to attend school. Such topics, be it in school lessons, movies such as 3 Idiots or Pasanga , or topics relating to extension education that I have been learning, have inspired me to dream big. A journey we made to Rajasthan and Haryana also taught me much. My proposal encapsulated my ambition and to my fortune, Spark India found it worthwhile,” she said.  Active social worker The college student, who has been an active volunteer with Thiruvananthapuram-based NGO Kanal, hopes to evolve a feasible business model, identify beneficiaries, and have a clear understanding of the challenges that lie ahead of her during the course of the programme. Sithara Balan V., Assistant Professor of Home Science in the Government College for Women, who guided Mr. Krishnan through the selection process, said her feat was uncommon among students of arts and science colleges. “While we hear much about start-ups floated by engineering students getting selected for incubation, the same is not the case in our disciplines. Besides, Athira’s ambition is testimony to the fact that the Home Science course is not merely about cooking and stitching, but serving the community through extension activities too,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-student-bags-coveted-offer/article33376848.ece

The State has recorded 26% deficiency in rainfall during the October 1-December 19 period. And indications are that the relatively dry spell is likely to continue. The extended range forecast for the two weeks ahead, by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday, indicates only “isolated to scattered rainfall” activity over Kerala and Mahe till December 24 and normal rainfall over Kerala and Mahe during the week from December 25-December 31. So far this NE monsoon season, seven Kerala districts each have reported deficient and normal rainfall. The northeast monsoon rainfall had officially commenced over Kerala on October 28, but heavy spells have been few and far between. The Lakshadweep islands, which had reported a large excess of 164% during the 2019 northeast monsoon, have so far recorded a 33% shortfall. Deficient districts Rainfall has been deficient in Thrissur (42%), Thiruvananthapuram (36%), Wayanad (31%), Palakkad (45%), Malappuram (58%), Kollam (31%) and Alappuzha (29%) districts, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

20 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Online classes for newly elected members||The newly elected local body members, many of them fresh out of college, have a set of online classes in store, aimed at easing them into local administration. The Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) has been for the past six months preparing and fine-tuning its online course, a shift necessitated by COVID-19. Till 2015, KILA used to organise classroom sessions for the new members. This process used to take months. Considering the sheer number of members in the local bodies, the institute has now readied more than 50 short video clips of durations ranging from 6 to 18 minutes, touching upon the various aspects of local governance. 70% new members "This time, the estimate is that we have more than 70% of new members across the local bodies. So, there is a dearth of experienced hands within the respective councils to guide them. This increases KILA's responsibility. Sessions are arranged on all basic responsibilities of the members and the new areas to focus on," says Mathew Andrews, Assistant Director, KILA. In addition to the training in the usual domains including public administration and planning, a new focus area will be social justice, to evolve a gender-friendly and old age-friendly local governance model. A separate module on waste management has also been introduced. Big screens will be set up in the respective local bodies for the sessions streamed from KILA. Four-day session They are expected to be held for four days in the first week of January, for 2 hours in the mornings. An hour after each of the two-hour sessions is set aside for clearing the doubts. KILA will have to resource persons in each local body to coordinate the activities. Eight handbooks KILA has prepared eight handbooks of more than 200 pages each on various aspects of local administration. Three of them- on social justice, gender and local governance and waste management - are common for all local bodies, while separate books on public administration, decentralised planning, finance management, social welfare measures and public works have been prepared for the grama panchayats, block panchayats and urban bodies. Additional training in planning and other aspects will be held a few weeks later. As the budgets for the local bodies are expected to be presented earlier in the election year, KILA has to immediately provide training in budget preparation for the finance standing committee members.  Big screens will be set up in the respective local bodies for the sessions streamed from KILA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/online-classes-for-newly-elected-members/article33376619.ece

He cited the examples of badminton player P.V. Sindhu, and said that persistent hard work and determination helped Sindhu to become a world champion in badminton. Deputy Registrar, Cooperative Department, B. Srinivasa Rao said that preparation for civil services should start from graduation. Former principal of SSN college PNVD Mahesh said the idea to establish a civil services academy by S. Narendra at Narsaraopet stemmed from the fact that there was not even a single IAS officer from the town. The town with a history of more than 200 years produced Chief Ministers, Ministers and MPs, but not even a single IAS officer. He said that he hoped that soon an IAS officer would come from the town . P. Srinivas Sai, senior lecturers from SSN College, was present. Mr. Narendra, who started the academy in 2017, said that all the faculty members were from Delhi. The academy offered degree courses in Arts with civil services coaching. About 500 students attended the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hard-work-determination-key-to-cracking-civils/article33376743.ece

Energy conservation should be inculcated into one’s lifestyle for environmental protection as well as for improving the country’s economy, said Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) A.

Every citizen, on their personal front, can contribute their mite in energy efficiency by following simple steps such as purchasing 5-star appliances, adhering to BIS and ECBC codes. As much as 20 to 25% energy can be saved by adopting these measures by following BIS standards, and 35 to 40% with ECBC norms,” he said. “Andhra Pradesh stands first in LED street lighting programme. A.P. is setting new trends in energy efficiency and conservation,” he said.

20 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Yanamala wants Divi’s unit to be shifted from East Godavari||Former Finance Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Saturday urged the government to shift the proposed Divi’s pharma unit from Thondangi mandal near Kakinada in East Godavari district to another location. In a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, Mr. Ramakrishnudu demanded that the cases booked against the local fisherfolk and women protesting against the project be withdrawn immediately. The senior TDP leader blamed the government for ‘destroying peace’ in the region by deploying a large number of police forces and subjecting the locals to intimidation. He condemned in strong terms the cases booked against locals and called it an act of suppression. He said the locals had been resisting the proposed project as it would not only spread pollution but would also deprive them of their livelihoods. He said the affluents released by the chemical unit and bulk drug industries would kill aqua life, destroy hatcheries and deprive the fisherfolk of their livelihood. Mr. Ramakrishnudu accused Mr. Jagan of going back on his word on the issue. “When he was in the Opposition, he had assured that the factory would not be allowed to come up here but he is doing exactly that when he is in power now,” he said. He said Mr. Jagan had unleashed a reign of anarchy and terror in the State where people were robbed of their right to dissent. “The Chief Minister is behaving like an autocrat, subjecting people who questioned the government’s failures to harassment,” he said. Mr. Ramakrishnudu said SC, ST, BC, Muslim minorities and other weaker sections had lost faith in the YSRCP government as they were at the receiving end of growing atrocities by the ruling party ‘goons’. Violence and unrest are ruling the roost and there was growing insecurity among the people of the State, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/yanamala-wants-divis-unit-to-be-shifted-from-east-godavari/article33376758.ece

20 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three capitals our policy decision, says Vijaya Sai||Having three capitals is our party’s policy decision and we have taken this decision after thorough consultation with various experts and stakeholders, said YSR Congress Party Rajya Sabha MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy. He was speaking after a press meet organised for the YSR Cricket Cup, here on Saturday. The decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital, Amaravati the Legislative capital and Kurnool the judicial capital, was much thought over and it was taken to address the issue of decentralised development. However, the MP pointed out that the decision to shift the High Court had to be taken by the Supreme Court and the Union Government. On conducting the local body polls, he said that the decision would be taken when the government deemed it to be fit and the conditions were conducive. Lashing out at TDP leaders, for stating that YSR Congress Party was afraid to face the polls, he said, “We are not not afraid of anyone, but since it is in the court the matter is sub-judice, it is not fair to comment on it.” Coming down heavily on TDP president Chandrababu Naidu, he said that Mr. Naidu had not come out of his back-stabbing politics, even after four decades, and he was on the verge of destroying the party. Naidu faulted Lashing out at Mr. Naidu for his demand for a referendum on the capital issue, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said Mr. Naidu and his MLAs should resign, just as the present Chief Minister of Telangana K. Chandrasekhar Rao had done at the time of Telangana agitation, before demanding for a referendum. He alleged that Mr. Naidu was against development and was trying to politicise the Polavaram issue. Mr. Vijaya Sai said that Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s birthday would be celebrated from December 21 to January 9, and a number of programmes would be held across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-capitals-our-policy-decision-says-vijaya-sai/article33376761.ece

20 December 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Naidu has done injustice to Vizianagaram, Srikakulam’||YSR Congress Party’s Member of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council Penumatsa Suresh Babu on Saturday said that real development of backward districts in the State, such as Vizianagam and Srikakulam, would be possible only by making Visakhapatnam an executive capital of Andhra Pradesh. He alleged that Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu was misleading people of Krishna and Guntur districts on the issue of Amaravati. “Amaravati will continue to remain the legislative capital of the State. Devoting all available financial resources for the development of only the Amaravati region will lead to further injustice to backward regions of North Andhra and Rayalaseema,” Mr. Suresh Babu said. Roundtable “The issue should be debated widely all over the State as it will have an impact on future generations too. That is why I am planning a roundtable with intellectuals, retired officials and policymakers. A study by an independent agency would reveal the fact that the progress of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam would be possible only by making Visakhapatnam an executive capital of the State,” said Mr. Suresh Babu, who is the son of former Minister and Protem Speaker of erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh Penumatsa Sambasiva Raju. “Visakhapatnam is an international city. More progress is going to be witnessed between the city and Bhogapuram where an international airport will come up very soon. A.P. can attract huge investments for North Andhra region and other areas only if there is clarity over the executive capital. Mr. Naidu used to highlight the plus points of Visakhapatnam while holding meetings with entrepreneurs to attract more investments. But now, he is holding protests in Amaravati region while doing maximum injustice to North Andhra region,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-has-done-injustice-to-vizianagaram-srikakulam/article33376809.ece

20 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||114 cadets from Air Force Academy aim for the sky||The centenary graduation parade of 114 cadets, including 21 women, at Air Force Academy (AFA), Dundigal, was suffused with blue as whirring sounds of acrobatic exercises of aircraft in the sky set a perfect example matching the spirits with soaring ambitions. A traditional flypast by the teams of SU-30 aircraft, the famous Surya Kiran, Sarang helicopter, Pilatus PC-7 trainer, a fly past by formations of PC-7, Kiran and Hawk aircraft, set the tone for the graduating officers to be in command of the future. This 206th batch, which happens to be the 100th to pass out from the portals of AFA, was second in succession without having the presence of parents, family members and friends, due to COVID restrictions. Parents and well-wishers were glued to their TV and mobile screens watching their dear ones graduate after undergoing rigorous training in the last one year. Though the biannual emotional rapture was missing, the newly-inducted officers were seen sharing their memorable moments over video calls to their friends and parents. Some of the sporty and jubilant young officers were seen exchanging signs of bond and happiness, while others were embracing as a mark of profound achievement. ‘Wings’ and ‘Brevets’ Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reviewed the parade and formally conferred the ‘President’s Commission’ on cadets who had completed their basic and professional training. Mr. Singh also presented ‘Wings’ and ‘Brevets’ to flight cadets who successfully completed flying and navigation training, respectively. He also awarded ‘Wings’ to officers of the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard and officers from friendly foreign countries of Vietnam, Nigeria and Sri Lanka on successful completion of their flying training. Flying Officer Ashish Khattri from the flying branch was awarded the Chief of Air Staff Sword and President’s Plaque for standing first in overall merit in pilot course, while Flying Officers Yash Kshirsagar was awarded President’s Plaque for being first in overall order of merit in the Ground Duty branch. The President’s Plaque was also awarded to Flying Officer Shivam Tyagi for being first in overall order of merit in the Navigation course. Asking the newly-commissioned officers to keep themselves updated about military strategy and technology and also focus on Artificial Intelligence, Mr. Singh said that they should not only be soldiers but also scholars for future warfare and betterment. Further, he said that India in future may face challenges not only across the physical borders, but also space and cyber domains. “For which, you need to be prepared and update yourself constantly,” the Minister said. He said that in the past few years, the government has taken several important measures to empower and promote indigenisation in the armed forces. “On the one hand, we have inducted and operationalised Light Combat Aircraft ‘Tejas’, while on the other, the fifth generation multi-role fighter aircraft, ‘Rafale’, has been included in the IAF’s fleet. It builds confidence in our forces,” Mr. Singh said. He said that air defence and maritime command are at an advanced stage of consideration. “Several reforms, including increase in Foreign Direct Investment limit in the defence sector, new policy on defence manufacturing and corporatisation of ordnance factories, are taken into consideration,” the Minister added. The grand ceremony on Saturday culminated with the officers marching out in two columns to the traditional notes of ‘Auld Lang Syne’, the poignant farewell tune played by Armed Forces of the world bidding adieu to colleagues and comrades, acknowledging the first salute given to them by their immediate juniors.  Several reforms, including increase in FDI limit in the defence sector, new policy on defence manufacturing and corporatisation of ordnance factories, are taken into consideration.

The state-of-the-art HWT test facility is a pressure vacuum driven enclosed free jet facility having nozzle exit diameter of one metre and will simulate Mach No. 5 to 12 speeds. (Mach represents the multiplication factor to the speed of sound.) India is the third country after the United States and Russia to have such a large facility in terms of size and operating capability. It is an indigenous development and an outcome of synergistic partnership with local industries. The facility has the capability to simulate hypersonic flow over a wide spectrum and will play a major role in the realisation of highly complex futuristic aerospace and defence systems. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy laid a foundation stone for the Explosive Test Facility for Propellant and Explosive Systems. This facility will be used for design validation and evaluation of missile sub-systems under different environmental conditions. Both ministers accompanied by Department of Defence R&D secretary and Chairman of DRDO Dr. G .Satheesh Reddy visited the facilities and interacted with lab directors, programme directors and other scientists, where they were briefed about the ongoing projects and technological developments. The DRDO labs showcased various indigenously developed systems and technologies in wide ranging areas, including missiles, avionics systems, advanced materials, electronic warfare, quantum key distribution technology, directed energy weapons, Gallium Arsenide and Gallium Nitride technology capabilities. Two anti-drone technologies were demonstrated during the visit - DRDO Young Scientists’ Laboratory - Asymmetric Technologies (DYSL-AT) and Research Centre Imarat (RCI) demonstrated the drone and innovative anti-drone technologies. It has multiple capabilities including neutralising ground targets and anti-drone applications to counter stationery as well as high-speed moving targets. Key features of the weapon system include secure communication link, effective recoil management system, high firing angular resolution and vision-based target detection and tracking. Later, addressing DRDO fraternity, he applauded the technological achievements and the recent successful missions by various clusters of DRDO like the Hypersonic Technology Demonstration Vehicle (HSTDV), Anti-Radiation Missile (RUDRAM), Quick Reaction Surface to Air Missile (QRSAM), Supersonic Missile Assisted Release Torpedo (SMART) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology in the last six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hypersonic-wind-tunnel-test-facility-inaugurated-at-drdo/article33376525.ece

With no clarity as to when and how the fresh assessments will be taken up, officials say that property owners will now have to apply online, through the Registrations Department. The abrupt full stop to manual assessments has caught GHMC officials too off the guard, who attribute the decision to Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar. Mr.Somesh Kumar is said to have issued instructions in a recent review meeting, for cessation of property tax assessments through the GHMC. “We also came to know of the decision very late, and are clueless about the future process for assessments. We just sought time till the pending applications with the deputy commissioners are disposed of, which has been completed on Saturday,” an official informed. The Registrations website does not display any option for Property Tax assessment as of now. While the applicants may be given the option for self-assessment, all the applications will arrive to the respective log-ins of the deputy commissioners, who will have to clear them within 48 hours, the official informed. Details of the existing property assessments too will be eventually given to the Registration Department, for collection of tax. Revenue from Property Tax collection, however, will accrue to the GHMC as usual.  We also came to know of the decision very late, and are clueless about the future process for assessments.

20 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘First deposit Rs. 15 lakh in all accounts’||Sangareddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy has asked BJP Telangana president Bandi Sanjay to explain the reasons behind the unfulfilled promises of the Modi government, including the Rs. 15 lakh that he promised to deposit in each account before the 2014 elections. “Stop provoking people raking up religious issues and start focussing on the promised Rs. 15 lakh and petrol for Rs. 40 a litre,” he said at a press conference here. “Why are you shying away from discussing public issues,” he asked. Mr. Jagga Reddy reminded that BJP rode to power with Rs. 15 lakh for each account promise and also reducing fuel prices at Rs. 40 a litre. There is no sign of Rs. 15 lakh even after six years while the petrol rates have shot up to Rs. 87 per litre despite the crude oil prices at their lowest in the world market. Cooking gas prices have doubled but the BJP leaders conveniently ignore such pressing issues, he said and advised Mr. Sanjay to address these issues first. “Talk to the Prime Minister and ensure the Rs. 15 lakh is deposited in every account of Telangana people.” The Congress MLA recalled how the BJP leaders used to occupy roads whenever prices of petrol and diesel went up by 25 paisa or 50 paisa during the UPA rule and asked why are they not coming onto the roads now. The picture of Union Minister Smriti Irani fighting on the streets for reducing the cylinder price is still fresh in the minds of people, Mr. Jagga Reddy said. Politics is not just about religion and temples but also about people, he said and wanted to know whether poor people were on the agenda of Mr. Sanjay or not. Comparing promises made by the BJP to an old movie of actor Chiranjeevi ‘Punnami Nagu’, he said just like in that popular movie people were being fed with religious hatred slowly ensuring that they forget the real issues haunting the country and the poor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-asked-to-keep-its-promise-of-depositing-rs-15-lakh-in-all-accounts/article33376550.ece

The leaders accompanied by Congress leaders from the old city and enquired with the locals. A statement said the locals informed the Congress delegation that the lands were saved all these days due to relentless efforts of Congress leaders Panduranga Rao and Ashok.

Mr. Niranjan said the PCC leaders submitted a memorandum to the Endowments Department in March 2020 to safeguard the temple lands but they failed to act. He said the police too favoured the land grabbers and in fact provided security to them.

Acting on specific intelligence that the psychotropic substances are concealed in a foreign bound parcel through courier consisting of food items consigned to Sydney, the consignment was intercepted. “After carefully removing the packets containing the food items which were used to cover the contraband, a false bottom was noticed.

According to officials, Methamphetamine is a powerful and highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system of a human body. Also known as meth, blue, ice, and crystal, among many other terms, the drug can be smoked, snorted, injected, or ingested orally,” they said. When it is used, a chemical called dopamine floods the parts of the human brain that regulates feelings of ecstasy. In the long term, Methamphetamine use can cause irreversible harmful effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, damaged blood vessels in the brain that can cause strokes or an irregular heartbeat that can in turn cause cardiovascular collapse or death. Liver, kidneys and lungs will also get damaged, the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/drugs-worth-rs-3-cr-being-smuggled-to-australia-seized/article33376554.ece

20 December 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Treasure hunt bid creates flutter||An alleged attempt by a villager of Remidicherla in Yerrupalem mandal to unearth “hidden treasure” by digging a 15-foot-deep pit on the premises of his house under the influence of a “tantrik” created a flutter in the village on Friday night. A 16-year-old girl of the same village, who is believed to be a relative of the villager, has gone missing from her home on Friday giving rise to suspicion about the alleged involvement of the latter behind her sudden disappearance. According to sources, some villagers grew suspicious about the movement of “strangers” at the house of one G Narasimha Rao in the last two days. They alerted the local police, who in turn inspected the house of Narasimha Rao and found a large pit dug up inside the house. Tantric rituals A group of local villagers reportedly claimed that they heard the sounds of some “tantric rituals” allegedly associated with “occult practices” from the house during the nightime in the last two days. Meanwhile, the mysterious disappearance of a minor girl from the village, coinciding with the incident, sparked doubts of “foul play.” Acting on a complaint lodged by the mother of the missing girl, the Yerrupalem police launched a search to trace the girl. A note purportedly written by the girl expressing her desire to pursue higher education was found at her home, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/treasure-hunt-bid-creates-flutter/article33376559.ece

Romil Ramgarhia, who was BARC’s COO between 2014 and 2020, was arrested on Thursday by Mumbai Crime Branch and was produced before additional chief judicial magistrate S.B. Bhajipale on Saturday at the end of his initial custody. The probe agency sought further remand saying it had retrieved certain chats from his phone for which he needed to be questioned, and to probe if there was a connection between BARC and Republic TV, one of the channels accused of manipulating the TRP mechanism. Republic TV, however, has refuted all allegations. Mr. Ramgarhia’s laywer, Aditya Mithe, told court his client had no role in the case but had been arrested on “flimsy grounds”. The court however accepted the police plea and extended his custody till Monday. Mr. Ramgarhia is the 14th person to be arrested in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/trp-scam-custody-of-ex-coo-of-ratings-agency-extended/article33376640.ece

20 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Four die in roof collapse||Four labourers died and two others were injured after the roof of a factory collapsed in west Delhi’s Khayala on Saturday. The building housed a motor-winding unit. The fire department received a call about the incident around 10 a.m., following which four fire tenders were rushed to the spot, said Delhi Fire Service (DFS) director Atul Garg. Six labourers, including three women, were inside the factory when the roof collapsed, said Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Subodh Kumar. The workers were rescued by a team of officials and rushed to the two nearest hospitals: Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and Guru Gobind Singh Hospital, Mr. Kumar said. Four of the six labourers were declared brought dead while two others are undergoing treatment. The deceased have been identified as Saina (36), Guddi (45), Twinkle (25) and Ramesh (35). Locals were the first responders along with the workers on the other floors of the factory. A loud sound rang across the building when tons of metal items fell on the people working on the top floor. “Power supply to the entire building tripped and a cloud of dust covered the entire area. By the time rescue teams arrived, we had pulled out two women from the debris. Their faces were badly crushed due to heavy metal items falling on them... their faces were beyond recognition,” said Ramesh Sahu, a local. The factory belongs to Mahendra pal, a resident of Uttam Nagar. Lucky break Aslam, a factory worker, said he was lucky as he had arrived 15 minutes late to work. “I was at the factory gate when I heard screams from the top floor. I, along with other workers, rushed to help and rescued several people. As per the duty chart, I had to report to the top floor where the accident happened,” said Aslam. Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Patel Nagar has been informed for further legal proceedings and legal action is being taken, Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/four-die-in-roof-collapse/article33376424.ece
20 December 2020||New Delhi,||Pollution project: problems outscore solutions||A committee appointed by the Delhi government has raised red flags over a study commissioned to find sources of air pollution on a real-time basis. The study — being done for the government by the University of Washington in St. Louis — is “likely to be cancelled”, multiple officials told The Hindu . The “real-time source appropriation study of air pollution in Delhi” was approved by the Delhi government in 2018. It was a flagship project of the government to find a solution to air pollution by pinpointing pollution sources on a real-time basis. “A three-member committee was formed to look into a report of the study submitted to the government by the university, and the panel raised multiple shortcomings. Later, the university accepted most of the issues raised by the committee and the study is likely to be cancelled,” a Delhi government official said. Environment Minister Gopal Rai is expected to take a final call on how to go forward with the study later this week. The causes of pollution in the city has been a matter of constant debate between the city and the Central government. The Delhi government has been stating that stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is the major cause of air pollution in the city during winters, while the Centre has many times pointed out that local pollutants in the city are also a main reason. Total cost of Rs. 1.2 crore The study, with a total cost of Rs. 1.2 crore, was allotted to the university on “nomination basis” without an open tender and was supposed to be completed by March 2020. When contacted, the Delhi government spokesperson and the Minister’s office did not comment on the “problems” with the study. The committee flagged multiple issues with the study, including methodology used and data generated. This was conveyed to the team from the university in October and again in November, said officials. The team finally replied in December. “After looking into the reply, the panel said in its report that the study has many limitations and it has not helped in finding sources of pollution on a real-time basis,” a second official said.  The government has paid about Rs. 50 lakh for the study till now, which is the first of two installments for the study, officials said, adding that if the study is now done by another agency, they can use a lot of the data generated from the current study. On July 3, 2018, the Delhi Cabinet headed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved a proposal for the study. Delhi’s AQI The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was 290 (poor) on Saturday and is likely to be in the “poor to very poor” category on Sunday. “The cold day conditions are forecast to intensify and surface winds are forecast to slow down. AQI is forecast to stay in the poor to very poor category on Sunday and may deteriorate further from Monday,” said monitoring agency SAFAR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pollution-project-problems-outscore-solutions/article33376421.ece

20 December 2020||Staff Reporter Mumbai,||Shiv Sena appreciates Sonia letter, dismisses talks of rift||A day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray reminding him about the commitment of the coalition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on the Common Minimum Program (CMP), the Shiv Sena discarded any possibility of a rift and clarified that the letter would bring forth matters which were on the backtrack due to pandemic. Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said on Saturday that Ms. Gandhi is a chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and has also contributed to the formation of the State government. “The CMP is the agenda of the MVA government for the welfare of the downtrodden section of the society. The government and our Chief Minister are working towards that direction. The pandemic may have put certain issues on backburner. But we are coming back on track and now focusing on the CMP,” said Mr. Raut. He discarded the allegations of opposition BJP that the Sena is under pressure from the Congress which is playing pressure politics through this letter of Ms Gandhi. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president and state’s Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said that the letter from Ms. Gandhi is not of resentment but about continuing the process of dialogue. “Our stand has always been in favour of upliftment of poor and deprived sections of the society. The letter was part of a dialogue on how such measures can be taken. It has nothing to do about resentment,” he said. Ms Gandhi’s letter focused on the CMP for betterment of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities, and said, “The budget allocation for the development of SC/ST communities should be proportionate to their share in the population. Focus may be on the schemes that benefit SC/ST communities to bring them on par with rest of the society at the earliest.”  Budget cuts Meanwhile, Nawab Malik, minister and NCP spokesperson, said Ms. Gandhi’s letter may have been prompted by complaints about budget cuts by her party’s ministers. Speaking to a news channel, he said, the MVA alliance is committed to CMP but there have been budget cuts for some development works due to the pandemic, he said. “Some Congress leaders may have complained about this,” he said adding that Mr. Thorat and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan, who are part of the MVA coordination committee, are aware of the situation.

20 December 2020||Washington,||Biden transition team slams Pentagon||The incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden warned on Friday of risks to national security after it said the Pentagon suddenly halted briefings for the transition team. Yohannes Abraham, executive director for the Biden transition team, said he was “concerned to learn this week about an abrupt halt in the already limited cooperation there”. President Donald Trump, who is refusing to acknowledge his election loss to Mr. Biden, until recently held back from allowing government agencies to cooperate with Mr. Biden’s team, as is the custom. On Friday, Mr. Trump’s acting Defense Secretary, Chris Miller, said in a statement that the two sides had a “mutually agreed upon holiday pause” on briefings with military officials. Mr. Abraham said this was not true. “There was no mutually agreed upon holiday break,” he told reporters, warning that “a failure to work together could have consequences well beyond” Mr. Biden’s inauguration in January. The latest stumble in what is traditionally a carefully choreographed handover of power between outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations comes as Washington reels from a massive, possibly Russian state cyberattack. “There’s no time to spare,” Mr. Abraham said.  Mr. Abraham said the attack was of “great concern” and that under Mr. Biden cyberattacks will meet a response inflicting “substantial cost”. According to Mr. Abraham, the team has “hope and expectation” that the Pentagon briefings will recommence “immediately”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-transition-team-slams-pentagon/article33376161.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||China appoints new General for India border command||China has appointed a new People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General to head its Western Theatre Command, its biggest military command which is responsible for the India border, replacing a long-standing General who oversaw a tumultuous four-year period that saw renewed border tensions. The announcement was made on Friday when President Xi Jinping, also chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), presented four military and armed police officers “with certificates of order promoting them to the rank of General”, the State media reported. Among the four were Zhang Xudong, who was named as Commander of the Western Theatre Command. The three other promoted officers were Guo Puxiao, Political Commissar of the CMC Logistic Support Department, Li Wei, Political Commissar of the PLA’s Strategic Support Force which is responsible for cyber warfare, and Wang Chunning, Commander of the People’s Armed Police Force (PAPF), which is tasked with internal security. General Zhang has no prior experience in the Western Theatre, Tibet or Xinjiang, having spent much of his career in the northeastern Shenyang Military Region (now under the Northern Theatre Command) and since 2017 as the Commander of the Central Theatre Command, which is responsible for the security of the capital, Beijing. General Zhang replaces the influential General Zhao Zongqi, who turned 65 this year, and has been in charge of the Western Theatre Command since its formation in February 2016, when Mr. Xi put in place sweeping reforms consolidating the seven military regions into five commands, with the aim of increasing jointness and integration between different services. General Zhao was in charge during the 2017 Doklam crisis, when ties between India and China were strained during a 72-day stand-off on the plateau near the India-Bhutan-China trjunction, and also during the current tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) which erupted in early May when the PLA carried out multiple transgressions across the LAC. In October 2017, he was appointed to the Communist Party’s 19th Central Committee. The PLA’s unprecedented mobilisation this summer and transgressions in multiple areas has led Indian officials to believe that the moves were authorised at least at the level of General Zhao, or even higher at the CMC. The appointment marks the second major change in the leadership of the Western Theatre Command since this year’s crisis began. In June, the PLA appointed Lieutenant-General Xu Qiling as the new Commander of the PLA Western Theatre Command Ground Force, or Army, serving under General Zhao who oversaw all forces there, including the Ground Force or Army, Air Force, Rocket Force and the Strategic Support Force. LAC talks India and China are set to soon have the ninth round of talks at the Corps Commander level to take forward disengagement on the LAC, with the next round of talks agreed to on Friday as officials from both sides met under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs. At the last round of talks on November 6, both sides continued discussing modalities to finalise a plan for phased disengagement. One of the sticking points is China’s insistence on India first withdrawing from the strategic heights south of Pangong Lake before it does so on the north bank. Officials told The Hindu following the last round that proposals were under discussion and would be taken up at the ninth round, and “once agreed upon it will be done in multiple phases with on the ground verification after each step”. North of the lake, China has moved troops up to Finger 4 since May and has prevented India from reaching Finger 8. Under the first phase of disengagement, both sides had moved back in the Galwan Valley and in the Gogra-Hot Springs area. The situation at Pangong Lake remains unresolved, as also in the Depsang plains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-appoints-new-general-for-india-border-command/article33376171.ece
20 December 2020||Brasţlia,||‘Jabs can turn people into crocodiles’||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has launched an attack on coronavirus vaccines, even suggesting that the one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech could turn people into crocodiles or bearded ladies. The far-right leader has been sceptical of the coronavirus since it first emerged late last year, branding it “a little flu”. This week, he insisted he would not be vaccinated, even while launching the country’s mass innoculation programme. “In the Pfizer contract it’s very clear: ‘We’re not responsible for any side effects.’ If you turn into a crocodile, it’s your problem,” Mr. Bolsonaro said on Thursday. That vaccine has been undergoing tests in Brazil for weeks and is already being used in the United States and Britain. “If you become superhuman, if a woman starts to grow a beard or if a man starts to speak with an effeminate voice, they will not have anything to do with it,” he said, referring to the drug manufacturers. When launching the immunisation campaign on Wednesday, Mr. Bolsonaro also said it would be free but not compulsory. But the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the vaccine was obligatory, although could not be “forced” on people. That means authorities can fine people for not being vaccinated and ban them from certain public spaces, but not force them to take it. Brazil has recorded more than 7.1 million cases and almost 1,85,000 deaths from COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/vaccine-can-turn-people-into-crocodiles/article33376162.ece
20 December 2020||Washington,||U.S. approves Moderna as second vaccine||The U.S. on Friday authorised Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, as the country grapples with a brutal winter surge that is killing over 2,500 people a day. It is the second vaccine to be deployed by the country after the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. “With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic,” Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn said. President Donald Trump — who has frequently taken credit for the fast pace of vaccine development — tweeted: “Congratulations, the Moderna vaccine is now available!” Joe Biden, who defeated Mr. Trump in the presidential elections, hailed the news as “another milestone” in the fight against the virus.

20 December 2020||Washington,||U.S. planning to close its last two consulates in Russia||Donald Trump’s outgoing administration is planning to close the two remaining U.S. consulates in Russia, the State Department confirmed on Saturday, as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office amid high tensions with Moscow. The U.S. will close its consulate in the far eastern city of Vladivostok and suspend operations at its post in Yekaterinburg, a Department spokesperson said. The decision followed consultation with Ambassador John Sullivan and was part of “efforts to ensure the safe and secure operation of the U.S. diplomatic mission in the Russian Federation”, the spokesperson said. CNN reported that a State Department letter to Congress this month said the move was a response to “ongoing staffing challenges for the U.S. Mission in Russia in the wake of the 2017 Russian-imposed personnel cap on the U.S. Mission”. Ten diplomats assigned to the consulates will reportedly be relocated to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, while 33 local staff will lose their jobs. The Department said the “resulting realignment of personnel at U.S. Embassy Moscow will allow us to advance our foreign policy interests in Russia in the most effective and safe manner possible”. “No action related to the Russian consulates in the U.S. is planned,” the spokesperson added. The closures would leave the Embassy as the last U.S. diplomatic mission in Russia. Moscow ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg in March 2018 during a diplomatic spat sparked by the poisoning of Sergei Skripal on British soil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-planning-to-close-its-last-two-consulates-in-russia/article33376168.ece

20 December 2020||Islamabad,||Imran denies interference by Pakistan Army||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has asserted that the Army is a state institution which works under him, amid Opposition’s allegations of the powerful military establishment’s interference in the country’s politics and elections. Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a 11-party opposition alliance, has been holding massive rallies since its inception in September to seek Mr. Khan’s ouster and press the military to stop interfering in politics. The PDM has been accusing the Pakistan Army of installing “puppet” Prime Minister Khan through a manipulated election in 2018. The Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country’s politics. Mr. Khan also denies that the army helped him win the election in 2018. According to the ‘Lahore Declaration’ signed by the Opposition parties on Monday, the military establishment had stolen the people’s mandate in the 2018 election and imposed a “hybrid and inefficient” government on the masses. In an interview to SAMAA TV on Friday, 68-year-old Mr. Khan rebutted accusations that he does not have any real authority and said that the Pakistan Army is a state institution, which works under him. On Opposition’s claims that the government wouldn’t hold if not for the support from the powerful establishment, he said he is the country’s democratically elected Prime Minister and so the institutions back him.   Mr. Khan said the Opposition does not want to hold talks with the government and is instead pressuring the Army to send a democratic government packing. This can be called treason, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/imran-denies-interference-by-pakistan-army/article33376173.ece

This was a very significant effort, and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-behind-cyberattack/article33376169.ece

20 December 2020||Brussels,||Impasse over post-Brexit deal continues||European Union and British negotiators pressed on with talks on Saturday with no sign of them breaking an impasse over post-Brexit fishing rights in time to save a trade deal. Fishing is now the main obstacle to any pact that could be in place on January 1 to prevent an economic jolt on both sides of the Channel as Britain leaves the single market. “It remains very blocked,” one EU diplomat said. Another said Brussels had made Britain its last offer on fishing access and it was down now to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to decide whether he wants a deal. “If Britain doesn’t accept the latest EU offer of it will be a 'no deal' over fish,” he warned. The EU’s pointman in the talks, Michel Barnier, has proposed EU fishermen giving up nearly a quarter of the value of the fish they currently catch in the UK waters. Britain is understood to be holding out for getting back much more than half. The U.K. has suggested this compromise last for three years before it is renegotiated, whereas Europe is holding out for seven.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/impasse-over-post-brexit-deal-continues/article33376164.ece

20 December 2020||COIMBATORE,||Cotton textile exports likely to reach last year’s level||Cotton textile exports for the year 2020-2021 are expected to match last year’s level. “Overall cotton textile and clothing exports are showing signs of positive growth,” said Siddhartha Rajagopal, executive director of the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council. “The industry hopes for 8% to 10% growth in the coming months to complete the financial year with exports at the same level as last year,” Mr. Rajagopal added. He pointed out that according to the quick estimates released by the Ministry of Commerce, cotton textile exports grew 8.54% to $869 million in November from a year earlier. Readymade garment exports stood at $1,043 million compared with $1,056 million last November. Exports of cotton textiles in the April-November period declined 12.7 %. Mr. Rajagopal attributed this to the slump in exports in April and May this year. Cotton home-made textiles and yarn were doing well, he said. A. Sakthivel, chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, said garment exports in September and October were good and in November, it was almost equal to the level seen in the year earlier period. “We are getting orders and hope for growth in exports in the coming months.

20 December 2020||Chennai,||Wheels India expects exports to lead growth recovery next fiscal, says MD||Wheels India is cautiously optimistic about the coming year, with export growth expected to outpace domestic demand, said Managing Director Srivats Ram. “In the coming year, growth in exports would probably be more than what our growth in the domestic market is,” Mr. Ram said in an interview. “We are seeing some amount of pickup from customers in the current period which seems to give some kind of progressive direction going into the next year,” he added. The manufacturer of steel wheels and other auto and industrial components is also looking to expand and deepen ties with existing customers as well as potentially tap new engagement opportunities with European and U.S. firms aiming to de-risk their supply chains by exploring new tie-ups with Indian suppliers and contract manufacturers. Fair amount of optimism “There is a fair amount of optimism for Indian companies,” Mr. Ram said, citing conversations that peers in the industry were reporting with companies looking to establish alternative supply locations in a bid to de-risk their exposure to China. “Existing customers trying to diversify their sourcing footprint, and also some new customers looking at other country sourcing in earnestness, is happening,” he observed. Wheels India, he added, “has found ways in which we can meet our customer requirements both overseas and in India and in some cases, we work with other suppliers so that may be jointly we can meet those requirements.” Noting that the agriculture sector's upbeat performance this year had given a significant fillip to tractor sales, Mr. Ram said outlook for the segment was upbeat. “The tractor segment has had a fairly rollicking year in terms of volumes,” he said, adding that manufacturers were seeing no let-up in demand. “Normally, this is the off season for the agri sector... but this year, tractor manufacturers are not letting off as they say they do not have stock left and are looking to build stock.” The momentum, he added, was expected to carry into the next year as well. Mr. Ram also flagged rising commodity costs, especially of inputs such as steel, as a key concern. “I hope that the inflation in commodity prices, at least in India, does not run away from us, for then it would affect our competitiveness, especially at a time when there are opportunities,” he said. “Opportunities are dependent on economics. While the global opportunities are on the rise, commodity prices are a concern. If you don’t hit the price points, then you don’t get the business.” Overall, given the pandemic’s impact, the outlook was hopeful, Mr. Ram said. “Globally, at least from an industrial perspective, the worst seems to be over,” the TVS group scion remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wheels-india-expects-exports-to-lead-growth-recovery-next-fiscal-says-md/article33376146.ece

20 December 2020||Adelaide,||Indian batting plumbs new depths as Aussie pacers wreak havoc||Josh Hazlewood took five for eight as Australia romped to an emphatic victory by eight wickets in the first Test at Adelaide Oval on Saturday after skittling India for 36, its lowest innings score in its 88 years of Test cricket. Hazlewood and Pat Cummins (four for 21) turned a tight Test on its head in a devastating spell of pace bowling to open the third day of the day-night Test, ripping through the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up in less than two hours. Australia chased down the victory target of 90 for the loss of Matthew Wade (33) and Marnus Labuschagne (6) to take a 1-0 lead in the series with Tests to come in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. “We were expecting a real dogfight right to the end, late day four, maybe day five in this test,” said Australia skipper Tim Paine, who was voted man-of-the-match. “Again, it shows the talent we have with the ball and when our boys execute and there's anything in the wicket, that's what can happen.” The margin of victory will be a hefty blow to India’s morale as well as its hopes of repeating a maiden Test series triumph in Australia two years ago. The tourists had resumed on 9 for one looking to build on the first innings lead of 62 they held overnight after two well-balanced days of the pink ball contest. Devastating spell Hazlewood and Cummins ripped up that script in short order with some quite brilliant bowling — in one spell they took four wickets for no runs over 29 balls. None of India’s batsmen, including the prolific Virat Kohli, managed to get into double figures in the second innings — only the second time that has happened to any team in a Test match. The innings score was the lowest in 544 Tests going back to 1932 — worse than its previous low of 42 against England at Lords in 1974 — and only two countries have managed fewer runs in the long history of the format. Mohammed Shami is likely to miss the rest of the Test series after taking a blow to the forearm from a short Cummins delivery which brought an end to India’s dismal innings when he retired hurt. The tourists will already be without Kohli for the rest of the series as the skipper returns home for the birth of his first child.  Getting bowled out for 36 is going to leave a few headaches here and there and their best batter (Virat) is leaving as well, it is going to leave a bit of whole Josh Hazlewood||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-batting-plumbs-new-depths-as-aussie-pacers-wreak-havoc/article33376302.ece

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||We lacked intent to take the game forward, says Kohli||India skipper Virat Kohli bemoaned the lack of intent from the batsmen, as the visiting team slumped to its lowest score in Test history in Adelaide on Saturday. “We just did not have enough intent with the plan of taking the game forward. Things happened so quickly, one could not make sense of it,” said Kohli after the loss. When asked if the lengths the Australian pacers bowled did not allow the batsmen to be more positive, Kohli said, “No, they bowled similar lengths to the first innings, but we just were better [then] in terms of handling it and having a plan around it. A bit of a lead can always be tricky. As a batting unit, you get into a head-space where you feel, ‘We are just 50-60 ahead and we don’t want to lose wickets so that the opposition comes into the game’. We should have seen where the game needs to go [rather] than where it has come to till now. The way we batted made them look more potent than they were,” he explained.  Kohli also added that the team should have done a better job on the second day, especially with its catching, as it let Australia, which was on 111 for seven at one stage, off the hook. “It was very crucial and they can be very costly. It is something we realised in a harsh way, what the repercussions of not taking those opportunities can and will be in Test cricket. “It would have been a boosting factor if we had a lead of a few more runs because then you are already over 100. With a decent batting effort, the opposition starts panicking as the target is surely moving up,” Kohli added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-lacked-intent-to-take-the-game-forward-says-kohli/article33376306.ece

20 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ankita moves to arrest momentum shift||Progress is often made only when you get out of the comfort zone. Ankita Raina stepped out of her strong side, the ad court, while partnering Ekaterine Gorgodze of Georgia, and made a successful finish to the season. “It is always a great feeling to end the year on a winning note,” said the 27-year-old Ankita, who shot to her career-best doubles rank of 117, following the doubles title in the $100,000 women’s tennis event in Dubai. “I was playing with Ekaterine for the first time, and we were the last team to get in,” recalled Ankita. “Since she is a lefty and was comfortable from her forehand side, I switched from my stronger side on the backhand. It was really fun playing with her, and am looking forward to partner her again,” said Ankita. Even though she had won the doubles title in a $125,000 event with Karman Kaur Thandi in 2018, Ankita pointed out that the tournament in Dubai had a field quality of a $250,000 WTA event. “More than the result, I am happy about the quality of performance, and the way I played. “In singles, I played a really good match against Siniakova, but a couple of errors changed the course of the match. I took the positives and it boosted my confidence,” said Ankita, who lost in three sets to Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic. Ranked 180 in singles, Ankita said she was trying to sharpen her singles game to get into the top-100 and play Grand Slam main draws. Now, the focus will be on training well, for the Australian Open qualifiers in Dubai, and boarding the flight to Melbourne.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ankita-moves-to-arrest-momentum-shift/article33376393.ece

20 December 2020||KOLKATA,||Real Kashmir triumphs||Real Kashmir FC thwarted local outfit George Telegraph’s spirited challenge to record a 2-1 victory and become the first team from Jammu and Kashmir to win the 123-year-old IFA Shield on Saturday. Lukman Adefemi and Mason Robertson scored a goal apiece for the I-League team in either half of the final, while substitute Goutam Das netted one for the Calcutta Football League side. Kashmir team applied pressure from the beginning but found solid resistance from the Telegraph defence before breaking through. Kashmir took the lead in the 36th minute as Lukman converted a penalty with a low right-footer after Robertson was pushed inside the Telegraph area. Telegraph, which wasted a superb chance in the first half, drew parity shortly after resumption. Twenty-year-old right-winger Goutam capitalised on a beautiful pass into the box. Kashmir regained its lead around the hour mark. Robertson jumped to head in a free-kick from about 35 yards. Telegraph missed a golden opportunity to equalise in the 80th minute as Tanmoy Ghosh’s penalty was blocked by Kashmir goalkeeper Mithun Samanta. Samanta, who had made another brilliant save in the first half, was declared the Man-of-the-Match.  The result:   Real Kashmir 2 (Lukman 36-pen, Robertson 59) bt George Telegraph 1 (Goutam 48).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/real-kashmir-triumphs/article33376298.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Crivellaro, Rahim end CFC’s winless run||Chennaiyin FC ended its four-match winless streak with a 2-1 victory over FC Goa at the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday. The two-time champion scored early in each half through skipper Rafael Crivellaro and Rahim Ali, its second win of the season helping it move level with Goa on eight points. CFC struck in the fifth minute, thanks to Crivellaro. His brilliant corner-kick curled into the far post, giving the Goa goalkeeper and defenders no chance. However, Goa hit back immediately. Jorge Mendoza equalised, slotting home after combining well with Alexander Romario. The rest of the first half saw CFC's season-long trouble play out yet again as it missed chances aplenty. In the 26th minute, Lallianzuala Chhangte failed to convert a sitter as he shot over the top of an open net from less than 10 yards out. Crivellaro, who fluffed a chance early on in the second half, made amends with an assist in the 53rd minute. Crivellaro collected a pass from Sylvestr, charged into the box and needled a pass through to Rahim Ali, who tapped home.  The result: FC Goa 1 (Mendoza 9) lost to Chennaiyin FC 2 (Crivellaro 5, Rahim 53).

20 December 2020||Chennai,||From ‘Summer of 42’ to the nightmare in daylight||From one carnage to another, one dubious milestone to another. For India, ‘Summer of 42’ in 1974 at Lord’s has now been replaced, ignominiously, by 36 at Adelaide. Indian cricket, after an abysmal batting display, now has a new low in Tests. A nightmare in daylight as the batsmen appeared and disappeared. Alarming spiral A combination of some spice in the pitch, falling defensive standards, Australians’ pace, fuller length, accuracy, and movement that saw batsmen caught at the crease or being drawn to nick, caused the alarming downward spiral. Like it was in 1974. India, led by Ajit Wadekar, was expected to repeat the Test series-winning heroics of ‘71 in England. Yet, the tour of ’74, was a disaster. There were talks of frictions in the side, one of the cricketers came under the radar for alleged shoplifting and the side appeared disjointed on the field. India lost the first Test at Old Trafford by 113 runs, and then came the second at Lord’s. India’s famous spin trio ineffective, England amassed 629. India replied with 302 and then followed on. England’s high-quality swing bowlers Geoff Arnold, Chris Old and Mike Hendrick zeroed in. Arnold trapped Sunil Gavaskar leg-before and had Gundappa Viswanath caught behind (for five each), and India collapsed. The batsmen’s stays at the crease alarmingly brief — only Eknath Solkar (18 not out with an ironical six) reached double figures — India lasted just 17 overs. Old scalped five and Arnold four. From Lord’s to Adelaide, from one sorry mess to another.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/from-summer-of-42-to-the-nightmare-in-daylight/article33376340.ece

20 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram:,||KFA takes over the reins of TDFA||Kerala Football Association (KFA) has taken over the reins of Thiruvananthapuram District Football Association (TDFA) after a no-confidence motion against the office-bearers of the district body was passed at a special general body meeting on Friday. Sixteen clubs affiliated to TDFA brought a no-confidence motion against TDFA office-bearers in July. The clubs were unhappy with the non-democratic functioning of the association, headed by M. Rajeev Kumar (president) and Joseph (secretary). The meeting was held under the auspices of the KFA, District Olympic Association and District Sports Council. The non-confidence motion was put to vote and passed with a 26-18 verdict after which the KFA dismissed the current set of officials who had assumed power in 2019. An Ad-hoc committee appointed by the KFA will now look after the functioning of the TDFA till new office-bearers are elected.   Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said Kerala Police will soon constitute a women’s football team. He was speaking at the passing out parade of sports quota recruits on Saturday. Mr. Vijayan said the State Government had recruited 137 sportspersons to Kerala Police during the last four years. He added the government was thinking of recruiting shooters and hockey players to Kerala Police and that he had given instructions to the State police chief to form a special package to attract talented sportspersons to the force. Cash awards and trophies to medal winners of the all-India Police athletics meet, which was held in Haryana, were also distributed.     George Zachariah Cheeran, former patron of Kerala Basketball Association and former chairman of its selection committee, passed away at Kunnamkulam on Saturday. He was 92. Cheeran had had contributed immensely to the promotion of basketball in Kerala. According to the KBA, he was the first captain of Thrissur’s Sree Kerala Varma College and was also a former secretary of the Thrissur District Basketball Association. He was also instrumental in promoting many all-India tournaments in Thrissur and Kunnamkulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kfa-takes-over-the-reins-of-tdfa/article33376607.ece

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Sunny days ahead||It might be raining in a few parts of the country, but in the musical world of Pune-based guitarist Vinay Kaushal... everything is sunny. His pop-inspired single, titled ‘Is It Sunny?’, released recently. “I’ve always been a fan of pop, both old and new. There is a certain charm to interesting pop music which I hear in so many of my favourites like Norah Jones and Tom Misch. Being able to blend pop with just a little bit of jazz was exciting and somehow didn’t feel alien to me,” says the musician. The music video features Nupur Chaudhuri, India’s first pole athlete to win a medal in an international pole championship. “Pole dancing has had negative connotations attached to it for a long time,” explains Vinay, whose 2021 line-up includes a guitar-centric instrumental track. “What people don’t realise is the amount of work that goes into it and how physically strong you have to be. To be graceful while on the pole means that the dancer has to really work with their mind and body in unison.” ‘Is it Sunny?’ revolves around themes of love and longing. “The core idea came from the acoustic guitar progression I happened to stumble upon while playing one morning,” he recalls. “I instantly heard the chords reflect a very melancholic mood. Something about being locked down and not getting to meet your loved ones furthered the mood.” His wife, Uma, pitched in with the words and within a few hours, a musical idea was on. But there was still a challenge at hand because Vinay is usually more inclined towards writing instrumental music. “I’ve rarely had to compose a vocal melody myself,” admits Vinay, whose début album ‘Naked on a Train’ in 2018 drew heavily from jazz, funk and Indian classical. “Composing the vocal melody was like a Eureka moment.” He subsequently roped in Shakthisree Gopalan, a singer he greatly admires. “I was sure that no other singer would do the song justice,” he says, recalling how he was introduced to her music through a track titled ‘Voices’, and has been smitten ever since. Shakthi too describes her association with the track as “nothing short of a love affair”. “My journey with this has been like falling head over heels from the very first listen, to discovering so many layers as I deep-dived into it,” she says. Shakthi and Vinay have met only once four years ago, and have collaborated for the first time on this track. “It is incredible how we live in a time when it is possible to create music and work on projects together without ever having to actually meet in person,” says Shakthi, whose voice has been heard in recent Tamil films like Ganesapuram , Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban and Dharala Prabhu . “I recorded the vocals at my home studio. Every time I sang, it felt like I discovered a new layer or a new door to express and explore the vocals with.” ‘Is it Sunny?’ is streaming on YouTube and other music platforms   My journey with this track has been like falling head over heels from the very first listen, to discovering its many layers Shakthisree Gopalan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sunny-days-ahead/article33376624.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Creative content is at its best now’||Anupriya Goenka, reprising the role of Nikhat Hussain in the second season of Criminal Justice , says viewers will get to see a lot of women in this season. Anupriya plays the role of a lawyer assisting Pankaj Tripathi in a murder case. The makers of the show have gone on record saying the series is an adaptation of a British whodunnit by Peter Moffat. Talking about Nikhat in Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors, Anupriya says, “Taking the legacy of the series forward in itself means a lot, because the same hasn’t been done with the British counterpart. Nikhat is a lot more nuanced this season. The makers have fleshed the character out well giving the audience a lot more to look forward to.” Viewers will be surprised with how the second season unfolds, the 33-year-old says. “It has a lot to do with social responsibility and not just look at creating big numbers in terms of episodes. Audience should look beyond the plot, then they will witness how each character is well spun and has a story to tell. My role grows as a personality. I am very excited that I got to work with Dipti [Naval] ma’am.” Anupriya, who has appeared in films such as War , Padmaavat and Tiger Zinda Hai , adds the script for the series had a lot to do with output from every actor. On her organic career growth, she observes that OTT platforms allow more formats and stories to be explored. “While cinema can never lose its charm, OTTs are steadily becoming the medium that allows many angles to be explored. Thanks to the digital platforms, works of talented directors and actors are appreciated hugely. Creative content is at its best at the moment,” she says, adding that such opportunities also make it possible for actors like herself to work with names like Dipti Naval, Mita Vashisht and Ashish Vidyarthi, whom she calls “schools of acting”.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Big questions, small answers||At the thought of a Disney original for India, Peter Docter beams, “You know what? Why not? There is a world of storytelling to tap into when it comes to India. And working with Indian filmmakers is a great opportunity too.” But for now, the Academy Award-winner — known for Inside Out , Up and Coco — and Pixar’s Chief Creative Officer, is directing Disney Pixar’s Soul , which stars Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. The long-awaited film has seen numerous release delays owing to the pandemic, but Disney Pixar powered through, and now the world can look forward to a December 25 release on Disney+ Hotstar. The film follows Joe Gardner (Foxx) who is transported to another realm. He is assigned a ‘soul’ whom he must help find their true passion. What follows is a sweet narration of how the choices of people are shaped by the world around them, and even vice versa. In an interview with Docter, producer Dana Murray, and co-director Kemp Powers, the trio chat about how the film is set apart from other Disney-Pixar films. Powers laughs, “This film is not made in chronological order.” And Docter tacks on cheekily, “Maybe if we were smarter…” Murray remarks that they had started working on Soul four years ago. As time went on, the film’s team became more collectively determined with the messaging of the film, which led to richer design and storytelling. In the last six months of production, the film comprised the workforce of over 350 people. All eyes on Tina While Joe Gardner remains the central character for Soul , 22 (Fey) is sure to grab audiences’ hearts and minds. Docter shares, “22 showed up, as a character, before Joe. Her original name was actually 107, 306, 822. But we dropped the other digits to just make her 22. From the beginning, the concept was a soul that looks down to earth and goes ‘that looks like a lot of suffering and disappointment, I don’t want to have anything to do with that!’ We actually read it in Tina’s autobiography, where she would make fun of students walking past her in high school. 22 always has some funny, snarky thing to say!” Murray says that in the beginning, production considered having a kid voice for 22, which would make sense given the character’s sweet and diminutive size. But it didn’t work out, thanks to 22’s sarcasm. Hence, Tina Fey fit the bill. “22 is a petulant adult, who has had a few thousand years to fill her war chest with knowledge from teachers she has sent packing,” concludes Powers.  Soul , Docter admits, taps into the more philosophical parts of a being, appealing to children and young adults. “It asks ‘why do we have a personality right when we are born?’ Such big questions were at the heart of it. When Powers came on, he helped develop the character of Joe and the specificity of the scenes,” he recalls. The process has been “messy” but in a good way, he adds. In fact, one can argue that Soul , Inside Out and Up have cleverly made up a trilogy of ‘heart, mind and soul’ for audiences. “I’m so grateful that people care and think we are smart to the point of [making theories online about Disney Pixar films we have worked on],” he quips. “We are just trying to make one movie at a time!”  Soul is a landmark for Docter, whose approach to storytelling is an “exploration and meditation” of each core idea. This is also his first film to be shot in 2.39:1 aspect ratio, unlike the usual 1.85:1 taller scope. “ Inside Out was, in a way, boot camp for Soul . This was a tough one. The challenges lay in doing things with abstract characters and worlds. Wait till the next one!”  Inside Outwas, in a way, boot camp forSoul.This was a tough one!Peter Docterdirector||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/big-questions-small-answers/article33376627.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||A window to the future||Theatre and performing artistes who have been struggling against odds due to the pandemic have a little something to cheer about. Nine Rasa, to be launched by actor Shreyas Talpade in January 2021, provides them an opportunity to reach out to audiences across the world. Having begun his journey with theatre, Shreyas considers the digital platform his payback time. The idea stemmed from his interactions with friends from the community. “We got many calls informing us of the tough financial situation being faced by the artistes and technicians dependent on theatre. I realised if people cannot go to the theatre, it’s time to bring the theatre to them. Going digital is the future, so why not let the shows go online,” he says. Once the idea was conceptualised, Shreyas’ team conducted a survey with over 200 people in the age group of 18-65 across the country, and almost 65% of the respondents said they either want to watch, know and want to be a part of theatre. Quoting actor Naseeruddin Shah, he says, “There are pros and cons of a digital medium. We cannot replicate the thrill of performing in front of a live audience but as Naseerji said, ‘Online theatre is an inescapable part of the future’. So, why not embrace it?” Humans experience nine emotions or the ‘navarasas’ as defined in Indian aesthetics, hence the name ‘Nine Rasa’. It will be launched with Hindi, English, Marathi and Gujarati content in the first phase with full-length plays, monologues, skits, stand-up, poetry and story readings. Going forward, the platform will include Tamil, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Kashmiri and Parsi. Shreyas admits nothing of this scale can happen without help from friends. While it is a self-funded venture, he has a team of professionals — writer and director Sanjay Upadhyay, ex-programming head at Colours TV channel, award-winning director Ashwini Choudhary, renowned theatre director Vijay Kenkre, Sushant Shelar, Kritika Seth and the tech team handled by Rajesh Kutty and Eitan Koter helping him. The team put together 100 hours of content to go live with the launch. Shreyas elaborates: “This is original content and was exquisitely shot and planned over the past few months following all safety measures and social distancing rules. Renowned artists and actors including débutants showcase their talent here. The shows in multiple genres have a variety and entertainment value.” Besides this new venture, Shreyas’ two-and-half-year-old daughter, Aadya, kept the actor busy during the past few months. He is thankful he could spend that time with her and experience simple pleasures of watching her grow. He also looks forward to the release of his new projects — Love You Shankar directed by Rajiv S. Ruia, a Marathi film tentatively titled Mrigtrishna with Mahesh Manjrekar, and a web series Jo Hukum Mere Aaka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-window-to-the-future/article33376629.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Digital immigrants adopt technology to run group and RWA||The pandemic led many people to put a toe, if not a firm foot, out of their comfort zone. Notably, even seniors could not hide themselves behind easy labels like “digital immigrants”. Many of the seniors in our group were initiated into the digital world, usually with their Gen Z grandchildren playing tech-high priests. With people having to shelter in place almost completely in the first few months, life was largely lived on the virtual highway, and this necessitated the use of digital payment apps. Many domestic help had enabled digital payment in their mobiles, and their salaries had to be transferred online. Seniors who adapted well to these changes would be benefited beyond the pandemic. In truth, it would benefit everyone, not just seniors, if services could be accessed on their doorsteps. We would like to see some of these services continue to be delivered in this manner. At the height of the pandemic, even government agencies, including the Horticulture Department, organised special vegetable sales. That is one thing I would like to see happen well beyond this crisis. I guess it would be a help if ration articles were home-delivered for seniors. Being virtual helped seniors cope with emotional isolation. 1. East Coast Beach Walkers’ Association consists largely of seniors, and we made sure to keep our WhatsApp groups buzzing with conversations to beat the lockdown blues. Members of our Association are accustomed to morning and evening walks in the beach, which also double as social meet-ups. The alternative — walking and exercising alone at home — cannot quite make up for the loss of this routine. So, we decided to over-communicate on these online groups to keep our spirits up. 2. We did not miss out on big celebrations, especially members' birthdays. On their birthday, a special card with their photo would be created and circulated in our online groups so that they are wished on their big day. 3. We conducted fund-raisers to help the conservancy workers tasked with cleaning the beach. In particular, we organised a donation collection drive to help some of them facing medical emergencies. 4. The group's executive committee got savvy with online meetings. For many, these online meetings were a first, as they are retirees for long and strangers to digital conferences. Neighbourhood group There are many initiatives undertaken at the neighbourhood level which I hope to see being sustained. 1. Members of our neighbourhood online groups — Srinivasapuram Residents Welfare Association — ran a series “Know Your Colony Doctors”. There are around 20 doctors in our colony, and started sharing how they are making a difference in this crisis through their work. 2. We honoured and rewarded conservancy workers who kept our neighbourhood spic and span. 3. We organised vegetable sales in our colony with the assistance of the Agri Horticultural Society. 4. We organised sanitation drives by talking to the Corporation 5. Thefts are the last thing anyone would want during a pandemic. So, to avoid untoward incidents, we were monitoring CCTV footage regularly. 6. The pandemic has created greater hygiene consciousness among residents, and this included getting dog owners to carry a poop scoop while out walking their dogs.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you tried catching up with these passage migrants?||Dark-sided Flycatcher In November 2011, senior member of Madras NaturalistsSociety (MNS) Ramanan Padmanabhan posted a picture of a flycatcher that had invited itself to his home at Shastri Nagar. It resembled the Asian Brown Flycatcher closely, but was smaller and darker on the sides. After studying the other photos of the bird clicked by Ramanan, Gnanaskandan Kesavabharathi, an eBird reviewer and also an MNS member, sensed it could be a Dark-sided Flycatcher. The bird reportedly hanging around the greenery near Ramanan's home the next day, Gnanaskandan decided to make a visit. “There were heavy showers before the day of the sighting, on that day as well as the next. The bird was probably staying back due to the rains,” recalls Gnanaskandan. Around evening time, when there was let-up in the rain, Gnanaskandan, a resident of Besant Nagarat at that time, headed to another MNS member Sivakumar Hariharan's home, and the two were were on their way to Raman’s. “I knew that if I let go of this opportunity, I would have to go only to the Himalayas to see the Dark-sided Flycatcher," says Gnanaskandan.” After the vistiors had waited for a while, the bird showed up on a tree next to Raman’s balcony. “We took pictures and jotted down notes. Ramanan used to see the Asian Brown Flycatcher there before; and so we had to be certain it was the same bird he had seen the day before. After thorough examination, we documented that it as a Dark-sided Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan continues: “The pointers were very clear: It was smaller than the Asian Brown Flycatcher; had darker flanks; a very pointed beak; a conspicuous narrow white line running in the centre of the belly; and the primary projection was larger than that of the Asian Brown Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan points out that in November 2015 in Avadi, there was a sighting of the Dark-sided Flycatcher by Pronoy Baidya, "a Goan birder who was living in Chennai at that time”. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, an eBird reviewer, documented the sighting of a juvenile Dark-Sided Flycatcher that was on its return migration, in March 2016, at Guindy National Park (GNP). Tickell's Blue Flycatcher “Tickell's Blue Flycatcher isa passage migrant in Chennai and its sightings are highly localised,” says Vikas. The bird seems to choose GNP and IIT-M probably because these places are heavily wooded, for its short sojourn, as records of its sighting have emerged from there. Vikas had seen a Tickell’s Blue Flycatcher at Guindy National Park in November 2016, and interestingly made another sighting bang on “the other side of the wall on the IIT-M campus”. Other birders, Mahathi Narayanaswamy in particular, have sighted this scarce passage migrant at IIT-M.“It is a forest bird, and likes a particularly secluded area,” points out Vikas. “It is also drawn to patches with streams. In western ghats, I have seen this bird around streams.”   Ultramarine Flycatcher During a one-year study of butterflies and birds at Guindy National Park, Vikas made quite a numer of flycatcher records, and that includes the rare sighting in March 2016 of a male Ultramarine Flycatcher, a scarce passage migrant in Chennai, and a winter visitor to the Nilgiris. There are flycatchers with generous “coats” of blue, but there is an ethereal quality to this male Ultramarine Flycather’s blue. It has lapis lazuli written all over it. The white brow and the white patch running from throat to the belly accentuates the blueness. Birder Rama Neelamengam was one of the other birders on the spot when Vikas saw the Ultramarine Flycatcher at GNP. “I was there, but I missed seeing it,” says Rama, Given the rarity and beauty of the Ultramarine Flycatcher, she knows that would have made one unforgettable lifer, had she seen the bird that day. Rusty-tailed Flycatcher Vikas would choose tocautiously place the Rusty-tailed Flycatcher “somewhere between a scarce winter visitor and a passage migrant”, though he sees enough reason to name it a passage migrant, straightaway. “I had seen it on December 31, 2016 and in the previous season, in late April 2016. If a bird is seen at the beginning and end of a migratory season, they are likely a passage migrant for that area. The fact that I saw the bird on a December 31, well into a migration season makes me think that all may not be just passing through Chennai, and a few may be lingering on a bit longer than you would expect a passage migrant to,” explains Vikas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/have-you-tried-catching-up-with-these-passage-migrants/article33375913.ece

The exact spot of the right turn is the point where a lane off the arterial road leads to the Oonamanchery crusher unit. Here, motorcyclists are known to take a sudden right turn to enter this lane. I request the State Highways Department to block the right turn to prevent any more accidents. Instead, by totally blocking this right turn, motorcyclists proceeding towards the crusher unit should be made to take a U-turn at the intersection of Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road and Anna Main Road in Vengambakkam.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Let us together make Chennai the ‘herbal-garden city of India’||‘Immunity-boosting food’ has been a recurrent theme, its importance being particularly emphasised in the first few months of the pandemic. So, in many households, grandma recipes — think nellikai thuvaiyal , sundakkai kozhambu , vaeppam poo rasam, and chukka malli kappi — have made a comeback. Fear of COVID-19 would have led us to add medicinal herbs to our regular preparations, and the challenge lies in continuing this practice in a post-pandemic world. So, I propose the idea of having community herbal-gardens across Chennai. The idea may appear far-fetched, but I believe it is worth acting upon. In a metropolis, space is a challenge, and therefore all available options should be explored. Local bodies should be open to having spaces in public parks earmarked for growing medicinal herbs. There are regular reports from various parts of Chennai of how vacant lands are misused for dumping garbage. Why can’t neighbours seek the owner’s permission to grow useful plants there? There is the possibility that some would accede to the request. There would be no harm in having Thippili , Seenthil Kodi, Karumulli , Kostam , Nilavembu , Karpooravalli and Adathoda as our ‘neighbours’. With their medicinal properties, they would protect us. (J.

From seeing how shops in my locality — Jawahar Nagar in Perambur (West) — operated during the months when lockdowns were intense, I am certain there must be renewed trust in them. If a particular item was out of stock, they would promise to get it for the customer the next day, and would invariably deliver on this promise. This personal touch was quite refreshing. One kirana store accepted digital payment, which came a pleasant surprise to me, as I had seen them doing only cash transactions before the pandemic. They made the quick and timely switch. Again, going by my experience, the kirana stores in my neighbourhood that I visited, strictly abided by the rules laid by the Government, including maintaining social distancing, and opening and closing timings (which was the case in the early months of the lockdown). At some stores, I noticed that shoppers entering without a mask were politely asked to leave the shop. Like me, many others have started patronising these kirana stores more than ever before; and I hope they keep on adopting technology. Maintaining digital shelf for customers to order from, and offering many digital payment options would help these neighbourhood stores capitalise on these gains. (S.

We are making this request — which may sound a bit out of the ordinary — factoring in certain realities. The team of the Public Workd Department (PWD) that is in charge of the lake is at Padappai, and whenever residents of Velachery want to make any representation regarding the lake to PWD officials in person, they are up against the factors of time and quick accessibility. Secondly, when it comes to monsoon-preparedness, the PWD team at Padappai with many other lakes to attend to, will not accord priority to the Velachery lake. Besides, time and again, we have noticed that it is Greater Chennai Corporation which cleans the lake before the onset of the monsoon to prevent flooding of surrounding localities.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||RWAs will never be the same again||Every crisis will offer lessons that require those involved to follow a corrective course, one that would take many days and sometimes even years to complete. As far as residential welfare associations (RWAs) are concerned, these are the lessons to be imbibed:  Promote diversity  The management committee of an RWA should constitute a group that has the right mix of the young and the old, and is also characterised by gender diversity. Senior-citizens will be at home most of the time, but during the pandemic, movement restriction was imposed on senior citizens. During the time of pandemic and natural disasters, youngsters will be needed in large numbers. So, it is important to have youngsters in good numbers in the management committee of a RWA, as they can adapt to evolving situations more easily.  Make a directory  The COVID-19 crisis has taught the community to be self-reliant, and this means have a directory for your community, with residents professions clearly spelt out. The health care professionals and staff have been of immense help to the community during this crisis. With such a directory Even, other maintenance work, and help to senior-citizens could be extended, if you have a directory.  Become tech-savvy  The pandemic has underlined how digital technology can be leveraged make the regular management-committee meetings more focused and more meaningful.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Let us make PHCs great again||Primary Health Centres (PHCs) can be called community hospitals as they are designed to serve local populations. If PHCs are well-equipped, adequately-staffed and run efficiently, and also hugely patronised by the local population, they will provide a picture of a community’s health profile, so that necessary and timely interventions can be effected. In a crisis like COVID-19, this function of PHCs cannot be overemphasised. Well-equipped and optimally-functioning PHCs can ease the burden on the next tier in a government’s multi-tiered health care system — namely, district-level hospitals. Again, this is an opportunity missed, and also a lesson we ought to learn from the COVID-19 crisis. In the current scheme of things, PHCs do not enjoy the importance they deserve. Well over a year ago, in Chitlapakkam, government establishments, which include a police station, a post office, an office of Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation, a PHC and the office of Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat, had to be shifted to facilitate the restoration of Chitlapakkam lake. Alternative premises were identified for all these government establishments, except for the PHC. My sister and I, and a few of my cousins were born at this PHC in Chitlapakkam. Until 2000, this PHC enjoyed considerable patronage from the local community. Over the last two decades, it has been losing its importance among the local community. However, I take my --- year-old son to the Chitlapakkam PHC to administer immunisation vaccines, much against my family will. Many a time, I have approached the authorities concerned and urged them to improve facilities at the Chitlapakkam PHC, to no avail. Now, the PHC is not even functioning. When I bring up this issue, I am told residents shoud make use of Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) at Haridhasapuram in Pallavaram Municipality, which is 5 km from Chitlapakkam. Going to Haridhasapuram PHC is not the solution. Our rightful PHC should be reestablished in our locality at the earliest. Residents welfare associations’ should reiterate their right to having a fully-functional and well-equipped PHC in their neighbourhoods. But most RWAs are strident in their demand for parks and playgrounds, but silent about PHCs. And then, RWAs draw authorities’ attention to battered roads and sewage overflows, but fail to even notice deficiencies in the PHCs in their localities.

Our interactions with GCC engineers in charge of roads, street lights, and solid waste management are particularly frequent. But we would hardly interact with GCC’s health officials. During 2020 though, we are in a position to appreciate the role played by public health officials, as they and members of our RWA have been working together over the last 10 month, due to the pandemic. Our collaboration included camps being organised to identify those with COVID-19, and awareness campaigns promoting prevention measures. The pandemic has taught us that behaviours at the community level impact individuals’ health. To illustrate, we clearly notice that spitting in public places, and even more specifically to the current context, not wearing a mask can have implications for the health of those around. Therefore, even in a post-pandemic world, residents welfare associations should work towards ensuring hygiene and cleanliness in public places through awareness and sensitisation. (S.

They wait for Ganthimathi ‘amma’, who brings freshly prepared food for them daily, consisting of cooked rice and chicken. Ganthimathi ‘amma’, as she is known, was born in 1947. She started feeding the strays around 25 years ago. This was the time when rice was first distributed by the state government at Rs. 3.45 per kg. What began as a small exercise has now grown to support around 20 dogs. These canines are now being fed every day. She is assisted by her domestic help who does the cooking and a boy who fetches a fixed quantity of chicken every day. She sources the rice on her ownand also gets it from her relatives and friends. She also feeds fish to around 15 cats every morning. She recognises all the dogs and cats and they repay the warmth. She feeds them using eight steel bowls. She was tested positive for COVID-19 and had to be hospitalised and later be in home quarantine. However, the feeding of dogs continued with help of her family and acquaintances.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||RWAs will never be the same again||Every crisis will offer lessons that require those involved to follow a corrective course, one that would take many days and sometimes even years to complete. As far as residential welfare associations (RWAs) are concerned, these are the lessons to be imbibed:  Promote diversity  The management committee of an RWA should constitute a group that has the right mix of the young and the old, and is also characterised by gender diversity. Senior-citizens will be at home most of the time, but during the pandemic, movement restriction was imposed on senior citizens. During the time of pandemic and natural disasters, youngsters will be needed in large numbers. So, it is important to have youngsters in good numbers in the management committee of a RWA, as they can adapt to evolving situations more easily.  Make a directory  The COVID-19 crisis has taught the community to be self-reliant, and this means have a directory for your community, with residents professions clearly spelt out. The health care professionals and staff have been of immense help to the community during this crisis. With such a directory Even, other maintenance work, and help to senior-citizens could be extended, if you have a directory.  Become tech-savvy  The pandemic has underlined how digital technology can be leveraged make the regular management-committee meetings more focussed and more meaningful. Committee could meet only over digital platforms. The attendance at digital meetings was much higher that it was during in-person meetings. Digital meetings are here to stay.

From seeing how shops in my locality — Jawahar Nagar in Perambur (West) — operated during the months when lockdowns were intense, I am certain there must be renewed trust in them. If a particular item was out of stock, they would promise to get it for the customer the next day, and would invariably deliver on this promise. This personal touch was quite refreshing. One kirana store accepted digital payment, which came a pleasant surprise to me, as I had seen them doing only cash transactions before the pandemic. They made the quick and timely switch. Again, going by my experience, the kirana stores in my neighbourhood that I visited, strictly abided by the rules laid by the Government, including maintaining social distancing, and opening and closing timings (which was the case in the early months of the lockdown). At some stores, I noticed that shoppers entering without a mask were politely asked to leave the shop. Like me, many others have started patronising these kirana stores more than ever before; and I hope they keep on adopting technology. Maintaining digital shelf for customers to order from, and offering many digital payment options would help these neighbourhood stores capitalise on these gains. (S.

So, in many households, grandma recipes — think nellikai thuvaiyal , sundakkai kozhambu , vaeppam poo rasam, and chukka malli kappi — have made a comeback. Fear of COVID-19 would have led us to add medicinal herbs to our regular preparations, and the challenge lies in continuing this practice in a post-pandemic world. So, I propose the idea of having community herbal-gardens across Chennai. The idea may appear far-fetched, but I believe it is worth acting upon. In a metropolis, space is a challenge, and therefore all available options should be explored. Local bodies should be open to having spaces in public parks earmarked for growing medicinal herbs. There are regular reports from various parts of Chennai of how vacant lands are misused for dumping garbage. Why can’t neighbours seek the owner’s permission to grow useful plants there? There is the possibility that some would accede to the request. There would be no harm in having Thippili , Seenthil Kodi, Karumulli , Kostam , Nilavembu , Karpooravalli and Adathoda as our ‘neighbours’. With their medicinal properties, they would protect us. (J.

Residents complain of rainwater puddles in an open space along the railway station that belongs to the Southern Railway. “Stagnant rainwater in the open spaces at the railway station is the major reason for a sudden increase in mosquitoes in the neighbourhood,” says K. Senthil Kumar, a resident of Villivakkam. The open space along the railway station was once a paid parking area for all vehicles, including two- and four-wheelers. It was also free of encroachments before the lockdown. Residents point out that it is poorly maintained now. The open plot does lacks drains that could discharge excess rainwater to nearby stormwater drains. Another major irritant for commuters is the closure of a refreshment outlet at the railway station. Villivakkam railway station does not have adequate refreshment outlets. The closed refreshment outlet was operating on a suburban platform near the ticket counters towards Arakkonam. As Villivakkam is a busy station serving a massive number of passengers heading to various destinations, residents want the authorities to attend to these concerns. ”Steps will be taken soon to clear the open space of stagnant rainwater, and also to spray disinfectants on it,” says a railway official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/open-space-becomes-breeding-ground-for-mosquitoes/article33375946.ece

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you tried catching up with these passage migrants?||Dark-sided Flycatcher In November 2011, senior member of Madras NaturalistsSociety (MNS) Ramanan Padmanabhan posted a picture of a flycatcher that had invited itself to his home at Shastri Nagar. It resembled the Asian Brown Flycatcher closely, but was smaller and darker on the sides. After studying the other photos of the bird clicked by Ramanan, Gnanaskandan Kesavabharathi, an eBird reviewer and also an MNS member, sensed it could be a Dark-sided Flycatcher. The bird reportedly hanging around the greenery near Ramanan's home the next day, Gnanaskandan decided to make a visit. “There were heavy showers before the day of the sighting, on that day as well as the next. The bird was probably staying back due to the rains,” recalls Gnanaskandan. Around evening time, when there was let-up in the rain, Gnanaskandan, a resident of Besant Nagarat at that time, headed to another MNS member Sivakumar Hariharan's home, and the two were were on their way to Raman’s. “I knew that if I let go of this opportunity, I would have to go only to the Himalayas to see the Dark-sided Flycatcher," says Gnanaskandan.” After the vistiors had waited for a while, the bird showed up on a tree next to Raman’s balcony. “We took pictures and jotted down notes. Ramanan used to see the Asian Brown Flycatcher there before; and so we had to be certain it was the same bird he had seen the day before. After thorough examination, we documented that it as a Dark-sided Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan continues: “The pointers were very clear: It was smaller than the Asian Brown Flycatcher; had darker flanks; a very pointed beak; a conspicuous narrow white line running in the centre of the belly; and the primary projection was larger than that of the Asian Brown Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan points out that in November 2015 in Avadi, there was a sighting of the Dark-sided Flycatcher by Pronoy Baidya, "a Goan birder who was living in Chennai at that time”. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, an eBird reviewer, documented the sighting of a juvenile Dark-Sided Flycatcher that was on its return migration, in March 2016, at Guindy National Park (GNP). Tickell's Blue Flycatcher “Tickell's Blue Flycatcher isa passage migrant in Chennai and its sightings are highly localised,” says Vikas. The bird seems to choose GNP and IIT-M probably because these places are heavily wooded, for its short sojourn, as records of its sighting have emerged from there. Vikas had seen a Tickell’s Blue Flycatcher at Guindy National Park in November 2016, and interestingly made another sighting bang on “the other side of the wall on the IIT-M campus”. Other birders, Mahathi Narayanaswamy in particular, have sighted this scarce passage migrant at IIT-M.“It is a forest bird, and likes a particularly secluded area,” points out Vikas. “It is also drawn to patches with streams. In western ghats, I have seen this bird around streams.”   Ultramarine Flycatcher During a one-year study of butterflies and birds at Guindy National Park, Vikas made quite a numer of flycatcher records, and that includes the rare sighting in March 2016 of a male Ultramarine Flycatcher, a scarce passage migrant in Chennai, and a winter visitor to the Nilgiris. There are flycatchers with generous “coats” of blue, but there is an ethereal quality to this male Ultramarine Flycather’s blue. It has lapis lazuli written all over it. The white brow and the white patch running from throat to the belly accentuates the blueness. Birder Rama Neelamengam was one of the other birders on the spot when Vikas saw the Ultramarine Flycatcher at GNP. “I was there, but I missed seeing it,” says Rama, Given the rarity and beauty of the Ultramarine Flycatcher, she knows that would have made one unforgettable lifer, had she seen the bird that day. Rusty-tailed Flycatcher Vikas would choose tocautiously place the Rusty-tailed Flycatcher “somewhere between a scarce winter visitor and a passage migrant”, though he sees enough reason to name it a passage migrant, straightaway. “I had seen it on December 31, 2016 and in the previous season, in late April 2016. If a bird is seen at the beginning and end of a migratory season, they are likely a passage migrant for that area. The fact that I saw the bird on a December 31, well into a migration season makes me think that all may not be just passing through Chennai, and a few may be lingering on a bit longer than you would expect a passage migrant to,” explains Vikas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/have-you-tried-catching-up-with-these-passage-migrants/article33375986.ece

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||A triumph of the spirit||Throughout the pandemic, the residents of my apartments — Rani Meyyammai Towers — have made it a point not to let the pandemic dictate the way they live their lives, and I salute that. The entire community came up with innovative ways to make life as normal as possible, making it easier for everyone around them to ease into this new, and quite frankly unexpected way of life. A raft of get-togethers were conducted online, mostly via zoom. To keep the children engaged, some residents took the initiative to outsource entertainment, including a magic show, a planetarium and even an aquarium tour. These were primarily driven by Mrs. Jayasree. In my opinion, the pandemic has also opened our eyes to the importance of giving back to the society, especially in this time of crisis. Rewind back to March, when the lockdown was first announced. A large majority of the residents in my apartments were forced to stop their domestic help, in light of the situation. However, despite that, most of them continued to pay them their salaries. It was gladdening to see that people genuinely cared about the livelihood of those who cared for them, and were willing to support them in their time of need. As a community also, we came together to support others who needed our help. For the nine-day festival of Navaratri, the children of the community came together to package and sell tamboolam to the residents of the apartment. The proceeds then went towards buying essentials for an old age home. Mrs. Lalitha was mainly responsible for coordinating the efforts of these children. The pandemic also made us appreciate the efforts of the support staff/maintenance teams who put us ahead of themselves. As a token of our appreciation towards our maintenance staff, who worked diligently throughout the pandemic and even when cyclone ‘Nivar’ hit, the community as a whole contributed towards a fund. So, in reality, there is a lot of good to look back upon this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-triumph-of-the-spirit/article33375972.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Digital immigrants adopt technology to run group and RWA||The pandemic led many people to put a toe, if not a firm foot, out of their comfort zone. Notably, even seniors could not hide themselves behind easy labels like “digital immigrants”. Many of the seniors in our group were initiated into the digital world, usually with their Gen Z grandchildren playing tech-high priests. With people having to shelter in place almost completely in the first few months, life was largely lived on the virtual highway, and this necessitated the use of digital payment apps. Many domestic help had enabled digital payment in their mobiles, and their salaries had to be transferred online. Seniors who adapted well to these changes would be benefited beyond the pandemic. In truth, it would benefit everyone, not just seniors, if services could be accessed on their doorsteps. We would like to see some of these services continue to be delivered in this manner. At the height of the pandemic, even government agencies, including the Horticulture Department, organised special vegetable sales. That is one thing I would like to see happen well beyond this crisis. I guess it would be a help if ration articles were home-delivered for seniors. Being virtual helped seniors cope with emotional isolation. 1. East Coast Beach Walkers’ Association consists largely of seniors, and we made sure to keep our WhatsApp groups buzzing with conversations to beat the lockdown blues. Members of our Association are accustomed to morning and evening walks in the beach, which also double as social meet-ups. The alternative — walking and exercising alone at home — cannot quite make up for the loss of this routine. So, we decided to over-communicate on these online groups to keep our spirits up. 2. We did not miss out on big celebrations, especially members' birthdays.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Traders seek restoration of a section of NSC Bose Road||Heavy downpours resulting from cyclone Nivar have left a section of NSC Bose Road, particularly between the Flower Bazaar police station and the road's intersection the Wall Tax Road, pockmarked. Motorists and traders call this section of NSC Bose Road the “poor cousin” to the section that is lined with historical buildings including the Madras High Court and the Government Law College. With traders having resumed their businesses, which include wholesale trade, the movement of vehicles on this section has significantly increased. This section is widely used by goods-laden vehicles trundling in from neighbouring States. Due to its poor maintenance, this section got damaged on account of Nivar. Traders and motorists point out that bitumen topping wore off due to the heavy showers. After a wait lasting seven years, NSC Bose Road between the Madras High Court and Broadway junction was opened for two-way traffic two years ago in 2018 to ease traffic flow on the congested stretch. Since then, vehicles including MTC buses from Broadway junction are being allowed to proceed straight towards Parry’s Corner. Similarly, vehicles coming in from RBI subway can take a "left" turn travel down NSC Bose Road and reach the Broadway junction. Similar to traffic arrangements in place prior to Metro Rail work, vehicular parking is allowed on these section of NSC Bose Road towards Broadway direction. The opening of NSC Bose Road for two-way traffic has helped motorists coming from North Beach Lane to reach Anna Salai via Fort railway station. Earlier, due to Metro Rail work, motorists coming from North Beach Lane had to use the narrow dilapidated one-way lane above the RBI subway to reach Anna Salai. Operators of MTC buses had to take a detour to reach the Madras High Court complex on NSC Bose Road. "Steps will be taken to relay the damaged NSC Bose Road, especially the section that covers a part of the wholesale business," says a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/traders-seek-restoration-of-a-section-of-nsc-bose-road/article33375975.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Let us together make Chennai the ‘herbal-garden city of India’||‘Immunity-boosting food’ has been a recurrent theme, its importance being particularly emphasised in the first few months of the pandemic. So, in many households, grandma recipes — think nellikai thuvaiyal , sundakkai kozhambu , vaeppam poo rasam, and chukka malli kappi — have made a comeback. Fear of COVID-19 would have led us to add medicinal herbs to our regular preparations, and the challenge lies in continuing this practice in a post-pandemic world. So, I propose the idea of having community herbal-gardens across Chennai. The idea may appear far-fetched, but I believe it is worth acting upon. In a metropolis, space is a challenge, and therefore all available options should be explored. Local bodies should be open to having spaces in public parks earmarked for growing medicinal herbs. There are regular reports from various parts of Chennai of how vacant lands are misused for dumping garbage. Why can’t neighbours seek the owner’s permission to grow useful plants there? There is the possibility that some would accede to the request. There would be no harm in having Thippili , Seenthil Kodi, Karumulli , Kostam , Nilavembu , Karpooravalli and Adathoda as our ‘neighbours’. With their medicinal properties, they would protect us. (J.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Let us make PHCs great again||Primary Health Centres (PHCs) can be called community hospitals as they are designed to serve local populations. If PHCs are well-equipped, adequately-staffed and run efficiently, and also hugely patronised by the local population, they will provide a picture of a community’s health profile, so that necessary and timely interventions can be effected. In a crisis like COVID-19, this function of PHCs cannot be overemphasised. Well-equipped and optimally-functioning PHCs can ease the burden on the next tier in a government’s multi-tiered health care system — namely, district-level hospitals. Again, this is an opportunity missed, and also a lesson we ought to learn from the COVID-19 crisis. In the current scheme of things, PHCs do not enjoy the importance they deserve. Well over a year ago, in Chitlapakkam, government establishments, which include a police station, a post office, an office of Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation, a PHC and the office of Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat, had to be shifted to facilitate the restoration of Chitlapakkam lake. Alternative premises were identified for all these government establishments, except for the PHC. My sister and I, and a few of my cousins were born at this PHC in Chitlapakkam. Until 2000, this PHC enjoyed considerable patronage from the local community. Over the last two decades, it has been losing its importance among the local community. However, I take my --- year-old son to the Chitlapakkam PHC to administer immunisation vaccines, much against my family will. Many a time, I have approached the authorities concerned and urged them to improve facilities at the Chitlapakkam PHC, to no avail. Now, the PHC is not even functioning. When I bring up this issue, I am told residents shoud make use of Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) at Haridhasapuram in Pallavaram Municipality, which is 5 km from Chitlapakkam. Going to Haridhasapuram PHC is not the solution. Our rightful PHC should be reestablished in our locality at the earliest. Residents welfare associations’ should reiterate their right to having a fully-functional and well-equipped PHC in their neighbourhoods. But most RWAs are strident in their demand for parks and playgrounds, but silent about PHCs. And then, RWAs draw authorities’ attention to battered roads and sewage overflows, but fail to even notice deficiencies in the PHCs in their localities.

From seeing how shops in my locality — Jawahar Nagar in Perambur (West) — operated during the months when lockdowns were intense, I am certain there must be renewed trust in them. If a particular item was out of stock, they would promise to get it for the customer the next day, and would invariably deliver on this promise. This personal touch was quite refreshing. One kirana store accepted digital payment, which came a pleasant surprise to me, as I had seen them doing only cash transactions before the pandemic. They made the quick and timely switch. Again, going by my experience, the kirana stores in my neighbourhood that I visited, strictly abided by the rules laid by the Government, including maintaining social distancing, and opening and closing timings (which was the case in the early months of the lockdown). At some stores, I noticed that shoppers entering without a mask were politely asked to leave the shop. Like me, many others have started patronising these kirana stores more than ever before; and I hope they keep on adopting technology. Maintaining digital shelf for customers to order from, and offering many digital payment options would help these neighbourhood stores capitalise on these gains. (S.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||RWAs will never be the same again||Every crisis will offer lessons that require those involved to follow a corrective course, one that would take many days and sometimes even years to complete. As far as residential welfare associations (RWAs) are concerned, these are the lessons to be imbibed:  Promote diversity  The management committee of an RWA should constitute a group that has the right mix of the young and the old, and is also characterised by gender diversity. Senior-citizens will be at home most of the time, but during the pandemic, movement restriction was imposed on senior citizens. During the time of pandemic and natural disasters, youngsters will be needed in large numbers. So, it is important to have youngsters in good numbers in the management committee of a RWA, as they can adapt to evolving situations more easily.  Make a directory  The COVID-19 crisis has taught the community to be self-reliant, and this means have a directory for your community, with residents professions clearly spelt out. The health care professionals and staff have been of immense help to the community during this crisis. With such a directory Even, other maintenance work, and help to senior-citizens could be extended, if you have a directory.  Become tech-savvy  The pandemic has underlined how digital technology can be leveraged make the regular management-committee meetings more focused and more meaningful. Committee could meet only over digital platforms. The attendance at digital meetings was much higher that it was during in-person meetings. Digital meetings are here to stay.

There is a difference between staying at home and staying inactive. Early on, I realised that I could do enough to help people, from home. So, to help people with limited resources, I ran a fund collection drive, reaching out to friends and relatives contributions. The charity purse swelled to Rs. 3.5 lakh, and with this money, I helped people get tested; supplied food to 100 to 150 people for two months; I helped archakas, nadhaswaram groups, hairdressers, and autoriskshaw drivers by extending an amount of Rs. 1,000 and provisions of the same value to them. I supplied 1000 masks to the Chromepet Government Hospital. Besides, I got a huge tank installed in my neighbourhood — New Colony, Chromepet — and supplied 3,000 litres of sanitiser to public free of cost. Besides, I also organised a function and honoured a doctor and a nurse for their exemplary service towards people with COVID-19. (V.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Honouring and helping conservancy staff||For me, one of the key lessons from the last nine months is that when there a crisis demanding a massive response from us, we have to summon every ounce of energy and try to provide just that kind of a response. Thankfully, often that may not be demanded of us. There are people who have been responding to the crisis effectively by just not abandoning their post and doing their work. Honouring them would constitute an apt response from us. As a gesture of thanksgiving, in the early part of the lockdown, Raja Annamalaipuram Residents’ Welfare Association along with a few other RWAs, provided breakfast to the conservancy staff in our locality, with the expenses met by residents. We noticed the staff were coming from far-off places to work and no outlets were open for them to buy food. So, we started serving them breakfast. At periodic intervals, we also served lunch. For a couple of staff, who would walk to work, from Royapettah to Alwarpet, residents pooled in money and bought cycles. We also distributed financial aid and provided essential items to the conservancy workers. And then, before the onset of the north-east monsoon, with the help of Greater Chennai Corporation, we arranged for pruning of tree branches along the stretches in our locality. Cyclone Nivar uprooted as many 10 decades-old trees. Soon, we will be planting tree saplings to offset the loss caused by the cyclone. (T. N.

Our interactions with GCC engineers in charge of roads, street lights, and solid waste management are particularly frequent. But we would hardly interact with GCC’s health officials. During 2020 though, we are in a position to appreciate the role played by public health officials, as they and members of our RWA have been working together over the last 10 month, due to the pandemic. Our collaboration included camps being organised to identify those with COVID-19, and awareness campaigns promoting prevention measures. The pandemic has taught us that behaviours at the community level impact individuals’ health. To illustrate, we clearly notice that spitting in public places, and even more specifically to the current context, not wearing a mask can have implications for the health of those around. Therefore, even in a post-pandemic world, residents welfare associations should work towards ensuring hygiene and cleanliness in public places through awareness and sensitisation. (S.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you tried catching up with these passage migrants?||Dark-sided Flycatcher In November 2011, senior member of Madras NaturalistsSociety (MNS) Ramanan Padmanabhan posted a picture of a flycatcher that had invited itself to his home at Shastri Nagar. It resembled the Asian Brown Flycatcher closely, but was smaller and darker on the sides. After studying the other photos of the bird clicked by Ramanan, Gnanaskandan Kesavabharathi, an eBird reviewer and also an MNS member, sensed it could be a Dark-sided Flycatcher. The bird reportedly hanging around the greenery near Ramanan's home the next day, Gnanaskandan decided to make a visit. “There were heavy showers before the day of the sighting, on that day as well as the next. The bird was probably staying back due to the rains,” recalls Gnanaskandan. Around evening time, when there was let-up in the rain, Gnanaskandan, a resident of Besant Nagarat at that time, headed to another MNS member Sivakumar Hariharan's home, and the two were were on their way to Raman’s. “I knew that if I let go of this opportunity, I would have to go only to the Himalayas to see the Dark-sided Flycatcher," says Gnanaskandan.” After the vistiors had waited for a while, the bird showed up on a tree next to Raman’s balcony. “We took pictures and jotted down notes. Ramanan used to see the Asian Brown Flycatcher there before; and so we had to be certain it was the same bird he had seen the day before. After thorough examination, we documented that it as a Dark-sided Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan continues: “The pointers were very clear: It was smaller than the Asian Brown Flycatcher; had darker flanks; a very pointed beak; a conspicuous narrow white line running in the centre of the belly; and the primary projection was larger than that of the Asian Brown Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan points out that in November 2015 in Avadi, there was a sighting of the Dark-sided Flycatcher by Pronoy Baidya, "a Goan birder who was living in Chennai at that time”. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, an eBird reviewer, documented the sighting of a juvenile Dark-Sided Flycatcher that was on its return migration, in March 2016, at Guindy National Park (GNP). Tickell's Blue Flycatcher “Tickell's Blue Flycatcher isa passage migrant in Chennai and its sightings are highly localised,” says Vikas. The bird seems to choose GNP and IIT-M probably because these places are heavily wooded, for its short sojourn, as records of its sighting have emerged from there. Vikas had seen a Tickell’s Blue Flycatcher at Guindy National Park in November 2016, and interestingly made another sighting bang on “the other side of the wall on the IIT-M campus”. Other birders, Mahathi Narayanaswamy in particular, have sighted this scarce passage migrant at IIT-M.“It is a forest bird, and likes a particularly secluded area,” points out Vikas. “It is also drawn to patches with streams. In western ghats, I have seen this bird around streams.”   Ultramarine Flycatcher During a one-year study of butterflies and birds at Guindy National Park, Vikas made quite a numer of flycatcher records, and that includes the rare sighting in March 2016 of a male Ultramarine Flycatcher, a scarce passage migrant in Chennai, and a winter visitor to the Nilgiris. There are flycatchers with generous “coats” of blue, but there is an ethereal quality to this male Ultramarine Flycather’s blue. It has lapis lazuli written all over it. The white brow and the white patch running from throat to the belly accentuates the blueness. Birder Rama Neelamengam was one of the other birders on the spot when Vikas saw the Ultramarine Flycatcher at GNP. “I was there, but I missed seeing it,” says Rama, Given the rarity and beauty of the Ultramarine Flycatcher, she knows that would have made one unforgettable lifer, had she seen the bird that day. Rusty-tailed Flycatcher Vikas would choose tocautiously place the Rusty-tailed Flycatcher “somewhere between a scarce winter visitor and a passage migrant”, though he sees enough reason to name it a passage migrant, straightaway. “I had seen it on December 31, 2016 and in the previous season, in late April 2016. If a bird is seen at the beginning and end of a migratory season, they are likely a passage migrant for that area. The fact that I saw the bird on a December 31, well into a migration season makes me think that all may not be just passing through Chennai, and a few may be lingering on a bit longer than you would expect a passage migrant to,” explains Vikas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/have-you-tried-catching-up-with-these-passage-migrants/article33376052.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Digital immigrants adopt technology to run group and RWA||The pandemic led many people to put a toe, if not a firm foot, out of their comfort zone. Notably, even seniors could not hide themselves behind easy labels like “digital immigrants”. Many of the seniors in our group were initiated into the digital world, usually with their Gen Z grandchildren playing tech-high priests. With people having to shelter in place almost completely in the first few months, life was largely lived on the virtual highway, and this necessitated the use of digital payment apps. Many domestic help had enabled digital payment in their mobiles, and their salaries had to be transferred online. Seniors who adapted well to these changes would be benefited beyond the pandemic. In truth, it would benefit everyone, not just seniors, if services could be accessed on their doorsteps. We would like to see some of these services continue to be delivered in this manner. At the height of the pandemic, even government agencies, including the Horticulture Department, organised special vegetable sales. That is one thing I would like to see happen well beyond this crisis. I guess it would be a help if ration articles were home-delivered for seniors. Being virtual helped seniors cope with emotional isolation. 1. East Coast Beach Walkers’ Association consists largely of seniors, and we made sure to keep our WhatsApp groups buzzing with conversations to beat the lockdown blues. Members of our Association are accustomed to morning and evening walks in the beach, which also double as social meet-ups. The alternative — walking and exercising alone at home — cannot quite make up for the loss of this routine. So, we decided to over-communicate on these online groups to keep our spirits up. 2. We did not miss out on big celebrations, especially members' birthdays. On their birthday, a special card with their photo would be created and circulated in our online groups so that they are wished on their big day. 3.

Going to Haridhasapuram PHC is not the solution. Our rightful PHC should be reestablished in our locality at the earliest. Residents welfare associations’ should reiterate their right to having a fully-functional and well-equipped PHC in their neighbourhoods. But most RWAs are strident in their demand for parks and playgrounds, but silent about PHCs. And then, RWAs draw authorities’ attention to battered roads and sewage overflows, but fail to even notice deficiencies in the PHCs in their localities.

From seeing how shops in my locality — Jawahar Nagar in Perambur (West) — operated during the months when lockdowns were intense, I am certain there must be renewed trust in them. If a particular item was out of stock, they would promise to get it for the customer the next day, and would invariably deliver on this promise. This personal touch was quite refreshing. One kirana store accepted digital payment, which came a pleasant surprise to me, as I had seen them doing only cash transactions before the pandemic. They made the quick and timely switch. Again, going by my experience, the kirana stores in my neighbourhood that I visited, strictly abided by the rules laid by the Government, including maintaining social distancing, and opening and closing timings (which was the case in the early months of the lockdown). At some stores, I noticed that shoppers entering without a mask were politely asked to leave the shop. Like me, many others have started patronising these kirana stores more than ever before; and I hope they keep on adopting technology. Maintaining digital shelf for customers to order from, and offering many digital payment options would help these neighbourhood stores capitalise on these gains. (S.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||RWAs will never be the same again||Every crisis will offer lessons that require those involved to follow a corrective course, one that would take many days and sometimes even years to complete. As far as residential welfare associations (RWAs) are concerned, these are the lessons to be imbibed:  Promote diversity  The management committee of an RWA should constitute a group that has the right mix of the young and the old, and is also characterised by gender diversity. Senior-citizens will be at home most of the time, but during the pandemic, movement restriction was imposed on senior citizens. During the time of pandemic and natural disasters, youngsters will be needed in large numbers. So, it is important to have youngsters in good numbers in the management committee of a RWA, as they can adapt to evolving situations more easily.  Make a directory  The COVID-19 crisis has taught the community to be self-reliant, and this means have a directory for your community, with residents professions clearly spelt out. The health care professionals and staff have been of immense help to the community during this crisis. With such a directory Even, other maintenance work, and help to senior-citizens could be extended, if you have a directory.  Become tech-savvy  The pandemic has underlined how digital technology can be leveraged make the regular management-committee meetings more focused and more meaningful. Committee could meet only over digital platforms. The attendance at digital meetings was much higher that it was during in-person meetings. Digital meetings are here to stay.

Nagar for more than four decades, I have been a witness to the various developments on Anna Main Road. I hsve seen its transformation from a sandy narrow path to a widened bitumen stretch. Today, the road has LED streets lights, a concrete median, a wide footpath and pedestrian-crossings. CCTV cameras are a new addition. With multi-storey apartments replacing independent houses in the neighbourhood, and as link that connects Nesapakkam and Virugambakkam with Ashok Pillar, Anna Main Road has been witnessing a steady and consistent rise in volume of vehicles over the past two decades But what has not changed since my childhood is that Anna Main Road would often remain dug-up for one reason or the other — by the Greater Chennai Corporation, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) or Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco). To cite an example, a section of Anna Main Road that lies between Nesapakkam and the Metropolitan Transport Corporation terminus in K.K. Nagar (where the flow of traffic is towards Ashok Pillar) was dug up by the Tangedco more than a year ago to lay high-voltage optic fibre cables to prevent power fluctuations in the neighbourhood. Before the stretch could be repaired and relaid by Greater Chennai Corporation, the opposite side of the road was dug up by CMWSSB to lay pipes and water collection pits, and that is how it remains for the past six months now. The CMWSSB work is still under way creating traffic chaos during rush hour. Frequent digging of the road only reflects the lack of coordination among the government departments. We would like to see all forms of civic work on Anna Main Road get completed at the earliest, and a complete road that is not opened up here and there. S. Thirunavukarasu is a resident of K.K.

Other key roads in the locality that are waterlogged: Ramakrishna Street, Anna Street, Gangadharan Street, Senthil Andavar Street and Dharan Singh Colony Road. In the first three streets on this list, water had to be pumped out and let into an open trench dug up along Ramakrishna Street. Despite the water being pumped out, these roads are still plagued by water-logging. Residents cite clogs in the stormwater drains as well as in the sewage pipes of CMWSSB Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) as the reason for water stagnation. “The water stagnation problem is compounded as sewage overflows from manholes. We have to wade through water which is mixed with sewage,” says K. Raghavan, a resident of Vadapalani. Interestingly, the Greater Chennai Corporation widened the stormwater drains in the neighbourhood only last year under the Integrated Storm Water Drain (ISWD) Project. Residents allege that poor planning including failure to revive earlier water-discharge routes in the neighbourhood by GCC is the main reason for the water-logging. Further, they have pointed out that for many years, excess rainwater during every monsoon would get discharged into a vast open land that connects three streets: Ramakrishna Street, Anna Street and Gangadharan Street in Gandhi Nagar. It served as a soak pit for excess rainwater. But the compound wall was built around the open land a few years ago. Since then, following the rains, the roads get inundated. Widening the stormwater drains has not helped, say residents.  “Steps will be taken to discharge stagnant water and clear the drains at the earliest,” says a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/colony-in-vadapalani-remains-under-water/article33376042.ece

Our interactions with GCC engineers in charge of roads, street lights, and solid waste management are particularly frequent. But we would hardly interact with GCC’s health officials. During 2020 though, we are in a position to appreciate the role played by public health officials, as they and members of our RWA have been working together over the last 10 month, due to the pandemic. Our collaboration included camps being organised to identify those with COVID-19, and awareness campaigns promoting prevention measures. The pandemic has taught us that behaviours at the community level impact individuals’ health. To illustrate, we clearly notice that spitting in public places, and even more specifically to the current context, not wearing a mask can have implications for the health of those around. Therefore, even in a post-pandemic world, residents welfare associations should work towards ensuring hygiene and cleanliness in public places through awareness and sensitisation. (S.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you tried catching up with these passage migrants?||Dark-sided Flycatcher In November 2011, senior member of Madras NaturalistsSociety (MNS) Ramanan Padmanabhan posted a picture of a flycatcher that had invited itself to his home at Shastri Nagar. It resembled the Asian Brown Flycatcher closely, but was smaller and darker on the sides. After studying the other photos of the bird clicked by Ramanan, Gnanaskandan Kesavabharathi, an eBird reviewer and also an MNS member, sensed it could be a Dark-sided Flycatcher. The bird reportedly hanging around the greenery near Ramanan's home the next day, Gnanaskandan decided to make a visit. “There were heavy showers before the day of the sighting, on that day as well as the next. The bird was probably staying back due to the rains,” recalls Gnanaskandan. Around evening time, when there was let-up in the rain, Gnanaskandan, a resident of Besant Nagarat at that time, headed to another MNS member Sivakumar Hariharan's home, and the two were were on their way to Raman’s. “I knew that if I let go of this opportunity, I would have to go only to the Himalayas to see the Dark-sided Flycatcher," says Gnanaskandan.” After the vistiors had waited for a while, the bird showed up on a tree next to Raman’s balcony. “We took pictures and jotted down notes. Ramanan used to see the Asian Brown Flycatcher there before; and so we had to be certain it was the same bird he had seen the day before. After thorough examination, we documented that it as a Dark-sided Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan continues: “The pointers were very clear: It was smaller than the Asian Brown Flycatcher; had darker flanks; a very pointed beak; a conspicuous narrow white line running in the centre of the belly; and the primary projection was larger than that of the Asian Brown Flycatcher.” Gnanaskandan points out that in November 2015 in Avadi, there was a sighting of the Dark-sided Flycatcher by Pronoy Baidya, "a Goan birder who was living in Chennai at that time”. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, an eBird reviewer, documented the sighting of a juvenile Dark-Sided Flycatcher that was on its return migration, in March 2016, at Guindy National Park (GNP). Tickell's Blue Flycatcher “Tickell's Blue Flycatcher isa passage migrant in Chennai and its sightings are highly localised,” says Vikas. The bird seems to choose GNP and IIT-M probably because these places are heavily wooded, for its short sojourn, as records of its sighting have emerged from there. Vikas had seen a Tickell’s Blue Flycatcher at Guindy National Park in November 2016, and interestingly made another sighting bang on “the other side of the wall on the IIT-M campus”. Other birders, Mahathi Narayanaswamy in particular, have sighted this scarce passage migrant at IIT-M.“It is a forest bird, and likes a particularly secluded area,” points out Vikas. “It is also drawn to patches with streams. In western ghats, I have seen this bird around streams.”   Ultramarine Flycatcher During a one-year study of butterflies and birds at Guindy National Park, Vikas made quite a numer of flycatcher records, and that includes the rare sighting in March 2016 of a male Ultramarine Flycatcher, a scarce passage migrant in Chennai, and a winter visitor to the Nilgiris. There are flycatchers with generous “coats” of blue, but there is an ethereal quality to this male Ultramarine Flycather’s blue. It has lapis lazuli written all over it. The white brow and the white patch running from throat to the belly accentuates the blueness. Birder Rama Neelamengam was one of the other birders on the spot when Vikas saw the Ultramarine Flycatcher at GNP. “I was there, but I missed seeing it,” says Rama, Given the rarity and beauty of the Ultramarine Flycatcher, she knows that would have made one unforgettable lifer, had she seen the bird that day. Rusty-tailed Flycatcher Vikas would choose tocautiously place the Rusty-tailed Flycatcher “somewhere between a scarce winter visitor and a passage migrant”, though he sees enough reason to name it a passage migrant, straightaway. “I had seen it on December 31, 2016 and in the previous season, in late April 2016. If a bird is seen at the beginning and end of a migratory season, they are likely a passage migrant for that area. The fact that I saw the bird on a December 31, well into a migration season makes me think that all may not be just passing through Chennai, and a few may be lingering on a bit longer than you would expect a passage migrant to,” explains Vikas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/have-you-tried-catching-up-with-these-passage-migrants/article33376021.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Digital immigrants adopt technology to run group and RWA||The pandemic led many people to put a toe, if not a firm foot, out of their comfort zone. Notably, even seniors could not hide themselves behind easy labels like “digital immigrants”. Many of the seniors in our group were initiated into the digital world, usually with their Gen Z grandchildren playing tech-high priests. With people having to shelter in place almost completely in the first few months, life was largely lived on the virtual highway, and this necessitated the use of digital payment apps. Many domestic help had enabled digital payment in their mobiles, and their salaries had to be transferred online. Seniors who adapted well to these changes would be benefited beyond the pandemic. In truth, it would benefit everyone, not just seniors, if services could be accessed on their doorsteps. We would like to see some of these services continue to be delivered in this manner. At the height of the pandemic, even government agencies, including the Horticulture Department, organised special vegetable sales. That is one thing I would like to see happen well beyond this crisis. I guess it would be a help if ration articles were home-delivered for seniors. Being virtual helped seniors cope with emotional isolation. 1. East Coast Beach Walkers’ Association consists largely of seniors, and we made sure to keep our WhatsApp groups buzzing with conversations to beat the lockdown blues. Members of our Association are accustomed to morning and evening walks in the beach, which also double as social meet-ups. The alternative — walking and exercising alone at home — cannot quite make up for the loss of this routine. So, we decided to over-communicate on these online groups to keep our spirits up. 2. We did not miss out on big celebrations, especially members' birthdays. On their birthday, a special card with their photo would be created and circulated in our online groups so that they are wished on their big day. 3. We conducted fund-raisers to help the conservancy workers tasked with cleaning the beach. In particular, we organised a donation collection drive to help some of them facing medical emergencies. 4. The group's executive committee got savvy with online meetings. For many, these online meetings were a first, as they are retirees for long and strangers to digital conferences. Neighbourhood group There are many initiatives undertaken at the neighbourhood level which I hope to see being sustained. 1. Members of our neighbourhood online groups — Srinivasapuram Residents Welfare Association — ran a series “Know Your Colony Doctors”. There are around 20 doctors in our colony, and started sharing how they are making a difference in this crisis through their work. 2. We honoured and rewarded conservancy workers who kept our neighbourhood spic and span. 3. We organised vegetable sales in our colony with the assistance of the Agri Horticultural Society. 4. We organised sanitation drives by talking to the Corporation 5. Thefts are the last thing anyone would want during a pandemic. So, to avoid untoward incidents, we were monitoring CCTV footage regularly. 6. The pandemic has created greater hygiene consciousness among residents, and this included getting dog owners to carry a poop scoop while out walking their dogs.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Let us together make Chennai the ‘herbal-garden city of India’||‘Immunity-boosting food’ has been a recurrent theme, its importance being particularly emphasised in the first few months of the pandemic. So, in many households, grandma recipes — think nellikai thuvaiyal , sundakkai kozhambu , vaeppam poo rasam, and chukka malli kappi — have made a comeback. Fear of COVID-19 would have led us to add medicinal herbs to our regular preparations, and the challenge lies in continuing this practice in a post-pandemic world. So, I propose the idea of having community herbal-gardens across Chennai. The idea may appear far-fetched, but I believe it is worth acting upon. In a metropolis, space is a challenge, and therefore all available options should be explored. Local bodies should be open to having spaces in public parks earmarked for growing medicinal herbs. There are regular reports from various parts of Chennai of how vacant lands are misused for dumping garbage. Why can’t neighbours seek the owner’s permission to grow useful plants there? There is the possibility that some would accede to the request. There would be no harm in having Thippili , Seenthil Kodi, Karumulli , Kostam , Nilavembu , Karpooravalli and Adathoda as our ‘neighbours’. With their medicinal properties, they would protect us. (J.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Let us make PHCs great again||Primary Health Centres (PHCs) can be called community hospitals as they are designed to serve local populations. If PHCs are well-equipped, adequately-staffed and run efficiently, and also hugely patronised by the local population, they will provide a picture of a community’s health profile, so that necessary and timely interventions can be effected. In a crisis like COVID-19, this function of PHCs cannot be overemphasised. Well-equipped and optimally-functioning PHCs can ease the burden on the next tier in a government’s multi-tiered health care system — namely, district-level hospitals. Again, this is an opportunity missed, and also a lesson we ought to learn from the COVID-19 crisis. In the current scheme of things, PHCs do not enjoy the importance they deserve. Well over a year ago, in Chitlapakkam, government establishments, which include a police station, a post office, an office of Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation, a PHC and the office of Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat, had to be shifted to facilitate the restoration of Chitlapakkam lake. Alternative premises were identified for all these government establishments, except for the PHC. My sister and I, and a few of my cousins were born at this PHC in Chitlapakkam. Until 2000, this PHC enjoyed considerable patronage from the local community. Over the last two decades, it has been losing its importance among the local community. However, I take my --- year-old son to the Chitlapakkam PHC to administer immunisation vaccines, much against my family will. Many a time, I have approached the authorities concerned and urged them to improve facilities at the Chitlapakkam PHC, to no avail. Now, the PHC is not even functioning. When I bring up this issue, I am told residents shoud make use of Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) at Haridhasapuram in Pallavaram Municipality, which is 5 km from Chitlapakkam. Going to Haridhasapuram PHC is not the solution. Our rightful PHC should be reestablished in our locality at the earliest. Residents welfare associations’ should reiterate their right to having a fully-functional and well-equipped PHC in their neighbourhoods. But most RWAs are strident in their demand for parks and playgrounds, but silent about PHCs. And then, RWAs draw authorities’ attention to battered roads and sewage overflows, but fail to even notice deficiencies in the PHCs in their localities.

From seeing how shops in my locality — Jawahar Nagar in Perambur (West) — operated during the months when lockdowns were intense, I am certain there must be renewed trust in them. If a particular item was out of stock, they would promise to get it for the customer the next day, and would invariably deliver on this promise. This personal touch was quite refreshing. One kirana store accepted digital payment, which came a pleasant surprise to me, as I had seen them doing only cash transactions before the pandemic. They made the quick and timely switch. Again, going by my experience, the kirana stores in my neighbourhood that I visited, strictly abided by the rules laid by the Government, including maintaining social distancing, and opening and closing timings (which was the case in the early months of the lockdown). At some stores, I noticed that shoppers entering without a mask were politely asked to leave the shop. Like me, many others have started patronising these kirana stores more than ever before; and I hope they keep on adopting technology. Maintaining digital shelf for customers to order from, and offering many digital payment options would help these neighbourhood stores capitalise on these gains. (S.

As far as residential welfare associations (RWAs) are concerned, these are the lessons to be imbibed:  Promote diversity  The management committee of an RWA should constitute a group that has the right mix of the young and the old, and is also characterised by gender diversity. Senior-citizens will be at home most of the time, but during the pandemic, movement restriction was imposed on senior citizens. During the time of pandemic and natural disasters, youngsters will be needed in large numbers. So, it is important to have youngsters in good numbers in the management committee of a RWA, as they can adapt to evolving situations more easily.  Make a directory  The COVID-19 crisis has taught the community to be self-reliant, and this means have a directory for your community, with residents professions clearly spelt out. The health care professionals and staff have been of immense help to the community during this crisis. With such a directory Even, other maintenance work, and help to senior-citizens could be extended, if you have a directory.  Become tech-savvy  The pandemic has underlined how digital technology can be leveraged make the regular management-committee meetings more focused and more meaningful. Committee could meet only over digital platforms. The attendance at digital meetings was much higher that it was during in-person meetings. Digital meetings are here to stay.

If the shutter of the sluice is replaced, the water storage capacity at the lake would increase and help recharge the groundwater level. In addition, we have requested the Chengalpet District Collectorate to take steps to arrest illegal discharge of sewage from apartments on Grand Southern Trunk Road into the rainwater canal of Kilambakkam Eri. Due sewage being discharged into the canal, crops in the agricultural lands around the lake have been destroyed. There is also groundwater contamination to deal with. At the Jamabandi meeting held three years ago, the forum submitted a petition in this regard to the pre-bifurcation Kancheepuram District Collectorate, seeking that it do the needful. The petition was forwarded to the Water Resources Department (WRD), Chengalpattu. If rules had been followed, WRD should have submitted a reply to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate and a copy of it sent to the petitioner. But, we are yet to get any reply in this regard.

It has reared its head again. “Due to water seepage, the subway road is slippery,” complains A. Raghavan, a long-time resident of Nanganallur. . Many years ago, the State Highways Department had conceived a mechanism to discharge rainwater from the subway. Three large sumps were constructed near the subway to collect any excess rainwater. They were designed in such a way that water from the sumps would be discharged into Veerangal Odai. Despite the construction of sumps, seepage from the walls of the subway continues. Besides, the the subway road is uneven. Residents have asked the State Highways Department to set this right as well. “The road was relaid, but it is still uneven, making the drive a challenge for motorists, especially motorcyclists. They have to exercise utmost caution while taking the subway. Besides, the tyres get damaged,” he says. The subway provides easy access to Adambakkam, Ullagaram, Puzhuthivakkam and Vanuvampet from Grand Southern Trunk Road, St. Thomas Mount and therefore witnesses heavy vehicular movement. Residents say remedial action has to be taken at the earliest to prevent any untoward incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/an-old-problem-returns-to-thillai-ganga-nagar-subway/article33375993.ece

Our interactions with GCC engineers in charge of roads, street lights, and solid waste management are particularly frequent. But we would hardly interact with GCC’s health officials. During 2020 though, we are in a position to appreciate the role played by public health officials, as they and members of our RWA have been working together over the last 10 month, due to the pandemic. Our collaboration included camps being organised to identify those with COVID-19, and awareness campaigns promoting prevention measures. The pandemic has taught us that behaviours at the community level impact individuals’ health. To illustrate, we clearly notice that spitting in public places, and even more specifically to the current context, not wearing a mask can have implications for the health of those around. Therefore, even in a post-pandemic world, residents welfare associations should work towards ensuring hygiene and cleanliness in public places through awareness and sensitisation. (S.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Crafting Khayyam bit by bit||Sometime in the 12th century, Omar Khayyam, the Persian poet and astronomer, wrote these lines about love and longing: “Come, fill the cup, and in the fire of spring / The winter garment of repentance fling: The bird of time has but a little way / To fly — and Lo! the bird is on the wing.” Khayyam could never have imagined that his words would be depicted, nearly a millennium later, in a far-off place called Kashmir, on four-foot-high, intricately designed, papier-mâché vases. His poems continue to inspire the masters of papier-mâché art, who live in the narrow bylanes of Srinagar’s Zadibal-Alamgari Bazaar. They have, for centuries, striven to bring to life the literary works of poets, Iranian kings and Mughal emperors, adding their familiar, local motifs to the mix. “I am not a learned man. But I know that Khayyam was a highly imaginative person who delved deep into his mind’s images. We offer a peek into Khayyam’s mind through our work,” says Reyaz Ahmad Khan, 51, a Shia Muslim from Alamgari Bazaar, as he swirls a vase with its images, like a storyteller captivating a group of children on a wintry Kashmiri evening. Starting young Khan’s elder brother is an award-winning artisan. He was in Class IV when his parents enrolled him with a master artisan at a local karkhana (studio). Later, Khan and many other siblings joined their brother. Today, hundreds of artisans — men and women — learn the craft at similar karkhanas , many, like Khan’s brother, beginning at a tender age. “It all started with putting dots on the works crafted by my brother. And now, after all these years, I can make the brush sing,” says Khan. Each of Khan’s vases is indeed a story. The Khayyam verses depicted on them tell tales of human life: a man courts a nymph; the couple enters the garden of love; they age together in these gardens that resemble Kashmir with chinars and flowers embossed all over. We meet Khan at his two-storey showroom-cum-design centre. He is wearing a black pheran and the embers in his kangri with its knitted willow cover are fast turning to ash. But the ink-pot and brush dripping with parrot-green paint are all that he is focused on. For Khan, his wife, their extended family and two young neighbours, winter is the season for papier-mâché. The cold, they say, forces them to stay indoors and offers less distraction than the summers filled with tasks. “Papier-mâché gives us a sense of peace. The way prayers purify a person, this art purifies us,” says Khan, who begins his day at eight in the morning and works till 10 at night. “There is no fixed schedule,” he says. “But I love to work after sundown; the long winter nights feel shorter.” Khan and his associates are busy with a special commission. They are restoring the freehand papier-mâché work on the ceiling of an imambara in Zadibal, a special prayer hall mostly used by Shia Muslims at Muharram. “These are pieces more than 200 years old. We are trying to recreate the ceiling. Future generations should be able to appreciate this work centuries down the line,” says Khan. The first artisan No historian has been able to trace the first papier-mâché artisan who travelled to Kashmir from Persia, where the craft was born, probably at the same time that kar-i-kalamdan, the art of making lacquered pen cases, became popular. Local legend has it that the art was introduced to Kashmir in the 15th century by a Kashmiri prince who had spent years in prison in Samarkand in Central Asia. Experts, however, believe the Sultanate period in Kashmir in the 14th century was when a large number of migrants, especially those from Persia and Central Asia, travelled to Kashmir and introduced many arts and crafts. Hakim Sameer Hamdani, architect and author of the book The Syncretic Traditions of Islamic Religious Architecture of Kashmir (Early 14th –18th Century) , says two men stand out for their contribution: Mir Syed Ali Hamadani, a famous Persian mystic, and Sultan Zain-ul-Abideen, a local king. “The Syed came to Kashmir in the 14th century,” says Hamdani, “when Timur invaded Persia. He brought several artisans with him. The then king, Sultan Zain-ul-Abideen, encouraged and patronised their work.” In the 15th century, shields, bows, arrows and quivers were made from papier-mâché. In the 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh decorated the ceiling of his summer house in Lahore’s Hazuri Bagh with exquisite papier-mâché, an attraction even today. Trade secrets The art of papier-mâché has been passed on orally from one generation to the next. Indeed, until the 20th century, the craft was a well-kept secret within the artisan community, says Hamdani. Many processes and materials — such as the use of smoke as ink, crushed limestones as base, and fish fat as colour — are no longer in vogue. However, papier-mâché continues to be crafted by hand, with brush strokes that render flawless patterns. Sareesh , the locally made glue derived from animal or fish fat, is used in almost all stages of the work. It’s an age-old process. Paper is first soaked in water for several days, then drained and mixed with cloth, rice straw and copper sulphate to form a pulp. The mixture is placed on a mould and left to dry for two-three days in a process called sakhtsazi . The surface is coated with glue and gypsum, rubbed smooth with a stone or piece of baked clay, and plastered with many layers of tissue paper. The piece is then sandpapered or burnished and finally painted with several coats of lacquer, a process known as naqashior surface painting.  From portraits of the Mughal emperors, especially Jahangir, for whom Kashmir became a favourite haunt, to the last Mughal king Bahadur Shah Zafar; from court scenes to hunting parties, the craft chronicled history, freezing time in frames with the finest details. But it is the depictions of Kashmir’s flora and fauna that are the big draw for buyers across the globe. The award-winning Masrat Jan, bespectacled and in her 50s, is one of the few women associated with the trade. Her home in Mughal Mohalla in Srinagar’s Lal Bazaar is her karkhana , with most of her family also involved in the craft. Masrat’s favourite motifs are drawn from Kashmir’s famous spring, with its peach, almond and cherry trees in full bloom and its many birds. “Depicting spring gives me a sense of elation,” says Masrat. “I love to paint fruit trees like the apple, almond and peach, wild bushes, roses, birds. They dispel the sadness of the saddest hearts.” Most Kashmiri papier-mâché boxes that adorn homes across the globe are a riot of floral motifs: roses, irises, carnations, poppies, lotuses, narcissus, daffodils, as well as grape vines and chinar leaves. Masrat’s husband Maqbool Jan, 60, four-time State award winner, is known for his innovative patterns. He was just four when he joined a karkhana, soon after his father’s death. He turned the pain into unmatched craft. “The more symmetrical the flowers and birds are, the more money it fetches,” says Maqbool, as he cleans up a small box that can sell for Rs. 50,000. The boxes he makes with the Dal Lake and Jamia Masjid motifs have fetched him awards but, he says, there is no dignity in being an artisan in Kashmir. “Do you see any political party offering special measures for us in their manifestos? We continue to live in pain. Who asks us if we have money for school fees or food? No one.” He sees a lot of scope for the art. When he designed papier-mâché on the walls of the now-famous Srinagari tea joint Chai Jai, Maqbool saw it as the beginning of a new trend. “I was expecting people to go in for papier-mâché work on their walls, in their children’s bedrooms,” he says. The work on Chai Jai took two years to complete. Since it is located on the banks of the Jhelum, Maqbool created floral prints to match the location. “I wanted people to feel they are in a garden when they sit in the café,” he says.  Fading colours  Instead, papier-mâché is now at its lowest ebb. Three decades of militancy have taken a huge toll, say artisans. Then came the unprecedented floods of 2014, inundating scores of karkhanas on the banks of Khushal Sar lake and in Hasanabad. Finally, this year’s pandemic dried up all offshore orders, especially from Europe, their mainstay. The French, Hamdani says, were the first Western buyers of papier-mâché in the 19th century; they packed pashmina shawls in papier-mâché boxes. “Only tourism can sustain our art. Without that, the craft is doomed. And in the last three decades, tourism has been badly hit,” says Maqbool. Today, he is innovating. Crafting functional products like bridal purses, pen-holders, stands for mobile phones and visiting cards, to keep trade afloat. Ray of hope Meanwhile, a Rs. 2.18 crore World Bank scheme, created after the floods, offers a ray of hope. The artisans are attending workshops with trade experts from across the country to upgrade designs and colours. Both Maqbool and Khan attended the workshops in Srinagar, along with some 600 artisans who have been through the skill assessment and capacity building classes. “The workshop would have been more fruitful if the remuneration was better. I had to give up a day’s work for it,” says Maqbool, “but there were some fruitful interventions like new colour schemes and designs.” For centuries, the colours have been limited to four or five pastel shades, locally called sufiyana rang or colours influenced by Sufi sensibilities, believed to have been an influence on the craft. “We are aiming to establish sustainable artisan-owned institutions,” says Syed Abid Rasheed Shah, CEO of the Economic Reconstruction Agency, the implementing agency of the scheme. “Marketing linkages, orders, and participation in marketing events will be facilitated by experts.” The artisans have pinned a lot of hope on the World Bank project and on a post-pandemic world returning to Kashmir and the Dal Lake, pashmina and papier-mâché. For now, I leave Khan engrossed, head bent close over his creation, his brush dripping bright green.  Many processes and materials — such as the use of smoke as ink, crushed limestones as base and fish fat as colour — are no longer in vogue.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The funny side of pain||Their jokes tickle you to tears. Chances are they have distilled their own tears to make the joke. See this one:  “You start getting condolence calls when someone passes away. I’ve counted and categorised them into five types.   The first type is when someone will call and say, ‘Hello son, she’s in a better place.’   [Then addressing audience] ‘Have you been there or what? How do you know it’s a better place, f*****? She didn’t buy two tickets to Goa, understood? Better place, it seems.”  This opener to a much longer joke was performed by stand-up comic Neville Shah 15 days after his mother died in February 2018. “I had hit rock bottom when my mom passed away, and I started therapy. For me to be able to start talking about any vulnerability or feeling on stage was almost a natural progression. It started to become a form of release as well.” It helped him cope with a lot of anger, he adds.  The stereotype of the depressed comic has been around for a long time — Stephen Fry, Lenny Bruce, Joan Rivers, John Belushi, Robin Williams; the sad face behind the happy mask, those who mine their own pain and vulnerabilities to make others laugh. Although Shah doesn’t agree with the stereotype, he says, “I don’t think happiness is funny.” Improviser and stand-up comedian Kaneez Surka talks about a recent experience where she heard a song by a Goan singer asking God to answer the prayers of Fado (a genre of Portugese folk music) musicians because they sing from a place of such sadness. “I looked at my friend and said, ‘She should include comedians in that too.’ I found it so relatable. We talk from a lot of pain.” Surka has been seeing a therapist for the past four years for anger issues that stemmed from her teenage days. “I went to therapy to see how I can understand Kaneez Surka and what’s going through her brain.” The openness and sense of camaraderie among comedians helped her feel more accepting of her own issues and herself. Having seen the benefits first-hand, a master’s degree to explore the correlation between improvisational comedy and therapy is on her mind. This is, of course, not to say that all comics are depressed. There have been no studies in India about the sad clown paradox. And yet a host of prominent names in this small but growing industry have been vocal about their own mental health challenges and about seeking help. Personal therapist “Many artists see therapists. It’s as common as having a gym trainer,” says Balraj Singh Ghai, owner of Mumbai’s The Habitat comedy club. “If someone starts talking about these topics in the green room, there’s always someone else who will say, ‘I can see what your problem is. I think you should go see this person.’” The refrain among comics is that cracking jokes helps them either drown out their own miseries or express their emotions as they work their way through the turmoil. “At least 75% of the comedians I’m seeing or have seen have developed humour as a defence mechanism to fight their issues. That is something you can differentiate from the routine clients we see,” says consultant psychiatrist Dr. Shyam Mithiya, who has had at least 20 comedian patients over the past four-five years. It certainly does not mean comedians are more depressed than, say, lawyers or engineers, according to the mental health professionals. “You probably hear comedians say it out a lot more because we speak about these things. I feel anybody and everybody could go through this,” says comedian Danish Sait, who has spoken about his battles with depression. He credits therapy, medication, and a conscious effort to prioritise things for being able to turn himself around.  Clinical psychologist and psychotherapist Narendra Kinger, who has been treating 8-10 comedians over the past 18 months, also attributes it to the creative nature of the profession. “People who are more right-brained have more mood disorders and mood swings and fluctuations... Creative professions probably involve higher levels of anxiety because there’s no structure or timing to the work... They have to put themselves out there on a limb every time they perform,” he adds. Dr. Mithiya concurs. He says anxiety is the most common problem many comedians face due to the pressure of performance. But the subject of mental health also lends itself well to comedy, which is also why they find it pouring out into their work, unlike musicians or actors. “But what they do is helpful for us to destigmatise the issue as well.” Calling them extremely intelligent, introverted and self-aware people, Kinger says they tend to analyse their families, the stupidity around them and the hypocrisy we all face in our lives. He says, in a way, what they do on stage by sharing a part of themselves with a group of strangers is also therapeutic work. “They understand their own triggers and some of them eventually even make jokes about it.”  But will all the joking make it the next cool thing to talk about, taking away from the seriousness of the issue? The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 15% of Indian adults need active intervention for one or more mental health issues. Shah understands how serious that actually is. During the lockdown, he has been conducting a Stream for Sanity series on his YouTube channel where he assembles mental health experts to address some of the questions he gets from the audience. “So many people are going through so much similar s***!” Besides, he is sure the audience will pick up on frivolous jokes on this subject. “They have a great bulls***-meter now.” And even if joking about it or seeking therapy does become the new ‘woke’ thing, that may not be so bad, Surka says. “If there is going to be a trend, then seeking therapy is a great trend as opposed to some, I don’t know, make-up trend. I don’t see the negative side of this.” The writer is a Delhi-based freelance journalist.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Land of many histories||In the newly constituted Bihar assembly, MLA Akhtarul Iman said he would take his oath not with Hindustan, but with Bharat, as the Constitution mentions Bharat and not Hindustan. There was a minor commotion as it was clear that Iman wanted to underline that he was not a citizen of ‘Hindustan’. This understanding of Hindustan as Hindu sthan was ironic, as the two stand in complete contrast to each other — Hindustan, indicating those that lived on this side of the river Sindhu and later as “an archive, a space and a belonging for diverse people” versus Hindu sthan , a land for those who identify by the Hindu faith, something popularised by Savarkar’s Hindutva. Hindustan, Hindusthan , Bharat or India, the title we choose to ascribe to this land, and how that shapes it is the subject of Manan Ahmed’s examination in The Loss of Hindustan , a masterful journey into many histories of the sub-continent. It is about a history written by powerful colonisers which went onto define it to the outsider, and later became the worldview of the inhabitants themselves. It is about reading history to see the present clearly and then examine the future. Ahmed’s work is of traversing the history of histories in India over the ages and explain how it served as a precursor to people’s evaluation of themselves. The Loss of Hindustan boldly tackles the question of present-day prejudices and majoritarian sentiment in the sub-continent, whether Hindutva or Sunni Muslim, and what it might owe to how history has been crafted in the past two centuries. Foreigner mode The Hindu revivalist framing of India of first ancient ‘glorious’ Hindu rule, then ‘dark’ medieval Muslim rule, followed by the British rule is closely derived from the James Mill kind of writing, which kept slightly less than one half of the citizenry in perpetual foreigner mode. Manan says that this idea of the Muslim as foreigner was made possible, as mostly British officers or “soldier-scribes” wrote history, relying on but then selectively carving out and distorting rich histories written by Indians of their past. Nearly one-third of the book is about this “bowlderisation” of older histories, especially that of the early 17th century Deccani historian, Muhammed Qasim Firishta’s Tarikh-i-Firishta . Firishta had seen his task as writing history of a wide variety of people. The threat he identified early on was of war-mongering Europeans. Alexander Dow, Jonathan Scott and John Briggs treated the Tarikh cynically, to write their own versions — seizing its treasures but mauling its soul. The destruction of the notion of Hindustan was not only about its geography. The template the colonial writers found necessary to implant, especially after their reading of the 1857 disruption of the Company’s plunder, is well elaborated on Page 66 — “the paradigm of the five thousand years, with its attendant Golden Age, had posited an India that was timeless, devoid of historical change — a conceptualisation that cemented itself as the very notion of a lack of history itself. In contrast to ‘native’ India was the Muslim invader from Arabia.” Cleaving in the mind Any sense of shared and bonded living, exemplified by ‘Hindustan’ had to be destroyed to ensure a durable innings for the Crown and for it to be thought of as a force of good. For both, there was no better place to start than with the history books. The erasure of Hindustan via building these histories was important to keep the jewel in the crown under control and the needs of the British empire were to be served. But the cleaving that followed in the mind had long-standing implications, as it shaped India’s early 20th century and eventually led to Partition. All ideas of nationhood must draw on an imagination or draw up an imagination of the nation, and memory and history is central to those ideas. Decades after the idea of Hindustan was sandpapered into India, leading to a yearning for an ethnic division, India’s first future Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote The Discovery of India in Ahmednagar prison in 1944. That too wove together an imagination about India, its ancient past and imbued it with values that would help in forging a nationhood with diversity as its central feature, and accommodation a national ideal. This sense that India and the sub-continent was a crucible across millennia, gave every kind of Indian a stake in the project as well as accorded a sense of exceptionalism to Indians in South Asia. Amidst a region of nations defined by ethnicity, India stood as a glorious outlier. At this dangerous time when India becomes indistinguishable from its neighbours it once gave sermons to, what must historians do? Manan has two insights to offer, the first a clear acceptance by them that history can actually impact real lives as dangerous “narratives of separation” can move quickly “from books to the market.” Secondly, apart from the acknowledgement of loss, they should quickly “imagine ways forward that do not yield to the majoritarian present, that do not inherit the past as a certainty, and do not romanticize that which is lost.” The Loss of Hindustan sees itself as part of “our collective responsibility to speak against the conformism of prejudice” as well as “our collective task to reimagine the past.”  The reviewer is a journalist based in Delhi.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||‘There are no 10 ways to save the planet’||Over the last five decades, Sunita Narain has been striving to make environmental consciousness everybody’s business. Be it her work on rainwater harvesting, efforts to introduce CNG in Delhi, advocacy of pro-poor policies, or the fight for an equitable climate change agreement, the Padma Shri awardee has been a strong voice championing climate justice. When I speak with Narain, she is fielding calls and emails after the release of ‘Honeygate’, the Centre for Science and Environment’s (CSE) report on honey adulteration. Not many know that the investigation took all of three months and was done entirely during the lockdown. No mean feat for the environmentalist, who won Edinburgh Medal 2020 last month, awarded for significant contributions to science and technology and to the wellbeing of humanity. “COVID-19 is the result of our progressively worsening dystopian relationship with nature,” she said at the virtual awards ceremony, adding that the climate crisis was making the world’s poor even more marginalised and insecure. Excerpts from an interview: What led to the Honeygate investigation? We kept getting distress calls from beekeepers in North India who said the market price for honey had crashed and it wasn’t selling. On the other hand, there is anecdotal data that suggests COVID-19 has led to an increase in honey consumption because of its immunity-boosting and anti-inflammatory properties. We were intrigued with the beekeepers’ claims who, in literal Chinese whispers, spoke about a ‘Chinese syrup’ that was being used to adulterate honey. We went on to find the ‘designer’ syrup that could bypass Indian rules and also studied how they have been altered over the years. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been putting out notices about a similar ‘rice syrup’ being imported to India. When we spiked it with raw honey, it cleared all the lab tests. This was really scary. We then sent samples from 13 big brands for advanced testing to Germany and they failed the test. The business of adulteration is a sophisticated one. The bigger concern is the threat to bees. They are the harbingers of the ecosystem’s health and if not for them, you won’t have food productivity. It was the bee colonies’ collapse that pointed to the overuse of pesticides in large parts of the world and in India. As for the backlash from companies, this is a textbook case. The first response is to deny, then bring in scientific jugglery with test reports, followed by attacks on us as ‘foreign agents’. What we are expecting now is that they will use the government to target us and prove us wrong. They have huge ad spends to convince the customer and this worries us enormously. We have made our presentation to FSSAI and hope the regulator will take it forward. Is it too late to reverse the climate crisis? I will never say it is too late. But yes, we are running out of time. Climate change has been talked about, at least seriously, in international negotiations since 1991. Since then, the world has only procrastinated, prevaricated and delayed serious action — we are already seeing the consequences. There are no 10 ways to save the planet. But governments all over the world are certain that there are ways in which you can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. No country has really made big-time investments to move out of fossil fuel yet. Some exceptions are the U.S. (shifted from coal to gas, which is still a fossil fuel), Germany (solar), the U.K., Norway and Denmark (offshore wind), and Sweden (biomass, hydro and nuclear). If you can reduce emissions from the energy sector, don’t increase it somewhere else. For instance, in the U.S., they have had a massive 30% reduction in energy-related emissions in the last decade, but the country’s consumption has increased as fuel is cheaper. Now, their emissions are higher than in 2016. We need to reduce energy-related emissions and also ensure that we bring change in every other field, particularly transportation. The poor and the farmers are the worst victims of climate change. They are not responsible for the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but are the victims of our excesses. World over, young people are urging us to take climate change seriously. We need to pay heed to those voices. These are interesting times from which we should learn and change the way we are doing things. Unfortunately, our governance systems are still wedded to the old ways and not ready to change. What are your views on the controversial draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 and the impact the proposed expansion projects, in Mollem and the Jolly Grant airport, for instance, will have on India’s environment? This is the final nail in a coffin. But you already have a coffin made out of the corruption of environmental clearance procedures. The scrutiny of projects is being done today by faceless committees who take no responsibility for their decisions. For instance, the Navi Mumbai airport proposal went through years of convoluted decision-making. Environmentalists opposed it, but the government finally cleared it with conditions. Once the airport is built, is there any way to check whether those conditions have been complied with? No, because there is no monitoring. The EIA notification has already been killed by successive governments, not just the current one. We should be demanding a better process of environmental clearance instead of clinging to the draft. Do you think the Biden-Harris team will change the way the U.S. has handled the climate crisis till now? The change of top leadership in the U.S. is important for the climate movement as the former president was so out of sync with reality and a climate-change denier. The Biden-Harris team has clearly stated that they are committed to climate change action, and we need them to take effective action. What the U.S. does is important for climate change negotiations because, in some sense, it’s an indicator species. If they are able to do things then the whole world will do it. In India, we need to do a lot more. There is an awareness among the top leadership of the need to do things, but I don’t think there is enough knowledge about the scale at which we need to act. When it comes to air pollution, for instance, I have been arguing that just like we had CNG for vehicles, we need to have natural gas for industries. It’s a win-win situation because you have industrial growth, but without pollution. But that requires a different taxation system. India needs what we call the co-benefit approach: we need economic growth but we need to do it in a way that lowers air pollution.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||A mouthful of heaven||Sometime last year, during a book launch, I was interacting with a European author after his eloquent talk when he asked me if my name meant ‘that yellow-coloured soft sweet that’s eaten in the mornings’. I was already a fan of malaiyo, which fits the description, but could not for the life of me figure out why he had referred to my name. Best dessert Then, a few weeks later, a friend asked if my name derived from the Lucknowi dish available only during the winters. A sweet similar to the Daulat ki Chaat she had eaten in Old Delhi, she said. Vir Sanghvi’s account of the street food festival in Delhi, where Varanasi took the honours, had prompted her question. By this time, I was intrigued and looked up malaiyo, Daulat ki Chaat and, of course, nimish. It turns out the dish has a fourth name too — malai makhan. Ashish Mamgain writes in an article titled ‘If you could eat the clouds...’ that “the same ‘chaat’ is available in other parts of north India, but it goes by different names, such as malai makhan in Kanpur, malaiyo in Varanasi, and nimish in Lucknow”. In love with the sweet, he says, “The moment you put it in your mouth, it just melts away. So much so, that a person trying it for the very first time is very likely to be left bemused.” Another writer, Sabyasachi Roy Choudhury, says, “The dish has subtle differences from place to place. Silver foil, rose water and mawa are some ingredients in these variations.” Chand Sur and Sunita Kohli in The Lucknow Cookbook describe nimish as a “famous and unique Lucknow speciality.” “The basic preparation of nimish is when milk is poured into large flat pans and left in the open before dawn. When the early morning dew falls on the milk, it creates a froth which is as light as air,” they say. The dish, however, does not find mention in Mirza Jafar Husain’s The Classic Cuisine of Lucknow: A Food Memoir . Silent contentment A conversation with another friend who has grown up in Old Delhi reaffirmed what I had found earlier on the web — that the ‘cloud’ disappeared some years ago and has made a comeback of sorts in recent times. Food writer Rahul Verma enjoyed it at Jashn-e-Rekhta, a festival celebrating Urdu, and described it as “the best dessert in the world”.  In Varanasi, I spoke with Somnathbhai in between his brisk sales of malaiyo near Chowk. As he handed over the “cloud” in kulhads to customers, he spoke of how Chowk and Chowkhamba — the heart of Varanasi — continue to be the localities in town for malaiyo. The season for malaiyo is the period between Diwali and Shivratri. But apparently, sales begin to dip after Makar Sankranti. As we extended our empty kulhads for a refill, this time with milk, Somnathbhai proudly declared that he had introduced flavours like chocolate and strawberry and was now getting party orders during the ‘season’. The cost of a serving, at Rs. 30 or Rs. 50 depending on size, includes the refill with milk. I can savour malaiyo before breakfast, after breakfast, and both before and after breakfast. In each of these scenarios, I usually end up in silent contentment. I am yet to figure out how a dish that appears so light gives so much satisfaction. Maybe there’s a message here. Not everyone is crazy about it though. One friend was somewhat apprehensive of the quality of milk and the methods used to make the dish today, while students at a school on the town’s outskirts had not even tasted the dish. Other friends in Varanasi insist that although some shops now serve it through the day, the asli (real) stuff is available only in the mornings.   In her mouth-watering book, Korma, Kheer and Kismet: Five Seasons in Old Delhi , Scottish journalist Pamela Timms writes this about malaiyo: “It resembles uncooked meringue and the taste is shocking in its subtlety, more molecular gastronomy than raunchy street food, a light foam that disappears instantly on the tongue, leaving behind the merest hint of sweetness, cream, saffron, sugar and nuts; tantalizing, almost not there. I’ve often wondered if it is a preview of what might be on the menu should we make it as far as the pearly gates.” I quite agree. The writer is a history buff and avid blogger.  I am yet to figure out how a dish that appears so light gives so much satisfaction.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Some tips on masks||We are now living in the golden age of masks. Everyone is wearing masks. In pre-modern times, only the elites did. The French aristocracy, for instance, used to have masked balls. In Italy, rich people used to have orgies where everyone wore masks. There is a film calledEyes Wide Shutby Stanley Kubrick where Tom Cruise goes to an orgy wearing a mask, and almost gets killed because his mask was not covering his nose — a common failing among Indian mask-wearers. Personally, I have never attended an orgy, with or without a mask. I would also recommend against attending one, given that interpersonal, multi-player interactions of this kind are not part of Indian culture. We are, after all, a conservative society whose population has come to current levels purely by floral pollination. Knowing it But a society tends to have all kinds of elements. I know there are people out there who put other people at risk by refusing to wear a mask or wearing the wrong mask at the right place. Such mistakes can prove fatal in an orgy, as Tom Cruise discovers inEyes Wide Shut. This is why it is important to know the do’s and don’ts of masks. The first thing to remember, if you’re planning on attending an interpersonal, multi-player floral pollination this New Year’s eve, is that they don’t accept the kind of masks used by decent, family-wala people like me. For instance, if you live in Delhi, where the Air Quality Index right now is 997, chances are you’re using an N-95 respirator mask. This is not a bad mask — it offers 95% protection. But orgies won’t accept N-95 masks. The reason: they already have air purifiers in every room. Ditto for surgical masks. Yes, it’s true that inEyes Wide Shut, Tom Cruise is a doctor and even performs a medical procedure on the sidelines of an orgy. But let me ask you: do you ever see him in a surgical mask? No. Surgical masks are okay for the operation theatre but not for other kinds of theatre where, typically, more artistic masks are preferred. Destination Venice If you want a mask exactly like the one Tom Cruise was wearing, I must inform you that they are only available at Kartaruga Mascheraio, the Venetian atelier. They are located at Calle Paradiso, near the Rialto bridge, and are open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. If you can’t be bothered to fly to Venice, you can order one online. But before you do, remember: The mask should be appropriate for your personality. If you are a bhakt, for instance, then go for a traditional Modi mask. It might look very basic, but it offers more protection against more risks than the world’s most advanced medical masks. Even a multi-layer, multi-fabric, neem-coated N-95 can only protect you from contracting respiratory illnesses. It won’t protect you from the lethal risks posed by diseases such as free speech and dissent, which have a high case fatality rate in India. Stock up So, even if you’re not a bhakt, in case you happen to live in a country with too much democracy, I would advise you to stock up on Modi masks. Besides personality, another factor is the shape of your face. If you have a short nose, for instance, no one can stop you from wearing a Plague Doctor Venetian Long Nose Mask. Of course, I’d think twice before picking a Plague Doctor mask during a pandemic. But if you are a habitual liar with a tiny nose that makes you feel inadequate, then go for a Latex Long Nose Beak Bird Mask. This is an excellent all-rounder mask that can also be worn in crowded places other than an orgy. For instance, you could wear the Bird Beak Mask to a protest, or a prison, which is where you will end up if you do go to a protest. While the long beak will automatically enforce social distancing, the soft lenses — this mask comes with transparent, bird eye-like lenses for the eyes — will ensure your glasses don’t steam up. The balaclava The last but most important thing to bear in mind when buying a mask is your purpose. Let’s say you have no intention of attending an orgy, and only wish to rob a bank. Then I would suggest the perennial favourite of bank robbers: the balaclava. Some bank robbers prefer home-made bandannas as they would be non-traceable for law enforcement. But I wouldn’t advise them unless you’re robbing a bank while being Covid-positive, in which case a home-made cloth mask would definitely protect your associates from catching the infection when you’re travelling together in the getaway van. But many Indian banks are sick — so do check their financial health before making plans. If you are neither an orgy enthusiast nor a bank robber and need a mask solely for protection against coronavirus, my advice to you is simple: stay home, wait for vaccine, and stop reading about orgies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/some-tips-on-masks/article33376124.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Read me to the edge of time||Let me share with you a secret that you as readers probably already know. Books have saved us. In these past few weeks, amid much talk of structures that will symbolise a new India, my thoughts have turned instead to the institutions that were to me the fondest symbol of an old India — libraries. Worry not, however; this column will not be a lament of the liberal performing nostalgia and righteousness in equal measure via some imagined disappearance. For libraries still exist, as do library builders. A library to me symbolises the other end of the loneliness that has been this pandemic; it is a more potent and contemplative form of chosen isolation meant to allow one to retreat into forms of knowledge only to emerge wiser, more prepared and more informed. And all this, surrounded by others seeking similar respite. Collectively, we withdraw from the immediate world into multiple other worlds of other spaces and times, providing the resolute certainty that this too shall pass, as much has passed before. Libraries also produce greatly needed forms of community and gathering. From neighborhood lending libraries, where geeky children of many classes find access to that coveted book, to the community reading room for garrulous folks of all reading and talking stripes, they can be platforms for multiple forms of egalitarianism. The university library, where I sat out most of my graduate education, was a stage for all kinds of bodies, affects, and interactions. And then there is of course, the regular reel and real-life role that libraries play, allowing tentative and shy lovers to steal the occasional kiss and then some, behind rows of books that haven’t seen the light of readership for many years. Feared and fetishised Here I must also speak of the figure common to all libraries, the feared but also fetishised librarian. On the one hand, librarians in India symbolise discipline and order. They are the last frontier between careless and thieving readers and well-catalogued shelves, especially in a postcolonial country that had to, at one point, provide books to American libraries in exchange for wheat. (P.L.480 if you are interested; and many thanks to historian, author and translator A.R.Venkatachalapathy for the timely reference.) At the other end of the spectrum, Americans imagine the librarian as a trope of sexiness and a reference for Halloween costumes. Cultural anthropologist Dustin M. Wax argues in a post on the anthropology blog Savage Minds that the sexy librarian became central to the American erotic imagination precisely because of the de-sexualisation entailed by the times in which female librarians entered public spaces. In his words, “the sexy librarian is seen as not just a woman underneath, but a super-sexual being, a “freak”, a “wild one”. She is a prize to be taken, a treasure to be captured, an exotic animal barely tamed beneath her bun and shapeless cardigan.” But the stories of libraries and librarians that give wind to my wings these days have nothing to do with either of these tropes. Consider, for example, the work of The Community Library Project (TCLP), committed to “the work of building the movement for a publicly owned, free library system that is accessible to all.” Or the much circulated story of P.V. Chinnathambi, who in the words of P. Sainath, runs “one of the loneliest libraries in the forested wilderness of Kerala’s Idukki district”, and whose 160 books “are regularly borrowed, read and returned by poor Muthavan Adivasis”. I like to think of these libraries and their librarians as balms to the increasing isolation brought on by the personal laptop, headphones, growing social distance, and the losses entailed by a modernity of much promise and little hope. At one online meeting I attended during these past few months, nobody spoke — we all just read together. Even though it was a poor substitute for the real thing, it reminded me of many a pleasant afternoon I have spent in Chennai’s winter sun at the Anna Centenary Library. Here, one December day of a different year, in the company of other heads bobbing in and out of books, I found staring at me my former advisor John Hartigan’s book Odd Tribes . In a new city, among new friends, I felt all right.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/read-me-to-the-edge-of-time/article33376141.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Inside the tortoise||To have compassion for those who suffer is a human quality which everyone should possess…” Thus begins Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron , written against the backdrop of the Black Death of 1348. It’s an interesting opening, made particularly poignant by the implication that compassion, though a necessary human quality, is not something all humans possess. Compassion is linked to empathy, and empathy is central to literature. How can you relate to a work of literature, let alone the voices or characters in it, unless you empathise with others? After all, they are by other people and about other people. It is little wonder then that pandemics have tended to evoke literary and cultural responses, with this one already producing a spate of work, and it’s not even over yet. In Boccaccio’s footsteps Months ago, I contributed to Decameron 2020, envisioned by the major Italian writer, Erri de Luca, a collaborative project with writers producing texts that are read out by actors on YouTube. Elsewhere, Michelle Stevens and Clair Whitefield set up a website to showcase pandemic literature. Nigerian-American writer Chimamanda Adichie wrote a moving personal essay for The New Yorker . Arundhati Roy adopted a more political tone in the Financial Times , as did Amartya Sen. Jhumpa Lahiri in Vogue wrote about how words help us heal and connect. I suspect there is hardly a writer who hasn’t written something. Books and booklets soon followed. In June, I did a series of rewritings of Shakespeare’s sonnets, published as Quarantined Sonnets by Kitaab. Penguin published a slim collection of essays, Intimations, by Zadie Smith. In one essay, Smith notes that “it is possible to penetrate the bubble of privilege and pop it — whereas the suffering bubble is impermeable.” There were anthologies too, like And We Came Outside and Saw the Stars Again and A Thousand Cranes for India . Of course, I am leaving out the most significant writings, the scientific ones, because I am focusing on books and articles that, so to say, follow in Boccaccio’s footsteps: texts of a cultural provenance, including books of ideas, like those penned by Bernard-Henri Lévy and Slavoj Žižek. Is it not significant that the two books — from the established Right and Left — largely disappoint? Žižek’s Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World argues that the pandemic is a wake-up call, marking the melting of orthodoxies, and the world needs a new form of communism. In contrast, Lévy’s The Virus in the Age of Madness argues that we essentially need to get back to normal quickly and considers calls for change ‘obscene’. Lévy’s book is filled with a loud hollowness, evident if you pose questions such as: “Would calls for change after the Holocaust also be considered obscene?” But Žižek’s book, despite calling for change, also leaves one feeling empty. There seems to be little more than a call in it, sounds already made so often that they are like the waves when you’ve been sailing for some time: you no longer really hear them. Both books contain too many words, too many ready answers. Despite their erudition, the extracts I could bear to read reminded me of Twitter. I also feel a degree of disappointment when I read the literary essays. Many of them are personal, sensitive musings, with a gesture or two indicating that the fallout won’t be equally shared. A few, like Arundhati Roy’s ‘The Pandemic is a Portal’, talk of the sufferings of migrant workers, but I was still left with a sense of déja vu. Perhaps her conclusion that COVID-19 “has made the mighty kneel and brought the world to a halt” is an indication of our failures as a generation. The very rich, including in India, grew their fortunes by 25% in 2020, even as at least 250 million people became unemployed. Wait for the best It is obvious that the profusion of pandemic writing is not simply the index of a world fighting a virus. It is also an index of the capacity to be secluded and indulge in creative activities in relative safety. In that sense, it is an index of privilege. This relative safety is unlikely to enable us to engage with full complexity — let alone come up with answers that will apply to the millions who are not safe, never have been and never will be safe. This is why I, for one, am still waiting for significant literature to emerge from this pandemic. Perhaps it will come after the event. Literature takes time. That is the difference between computing and contemplation. Perhaps significant literature will come from those who walked miles to reach ‘home’, or lost jobs or had their homes repossessed, if (like Manoranjan Byapari) they ever get the chance to write. Perhaps it will come when we, the relatively safe, begin to meet the millions who could not retract their heads, like we did, into the carapace of a lockdown. Or, perhaps, it will come tangentially. Shakespeare’s King Lear , most scholars say, was written during the plague. King Lear is not about the plague, and yet it is the most angry and despairing of Shakespeare’s plays, castigating not just the powerful, but also questioning if “the Gods are just.” It contains what one critic has called the “bleakest pentameter” in English: “Never, never, never, never, never.” This is Lear, no longer king, lamenting over his lifeless daughter, who might not, should not, have died. The writer is an Indian novelist and academic who teaches in Denmark.  It is obvious that the profusion of pandemic writing is not simply the index of a world fighting a virus. It is also an index of the capacity to be secluded and indulge in creative activities in relative safety||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/inside-the-tortoise/article33376096.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Wind in the sails||Waiting with apprehension for the landfall of Cyclone Nivar, my mind conjured up visions of maniacally swaying trees crashing down on our house. Anxiously, I suggested to my husband that perhaps it would better to move to a hotel with our important papers and jewellery. He countered wryly that trees could fall on the hotel too, and it may be better to stay put. Contrast this with our school days when we would pray for incessant rain so that the authorities would declare a holiday. Working life, however, throws up its own challenges. I recall with horror the notorious Chennai floods of 2015. On that unforgettable day, as office closed at 6 p.m., colleagues began to pack up and leave. I had more than a couple of sources for cabs and was not too worried about getting home. But calling up one cab operator after the other, I got the same response. All their cabs were out, booked much earlier in the day, but still stuck on chaotic, flooded roads. An hour-and-a-half went by in this futile exercise. The calls from my anxious folks at home kept coming in, enquiring if I had left office as it was raining heavily and there were dire predictions of worse to come. I could think of no solution and imagined spending the night all alone at office. Then a miracle happened. The landline in the office rang. “Hi, how come you are still in office? I really didn’t expect anyone to take this call, but wanted to try anyway. I’ve left my wallet on my desk. Can you pick it up? I’ll collect it from you later. But how are you going home? Roads are flooded.” It was my colleague Zayed. “I have no means of transport. I am really stuck, Zayed,” I said. Magical words Then Zayed spouted sweet, magical words: “Hold on. I have a cousin who recently bought an SUV which is rain- and flood-worthy! His office is close to ours and I’ll ask him to give you a ride home.” Thus, seated in a brand new SUV, I was able to travel through the streets of Chennai which had become one endless flowing river, and reach home, much to the relief of my folks. That night, my mother had a monsoon tale of decades ago when we as tiny tots played in rainwater left behind by a cyclone. With my mother busy in the kitchen, we played with empty coconut shells at an imaginary tea party. The shells were filled with the dirty rainwater and handed out for consumption until a neighbour spotted us, and frantically hollered to my mother, “Your little ones are drinking dirty stagnant rainwater.” Well, I have survived that tea party and weathered many cyclones and will, I guess, continue to do so for years to come. santalakshmi@outlook.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/wind-in-the-sails/article33376080.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The name’s not Bond||What do you think spies are? Priests, saints and martyrs? They’re a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors, too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives.” So says Alec Leamas, the cynical, world-weary, 50-something protagonist of John le Carré’s 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  The words represent the paradigm shift that le Carré brought to the idea of spies in the popular imagination, an idea nourished by the debonair derring-do of Ian Fleming’s James Bond, whose macho romps through danger and dangerous women oozed glamour and pizzazz. In contrast, the world of Cold War espionage as wrought by le Carré is complex and sordid — sordid in its deceit, corruption and treachery, sordid in its shadowy machinations and muddling of good and evil. But once readers got a taste of it, they felt it was the real thing. Murky moral universe John le Carré, born David Cornwell, who died on December 12 at the age of 89, was, without doubt, the greatest master of the spy novel. Densely plotted and vividly characterised, his books are not just suspense storytelling at its best, but also depictions of a murky moral universe, and of human beings who are both participants in and victims of vast, invisible iniquities that the liberal West is as guilty of perpetrating as are regions less known for their dedication to human life. In 1948, when he was just 16, le Carré began working for the British secret service while studying German at University of Berne, and then while at Oxford a few years later. After a short stint as a teacher at Eton, he joined the British Foreign Office in 1958, and spent the next few years recruiting and running spies on the other side of the Iron Curtain. While at it, he was also trying his hand at writing. He published his first novel, Call for the Dead (1961) under the name of John le Carré, since service rules didn’t allow him to use his own name. Fame came with his third book, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, a gritty tour de force  which Graham Greene called the “the best spy story I have ever read”. He left the Foreign Office soon after — according to some reports, because his identity was outed by British double agent Kim Philby, who decamped to Moscow in 1963. However, le Carré continued to maintain, till as late as the 1980s, that his work at the British foreign office had not involved espionage. Meanwhile, in novel after novel, he spun his bleak, richly-detailed world of spy craft, orchestrated from on high by the ‘Circus’, his rather delicious name for the London-based headquarters of MI6. Its most memorable denizen is, of course, George Smiley. Short, podgy, donnish and a cuckold to boot, Smiley is a super spook who is the very antithesis of James Bond. He appears in multiple books, but most centrally in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1974), The Honourable Schoolboy (1977) and Smiley’s People (1979) — a thrilling trifecta of intrigue, where he is locked in a deadly battle of wits with his KGB counterpart, Karla. After the Cold War When the Cold War ended, some felt that le Carré would lose his muse. Not so. He focused on other battle zones and wrote about them with his usual forensic flair: the international arms trade in The Night Manager (1993), the predations of big pharma in The Constant Gardener (2001), the war on Iraq in Absolute Friends (2003), and so on. His 2008 novel, A Most Wanted Man, is a gut-wrenching story of a Muslim immigrant destroyed by Western intelligence agencies amidst the post-9/11 paranoia. Deception and betrayal are central to le Carré’s works, and that’s not merely because of his experience in espionage. The roots go deeper — to his childhood and his fraught relationship with his father, Ronnie Cornwell, a charming con man. In his 2016 memoir, The Pigeon Tunnel , le Carré calls him a “fantasist and an occasional jail bird”, who often wrote to him from foreign prisons asking for money. There are clear echoes of Ronnie in the character of Rick Pym, father of Magnus Pym, the troubled double agent and protagonist of A Perfect Spy (1986), which is also le Carré’s most autobiographical novel. Le Carré, who married twice and had four sons, wrote 25 novels over a career spanning almost 60 years. Despite the indubitable literary merit of his works and the fact that they transcend the narrow descriptor of spy fiction, he consistently eschewed prizes and awards. When he was nominated for the Man Booker in 2011 for lifetime contribution to fiction, he had his name removed from the list. Bred in the Cold War era, le Carré may have rejoiced in the fall of communism, but he was, till the end, furiously indignant about the loathsomeness and hubris of states. He saw the world change — and then saw that it hadn’t really, and that the same games of power and violence and treachery were being played again and again. In his passing, we have lost a giant, and a mighty chronicler of our times. The writer is a journalist and author.  Deception and betrayal are central to le Carré’s works, and that’s not merely because of his experience in espionage||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-names-not-bond/article33376095.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Ferns on her sador||The book of short stories titled Mariam Austin othoba Hira Barua that won for Arupa Patangia Kalita the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2014 has now been translated from Assamese to English by Ranjita Biswas, opening another sensitive window to a corner of the elusive Northeast. The 15 stories are soaked in nostalgia for a way of life slowly disappearing from interior Assam, which Kalita memorialises here with a tenderness that is immediately apparent. Each grinding stone, each wood stove, each bakul tree and fragrant malati flower is dwelt over lovingly, as if she were touching a beloved’s belongings after he was gone. In doing so, Kalita performs in this book a task more important than its literary function — she becomes a cultural anthropologist, cataloguing customs and manners, festivals and foods in vivid detail, ensuring a life for these accounts well beyond the margins of the simple stories they tell. In ‘The Girl with Long Hair’, Kalita describes the young Mainao’s hand-woven sadors with the farou-megan motif of pigeons or the dhekia pattern of ferns. A young man is served tea with tekeli pitha, stuffed with sesame and jaggery. The details are lovely. Three skeins run through the stories — the heavy toll that a conflict-torn Assam takes on everyday life; the loneliness of old age; and the intrusion of raucous modernity into a gentle land. The last of these is perhaps the most weakly treated idea, descending into over-wrought prose and melodrama in stories like ‘Scream’ and ‘The Auspicious Day’. The title’s eponymous story stands out, a masterly delineation of an elderly woman’s lonely life and her dependence on her beloved dog. ‘A Warm Jacket for the Son’ is another gem, gently mocking the inept son’s elevation in the eyes of his loving mother who will do anything for him, even steal. Both ‘The Girl with Long Hair’, a tragic account of mindless parochialism, and ‘The House of Nibha Bou’, describing a posse of soldiers wrecking Nibha Bou’s carefully tended home, push back against the politics of othering, gently but tellingly. Oddly, the book starts well, falls into a trough, then rises strongly again, but the good stories abundantly showcase Kalita’s subtle, mellow prose that brings a region and a people glowingly alive.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Breakfast with Kuttan||Reading The Zoo in My Backyard, the first thought that comes to mind is how apt the title is. In just the first few chapters, a black monkey, a baby elephant, a mouse deer, and numerous birds and rabbits have pranced through the pages, kindling amusement, occasional bouts of trepidation, and a heavy dose of nostalgia. “Our friends’ fathers went on official trips to Madras or Delhi and brought them clothes and sweets; ours went to the deep forests of Kerala and brought us young, abandoned wild animals,” Usha Rajagopalan writes at the beginning, aware of how different her growing-up years were. Her father, who worked as Conservator of Forests, is the man at the centre of all the adventures, be it giving a home to an exotic flying squirrel or tending to an injured common parakeet. The animal guests weren’t always entirely welcome — like the baby elephant, Kuttan, with his “bottomless pit for a stomach”, or the surly bear cub — but they were definitely tolerated until they found a new home. Author-conservationist Rajagopalan combines her two passions — for animals and for writing — in this book. Her childhood spent amidst a large, loving family at their ancestral home in Thiruvananthapuram is presented vividly and with a generous dose of humour. The gentle grandfather, the patient mother, the actor-uncle and a host of feisty siblings all come alive in her stories. The newspaper boy nicknamed ‘Pathrows’ (because he threw the patram , newspaper); the pointy-faced squirrel named Judie because of its uncanny resemblance to a teacher; the pomeranian Tommy rechristened Tommynathan to better fit into the South Indian family — all these sketches attest to Rajagopalan’s ability to coax a chuckle out of you.  The Zoo in My Backyard is written in a breezy, anecdotal style popularised by legendary conservationist and writer Gerald Durrell. Followers of Rajagopalan’s former newspaper column may find some of the stories familiar, but it is worth reading them together to get a glimpse into an idyllic life in a family where man-animal boundaries are blurry in the best of ways.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The life of Karunanidhi and a history of Tamil Nadu||M. Karunanidhi (1924-2018), Tamil Nadu’s five-time Chief Minister and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)’s president for nearly 50 years, was a multi-faceted personality. Apart from being one of the most important political leaders of post-Independent India, Karunanidhi was a journalist-editor, playwright, film-maker, and a powerful orator. It is an uphill task to capture essential aspects of Karunanidhi in a book, and Vaasanthi, a veteran writer-journalist, has made an earnest attempt. In less than 275 pages, the author has covered, seemingly with ease and lucidity, many important events not only in the life of Karunanidhi but also of the contemporary political history of Tamil Nadu. She has given an engrossing account of the moments the leader spent with his first wife, Padma; the circumstances under which Padma died and the political context that influenced his thoughts in the formative phase of his long political career, besides his emergence as the DMK’s pivotal figure, post-C.N. Annadurai. Welfare politics A substantial portion of Vaasanthi’s account of Karunanidhi’s political career is dedicated to the last 25-odd years of his life and it is a sympathetic view. Measures taken by Karunanidhi across a range of fields such as agriculture (“uzhavar sandhai” — farmers’ shanties), social sector (health insurance scheme for the poor and “samathuvapuram” — habitation of equality) and technology (promotion of the Information Technology sector) get their due importance. Yet, the author does not hesitate to compare the leader to Dhritarashtra in the Mahabharata , when it comes to matters concerning his family, or mention his naivety towards some of his party colleagues or his encouragement to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during one stint as Chief Minister (1989-91). On the killing of Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) chief K. Padmanabha and 14 others at a flat in Kodambakkam, a busy locality of central Chennai, on the evening of June 19 in 1990, she rightly states that the Karunanidhi government was “jolted out of its delusions [sic]” about the LTTE. There are, however, some inaccuracies in the book. The rice scheme at Rs. 2 per kg was launched in 2006 and not 1996, as stated in the book. Also, the Sarkaria Commission of Inquiry, which went into allegations of corruption against Karunanidhi and some of his ministerial colleagues, submitted its final report in February 1978 which was made public three months later, and not 1988.  Some inaccuracies During the final phase of the civil war in Sri Lanka, Karunanidhi went on a fast on April 27, 2009, three weeks before the end of the war, whereas the book says he did so on May 18, 2009, when the war was over and the death of LTTE chief V. Prabhakaran had been officially declared. As for the breach of privilege proceedings executed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly against The Hindu in 2003, the author has stated that arrest warrants were issued against N. Ram (then Editor-in-Chief) and N. Ravi (the Editor). But, there was no warrant against Mr. Ram as the proceedings were initiated before he assumed charge. Also, the warrant was issued against Malini Parthasarathy, (then Executive Editor), and three others. Besides, the book does not offer a comprehensive analysis of the political factors that went against Karunanidhi in coming back to power so long as M.G. Ramachandran was alive or why the DMK suffered a rout in the 2001 Assembly election despite, to borrow the author’s own words, the “golden period” of Karunanidhi’s reign (1996-2001). Notwithstanding these deficiencies, Vaasanthi’s book is a significant addition to the limited body of political literature on Tamil Nadu's leaders, available for non-Tamil readers.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Easy like Sunday morning||1 On December 20, 1812, two brothers had their book, Kinder-und Hausmärchen (Children’s and Household Tales), published for the first time. They were German academics who were interested in collecting and publishing folklore. The tales had long been passed down orally; stories like ‘Schneewittchen’, ‘Dornröschen’ and ‘Hänsel und Gretel’ are known to have been popular since the early 1700s. Who were these two brothers and how better do we know these stories? 2 ‘The Tiger Grandma’ is a Taiwanese/ Chinese fairy tale dating back to the 1600s. It tells the story of a family of two children and a mother. She has to leave the house, so she tells the kids to be careful and not let any strangers in. A tiger disguises itself as their grandmother, gets into the house, and manages to eat the first child before being found out. This is the earliest version of which familiar fairy tale that features a different animal? 3 This story was initially published as ‘Roland and May-Bird’. In the original, a pair of siblings run away from home and enter a forest where their cruel stepmother — a witch — turns them into animals. They eventually find shelter in a house and are saved by a king. This fairy tale may have originated in the mediaeval period during the Great Famine (1315–22), which forced desperate people to abandon young children to fend for themselves. How better do we know this brother-sister pair now? 4 Earth is unique in the Solar System in that it supports life. This is attributed to the fact that it is in a habitable zone round a star where it is neither too hot, nor too cold. This means the planet can support liquid water, one of the most vital ingredients in life as we know it. This zone is named after a popular fairy tale where the protagonist has very specific tastes of ‘not too hot, not too cold’. What is the name given to this zone? 5 In the original version of this fairy tale, the prince falls in love with the protagonist after seeing her body in a coffin. He begs her helpers for the coffin and they eventually give it to him. As his servants carry it back to the palace, they trip on a tree stump and this dislodges a piece of apple that had been suffocating her. The jolt renders her alive again. What fairy tale is this that sounds more plausible than the version we know, where she is saved by his kiss? 6 Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterised by persistent episodic hypersomnia (excessive time spent sleeping) and cognitive or mood changes. The hypersomnia lasts for about 15-21 hours and leads to excessive appetite. One of the theories for its cause is circadian dysfunction. By what name is this disorder known that refers to a princess who also apparently suffered from hypersomnia? 7 According to a story from the Jataka Tales , there was a beautiful bird with golden feathers who decided to help a poor woman by offering her one of its feathers. One day, the woman became greedy and pulled off all the feathers against her daughter’s wishes. This caused the feathers to turn white and worthless. The same story is found in European fairy tale collections as well. What bird is this that leads to a phrase about short-sighted destruction of a valuable resource? 8 The value and power of using personal names and titles is well established in psychology, management, teaching and trial law. This principle is named after a fairy tale about an imp who spins straw into gold in exchange for a girl’s firstborn. It’s a rare story where the title refers to the villain. What is the imp’s name, which when translated from German means ‘little rattle stilt’? 9 The very first story traditionally in Kinder-und Hausmärchen is about a spoiled princess who befriends an animal that retrieves her ball and eventually transforms into a prince. This story has been retold many times in popular culture, including a memorable version by the Muppets. What animal is this about? 10 The Youth Protection Revision Act was passed by the South Korean Parliament in 2011. It forbids children under the age of 16 from playing online video games between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00. This was done to “act on preventing and solving Internet addiction, including online games”. Due to the specific time when players have to stop what they are doing, by what name is the law better known? A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/easy-like-sunday-morning/article33376133.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Making sense of the present||Humans are sense-making beings. To be so is to want to make sense of what is happening around oneself. And we make sense by making comparisons. It is only when we’re able to relate something to something else that we say we ‘understand’. But what if the phenomenon we are trying to understand is without precedent? Indeed, the adjective ‘unprecedented’ has been widely applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. But was it, really? If global reach and mortality are metrics of comparison, then the Spanish influenza of 1918-21, which caused 50-100 million deaths worldwide, is a horrifying precedent. The 1.6 million lives claimed by the coronavirus so far seem unexceptional in comparison. Huge disruption Yet we all know in our bones that what we’ve lived through is unprecedented. The sweeping lockdowns and the scale of economic disruption are certainly without precedent. Nonetheless, it is to history we must turn to make sense of the present, avers Vinay Lal, a professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles. The discourse on COVID-19 has been dominated by numbers, epidemiological and economic. Lal goes beyond the “empire of facts” to ask social, cultural, and philosophical questions: what does ‘social distancing’ mean in a caste society? Will the coronavirus alter the architecture of the mall? Can we say “we are all in this together” when it’s clear the pandemic has affected different sections differently? In any country one cares to look, ethnic minorities (Blacks in the U.S. and U.K, immigrants in Sweden) have been worse affected, and while the urban poor suffered, billionaires multiplied their wealth. So, how do we make common cause in the name of a ‘shared humanity’ when even death, ‘the great leveller’, seems to discriminate? Lal’s historical sweep and penchant for drawing unlikely parallels, if you don’t mind a prose style partial to subordinate clauses, have a certain professorial charm that can put you in a sweet reverie about plague, famine, and death. You learn that the first ever quarantine law was passed in Dubrovnik on July 27, 1377 during the Black Plague. You wonder if the Indian public’s disregard of their Prime Minister’s ‘CORONA means Koi Road Par Na Nikle ’ diktat — and the disastrous consequences that followed — has a mythological precedent in Sita’s failure to comply with the Laxman Rekha. A warning? And you ponder the probability that the coronavirus is actually a manifestation of Mother Nature’s tough love for humanity — she may have despatched the corona regiment of her microbe army to warn humans that if they don’t mend their rapacious ways, they’ve had it. The zoonotic origins of the coronavirus do suggest that human encroachments into pristine jungle habitats could be generating a blowback whereby pathogens, faced with the extinction of their animal hosts, are evolving to survive on humans. Such intriguing ideas and parallels are legion in this book. But on the whole, it’s an underwhelming read, as they are not developed or integrated into a larger argument about the COVID-19 phenomenon. This is a loose collection of essays themed around the virus rather than a unitary work of non-fiction. Lal puts you in the frame of mind for a sumptuous repast, but as you eagerly await the main course, serves you one appetizer after another.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The higher is calling!||Dear Agony Akka,  It’s been a few months since I graduated, but I haven’t done much about getting a job yet. And no, it’s not COVID-19 that’s stopping me. I am not lazy or anything, but the notion of having to work for a salary strikes me as mercenary. Anyway, mainstream ‘careers’ leave me bored. I think I was made for a higher calling, only I am not sure what that is. I am happy to wait and find out, but my parents are not. Once an hour, every hour, they turn to me and say, “ Dei , what do you want to do in life?” Lately, their tone has become sharper and I find long-lost uncles phoning me with career advice. I think my parents are setting them on me. Last week, Amma even looked pointedly at the celery I had bought and said, “ Adhu spelling enna? Celery -a, salary -a? ” I am feeling very misunderstood. Please help.  — A Sleepy Savant   Dear ASS,  I like surfing on my smartphone. (I own the most expensive phone among all my friends.) Some time ago, I saw a video taken at the panda enclosure of a foreign zoo. Pandas, of course, score high on cuteness quotient, a bit like me in my youth in that sense, but their chief characteristic is their minimal movement. As a species, they seem to prefer languor to locomotion. In the video, when Yin, the biggest panda, wakes up and feels peckish, he stretches out lazily for a bamboo shoot, with all the urgency of a Jeetendra slow-motion song. Sometimes, even that much action proves too exhausting and he rolls over and goes back to sleep, bamboo shoot halfway to mouth. I know this is not exactly like the Jackie Chan action films you probably watch, but there’s something mesmerising about the panda’s extravagant lethargy. I watched the video many times. Now, coming to your parents, it’s entirely possible that the sight of the 20-something, unshaven you lolling in a purple lungi on the couch is not as mesmerising for them as the panda was for me. In fact, I venture to say your masterly inactivity is as far from cutesy panda porn as Kangana is from Mother Teresa. Still, I have a suggestion. Your parents are clearly focused on money. I can’t blame them, if your celery cravings are anything to go by. Why don’t you suggest that they rig up a video camera in the sitting room to livestream your masterly inactivity? In fact, if you are inactive in a hammock, that might be the ‘higher’ calling you are looking for. The success of mind-elevating shows such as Bigg Boss rests entirely on the enduring voyeuristic appeal of watching nothing happen. I understand why your lofty, albeit lazy, mind views mainstream careers with disdain. Like the panda, you fear that you might fall asleep before you attach screwdriver to screw or vernier calipers to well, vernier. But please don’t despair. I am sure there are many alternative careers out there literally calling out for someone with your special skills. Dunlopillo might want someone to test the springiness of their products. Or Berger might want you to watch their paints dry. I recently read about a pet clinic in Dublin that wanted a full-time ‘cat cuddler’ and I believe that lonely people in Japan advertise for ‘human cuddlers’. Of course, these jobs are a bit too loving to exist in India, but there’s a thriving career to be made in the opposite direction. Think of the lakhs you can earn snitching on couples canoodling in parks. Or standing in registration offices reading all the special marriage notices. In fact, you should tell your parents you are in august company. With Parliament’s winter session cancelled, the army of thumb twiddlers has just grown larger. — AA  agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-higher-is-calling/article33376132.ece

He turned his attention to possible 4-1 splits. Some 4-1 spade splits could be handled. Should West have a singleton jack or ten, the ace of spades followed by a low spade to the king would reveal that, and a finesse could be taken through East. He would then need a 3-2 diamond split. A 4-1 split in diamonds was more difficult as it would require a ruff before drawing all the trumps and then a return to dummy with the king of spades. South combined his chances. He cashed the ace of spades, and when no jack or 10 appeared, he continued with the queen of spades. He then led a diamond to the ace and cashed the king of diamonds. Had both opponents followed, South would have drawn the last trump and claimed the rest. When West showed out on the second diamond, South ruffed a diamond and returned to dummy with the king of spades to cash the rest of the diamonds. Making six.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The curtain of memory||Why do some memories from half-a-century ago seem brighter and clearer than what happened last year? From apparently nowhere pops up the name of a person long forgotten or the colour of the binding of an old book. Patterns of memory seem to have no logic at all. When we were eight or nine, my twin, Ravi, and I, fired by stories about the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Ramses II in the Ten Commandments, incidents from the Mahabharata and tips from watching school theatre, began to stage home plays. I don’t know how mother put up with the wrecking of our room every weekend. A bed was pushed against the wall, all the safety pins in the house held together an old sheet strung from one end of the bedpost to the other, the window darkened with towels and the afternoon topped off by a script which held no clue to how it was going to reach the middle, leave alone the end. The real drama was that both of us wanted equal credits. Neither would yield on writing, directing or acting. Our audience (one patient, affectionate uncle) sat waiting endlessly for the “play” to unfold. Not once did the lead actor hesitate to abandon the stage to pound the playwright who shouted instructions and changes of script from the wings. We both wanted the best lines and fell upon the other if we didn’t get them. “Bring the prisoner in!,” was something we both wanted to shout thrice. There was supposed to be an interval during which we gave our uncle imaginary popcorn and a cool drink, but what really happened was that to resolve our differences every five-eight minutes, one of us would yank the “curtain” till it closed (or collapsed in a heap) and step in front of it (like announcers in school) to say, “There will now be a five-minute break.” Even 20 years later, if he caught sight of one of us, our uncle would call across the room, “There will now be a five-minute break.” Henry Kissinger once said that the history of what did not happen has never been written down. Well, fortunately for the world, the history of the actor I did not become was never recorded. minioup@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-curtain-of-memory/article33376082.ece

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Ethical challenges of vaccinating people with comorbidities||The operational guidelines for COVID-19 vaccination issued recently by the union health ministry has once again identified the four high-risk groups — healthcare workers, frontline workers, persons over 50 years of age, and persons younger than 50 years with comorbidities — that would receive COVID vaccine on priority. Unlike in other groups, national databases of people with comorbidities are not available. However, though not comprehensive, since 2010, State governments have been conducting population-based district level screening to detect non-communicable diseases under the National Program for the Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) guidelines. Also, as part of the Ayushman Bharat initiative, States have been carrying out universal screening of people aged over 30 years. State governments have been asked to refer to the screening data for non-communicable diseases to identify individuals with comorbidities for COVID vaccination. As per the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, asthma, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer and bronchitis have been associated with hospitalisation and disease severity. According to Dr. Giridhara Babu, Epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, two studies have found varying degrees of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. While only 14% of 522 patients from a Jaipur hospital had comorbidities, it was 85% in the case of patients in Tamil Nadu. Diabetes (62%), hypertension (49%) and coronary artery disease (17.5%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in Tamil Nadu, whereas hypertension (42.5%), diabetes (39.7%), past history of tuberculosis (20.5%), COPD/Asthma (16.4%), coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease (13.7%) were common in Jaipur patients. Which comorbidities? Considering a range of comorbidities that increases the risk of disease severity, people with which comorbidity should be given more priority for vaccination? “The evidence available is insufficient to indicate the degree of severity amongst the comorbidities. The priority of vaccination [based on comorbidities] depends on various factors,” says Dr. Babu in an email. “As per the evidence elsewhere, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease increase the risk of COVID-19.” Virologist Dr. Shahid Jameel, Director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University says in an email: “My pick would be hypertension, diabetes and COPD. Even though COPD comes lower in the risk score, it also compromises lung function as in severe COVID, and that would be a double whammy.” But considering that Indians often have many risk factors, should people with two or more comorbidities be prioritised over those with just one comorbidity? Multiple comorbidities “Each comorbidity increases vulnerability. However, in case of shortage of vaccines, multimorbidity should be given first preference,” Dr. Babu says. Dr. Jameel too agrees that people with multiple comorbidities are at greater risk and hence should be prioritised over those with a single comorbidity. “My guess is that having more than one comorbidity would be more than the sum of parts in terms of risk,” says Dr. Jameel. In general, elderly people with multimorbidity, elderly with any comorbidity, elderly, young with multimorbidity, and young with any comorbidity seems to be a sensible order of priority, Dr. Babu says. Database problems Dr. Samiran Panda of ICMR says that people below 50 years who have been newly diagnosed with comorbidities should not be counted as high-risk for vaccination on priority. Even the union government’s guidance to States is to use the existing database of comorbidities to vaccinate people. Since the database is not comprehensive, relying solely on that can be problematic. Duration of chronic disease would certainly have an impact on physiology, and therefore those with longer duration of the conditions would be more at risk, says Dr. Jameel. But Dr. Babu says that there is no evidence to suggest that the duration of underlying disease increases the risk of COVID-19 disease. “There should not be any bias in prioritising individuals concerning the duration of underlying disease conditions,” Dr. Babu says. Health inequality Also, poor people and those living in rural areas very often are unaware of their disease status. Any policy that excludes people with newly diagnosed disease will inevitably affect the poor. “I suspect that only a few people qualify for consideration based on documentation of their comorbidities. This will unduly favour the rich and educated who keep documentation and thereby further exacerbate health inequity,” stresses Dr. Babu. “Comprehensive efforts should be done to test the blood glucose levels and blood pressure to make a new diagnosis and vaccinate them.” Besides the poor and people in rural areas, Dr. Jameel rightly points out that millions of middle-class Indians are unaware of their underlying chronic conditions. “This poses a challenge, but would hopefully also catalyse fresh efforts to develop the right health databases,” he says. In addition to using the NCD database, States should allow people with comorbidities to self-report and also conduct a quick survey to screen, enrol and schedule the vulnerable for vaccination in the entire country, says Dr. Babu. Males over females? Another ethical challenge revolves around gender. Males have been found to be at a greater risk of progressing to severe disease and even dying compared with females. Should males with comorbidities then be prioritised over females with comorbidities? Will that further exacerbate the underlying gender-based inequities? “Risk of severe disease and death is higher in males than in females, particularly in older age groups. However, prioritising males with comorbidities over females will result in inducing and worsening inequities,” says Dr. Babu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/ethical-challenges-of-vaccinating-people-with-comorbidities/article33376247.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Overexploitation, long life cycle have endangered a common Himalayan herb||The Himalayan trillium ( Trillium govanianum ), a common herb of the Himalayas was declared ‘endangered’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last week. In recent years, the plant has become one of the most traded commercial plants of the Himalayan region, due to its high medicinal quality. It has been used in traditional medicine to cure diseases like dysentery, wounds, skin boils, inflammation, sepsis, as well as menstrual and sexual disorders. Recent experiments have shown that the rhizome of the herb is a source of steroidal saponins and can be used as an anti-cancer and anti-aging agent. This increased its market value and has now become an easy target for poachers. Found in temperate and sub-alpine zones of the Himalayas, at an altitude from 2,400-4,000 metres above sea level, the existence of the plant has been traced across India, Bhutan, Nepal, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In India, it is found in four states only- Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand. Often called Nagchatri, in local areas this herb grows to a height of 15-20 cm. “Given the suspected rate of decline and an expected continued demand for rhizomes into the foreseeable future, population declines of at least 50% are expected to occur between 2010 and 2079,” says Harsh Kumar Chauhan from Kumaun University who has been studying the plant and helped assess its status for IUCN. “There are several factors threatening the survival of the plant such as over-exploitation, long life cycle - slow to reach reproductive maturity - and poor capacity for seed dispersal. The highly specific habitat requirement, high trade value, and increasing market demand are all causing its decline,” remarks Anil Kumar Bisht, Professor of Botany, Kumaun University who led the study team. The researchers note that in 2017, the herb was recorded as a medicinal plant traded from India. Since then its price has increased and sold at $50-315 per kilogram. To prevent its illegal trade, Dr. Chahuhan says, “Implementation and enforcement of sustainable collection protocols and quotas are needed. Designation of areas of natural habitat to local communities for management of harvest is the best option to control its illegal trade. Further, the implantation of FairWild Standard (a set of ecological and fair trade guidelines) can help traders, and concerned agencies in the sustainable harvest and trade of the species.” He adds that educational efforts including elevation of public awareness surrounding the threats to the species, and dissemination of best practices for harvest are also needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/overexploitation-long-life-cycle-have-endangered-a-common-himalayan-herb/article33376243.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Why elephants and tigers did not go extinct in India||Over the last 100,000 years, several land-dwelling mammals including big carnivores have gone extinct across the globe. North America lost its saber-toothed cat, North American lion, scimitar-tooth cat, American cheetah, and the only big cats left now are the Puma and the Jaguar. But most of the megafauna of South Asia and Africa were resilient to the arrival of modern humans and the region still has large land mammals such as elephants, tigers, and rhinos. A team led by Advait Jukar from Yale University set out to investigate why these big mammals are still seen in India when they disappeared from the Americas. Co-evolution A paper published last month notes that co-evolution - the fact that native animals learn to adapt to a new predator played an important role. “If humans were hunting, these animals evolved techniques to avoid people. For example, if we like to hunt on the plains, maybe these animals lived in the forests. It's basically an evolutionary rat race where one species has to keep up with the other in order to survive,” explains Dr. Jukar from the Department of Anthropology at Yale University. He is the lead author of the paper published last month in Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology . Environmental factors  However, there were mammalian extinctions in the country: two massive elephant relatives ( Palaeoloxodon namadicus and Stegodon namadicus ), a hippo ( Hexaprotodon sp), and a horse relative ( Equus namadicus ) were lost. “So what's actually common to all of these animals? And, what was going on in the environment at this time? All the extinct species were large, slow reproducing species, and they go extinct when the climate is fluctuating. We know that environmental change can stress populations out, especially populations of animals that don't reproduce quickly. Elephants have a two-year pregnancy and it takes about six years between calving events. Hippos, when they're stressed out, don't breed well,” explains Dr. Jukar. “But based on the fossil record, we know that these animals have survived multiple periods of similar environmental change in the past. They only go extinct when people show up. So people probably were the last nail in the coffin for these animals. Had we not shown up, they would have probably been fine.” Local extinction India was also home to ostriches ( Struthio camelus ) and Dr. Jukar notes that humans may have been the reason for their local extinction. “We have ostriches in cave art and we have a lot of evidence of people using ostrich eggshells for ornamentation by making beads. Humans probably used eggs for food. And obviously, if you start eating up their offspring, the populations are going to crash.” Dr. Jukar adds that humans may be driving the extinction of the mammals that fought and survived. “So most of the animals which survived, had a fairly large geographic range. But today, these animals are being restricted to small pockets and in fragmented populations, a lot of interbreeding happens making the populations weaker. And with increased human pressure, it's just a matter of time before they start going extinct. So we need active conservation to make sure that these animals don't go the way of Indian hippos or ostriches. Several factors Prof. Parth R. Chauhan, a paleoanthropologist from IISER Mohali, who was not part of the study, says that different factors may be behind the extinction of different species. “I don't think humans played equal roles across the Indian Subcontinent for all the species that become extinct. Nor can you point fingers only at climate change. For example, hippos and ostriches become extinct roughly at the same time. But if you look at their respective adaptations, hippos are used to water environments and ostriches are used to dry environments. So you cannot assign climate climatic factors to both of the species equally across India. There cannot be one dominant factor across India for these extinctions and more studies are needed.” He adds that one has to keep in mind that not all species are represented in the fossils and there are still missing links and biological dead ends.  Humans probably were the last nail in the coffin for these animals.

Using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a radio telescope in the Netherlands, the researchers uncovered emission bursts from the Tau Bootes star-system hosting a so-called hot Jupiter, a gaseous giant planet that is very close to its own sun. The team led by researchers from the Cornell University in the U.S. also observed other potential exoplanetary radio-emission candidates in the constellation Cancer and Upsilon Andromedae systems. However, the study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics found that only the Tau Bootes exoplanet system exhibited a significant radio signature. “We present one of the first hints of detecting an exoplanet in the radio realm,” said Cornell postdoctoral researcher Jake D. Turner. New window on exoplanets “The signal is from the Tau Bootes system, which contains a binary star system and an exoplanet. We make the case for an emission by the planet itself,” adds Dr. Turner. If confirmed through follow-up observations, the researchers said, this radio detection opens up a new window on exoplanets and provides a novel way to examine alien worlds that are tens of light-years away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/first-potential-radio-signal-from-exoplanet/article33376235.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Why do leaves die off in autumn?||You might have seen pictures of leaves in cold countries turning yellow and red before falling. This usually marks the beginning of autumn. Known as leaf senescence, this process prepares the trees for the coming winter. As a result of global warming, European trees were found to start this senescence about two weeks earlier. In a study published last month in the journal Science , researchers have now demonstrated that trees have a self-regulating mechanism that limits the photosynthesis period or the productive period. This increased photosynthesis in spring and summer could be leading to earlier senescence. The analyses suggested that seasonal photosynthesis, autumn temperatures, and day length were the key Lead author Deborah Zani from the Institute of Integrative         Biology, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Switzerland explained that several other factors, such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations, summer temperatures, light levels, and precipitation also appear to influence senescence, but only indirectly through affecting photosynthesis. The team arrived at the conclusion by studying six European deciduous tree species over the last six decades. They found a strong effect of photosynthesis on senescence. In years with increased photosynthesis in spring and summer, leaf senescence began earlier, with each 10% increase in photosynthetic activity advancing leaf senescence by eight days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/why-do-leaves-die-off-in-autumn/article33376241.ece
20 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Shops near protest site see dip in footfall||Despite the presence of thousands of protesting farmers at the Singhu border, business has been hit at shops along the highway. Several owners of these shops said fewer customers visit them due to the availability of langar services and other facilities at the protest site. The shops, mostly selling soft drinks and other items, have seen a stark contrast in footfall since the agitation began — over 20 days ago —, said its owners. Prem Prakash, who has been running the shop along the highway for over a decade, said: “Business is down to nothing. As compared to the time when the highway was open, there is almost a 50% dip, if not more. It is mostly happening because whatever people require are available to them now especially due to the langar services.” Procurement a hassle Procuring stocks for the shop has also proved to be a hassle in recent days, said Mr. Prakash. “Earlier we used to get items delivered to our shops. Now, we have to carry them ourselves and get the items from Kundli, which also proves to be a long walk. Sometimes the commute ends up being an hour-long affair,” he said. Shailendra, an employee at another similar store, said: “The necessity to stock items is also declining by the day as it has become very difficult to sell the existing items itself. Earlier we used to witness sales of more than a few thousand rupees each day but now it has reduced to Rs. 2,000/day. When everything is being distributed there [protest site] for free, how will we get any customers?” With the farmers Several other shop owners said even though they stand by the farmers, it was becoming difficult for them to sustain their families and pay rent due to the decline in their incomes. Sumeet Yadav, another shop owner, said: “We are sitting here all day doing nothing. What do we do? Usually, I pay my rent by the 10th of each month but this time I haven’t been able to pay till now.”  ‘What do we do?’ “We are with everyone and we understand the cause but it is also true that our business has been affected and it’s not the same as when the highway was open.

20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Are NRIs likely to get postal voting rights soon?||The story so far: On November 27, the Election Commission of India (ECI) wrote to the Law Ministry, proposing to extend the facility of postal ballots to (eligible) overseas, non-resident Indians (NRIs) for the Assembly elections in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal in 2021. The ECI proposed amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, in order to allow this facility. The postal ballots will be sent to NRIs electronically and they will send these ballots after choosing their candidate via post. This partially electronic facility is now available for service voters (being a member of the armed Forces of the Union; or a member of a force to which provisions of the Army Act, 1950 (46 of 1950), have been made applicable whether with or without modification; a member of an Armed Police Force of a State, and serving outside that State; or a person who is employed under the Government of India, in a post outside India).and is being sought to be extended to overseas NRI voters. The Law Ministry is yet to respond to the proposal. How can overseas voters currently vote in Indian elections? Prior to 2010, an Indian citizen who is an eligible voter and was residing abroad for more than six months owing to employment, education or otherwise, would not have been able to vote in elections. This was because the NRI’s name was deleted from electoral rolls if he or she stayed outside the country for more than six months at a stretch. After the passing of the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act, 2010, eligible NRIs who had stayed abroad beyond six months have been enabled to vote, but only in person at the polling station where they have been enrolled as an overseas elector. Just as any resident Indian citizen above the age of 18 years (having attained it on the first day of January of the year of revision of electoral rolls for the State) is eligible to vote in the constituency where she/he is a resident, overseas Indian citizens are also eligible to do so. In the case of overseas voters, their address mentioned in the passport is taken as the place of ordinary residence and chosen as the constituency for the overseas voter to enrol in. How has the existing facility worked so far? From merely 11,846 overseas voters who registered in 2014, the number went up to close to a lakh in 2019. But the bulk of these voters (nearly 90%) belonged to just one State — Kerala. Of the 25,606 such voters who actually turned up, 25,534 were from Kerala (mostly from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts). Clearly, a very low proportion of eligible overseas residents actually registered or turned up to vote. The Representation of the People Act, envisaged voters as only the “ordinary residents” in a constituency (https://bit.ly/3p7gIgL) who will choose representatives to represent their local interests while mediating on larger issues in the legislature. Some democracies that already allow absentee voting stipulate that overseas electors are eligible to vote provided they are not abroad for a specified period of time and/or if they mention an “intent to return”. Section 20-1A, Part III of the Representation of the People Act addresses this to some extent by qualifying “a person absenting himself temporarily from his place of ordinary residence shall not by reason thereof cease to be ordinarily resident therein” and in essence provides for NRIs who are temporarily staying abroad to be eligible to vote in their local constituencies. Yet, the proviso of having to visit the polling booth in person has discouraged eligible voters from exercising their mandate. In the winter session of Parliament in 2017, the government proposed to remove the restriction imposed by Section 20A of the Representation of the People Act, which required them to be physically present to vote in their constituencies. The Bill provided for overseas voters to be able to appoint a proxy to cast their votes on their behalf, subject to conditions laid down in the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. The Bill was later passed in 2018, but lapsed with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. Now the ECI has approached the government to permit NRIs to vote via postal ballots similar to a system that is already used by service voters (the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System, or ETPBS). What is ETPBS and how does it function? The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 was amended in 2016 to allow service voters to use the ETPBS. Under this system, postal ballots are sent electronically to registered service voters. The service voter can then download the ETPB (along with a declaration form and covers), register their mandate on the ballot and send it to the returning officer of the constituency via ordinary mail. The post will include an attested declaration form (after being signed by the voter in the presence of an appointed senior officer who will attest it). The postal ballot must reach the returning officer by 8 a.m. on the day of the counting of results. The ECI now proposes to extend this facility to overseas voters as well. For this to commence, the Law Ministry has to amend the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 (just as it was done for service voters). In the case of NRI voters, those seeking to vote through ETPBS will have to inform the returning officer at least five days after notification of the election. The returning officer will then send the ballot electronically via the ETPBS. The NRI voter can then register her/his mandate on the ballot printout and send it back with an attested declaration in a process similar to the service voter. Except in this case, the senior officer would be appointed by the Indian diplomatic or consular representative in the resident country of the NRI. The ECI has not specified whether the voter should send in the ballot through ordinary post to the returning officer or drop it off at the Indian consular office/embassy, which will then send the consolidated envelopes constituency-wise to the returning officers. Will this facility be available to all overseas voters across countries? There were news reports that the ECI had indicated to the Ministry of External Affairs that it would want postal voting introduced on a pilot basis in non-Gulf countries. But ECI officials told The Hindu that the ECI had asked the Law Ministry to explore the possibility of extending postal ballots to overseas electors and not restrict it to any particular country. Are postal ballots a viable means of voting? The ETPBS method allowed for greater turnout among service voters in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. With increasing mobility of citizens across countries for reasons related to work, the postal ballot method has been recognised by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (an intergovernmental organisation that works to support democratic processes and institutions) as a means to allow overseas voters to exercise their right, subject to certain conditions normally related to the time spent abroad or the work carried out abroad. Postal ballots were proven to be a secure and easy ways of registering the mandate in the presidential elections in the United States recently with many voters preferring to use this method due to the COVID-19 social distancing norms. A postal ballot mechanism that allows for proper authentication of the ballot at designated consular/embassy offices and an effective postal system should ease this process for NRIs, but the rules must be clearly framed for eligibility on the basis of time spent away from the country.  The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 was amended in 2016 to allow service voters to use the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System. The Election Commission proposes to extend this facility to overseas voters||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/are-nris-likely-to-get-postal-voting-rights-soon/article33376159.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Is the pink ball different from red and white?||The story so far: The first Test between Australia and India, which ended much ahead of schedule at Adelaide on Saturday, has put into focus the pink cricket ball used in day/night matches once again. It is only the 15th Test to go pink; the other 2,381 have all been played with the more traditional red balls. Having made its pink ball debut last November against Bangladesh, this was the second Test for India, while it was the eighth for Australia. Why are different shades of balls used for different formats of cricket? Long-format matches — like Test and First Class — are played with red balls; since the players are required to dress in white, a normal red ball is used. Till the advent of cricket at night in 1978, there was no need to look beyond red when it came to the ball’s colour. The colour of the ball through cricket’s history, which dates back to the 16th century, remained red till November 28, 1978. A different colour was needed when a rebel World Series one-day match between Australia and the West Indies was played under the brand new floodlights at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Thus a white ball was chosen, since it would be more visible at night. That required the players to don coloured clothing. Though the experiment proved a smashing success, with close to 50,000 fans turning up for the match and many more watching it live on Channel 9, it would take more than a decade for the coloured clothing and the white ball to gain wider acceptance — the World Cup of 1992, to be precise. How did the pink ball enter the Test arena? Though Test matches — they best bring out the aesthetics, techniques and the theatre of cricket — are still considered the purest forms of the game by most players and discerning fans, their popularity has been on the wane, more so in these times of instant gratification provided by the Twenty20 format in tournaments such as the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash League. Test matches attract big crowds only in England and Australia these days. Besides, Australia’s time zone is not ideal for cricket’s largest television audience — the subcontinent, where the day would not even have dawned when a Test match gets under way at Melbourne or Sydney. So the cricket administrators in Australia and England began to think seriously about day/night Tests. They were backed by the International Cricket Council, too. The first day/night Test was scheduled to have been played in 2010 between England and Bangladesh at Lord’s, cricket’s Mecca, but the plan had to be abandoned because two county teams, Durham and Worcestershire, felt their First Class fixture was too important to be held as a trial game for pink-ball cricket. It would take another five years for the pink ball to land at the Test match wicket. That happened at Adelaide, in 2015, with the third and final Test of the series between Australia and New Zealand. But women had played an international game with a pink ball long before men, though — the one-day international between England and Australia at Wormsley in 2009. Do the conditions have an impact on pink, red and white balls? Unlike most sports, the conditions — the ground or the weather — play a crucial role in cricket. For instance, the ball tends to swing more in overcast conditions (though science has been able to explain the aerodynamic mechanisms of swing and reverse-swing, atmospheric conditions enabling swing have not been clearly explained). Even balls manufactured by different companies behave differently. White and pink balls are believed to swing more than the red one. From the batsman’s point of view, the pink ball is probably the most difficult to handle, especially during twilight. Pace bowlers, however, relish the pink ball, especially when the lights are switched on as the shine lasts longer because of the lacquer. While only one pink or red ball is used to bowl from both ends in a match, two white balls have been used in one-dayers since 2012 (the white ball becomes difficult to see once it gets dirty). Do the pink, white or red balls have other differences besides colour? According to the Marylebone Cricket Club, guardians of the laws of cricket, any international and First Class ball has to weigh between 156 grams and 162 grams. There is no difference in weight in either red, white or pink ball. But the colour of the seam varies: white seam for the red ball, dark green for white and black for pink. Is there a difference between the Kookaburra, SG and Dukes pink balls in the way they are stitched and behave? Dukes and SG are hand-stitched in all six rows of the seam. Only two rows of a Kookaburra ball are hand-stitched, while the four outer rows are machine-stitched. The Dukes and SG balls tend to swing more than Kookaburra. Why is there a demand by some players to replace the red ball with the pink one in all Tests? Australian spin legend Shane Warne claims that the red ball does nothing for the bowler, and that the pink ball is more visible and looks better on television. It remains to be seen how much support he receives.  From the batsman’s point of view, the pink ball is probably the most difficult to handle, especially during twilight. Pace bowlers, however, relish the pink ball, especially when the lights are switched on||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/is-the-pink-ball-different-from-red-and-white/article33376155.ece
20 December 2020||December 20 2020 00:00 IST,||IITs and reservation||The story so far: The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have a large number of faculty vacancies, as the student intake capacity was raised by over 50% during 2008-10 after reservation for Other Backward Classes students was introduced, and more IITs were opened during 2008-17. Currently, there are 23 IITs, and reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) has been added. Since the ratio of students to teachers has come under strain, and the high bar for entry of teachers, starting with a doctoral degree, has shrunk the pool of eligible aspirants from reserved categories, the Education Ministry formed a committee to look at implementing the reservation system effectively. Who is responsible for recruitment? Student admissions and teachers’ appointments are covered by the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, and the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act, 2019. Beneficiaries belong to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and EWS. The Ministry Committee headed by the Director of IIT Delhi, V. Ramgopal Rao, met twice in the current year, and came up with two options. According to the first, the government could in effect sidestep the faculty reservation question by including IITs in the schedule to the 2019 law, providing them exemption as in the case of some national institutions of importance. The second option provides for de-reservation of positions if no suitable candidates are found in the year of recruitment. The recommendations have evoked a strong reaction, as they are seen as negating the objective of affirmative action through reservation. Why is it difficult to find candidates in reserved categories? The Committee said in its report that the IITs, set up as institutions of national importance under a special law to contribute to national and even global development, had to pursue high quality teaching and research. Aspirants must therefore possess a PhD degree, as well as a superior academic record and “high research accomplishments” for teaching. The IITs also come within the ambit of a special dispensation backed by the Human Resource Development Ministry (now the Education Ministry) in 2009, which enables a flexible cadre structure. This allows the institutes to maintain an overall faculty strength, but makes it possible to upgrade those with high credentials to higher tier positions without constraints of post limits. Yet, with more students enrolling, the opening of new IITs, and introduction of the EWS quota, the selection committees have been unable to find enough candidates to fill teaching positions. About a decade ago, the student to faculty ratio was estimated at about 6:1, which facilitated closer monitoring and pursuit of projects that make IIT courses unique. This faculty ratio later fell to 12:1, and appears to be under further strain. The Education Ministry’s Committee has pointed out that the optimal is a ratio of 10:1, on the basis of which faculty numbers have been set. The reality is that not enough candidates belonging to the reserved categories are going into research in engineering and technology. Even among those who do, only a small group opt for a teaching career. This has sharply reduced the available pool from which the IITs can recruit teachers while adhering to reservation norms. What remedy is the Committee looking at? The Committee came up with two options: to include the IITs in the schedule to the 2019 law on teachers’ recruitment, which would exempt these institutes from reservation, just as it does in other institutions of excellence. As a second option, the panel suggested that faculty at the level of Assistant Professor Grade I and II be given reservation, including for EWS, and the vacancies considered for the institution as a whole, and not for each department. Where suitable candidates from the reserved category are unavailable, the posts should be de-reserved in the next year, with approval from the Board of Governors. Also, Associate Professor and Professor posts should be exempted from reservation. To provide for a talent pool from among the reserved sections, the Ramgopal Rao panel has suggested the launch of two-year research assistantships fully funded by the Centre, with an option for the candidates to take up PhD studies that meet the rigorous standards of the IITs. What is the government’s position? The report of the Committee, which was obtained under the Right to Information Act by an interested citizen, is “under examination” by the government, according to the Ministry of Education. Although it aims at addressing a critical gap, the recommendation to do away with reservation is at odds with the stated position of the Central government. In November last year, the Education Ministry put out a notification that central educational institutions (CEIs), which would include the IITs and the Indian Institutes of Management, should ensure that faculty positions, including senior posts, fully met the norms of reservation. The Ministry now has a recommendation favouring no reservation, and a reiteration of the idea of treating an IIT as a single unit for the purpose of drawing up a roster of reserved posts, rather than go by individual departments.  The student to faculty ratio was earlier estimated at about 6:1, which facilitated closer monitoring. This faculty ratio later fell to 12:1, and appears to be under further strain||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/iits-and-reservation/article33376157.ece
20 December 2020||New Delhi,||Court takes cognisance of offence of sedition against Sharjeel Imam||A Delhi court on Saturday took cognisance of the offence of sedition against JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a case related to the violence during protests against the CAA in December last year, which resulted in damage to public property and injuries to police near Jamia Millia Islamia. Additional Sessions Judge took cognisance of the offences under Sections 124 A (sedition), 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language), 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), and 505 (public mischief) of the IPCagainst Mr. Imam. The court had earlier taken cognisance of the offence under Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Imam, but deferred taking cognisance of offences under IPC sections 124 A, 153 A, 153 B, 505 as the requisite sanctions were awaited. The court took cognisance of the offences after the Delhi Police filed a supplementary charge sheet mentioning the requisite sanctions granted by the authorities concerned. “The requisite sanction...has been filed. I have perused the supplementary chargesheet. In view of the same, I take cognisance for commission of offence under Section 124A/153A/153B/505 IPC, the judge said. The police had filed another supplementary charge sheet against Imam in the case in July this year. The police had alleged in the chargesheet that Mr. Imam gave inflammatory speeches at several places, including Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University during anti-CAA protests. The chargesheet said Mr. Imam allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt and disaffection towards the Centre and instigated the people, which led to the violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-takes-cognisance-of-offence-of-sedition-against-sharjeel-imam/article33376411.ece
20 December 2020||New Delhi,||BJP ends stir outside Kejriwal’s house||The Mayors of the three BJP-ruled Municipal Corporations of Delhi on Saturday ended their 13-day sit-in protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence here. They had been on a hunger strike for the past three days. Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta met the Mayors and offered them juice to end the hunger strike after which they declared that though they were ending the strike for the time being the movement to demand financial dues amounting to Rs. 13,000 crore would continue. “Today [Saturday], even on the 13th day, the corporation leaders are sitting outside the CM’s residence on hunger strike in this severe cold not for their convenience or benefit but for the salary of sanitation workers, doctors, nurses, health workers, teachers and other corporations employees who worked to keep Delhi safe, clean and healthy amid the pandemic,” Mr. Puri said. “It is utterly unfair that the Delhi government is not providing constitutionally allocated funds to pay the corporation employees. It is the moral responsibility of the Delhi government to provide financial strength to the civic bodies under them but even in such a critical situation, Mr. Kejriwal did not come for five minutes to meet the corporation leaders,” he added. Mr. Gupta said the corporation leaders were fighting for the people of Delhi, for the rights of corporation workers, and for better civic amenities. He alleged that the CM was “wasting crores of public tax money for shining his photo” on hoardings but not releasing the funds for the corporations. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday said that a school teacher of a BJP-ruled civic body had written to the President that he should either tell the corporation to release their salaries or he should give him permission to die by suicide. A complete lie: AAP AAP civic bodies’ in-charge Durgesh Pathak said that when the party asks the BJP to pay salaries of municipal employees, they say that Rs. 13,000 crore is pending from the Delhi government to the corporations. “It is a complete lie. A recent court order regarding clearance of pending salary of municipal employees has no mention of this imaginary Rs. 13,000 crore. During the court hearing, BJP’s standing counsel never mentioned Rs. 13,000 crore,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-bjp-ends-sit-in-outside-kejriwals-official-residence/article33376413.ece
