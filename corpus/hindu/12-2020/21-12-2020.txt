21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Three ghat roads to be strengthened||The three major ghat roads connecting the coastal region with the rest of the State — the Charmadi, the Shiradi and the Sampaje — that had witnessed massive landslips during the monsoon seasons in the last two years would see major strengthening work in the coming days. Charmadi Ghat on National Highway 73 connects the district with Chikkamagaluru and Hassan districts and beyond. It had suffered major damage during the cloudburst in 2019 as well as the heavy rain this year too. Shiradi Ghat on the Bengaluru-Mangaluru National Highway 75, though had got a new concrete road a couple of years ago, suffered major landslips in as many as 13 locations during the 2019 rainy season. The tale of Sampaje Ghat on National Highway 275 connecting the district with Kodagu and Mysuru was no different with multiple landslips in 2019. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Saturday announced that the three major ghat roads would undergo strengthening work at a cost of around Rs. 125 crore. The works would be executed by the National Highways Division of the State Public Works Department that looks after the maintenance of these highways. According to senior engineers with the National Highways Division of the Public Works Department, about 15 % of piling work was already completed on the 2.53-km stretch of the affected Sampaje Ghat. The Rs. 58.84 crore work involves the construction of the secant pile wall, RCC drains and other road safety works between km 71.6 and km 110 of NH 275. With the present pace of work, at least 50 % of the restoration work could be completed before the next monsoon thereby averting any further damage to the ghat road, the engineers said. Work on Shiradi Ghat involves providing permanent restoration to valley-side slips from km 237 to km 263 at a cost of Rs. 36.5 crore. River embankment of Kempu Hole had witnessed landslips threatening the concrete road surface at multiple locations on this 25-km stretch of the ghat road. Similar restoration works were proposed on the valley-side of the Charmadi Ghat between km 86.2 and km 99.2 too at a cost of Rs. 19.36 crore. Tenders for these two works were called for once and there was no response. Tenders have been called for the second time now, engineers said. Meanwhile, a 40-km stretch of the Bantwal-Mysuru National Highway 275, including the Sampaje Ghat section, would be strengthened at a cost of Rs. 30.5 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/three-ghat-roads-to-be-strengthened/article33381142.ece
21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Nepal set to face fresh election||In an emergency Cabinet meeting held on Sunday morning, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli recommended the dissolution of Parliament of Nepal and called for general election. The decision was ratified by President Bidhya Devi Bhandari in an official announcement hours later. “Prime Minister Oli had the mandate to govern Nepal but there were lingering problems among the higher ranks of the ruling party as senior leaders were unable to go with the PM. There is a tradition in democracy to deal with such situations by going back to the people and Prime Minister Oli has decided to seek fresh mandate,” Rajan Bhattarai, Foreign Affairs Adviser to Prime Minister Oli, told The Hindu from Kathmandu. The President has called for a two-phase election to be held on April 30 and May 10 next year. The dramatic move came after weeks of tension with challenger Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, who has been demanding that Mr. Oli change his style of governance. Protests break out Immediately, after the announcement, seven Ministers close to Mr. Prachanda announced their resignation at a press conference. Mr. Oli’s announcement was followed by deployment of quick action forces across capital Kathmandu and other major Nepal cities and towns where protests broke out spontaneously. Nepal held election in November-December 2017 and the elected 275-member Pratinidhi Sabha is expected to serve a full five-year term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nepal-set-to-face-fresh-election/article33380760.ece
21 December 2020||Belagavi,||Campaigning picks up for second phase of GP polls in Belagavi||Campaigning for the second phase of gram panchayat polls has picked up in Belagavi and surrounding districts. Though the elections are supposed to be non-political and parties do not issue ticket to candidates, the polls are heavily politicised and in most villages, they are being fought on party lines. The BJP has been holding Gram Swaraj meetings to coincide with the poll campaigning. These meetings are not only to spread word about the achievements of the State and Union governments, but also to scout for potential candidates, party sources say. In these taluk-level meetings, a Cabinet Minister and a State-level BJP leader participate. Ramesh Jarkiholi, district in-charge Minister, openly announced in a meeting in Gokak that the BJP would win in 80 % of the gram panchayats. The Congress has also been holding similar meetings, with senior leaders, including Satish Jarkiholi and Lakshmi Hebbalkar, addressing workers. In most taluks, the campaign has been peaceful, though there have been a few untoward incidents. In Ankalagi, Congress members complained that BJP members attacked them with sticks and machetes. The police arrested BJP leader Raju Talwar and six of his associates as part of the investigation on Saturday. In KK Koppa, there was a stand-off between Maratha and Nayaka community leaders over differences related to gram panchayat polls on Saturday. A funeral procession of the Nayaka community was stopped by some Maratha youth in the village. The police had to intervene to allow the procession to continue. In Kemmanakolu village near Gokak, some candidates said that their adversaries were using black magic to defeat them. One candidate found a plastic bag containing coconut, bones, cloth and a paper slip with the names of the candidate and his family members on Sunday. He complained about this before the community elders who held a meeting in the Hanuman temple. It was decided that the controversial bag be tied to a nail on the temple roof. Meanwhile, the district administration has issued strict instructions to Excise Department officials to check the transport, distribution or illegal sale of liquor. The police have set up check-posts at the inter-State and inter-district borders to stop the illegal movement of money and liquor. Deputy Commissioner and District Electoral Officer M.G. Hiremath visited poll training centres in Athani, Kagawad, Chikkodi and Nippani taluks that will go to the polls in the second phase. He spoke to officers in Chikkodi about the importance of mustering and de-mustering, training of returning and assistant returning officers, vigilance squads and security personnel, and poll ballot papers. Mr. Hiremath warned that any negligence or dereliction of duty on their part would adversely impact the democratic process at the grassroots level. All officers should follow the code of conduct and ensure that there were no malpractices, he said. He asked officers to stop attempts to auction gram panchayat seats in some villages and take criminal action against those involved in such incidents, if any.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/campaigning-picks-up-for-second-phase-of-gp-polls-in-belagavi/article33380970.ece
21 December 2020||MYSURU,||Tribals call for reduction in minimum age for marriage||At a time when the government is toying with the idea of increasing the minimum age for marriage for girls to reduce maternal mortality, tribals in Hunsur have sought a rollback. At the recently concluded ‘Adivasi Sansath’ held in Hunsur, a resolution was passed urging the government to lower the minimum legal age for marriage to 16 years for girls and to 18 years for boys. At present, the minimum legal age to get married in India is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. The activists have justified their demand on the grounds that tribals have low life expectancy when compared to other communities. S. Sreekanth of Development Through Education said it was a custom among tribals to marry early with the blessings of parents, but the authorities were intervening and branding their weddings as illegal, foisting cases on grooms and sending them to jail. He said this amounted to harassment. In recent days, 25 cases have been reported in H.D. Kote, Hunsur, and Periyapatna of tribals being victimised, Mr. Sreekanth alleged. He said it was resolved at the meet to urge the government to seek a reduction in minimum age for marriage to prevent such incidents. “Let the government ensure compulsory education for tribals, based on which they can arrive at a suitable decision on the age for marriage instead of a law being imposed on them,” he argued. Other demands The Adivasis also urged the government to desist from implementing the Kasturirangan report on the Western Ghats, saying it would have a direct bearing on the tribal communities living across the region. The resolution called for allotting 10 acres of land to each Adivasi family around Bandipur and Nagarahole and for the sanction of benefits due to them under the Forest Rights Act. The resolution, a copy of which has been submitted to the Chief Minister’s Office, also called for the immediate implementation of the Muzaffar Assadi committee report on the rehabilitation of 3,418 tribal families, as directed by the High Court of Karnataka. Tribal organisations warned that failure to do so would amount to contempt of court. Mr. Sreekanth said there were 34 recommendations made by the committee, all of which should be implemented, including the establishment of a university for tribals and internal reservation exclusively for them. The activists also said there were 215 tribal hamlets in Mysuru district, of which 200 were outside national parks and forests. These hamlets should be declared as revenue villages to facilitate additional development works, including civic projects, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tribals-call-for-reduction-in-minimum-age-for-marriage/article33381183.ece

In the vast majority of the local bodies, the elected members will assume office on Monday itself. Members will take the oath at later dates in two block panchayats and six grama panchayats in Malappuram district where the five-year term of the previous council did not expire on December 20, 2020, according to the State Election Commission (SEC).

21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Farmers to step up protest, reach out to NDA members||The leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a joint front of farmer unions, on Sunday announced a further intensification of their agitation demanding the repeal of the three agricultural marketing laws, including relay hunger strikes at protest sites and reaching out to constituents of the ruling-National Democratic Alliance. At a press conference at Singhu, a protest site at the Delhi-Haryana border, SKM leaders said they would approach the NDA leaders on December 26 and 27, appealing to them to compel the BJP to withdraw the three laws. “We will go to the residences of NDA leaders over the weekend and seek their support for the agitation. And their replies would be shared with the people,” Bharatiya Kisan Union president Rakesh Tikait said. The SKM leaders added that the NDA constituents would also be opposed if they did not support the farmers. Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said the farmer leaders at the protests around Delhi would hold relay hunger strikes from Monday. “Eleven leaders would observe fast for 24 hours every day. We appeal to those holding sit-ins in other parts of the country as well to observe hunger strike,” Mr. Yadav said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-to-step-up-protest-reach-out-to-nda-members/article33380758.ece
21 December 2020||Kolkata,||‘BJP’s Bengal CM will be a son of the soil ’||On the second day of his campaign visit to West Bengal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the State was yearning for change, and added that the BJP Chief Minister of the State would be a dhartiputra (son of the soil). Mr. Shah’s remarks not only give some clarity about the party’s chief ministerial candidate but are also aimed to address the allegation of the Trinamool Congress that the BJP is an “outsider party”. “To defeat you, Mamata ji , we do not need anyone to come from Delhi. A son of the soil will stand before you and defeat you in the polls. In the coming election, we will give West Bengal a Chief Minister who is a son of the soil,” Mr. Shah said. The Home Minister said the insider-outsider debate raked up by the Trinamool was aimed at creating confusion. “Mamata ji is having memory loss. When she was in Congress, did she call Indira Gandhi an outsider? Did she use the term for Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao? Is she trying to create a country where people of one State are not allowed in other States?” he said. Mr. Shah, who visited Visva Bharati University in Santiniketan, held a roadshow in Bolpur to wrap up his two-day visit. Mr Shah had lunch at the residence of a Baul singer in Bolpur. On the crowds during the one km long road show. Mr. Shah said people of West Bengal are yearning for change as they want to get “rid of political violence, corruption, and extortion”. Addressing the gathering at the end of the rally, Mr. Shah said he had attended several roadshows in his life “but have never seen one like this”. Addressing a press conference at Bolpur later in the day Mr. Shah raised the issue of political violence and said the attack on party president J.P Nadda’s convoy in Diamond Harbour “was an attack on democracy” and added that such attacks will not deter BJP even an inch from its goal of removing the TMC government in Bengal||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjps-bengal-cm-will-be-a-son-of-the-soil/article33380762.ece
21 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||Centre permits State to raise Rs. 2,508 cr. from open market||The State has received approval from the Central government for mobilising finances to the tune of Rs. 2,508 crore from the open market. Telangana, along with four others – Andhra Pradesh, Karnakata, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, received the benefit for completing the stipulated reforms in the Ease Of Doing Business, considered an important indicator of the investment-friendly business climate in the country. The approval follows completion of first assessment of district-level business reform action plan and elimination of requirement of renewal of registration certificates/approvals/licences by businesses for various activities. The latest announcement along with recent finances raised through the open market borrowings in the form of State Development Loans are expected to come in handy for the State for crediting amounts into the farmers’ accounts under Rythu Bandhu from December 27 as assured. The new benefit comes as a breather to the State which is landed in a precarious financial situation under the impact of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) forcing significant reduction in the budgetary allocations made for the financial year. While there was significant reduction on the GST revenue front, revenue through the Stamps and Registrations also took a major hit. Revenue through Stamps and Registration at the end of the third quarter was around Rs. 2,000 crore against the estimated Rs. 10,000 crore for the financial year. The State was recently given Rs. 559 crore by the Centre as part of the amount raised through special window and passed on to the States and Union Territories which accepted one of the two options suggested by the Centre with regard to GST implementation. The amount forms part of the Rs. 2,380 crore announced by the Centre through the special window of borrowing and the next instalments are expected to be released in the coming couple of weeks. According to the Union Finance Ministry, the Centre had enhanced the borrowing limits of the States by 2% of their GSDP and half of this special dispensation was linked to taking up citizen-centric reforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-permits-state-to-raise-rs-2508-cr-from-open-market/article33381021.ece
21 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Beneficiaries to have say in house construction||The State government has chalked out plans to involve the beneficiaries of the YSR Housing scheme in the construction of houses. The government will form committees comprising the beneficiaries. The idea is to leave the option of procuring the requisite material and take up construction as per their convenience. Housing Minister Ch. Ranganatha Raju told The Hindu that two to three committees would be formed based on the size of each Jagananna Colony. The idea is being successfully implemented at Yendagandi village of Undi constituency in West Godavari district. Three committees have been formed in the village where 350 houses are being constructed. The constitution of the committees would help in savings. For instance, a miller would cost Rs. 4,000 per day including rent. A beneficiary or a group of beneficiaries would have to pay the same rent per day. So, if a committee hires a vibrator or concrete miller, it would bring down the cost, resulting in savings, he explains. Mr. Sriranganatha Raju says that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would take part in the distribution of pattas at Kakinada in East Godavari district on December 25. Similar programmes would be organised at Tirupati in Chittoor district on December 28 and at Vizianagaram on December 30, he says. Land acquisition The State government, so far, has acquired 66,518 acres of land with a market value of about Rs. 23,500 crore. Of the total land pooled, the government has spent Rs. 8,800 crore on purchase of private land. As many as 17,500 Jagananna Colonies will come up across the State. The government aims at constructing 28.3 lakh houses in the next three years and will initiate the first phase of constructing 15.6 lakh houses on December 25 with the break-up being 8,914 houses in each assembly constituency. The phase-I of construction of houses is targeted to be completed by June 2022 and in phase-II, 13 lakh houses will be constructed by June 2023.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-will-form-panels-of-housing-beneficiaries/article33380754.ece
21 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||New tourism policy is by far the best, say stakeholders||The new tourism policy formulated by the government is seen as a robust and investor-friendly approach that will accelerate growth in the hospitality sector. “This is by far the best tourism policy in the country, which will put the State ahead of others, making it the first choice of the investors,” says K. Lakshminarayana, Chairman of the State Tourism Committee, AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry Federation. Lease amount Referring to the reduction in the lease amount from 2% to 1% of the ‘SRO value of the land’, he calls it a landmark incentive, especially in view of the sky-rocketing land values in the cities and towns of the State. The decision to increase it by 5% every three years, unlike annually in the past, is the “icing on the cake,” he says. Reimbursement of 100% of net SGST accrued to the State for all new tourism projects for a period of five years is a bold incentive, says Mr. Lakshminarayana, adding that refund of Rs. 2 on power tariff for all new tourism projects is a “milestone move.” “Straight forward incentives to all new tourism units for five years without any confusion about their categories is a ‘no-nonsense direct incentive’ that is bound to serve as the pull factor for investors,” he emphasises. Reimbursement of stamp duty for registration of new projects in the hospitality sector and continuation of the 100% waiver of land use conversion charges reflect the government’s intention to create a conducive climate for the investors, he says. The draft document also speaks of a nearly Rs. 200-crore aid, which the government will provide to everyone associated with the hospitality sector — hoteliers, restaurants, tour operators, travel agents, adventure and water sports operators. “The policy looks excellent with a lot of encouragement to the new entrepreneurs. The incentives offered to the Mega Tourism Infrastructure Development Projects, such as 90 years of lease, is encouraging,” says S. Prasanth, president of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Associations of Andhra Pradesh (HRAAP). Referring to the offer of ‘industry status’ to a mega project worth Rs. 400 crore, he says a project of that size may not be viable in the State, and so the amount can be reduced to Rs. 150 crore. “Also, some of the incentives doled out to the new projects can also be extended to the existing ones,” he adds. Bala Krishna Reddy, executive director, Hotel Bliss Taj, Tirupati, agrees that the new tourism policy is way more promising than the earlier one. “The only thing that bothers us is its proper implementation. If there is lack of coordination between the aligned departments, the purpose will be lost,” he says.  Reimbursement of 100% of net SGST accrued to the State for all new tourism projects for a period of five years is a major incentive K.

21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi HC orders police protection for old couple||The Delhi High Court has ordered the city police to ensure sufficient protection for a senior citizen couple who claimed that they were being “tormented and physically beaten” by their daughter and son-in-law living with them. Justice Vibhu Bakhru said the couple can also approach their area District Magistrate under Rule 22 of Delhi Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Rules (DMWPSCR) for their protection. Rule 22 of DMWPSCR lays down guidelines for protection of life and property of senior citizens. It says that complaints of senior citizens shall be promptly attended to by the local police. ‘Police inaction’ The High Court’s order came while hearing the plea of a 67-year-old man and his wife who said the police have not taken any effective steps to protect them despite several complaints. The man, who claimed to be suffering from paralysis and old-age ailments, said that on October 12 he was beaten up by his daughter. He had called the police and some officers had visited the premises. However, they did not take any action and asked the couple to submit a written complaint. He alleged that their statements were also not recorded. Thereafter, on December 13, his daughter and son-in-law once again assaulted them, claimed the complainant. The Delhi government’s Additional Standing Counsel submitted that the complaints received from the old couple do not reflect any cognisable offence and are largely regarding petty squabbles between the family members. The counsel, however, assured the court that the concerned beat staff will visit the complainants’ residence on a daily basis and ensure that they are not brought to any harm. Justice Bakhru said the Delhi government is “bound down to the said statement and the SHO concerned (PS Palam) shall ensure that sufficient protection is afforded to the petitioners”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-hc-orders-police-protection-for-old-couple/article33380888.ece
21 December 2020||MYSURU,||148 GPs in Mysuru to go to the polls tomorrow||A total of 148 gram panchayats in five taluks of Mysuru district will go to the polls in the first phase on Tuesday. Polling will be held in Hunsur, K.R. Nagar, Periyapatna, H.D. Kote, and Sargur taluks from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. The elections are apolitical and the candidates are barred from using their party symbols. Surprisingly, six GP seats did not receive nominations and therefore no elections will take place in those seats, apart from the ones where members have been elected unopposed. In total, elections to 2,180 seats will take place, with 6,165 candidates in the fray. Members to 123 seats have been elected unanimously.

Hunsur has the highest number of polling booths — 293 — while Sargur has the lowest — 98. In total, 974 booths exist in the five taluks, besides 174 auxiliary booths. As many as 5,052 polling staff have been appointed for conducting the elections, and polling staff from Mysuru taluk have been deputed to the taluks facing manpower shortage. Bus arrangements — 176 buses, 12 mini-buses, and seven smaller vehicles — have been made in Mysuru for ferrying the polling staff, including the presiding officers and the polling officers, to the taluks. Mustering and de-mustering arrangements will be made at the taluk headquarters on Monday. The polling staff have been instructed to apply the indelible ink on the voter’s left thumb. The voter ID or any proof of identity can be used for casting vote. Precautions Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri said public gatherings were prohibited outside the booths and people would not be allowed move around in groups, even as poll personnel have to ensure strict social distancing and compliance with the COVID-19 guidelines.

21 December 2020||MYSURU,||Protest planned today over Siddaramaiah’s remark||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s remark on beef and Kodavas has triggered a backlash, with a section of the community planning a protest in Madikeri on Monday. Different units of Kodava Samaja have taken exception to his statement and saidit reflected his ignorance of Kodava culture. Kanthi Satish Maneyapanda, a local BJP leader who is also a member of various organisations, said the protest would be held in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Madikeri. Saying that Mr. Siddaramaiah’s statement smacked of “vote-bank politics”, she asked him to withdraw it and apologise to the community. She added that the protest would not be staged under any political banner or organisation. Being in a responsible position, Mr. Siddaramaiah should desist from making such statements that hurt the sentiments of Kodavas, she said. Clarification Meanwhile, the Congress leader, in a series of tweets, clarified that his statement was misinterpreted by the media. Expressing regret if it had hurt the sentiments of Kodavas, he said he was aware of Kodava culture and greatly respected it. He went on to tweet that there were different food traditions and habits and it was wrong to link religion and food habits. “I never intended to say that Kodavas eat beef,” he tweeted. But not withstanding his clarification, the protests will go on as scheduled, Ms. Kanthi Maneyapanda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/protest-planned-today-over-siddaramaiahs-remark/article33380778.ece

They allege that the tax searches were politically motivated as many commission agents have been extending support to the farmers’ agitation. Punjab Arhtiya Association president Ravinder Singh Cheema said on Sunday that the association had decided to shut the mandi s across the State from December 21, as a mark of protest against what he termed a “revengeful act”. “These I-T raids are an act of revenge against the participation of arhtiya in the ongoing agitation of farmers. We are not just extending support to the farmers alone, the commission agents have their own set of concerns in the new farm laws. We are protesting to save our business and interests. It’s a joint struggle of farmers and commission agents,” Mr. Cheema said. “The current scenario seems to be one of imposition of continuous emergency. We can’t even protest as per our constitutional right. If we protest, steps to suppress us are being taken.” Mr. Cheema said the Punjab Arhtiya Federation had also extended support for the closure of mandi s. “We have decided to go to the Supreme Court against the Income Tax raids,” he said. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said on Saturday that the tax searches were conducted on the premises of several big arhtiyas of Punjab within four days of issuing notices, not waiting for responses to the notices. Leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the largest farmer unions in Punjab, along with the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) condemned the searches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/agents-to-shut-punjab-mandis-in-protest-against-i-t-searches/article33380702.ece
21 December 2020||Bengaluru,||No merger plan, say JD(S), BJP||Amidst speculations of a possible merger of the Janata Dal (Secular) with the Bharatiya Janata Party, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and former Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy — in separate statements on Sunday — dismissed those reports. However, neither of them denied that they were in talks over a possible alliance. What was in circulation in the political rumour mills for a couple of months now gained credence on Sunday, with senior JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti, an aspirant to become chairman of the Legislative Council in a new JD(S)-BJP alliance, speaking to mediapersons and stating that there has been talks between the two parties. “Our leader Mr. Kumaraswamy has been in talks with the BJP. There have been discussions about seat-sharing with the BJP and also whether we should be part of the government or not. We [JD(S) legislators] will tell our opinion on the matter within the party forum when it is placed before us,” he said. “Presently, what can we do when Congress is hammering us everyday? So supporting BJP has become inevitable now,” he added. Lobbying for post Sources in the JD(S) said Mr. Horatti has been lobbying to become Council chairman with the BJP’s support and the statement needs to be seen in that light. However, the statement comes in the wake of recent indications of JD(S) moving closer to BJP, over Mr. Kumaraswamy meeting the Chief Minister multiple times extending support to the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 2020 in the Council and supporting the no-confidence motion against Council’s chairman from Congress. Mr. Kumaraswamy, when asked about his new found closeness to BJP, had cryptically said: “Anything can happen in politics and I’m not an astrologer to predict the future,” denying reports of a merger. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wishing him on his birthday was also seen as an indication of the BJP courting the regional party. Hours later denials came. Mr. Kumaraswamy dismissed rumours of a merger with BJP saying JD(S) “will never display such stupidity” and that “the situation of committing suicide by merging itself with other party has not come.” He added that he doesn’t foresee such a situation in future too. However, he did not deny he was in talks with the BJP. “At the most, we may extend an issue-based support to the BJP if need be in the coming days in public interest...There is no tacit understanding with the BJP as being alleged by the Congress. Only an issue-based understanding is possible,” he tweeted. Mr. Yediyurappa also issued a denial. In a statement, he said though JD(S) has extended support to the BJP on the issue of Council chairman’s post, the reports of JD(S) legislators joining BJP or merger of two parties are lies. “There is nothing beyond JD(S) extending support on the Council chairman issue. Mr. Kumaraswamy has already said that they will not support the anti-cow slaughter Bill and we are bringing an Ordinance in this matter. There is no such [merger] situation. The Assembly elections are still more than two-and-a-half years away,” his statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-merger-plan-say-jds-bjp/article33380670.ece

However, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was in Bengal on a two-day tour, said the Home Ministry’s letter was completely within the ambit of Constitution and law. “The letter [on transfer] which the Centre has written is completely constitutional and as per law. The letter is written under the ambit of federal structure and she [Ms. Banerjee] should refer to the rules and speak to the Centre and also tell the people,” Mr. Shah said. The Union Home Ministry has transferred three IPS officers of the State to different positions under Central deputation, despite the State government’s reservations. The three IPS officers who were transferred were deputed in the security of BJP president J.P. Nadda when his convoy was attacked on December 10 in Diamond Harbour. “Centre is brazenly interfering with State Govt functioning by transferring police officers. My gratitude to @bhupeshbaghel @ArvindKejriwal @capt_amarinder @ashokgehlot51 @mkstalin for showing solidarity to people of Bengal & reaffirming their commitment to federalism.

Stalin, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot. They have come out in support of Ms. Banerjee and described the Centre’s action as interference in the federal structure.

21 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Bengaluru Regional Commissioner to compile status of Ponzi cases||In a bid to protect the depositors’ interest in Ponzi schemes run by financial companies, against whom cases have been registered, and monitor cases pending in various courts, the State government on Saturday appointed Bengaluru Regional Commissioner to compile the status of all cases that have been filed in the State and coordinate with the district administration. The finance companies running Ponzi schemes could dupe investors completely and if movable and immovable properties belonging to these companies are not attached, there is a possibility that investors’ interest cannot be protected since these properties could be sold, the government said in its proceedings appointing the Regional Commissioner. Since this action against the Ponzi scheme companies has to be moved as early as possible, and the action taken reviewed frequently, the Regional Commissioner, Bengaluru, has been appointed to supervise all the cases. The order comes in the light of the Reserve Bank of India identifying 118 finance companies in the State and seeking action against them under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment Act, 2004 and Banning of Unregulated Deposit Scheme Act, 2019. A series of meetings after the RBI flagging the issue to the State government found that the action pertaining to these 118 finance companies was not at the expected level. In Bengaluru alone, more than a dozen Ponzi schemes, including the most recent and biggest financial fraud committed by IMA, have caused losses running into several thousands crores, affecting at least 50,000 depositors. Accordingly, the Regional Commissioner will hold monthly meetings with DCs and SPs to review the developments and submit a report to the State government on pending cases against these financial companies in special courts and high courts.  The finance companies running ponzi schemes could dupe investors completely and if movable and immovable properties belonging to these companies are not attached, there is a possibility that investors’ interest cannot be protected since these properties could be sold.

21 December 2020||Kozhikode,||LDF-UDF nexus to stop BJP in Kerala: Surendran||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran on Sunday alleged that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) were joining hands to prevent the BJP from coming to power in panchayats across Kerala. Addressing presspersons here, he accused Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala of mediating a nexus between the two fronts to beat the BJP in the local body polls. Mr. Chennithala’s statement that the BJP would be decimated like the Yadava clan (in the Mahabharata ) was a signal to his party workers to vote for the LDF in the elections. However, it was the UDF which got destroyed in the process, Mr. Surendran said. The elections saw consolidation of minority votes, he said. “Now, in Mr. Chennithala’s home district of Alappuzha, in grama panchayats such as Kodamthuruth, Pandanad, Thiruvanvandoor and Chennithala, the BJP is the single-largest party. The UDF is going to stake claim to power in all these places after getting into a tie-up with the LDF,” the BJP leader alleged. He said a similar understanding had been arrived at at Karadkka, Badiyadka, Kumbadaje, Vorkady, Meenja, Kumbala, and Paivalike grama panchayats and Manjeswaram block panchayat in Kasaragod district as well. There were alliances in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts too, Mr. Surendran pointed out. The BJP leader said people would come to know how their verdict in favour of his party was being sabotaged by the LDF and the UDF. Mr. Surendran claimed that the BJP had made big gains in the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ldf-udf-nexus-to-stop-bjp-in-kerala-surendran/article33380666.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Improve APMCs, not close them, says AIKMS||The Left- affiliated All-India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha (AIKMS) on Sunday released a document countering the claims of the Modi government on the three contentious farm laws, saying the government’s arguments for not repealing the legislation were “deceptive” and “untruthful”. It also accused the government of propagating “falsehood” to claim that the laws would help farmers. In a 24-page document, the central executive committee of the AIKMS said the farmers had demanded improvement in the functioning of the mandis (markets) under the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act and not “mukti” (freedom) from them. It countered the government’s claim that the reforms were aimed at increasing private capital, infrastructure and development to reach villages, saying the functioning of the government mandis , supply of fertilizers, seeds, electricity and irrigation would not be promoted with the government promoting private companies under the new laws. On the government’s claim that it had decreased the input costs and aimed at doubling the income of the farmers till 2022, the document argued that the diesel cost had been raised tremendously by the present government, though international prices of crude oil had fallen from $110 a barrel in 2014 to $40-50 a barrel now. “Today the total tax on diesel and petrol is around Rs. 50, which is about 65% of the price of the fuel,” the document said. It added that seeds, insecticides and farm equipment were sold by the private companies at very high costs and not regulated by the government. “Every year the prices are raised and peasants have to take loans to pay for these,” said the document. “The government is trying to deny Minimum Support Price at C2+50% in the name of keeping food costs low for the poor people. Giving C2+50% as MSP will not make food costly if input costs are decreased proportionally. This will afford savings for farmers and agriculture will become sustainable. But government wants to allow corporates to sell costly inputs and keep the food costs low by depriving peasants of profitable MSP. Thus, at both ends the peasant is squeezed and corporate profit is secured,” the document said, adding that monopsony — one buyer and many sellers — cannot create a condition for peasants to bargain and fix prices. Offering counters to 16 claims of the government point-by-point, the document said the solution to the farmers problems was “cheap inputs” and “cheap loans”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/improve-apmcs-not-close-them-says-aikms/article33380691.ece
21 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||34 held under U.P. ordinance so far||With fresh cases in Shahjahanpur and Kannauj, the number of FIRs lodged under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 has reached 11. The ordinance was promulgated on November 27 and since then the ordinance has been invoked roughly once in every 48 hours. At least 34 persons have been arrested so far, police in various districts said. Along with Shahjahanpur and Kannauj, the police have lodged cases under the new ordinance in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Mau, Bijnor, Hardoi, Sitapur, Muzaffarnagar, Moradabad, Bareilly and Etah. In Kannauj, a case was lodged under Sections 3 and 5 of the ordinance in Gurusahaiganj against a Muslim man in his thirties for allegedly marrying a Hindu girl, aged 26, through a fraudulent Hindu identity. Ajay Verma, the brother of the girl, said the boy named Taufeeq was going by a fake name of Rahul Verma. “When we asked about his family, he said he had been living separately for seven years and lived in Lucknow. He said his family lived in Jaipur,” Ajay told a television channel. Through a photo of the wedding posted by the accused on Facebook, they got to know that the boy was a Muslim, alleged Ajay, claiming that even his sister did not know of the boy’s religion. Additional Superintendent of Police Vinod Kumar said the accused was arrested on Saturday. “The boy and girl had married as per Hindu rituals,” he said. The boy was booked for cheating for impersonation, marriage ceremony fraudulently gone through without lawful marriage and deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. BJP leaders in tow Superintendent of Police, Kannauj, Prabhat Verma said a complaint was registered after a man alleged that his daughter was married through deceit using a fake name. “Action is being taken on the basis of evidence,” said the officer. A group of BJP leaders had accompanied the complainant to the police. In Shahjahanpur, a Muslim youth identified as Mohammad Saeed was arrested on charges of allegedly sexually exploiting the woman after concealing his religion, said Sanjay Kumar, Superintendent of Police, City Shahjahanpur. Police said the accused had concealed his religious identity and raped the woman five years ago. He also clicked intimate pictures of the woman and blackmailed her with the threat to make it viral and continued to sexually exploit her, police alleged. While he also coerced her to give him money, recently he started threatening her to marry her by forcibly trying to convert her, police alleged. The man was also booked for rape and extortion. In Soorajpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar, police arrested four persons including three women — one of them a South Korean national — on charges of using enticement to convert people to a different religion. The accused were identified as Anmol from South Korea and Seema, Sandhya, Umesh Kumar of Prayagraj. They were also booked under Section 295a of IPC. Most of the arrests so far have been made in Sitapur and Mau. In Sitapur, 13 people have been arrested so far in a case after a Hindu girl allegedly eloped with a Muslim van driver of the same village, said DSP Laharpur Yadvendra Yadav. The girl’s father had alleged that the boy induced his daughter to flee from home with the intention of converting her religion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/11-firs-under-up-ordinance-so-far/article33380711.ece
21 December 2020||Chandigarh,||BJP trying to divert attention: Hooda||The Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal on Sunday slammed the one-day fast undertaken by BJP leaders in support of the early construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal (SYL), saying it was an attempt to divert attention from the protest against agriculture reforms. The SYL project is a focal point of a water-sharing dispute between Punjab and Haryana. BJP workers observed a fast on Saturday in Haryana to press for water-sharing from Punjab. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly, said, “The BJP wants to divert attention from the farmers agitation.” With regard to the SYL, the Supreme Court had already given a decision in Haryana’s favour and it was now the duty of the State and the Central governments to carry it out. “The BJP leads the government in Haryana as well as at the Centre, so who is stopping them from taking steps to start construction of the SYL canal,” Mr. Hooda asked. Mr. Hooda said Haryana government representatives should go to Delhi and observe a fast to urge the BJP government at the Centre to speed up the construction of SYL. “The BJP is shirking its responsibility,” he said. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) took a shot at the timing of the “fast” by BJP leaders. Former Minister and senior SAD leader Daljeet Singh Cheema said: “It’s a deep-rooted conspiracy to divide farmers of Punjab and Haryana, who are jointly fighting against the Centre’s farm laws.” In Narnaul, BJP Haryana president O.P. Dhankar said Punjab should provide Haryana its legitimate share of water through the early construction of the SYL canal. “It is the right time. We should not hesitate in asking our fellow farmers from Punjab to share water through the SYL. Once farmers from Punjab accede to water sharing, the politics played in Punjab will not affect Haryana’s share of water,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-trying-to-divert-attention-hooda/article33380704.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||India to bring more nations into coastal radar network||As part of efforts to further expand the coastal radar chain network meant to enable real-time monitoring of the high seas for threats as also expand India’s assistance for capacity building to Indian Ocean littoral states, efforts are in advanced stages to set up coastal radar stations in the Maldives, Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to defence sources. “Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka have already been integrated into the country’s coastal radar chain network. Similar plans are in the pipeline with Maldives and Myanmar and discussions are ongoing with Bangladesh and Thailand,” a defence source said. Similar proposals are being pursued with some more countries, a second source said. Two of the coastal radar stations in the Maldives were functional as of last year and work was under way on the third station. The Indian Navy’s Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC) located in Gurugram, which was set up after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, is the nodal agency for maritime data fusion. As part of information exchange regarding traffic on the high seas, the Navy has been authorised by the government to conclude white shipping agreements with 36 countries and three multilateral constructs. So far agreements have been concluded with 22 countries and one multilateral construct. Of these, 17 agreements and the one multilateral construct have been operationalised, the second source stated. Info fusion centre At the Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) which is meant to promote Maritime Domain Awareness, three more International Liaison Officers (ILO) are expected to join soon. The ILOs from France, Japan and the U.S. have joined the centre. “The additional officers have been delayed due to COVID-19,” an official said. Under Phase-I of the coastal radar chain network, 46 coastal radar stations have been set up across the country’s coastline. Under Phase-II of the project, which is currently under way, 38 static radar stations and four mobile radar stations are being set up by the Coast Guard and is in advanced stage of completion.  Sri Lanka, Mauritius and the Seychelles are integrated into country’s coastal radar link||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-to-bring-more-nations-into-coastal-radar-network/article33380707.ece
21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Skipped Congress meet as I was unwell, says Surjewala||A day after his conspicuous absence from Saturday’s high-profile meeting between the Gandhis and a section of group of 23 dissenters (G-23), Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala explained it by stating that he was “unwell”. Talking about the outcome of the meeting, the Congress leader — perceived to be close to former party chief Rahul Gandhi — said the Congress was now “united” to take on the Modi government. ‘All views heard’ “The meeting with Congress president ended on a cordial note. Views of the leaders were heard in a healthy discussion by the leadership. We shall stand united to fight the onslaught of the Modi government on our polity,” he said in an interview with The Hindu on Sunday. Mr. Surjewala also spoke at length about the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the three farm laws and blamed the Modi government’s “arrogance” for the deadlock. He said that “solution to a political issue does not lie in court”, and claimed that no farmers’ union had approached the Supreme Court to break the deadlock. “The solution to the impasse arising out of enactment of the anti-agriculture black laws does not lie in courts. The problem is that the 25 lakh crore agricultural trade is being sought to be handed over by the Prime Minister to three-four crony capitalist friends,” he said. “The farmers wanted a simple solution and that is immediate repeal of the laws.” Responding to the government’s charge that the Congress was instigating the farmers, he said, “The government and the BJP are insulting farmers by undermining their wisdom, hard work or their capacity to comprehend issues of their livelihood by attributing it to the instigation of Congress or other political parties.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/skipped-congress-meet-as-i-was-unwell-says-surjewala/article33380717.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||India, U.S. mull over unfinished work||With exactly a month left in U.S. President Donald Trump’s tenure, U.S. Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster has begun a series of calls on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and NITI Aayog chief Amitabh Kant, as well as “farewell discussions” with the U.S.-India business chambers, USIBC and USISPF. The calls highlighted the achievements of the India-U.S. partnership in the past four years. While these include great strides in diplomatic, defence, commercial, energy and health areas, talks on waivers for possible sanctions, trade negotiations, and nuclear deals are in the category of “unfinished business” between the the two countries. No free pass In a briefing this week, a U.S. official made it clear that despite hopes being raised in 2018 by the U.S. Congress’s amendment to the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), that allowed the U.S. President to waive sanctions on India’s purchase of the S-400 missile systems from Russia, Mr. Trump has not made the decision to give India a pass. Speaking about sanctions against Turkey for its purchase of the S-400, the official said this should be seen as a warning to others hoping to acquire the system. “We would caution other U.S. partners against making major purchases of Russian defence equipment in the future that would also put them at risk of sanctions,” R. Clarke Cooper, U.S. State Department Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, told presspersons in Washington, adding that the sanctions could be actualised at any point and there is no “blanket waiver” possible. “I know some states have thought or sought that either Congress or the Executive Branch would apply a waiver on sanctions, and I just would offer that is definitely not the case,” said Mr. Cooper, who had earlier called India’s consideration of the Russian S-400 and Sukhoi S-35 fighter jets as “problematic” as they would risk interoperability of India-U.S. defence systems. However, asked about the latest U.S. comments, Indian officials dismissed the concerns. “There will no issues in interoperability of the U.S. and Russian systems as they will be plugged into the Indian grid. There are filters for that,” a defence official told The Hindu . Given that the Democrats had pushed for the CAATSA, the government will have to take its chances with President-elect Joe Biden in office providing the waiver once India takes delivery of the S-400 systems in 2021. Trade negotiations are another area where New Delhi hopes the Biden administration will pick up where it believes the Trump administration failed to deliver, particularly its failure to reverse the decision to revoke India’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) since June 2019 due to differences in the areas of medical devices, dairy and IT products. Meanwhile, officials hopeful of a commercial contract finally being finalised for the decade-old MoU between U.S.-based Westinghouse Electric Company and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. (NPCIL) to build six reactors in Andhra Pradesh — the first since Mr. Modi and U.S. President Barack Obama announced “the deal is done” in 2015 — have also been disappointed with the lack of progress. Despite some hopes that the contract would be signed during Mr. Trump’s visit to India in February 2020, the deal is yet to go through, indicating lingering concerns over India’s civil liability laws. Both Indian and U.S. officials point out that the ledger of achievements during the past four years have been considerably longer than the “unfinished business”. They say that while New Delhi is now preparing hopefully for the Biden era, this period of plain-speaking, particularly Mr. Trump’s “blunt” and tough methods with India’s two main adversaries, Pakistan and China, and his flexibility in defence ties with India, would be missed. In particular, they point to the intense political engagement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi, including two huge, joint rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad held just five months apart in 2019 and 2020. The growing defence partnership, enhanced military exchanges bolstered by the signing of four foundational agreements: GSOMIA, LEMOA, COMCASA and BECA, U.S. grant of the STA-1 Strategic Trade Authorisation to India, capped by intelligence sharing and quick procurements during the ongoing standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), is clearly at the top of the list of achievements. Added to this is the crystallisation of the “Quad” arrangement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-us-mull-over-unfinished-work/article33380722.ece
21 December 2020||PUNE,||Uddhav against night curfew||While stating that he was not in favour of imposing a night curfew to curb the pandemic, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said it would be compulsory for all citizens to wear masks for the next six months. He said Maharashtra was yet to rid itself of the scourge of COVID-19 but there was a semblance of control over the pandemic. “Almost all businesses and establishments have opened. People are also moving about freely. I would only keep urging caution at every step,” said the Chief Minister. Mr. Thackeray said it had been possible to contain the spread of the virus only due to the lockdown and a strict enforcement of regulations. “Some experts have called for a ‘night curfew’, some are gunning for a lockdown. We have learnt from bitter experience the results of our actions and that prevention is always better than cure. Hence, those who still don’t wear masks are putting their kin at risk of infection,” he said, adding that masks were the most potent public weapon to ward off the virus. “The Union Health Minister has said that even if there is a vaccine, masks would henceforth be a mandatory feature. Countries in Europe and especially England are now going under a harsh lockdown. They have cited the fast-spreading ‘R nought’ variant of the virus,” he said, contrasting the pandemic conditions between the State and other European countries. He further warned the public against letting their guard down during the ongoing wedding seasons. Hitting out at the Centre for playing politics over the Mumbai Metro car shed, the Chief Minister said he had even invited the BJP for discussions to solve the political deadlock over the project. “It is unfortunate that the Union government had dragged the Maharashtra government to court over the Kanjurmarg land issue … This land doesn’t belong to the Centre or the State, it’s the people who own it,” said Mr. Thackeray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uddhav-against-night-curfew/article33380894.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Young farmers weeding out ‘misinformation’ on Web||Nearly 50 youth hailing from protesting farmer families have come together to counter “misinformation” and a “negative campaign” against the demonstrations in the capital round the clock. They take turns to bust falsehoods on social media platforms, take questions and reply to them and counter any negative perception. The youth say that because the elders in the family are not tech-savvy and are often unaware of the alleged slander, they have taken it upon themselves to engage with all those who doubt the motive of the campaign and feel that there is anything beyond a genuine anguish against the three proposed farm laws. Another reason, says this bunch, is that the traditional media has not been fair in reflecting their concerns. “So we leverage our education and technical know-how to bust the lies spread by the government about farmers. Apart from people at the Singhu and Tikri borders, we are also being helped by college and university students in large numbers, who are working round the clock and educating farmers back in Punjab and Haryana about the flaws in farms Bills,” said Harinder Happy, media coordinator and a Ph.D. scholar. Mr. Happy said they did not have a big set-up but they were fighting with what resources they have and counter malicious campaign on social media where farmers have been called terrorists. The leaders of the agitation have been targeted and defamed on social media. “To educate farmers and people on social media about our protest, every day we hold a live session on social media from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. where we take questions and answer them,” Mr. Happy said. “The BJP IT cell is targeting urban middle class people who are not aware of agrarian crisis or issues and they have been misled by TV channels,” Mr. Happy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/young-farmers-weeding-out-misinformation-on-web/article33380694.ece
21 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Tough task for TRS to pick Nagarjunasagar bypoll candidate||Local sentiment is likely to be the key issue in the candidate selection in the Nagarjuna Sagar by-poll, which the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) is desperate to win after two unsatisfactory performances in Dubbak by-poll and the GHMC elections. Despite rumours of senior Congress leader K. Jana Reddy being wooed by both the TRS and the BJP, it looks quite certain that he is likely to be the candidate from the Congress if he wishes to be. The TRS is looking for a candidate of his stature and a local candidate as the sentiment is gaining ground. In this backdrop the names of Legislative Council Chairman, Gutta Sukhender Reddy and TRS leder MC Koti Reddy, who was also the aspirant in 2018 Assembly elections, have cropped up. Mr. Koti Reddy is also the follower of Minister G. Jagadish Reddy and he is likely to pull strings in his favour if the need be. The US returned TRS supporter, Gaddampalli Ravinder Reddy is also staking claim and has been actively working in the constituency. Party is also considering a family member of late Nomula Narsimaiah, who represented the constituency till his death recently. The fresh experience of people rejecting candidate in Dubbaka is playing on party’s mind as the result proved people are not willing to accept a family member if they are not in active politics. “You can’t thrust anyone” is the argument heard quite loudly among the TRS cadre in the constituency. Sources said the party wants to go with a candidate whose stature is equal to Mr. Jana Reddy or a candidate from the same social group to give a tough fight. Mr. Jana Reddy has indicated to his well-wishers that he doesn’t have any intentions to switch parties at the fag end of his political career. There are rumours of TRS wooing Mr. Jana Reddy with Rajya Sabha nomination and ticket for his son. But none of the TRS leaders have confirmed it. A senior TRS leader, on condition of anonymity, said that there is a surging demand from the cadre that candidate should be a local unlike 2018 since the election is going to be tough for the ruling party on various counts. “A non-local will only add to the burden.” Whether Mr Sukhender Reddy is keen on taking Mr. Jana Reddy is a question that remains to be seen and he is said to have asked for sometime before taking a final call. He is already seeking the opinion of his followers on his candidature. Meanwhile, Mr. Koti Reddy is already on the job in the constituency expecting Chief Minister’s favour this time. Candidate selection cannot be delayed as the elections are likely to be held in February 2021 with the notification released in January. The Election Commission of India may notify Nagarjunasagar by-poll along with Tirupati Lok Sabha by-poll, which has to be completed before March, within the six-month period of its vacation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tough-task-for-trs-to-pick-nagarjunasagar-bypoll-candidate/article33380994.ece
21 December 2020||New Delhi,||‘Vajpayee spoke with Sharif four-five times amid Kargil war’||Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif spoke to each other on the phone at least four or five times during the course of the Kargil war, with the former veering to the view that Mr. Sharif had been bamboozled by the Pakistani Army headed by General Pervez Musharraf into the conflict. A new book on the late Vajpayee’s tenure as Prime Minister,Vajpayee: The Years That Changed India,by former bureaucrat Shakti Sinha, who served as Vajpayee’s private secretary for many years, including in the Prime Minister’s Office during the conflict, goes on to say that the communication was kept up after a telling incident between Mr. Sharif and R.K. Mishra, former head of the Observer Research Foundation, the man selected for back-channel talks. Suspected tapping “…Sharif’s position was a tenuous one, and in a later meeting, he indicated to Mishra that they should take a walk in the garden, obviously suspecting that his own house was tapped. When Mishra reported this to Vajpayee, the latter took this as an indication that Sharif was more a prisoner of circumstances than anything else,” the book says. “Vajpayee must have spoken to Sharif 4-5 times during the one-and-a-half month period from mid-May to 4th July when the Pakistani PM publicly committed to President Clinton that Pakistan would withdraw its forces to its side of the LoC,” the book further says. One of these calls occurred in mid-June from Srinagar, after Vajpayee paid a visit to Kargil. “On his arrival in Srinagar Vajpayee asked me to connect him to Sharif. My small team and I tried but we just could not get through. Then one of the local officers present informed us that dialling Pakistan (+92) from Jammu and Kashmir was barred. The telecom authorities were told to open the facility for a short while, so that the two Prime Ministers could talk,” the book says. Phone recordings A major factor in the withdrawal of Pakistani troops from the LoC, according to the book, was also because of two telephonic recordings that Arvind Dave, chief of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India’s external intelligence agency, brought to Prime Minister Vajpayee. “Arvind Dave, the RAW chief, came up with two telephonic recordings between the Pakistani Army chief Pervez Musharraf, and his Chief of General Staff, Lt. Gen. Mohammad Aziz. It was clear that the Pakistan Army was involved, with the Mujahideen playing a minor role, if any,” the book says. The tapes were shared with the media later, but were also smuggled into Pakistan for Mr. Sharif via the diplomatic route along with diplomat Vivek Katju and Mr. Mishra. The book spans Vajpayee’s premiership and the eventful years from an insider’s perspective and is full of bon mots .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vajpayee-spoke-with-sharif-four-five-times-amid-kargil-war/article33380709.ece
21 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||Lasting solution for monkey menace||The first rescue and rehabilitation centre for monkeys in Telangana was inaugurated at Gandi Ramanna Haritavanam near Chincholi village in Nirmal district on Sunday. It is the second such facility for the primates in the country. To make the rehabilitation centre a sustainable habitat for the primates, several fruit and flowering plants, a variety of trees that provide shade, and medicinal plants would be grown. Minister for Forests A. Indrakaran Reddy, who inaugurated the centre, said the monkeys that venture into human habitations would be caught in a phased manner, brought to the centre where they would be operated on for birth control and would be released into the forests again after the rehabilitation period. The Minister inaugurated the centre along with a lab, an operation theatre, a mouse deer park and play-cum-recreation facilities for children, including boating and a chain-link, on the occasion. The Minister said the rehabilitation centre for the primates was built at an estimated cost of Rs. 2.25 crore. Along with the Minister, District Collector Musharraf Ali Faruqui drove the safari vehicle as part of the inauguration. The Minister said the mouse deer park was set up at a cost of Rs. 8 lakh and other development works were undertaken at a cost of Rs. 2.65 crore. The Minister said the rehabilitation centre for the monkeys was also the first such facility in south India. The other facility in the country was in Himachal Pradesh. The Minister said the rehabilitation centre had been established on the advice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who had been repeatedly impressing upon improving the green cover in the State and to take monkeys venturing into human habitations back into the forests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lasting-solution-for-monkey-menace/article33380664.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||ED to move extradition request against Iqbal Mirchi’s wife, sons||Armed with non-bailable warrants from a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PLMA), the Enforcement Directorate is preparing to move an extradition request against the family members of international drug trafficker Iqbal Mirchi, who died in the United Kingdom in 2013. The agency recently filed chargesheets against Mirchi’s wife Hajra Memon and their two sons, Asif and Junaid, for alleged money laundering. The court took cognisance of the charges and issued the warrants. The three are currently said to be in the U.K., where the Indian enforcement agencies are already pursuing the extradition of businessmen Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, and defence dealer Sanjay Bhandari. The agency also moved an application seeking that the three family members of Mirchi be declared wanted under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, as they had failed to join the probe despite several summons. A request to confiscate 15 properties worth Rs. 96 crore, and Rs. 1.9 crore in six bank accounts under the Act has also been made. Taking note of the plea, the court issued notices seeking their presence till February 16. Under the PLMA, the agency has so far attached properties worth Rs. 978 crore in India and overseas. Five accused have so far been arrested in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-readies-extradition-request-for-mirchis-wife-sons/article33381178.ece
21 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Man alleges harassment by loan app employees||A man from Saidabad approached police on Saturday night alleging harassment, public shaming and threatening by an app-based instant loan provider The victim, Sai Aravind Dauluri, a resident of Singareni Colony in Saidabad, told the police that he had borrowed Rs. 3,500 from ‘My Bank’ app in the month of November and the company had disbursed Rs. 2,600 after deducting processing fees and interest. As he repaid the loan amount within a week, the company unlocked more features for him and he borrowed additional Rs. 30,000 for which he was asked to repay Rs. 55,000 within a period of one week. Threatening calls When he failed to repay the amount on time, My Bank’s customer care executive called and started threatening him that they would inform about his default to his friends and family members, Saidabad sub-inspector P. Madhava Rao said. “Though Aravind requested them to give him two days for repayment, My Bank customer care executives phoned him more than 400 times and threatened to publicly shame and call up his contacts,” he said. The app company employees started calling up all his contacts informing them about it on Aravind failing to return their money, Mr. Rao said. “They also created at least 10 WhatsApp groups, added the victim’s contacts in it and started sharing his and mother’s morphed photographs to bring pressure on him,” the officer said, adding that the customer care executives publicly humiliated Aravind by using abusive language. Based on a complaint, a case under Section 384, 420, 504,506 of Indian Penal Code and Section 3 and 13 of Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Money Lending Act against My Bank and launched a probe. The victim stated the app company levied a fine of Rs. 3,000 per day, which was illegal and the payment happened through Razorpay, an online payment gateway. 50 complaints Meanwhile Rachakonda Cyber Crime ACP S Harinath told The Hindu that so far they have received over 50 complaints against such instant loan mobile applications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/man-alleges-harassment-by-loan-app-employees/article33381034.ece

While the RBI has been consistently alerting on finance frauds, it learnt that some micro finance institutions were actively pumping money to loan apps. These loans are extended to prospective clients in the form of personal loans carrying higher interest rates as they are designated as ‘subprime’ loans. The rate of interest varies from 18 % to 40 % and sometimes touching 60 % to 150 %. This in addition to processing fee, which is paid upfront, when factored in, hiked up interest rate further, police said.

21 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||Centre urged to release MGNREGS payment||The State government has requested the Centre to release Rs. 1,024.59 crore pending funds for material and administration components of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in Telangana. In a letter addressed to Union Minister of Rural Development Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday, Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Errabelli Dayakar Rao said the State government has already generated 13.37 crore persondays against the annual approved labour budget of generating 13.75 crore persondays. The achievement was 97.3% as on December 20. He stated that 51.87 lakh wage-seekers belonging to 29.87 lakh households were provided wage employment as part of the scheme. He explained to the Union Minister that out of the Rs. 526 crore outstanding material component of 2019-20, Rs. 394.5 crore of the Central share is still due.

21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Why can’t Modi visit farmers, asks Congress||The Congress, while appreciating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unscheduled visit to Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib here on Sunday, asked why could not he visit the Singhu border to listen to agitating farmers. The Congress pointed out that 33 protesting farmers had died from extreme cold and related ailments. Earlier in the day, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, paid tributes to the dead. Congress general secretary (communications) Randeep Surjewala, in a tweet in Hindi, said the sermon being heard in the background of the video of the Mr. Modi’s visit said, “A man can read as many scriptures as he may, but if he doesn’t think about the goodness of humanity, then all of his readings are worthless. Where and how long will he run when death comes.” He further said, “I wish the Prime Minister, who is playing a cruel joke on farmers, would adopt this Guru Vani instead of just posing for pictures.” ‘Where is empathy?’ Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed said, “It is always a good thing to go to a gurdwara, go to a mandir. At the same time farmers are protesting in this bitter cold at the border, 33 of them have died during the agitation. They say that Pradhan Mantri is a man who loves this country and people. Where is the empathy from the Pradhan Mantri?” Ms. Mohamed took a dig at Union Home Minister Amit Shah, saying he had the time to visit West Bengal to attend a rally, but could not go to the Singhu border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-cant-modi-visit-farmers-asks-congress/article33380700.ece
21 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Loan apps: police teams sent to Delhi, Bengaluru||The investigation into the “harassment” by app-based instant financing platforms has deepened, with the Hyderabad cybercrime police sending two teams to Delhi and Bengaluru to identify and nab the masterminds. They will also physically verify the locations of the offices-cum-call centres of the app companies. The teams were sent to the national capital and Bengaluru based on the call detail record of the phone numbers of the loan borrowers, who complained of harassment and humiliation over repayment, a senior officer associated with the investigation told The Hindu . ‘Tracking numbers’ “As of now, there is no concrete progress in the case. Our teams are on the job. They are tracking the phone numbers through which the lenders had communicated with the recipients and their family members,” he said on condition of anonymity. More teams would be sent to other locations across the country, he added. So far, the Hyderabad police have registered more than nine cases against such companies, of which eight were booked based on the complaint lodged by women from different age groups. Meanwhile, the Cyberabad and the Rachakonda police have stepped up the investigation by writing to Alphabet Inc., which owns Google, to provide technical hosting details and online payment gateway link-ups of the app-based loan providers. However, the police said the breakthrough in the case depended on the information shared by Google, PhonePe, Paytm and other online wallets. The Cyberabad police also searched the offices of certain companies in Hyderabad. “It all depends on the quickness with which Google and others react. We have already launched a comprehensive investigation into this,” another officer said. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been consistently alerting on finance frauds, it is learnt that some microfinance institutions were actively pumping money into loan apps. These loans are extended to prospective clients in the form of personal loans carrying higher interest rates and are designated as ‘subprime’ loans. The rate of interest varies from 18% to 40%, sometimes touching 60% to 150%. This, in addition to the processing fees which is paid upfront, when factored in, hiked the interest rates further, the police said. The police suspect the involvement of some high net worth individuals, including businessmen and moneylenders. They have identified more than 60 such loan apps on Google Play Store whose operations are unlawful. “All appear to be built upon one software development kit [SDK], which is suspected to be provided by a foreign country, mostly Chinese,” the officer said. Given the number of young people falling prey to the promise of loans online, the police cautioned them to stay away from such apps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/loan-apps-police-teams-sent-to-delhi-bengaluru/article33380673.ece

The Kalamassery police said that Mohammed Irshad and Mohammed Aadhil, who were absconding, were arrested from Kalamassery when they arrived there accompanied by a lawyer, purportedly to surrender before the police.

The duo approached a lawyer at Perinthalmanna seeking advice on anticipatory bail. “They did not know the woman, and was curious to know her films when they saw her taking pictures with other people.

In reply to a question, Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal said if the government targeted people for sending money to their family members and friends from abroad in support of the agitation under the Foreign Contribution (regulation) Act then it was “condemnable”. He also condemned the raids on the arthiyas (commission agents) and farmers, and said people in Punjab would hold demonstrations outside the Income Tax offices against this. Earlier in the day, Prime Minster Narendra Modi prayed at the historic Rakabganj Sahib gurdwara, where the body of Guru Teg Bahadur was cremated. “I felt extremely blessed. I, like millions around the world, am deeply inspired by the kindnesses of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji,” said a tweet from his official handle.

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||BJP CM in Bengal will be a son of the soil: Shah||Speaking about the crowd that had gathered during his one-km-long roadshow, Mr. Shah said people were yearning for change as they want to get “rid of political violence, corruption, and extortion”. Addressing the gathering at the end of the rally, Mr. Shah said he had attended several roadshows “but have never seen one like this”. Addressing a press conference at Bolpur later in the day, Mr. Shah raised the issue of political violence and said the attack on party president J.P. Nadda’s convoy in Diamond Harbour “was an attack on democracy” and added that such attacks would not deter the BJP even an inch from its goal of removing the Trinamool government in Bengal. “Even after the attack the reaction from Trinamool leaders felt that they were supporting the attack,” he said. Mr. Shah reiterated that the Trinamool was a family-run party. “Trinamool had been reduced to a family-run party. Instead of thinking of the welfare of 10 crore people of the State, Mamata ji is thinking how to make her nephew the Chief Minister,” he alleged. Referring to several development indicators, Mr. Shah said West Bengal had slipped on all counts — employment, agriculture, industry — except that it was “number one in political violence and corruption”. Earlier in the day, as Mr. Shah visited Visva Bharati, set up by Rabindranath Tagore in 1921, the Trinamool held protests outside Jorasanko Thakurbari in Kolkata, alleging that the BJP had insulted the poet. Senior Trinamool leader and Minister Subrata Mukherjee said: “They (the BJP) have demeaned Rabindranath... we are shocked and therefore, we are wanted to protest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-cm-in-bengal-will-be-a-son-of-the-soil-shah/article33380687.ece
21 December 2020||New Delhi,||CPI(M) flays cancellation of Parliament session||The CPI(M) Polit Bureau has denounced the cancellation of the winter session of Parliament by the Union government quoting the rise in number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi. “The pandemic is not a problem for the BJP to organise its election campaign and rallies but it has chosen to avoid being answerable to Parliament. It is thus abandoning its constitutional responsibility of being accountable in Parliament,” the Polit Bureau said in a statement here after a day-long meeting. The Modi government, the party said, is escaping answering questions over its all-round failure in tackling the pandemic and economic recession while mercilessly attacking the livelihood of the people and destroying the rights of the working people and the peasantry. The CPI(M) expressed support to over 500 organisations peacefully protesting demanding the repeal of the new farm laws. “The struggle has entered the 25th day. The Polit Bureau salutes the martyrdom of 31 kisans in this struggle. Despite the severe cold wave sweeping across north India, more kisans are pouring in to join and strengthen the struggle further,” the party said. The Polit Bureau has asked all its units to organise solidarity actions in support of the farmers’ protest. The Polit Bureau slammed the Modi government for the price rise and continuing fuel price hike. “The miseries imposed due to the pre-pandemic economic slowdown has worsened during the course of this year. Prime Minister Modi and his government seem totally unconcerned about imposing further burdens and miseries on the people,” the CPI(M) said.

21 December 2020||PUNE,||Maharashtra CM against night curfew||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday that he was not in favour of imposing night curfew to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, and added that it is compulsory for all citizens to wear masks for the next six months. In a live web cast, Mr. Thackeray said though the State had not yet been rid of the virus, there was a semblance of control since the pandemic began in March. “Almost all businesses and establishments have opened up. People are also moving about freely. I would keep urging caution at every step,” the Chief Minister said, adding that throughout the pandemic, his government had presented all figures in a transparent manner. Mr. Thackeray said it had been possible to contain the spread only due to the lockdown and strict enforcement of regulations. “Some experts have suggested a night curfew while some are gunning for a lockdown. However, I do not think that any such drastic step will be necessary…We have learnt from bitter experience the results of our actions, and that prevention is always better than cure. Hence, those who still don’t wear masks are putting their kin at risk of infection,” the Chief Minister said. “The Union Health Minister has also said that even if there is a vaccine, masks would remain a mandatory feature. Countries in Europe, especially England, are going under a harsh lockdown, the likes of which not seen earlier. They have cited a fast-spreading ‘R nought’ variant of the virus,” he said. He also warned the public against letting their guard down during the ongoing wedding season. “Invite guests, not coronavirus. Try to avoid large gatherings and do not click photos with masks off,” the CM said. Metro car shed Hitting out at the Union government for playing politics over the Mumbai Metro car shed, he said he had even invited the Bharatiya Janata Party for discussions to solve the deadlock over the project. “It is unfortunate that the Union government dragged Maharashtra government to court over the Kanjurmarg land issue… This land doesn’t belong to the Centre or the State; it’s the people who own it,” he said. On the BJP accusing him of being ‘arrogant’, Mr. Thackeray said, “Yes, I certainly am arrogant for the welfare of Mumbai and Maharashtra... I ask the public to judge whether picking Kanjurmarg is an “act of arrogance” or one for the benefit of the State?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-cm-against-night-curfew/article33380720.ece

Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are the other States.

21 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Ex-CMs urge govt. to solve labour issues||Former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy, who have been trading barbs against each other in recent weeks, on Sunday spoke on an unified issue — urging the State government to intervene in solving the deadlock at Toyota Kirloskar plant in Bidadi near here. “The management of Toyota has declared a lockout in one of the plants in Bidadi. The protest by the workers has entered 40th day and the management has so far not come forward for talks,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said in a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, in which he also expressed concern over the situation in Wistron, which witnessed violence last week, and Arvind Fashions where workers have been protesting for 20 days. “While the government does not care if workers protest peacefully for weeks or months, it brands them as thieves, dacoits and arsonists if the protests turn violent. Using police, false cases are being foisted against the workers,” he said. The former Chief Minister said that labour laws have been framed under the Constitution to find solution to the working class and one needs maturity, humane attitude and statesmanship to find solutions. He urged the Chief Minister to bring both managements and workers to the table to find solutions. Mr. Siddaramaiah also took exceptions to the way in which the Wistron’s violence was being spoken about by Ministers. Meanwhile, in a series of tweets on Sunday, Mr. Kumaraswamy said: “The solution does not appear to be in sight though the strike by the employees of Toyota Kirloskar’s Bidadi plant is completing two months. The differences between the workers and management, and the government’s apathy may also be the reasons for such a situation. But there is a dire need to put an end to the impasse in the interest of the State’s industrial development.” Blaming the middle managers of the company for the crisis, he said that 3,000 workers have been pushed into the street. “I myself have held several meetings in a bid to resolve the workers’ crisis. It appears clear that the managers between the management and the workers are trying to create confusion as well as problems. It is important to note that these managerial personnel are not from either this region or the State.” It is not proper on the part of the companies that thrive by utilising our land, water, air and infrastructure to behave in such a cruel manner with our own people, he added. Urging the government to intervene in the matter urgently, he said: “The government should understand that resolving the labour crisis would benefit the State.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-cms-urge-govt-to-solve-labour-issues/article33380667.ece

The illicit trade of such species and untrammelled exploitation of some medicinal plants would be regulated soon with a State-specific conservation data of its threatened species. Species specialists are hoping to come out with an interim report on the regional-level data on mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes by January end. The list will speak about the conservation status of fishes, odonates, spiders, freshwater crabs and molluscs. It is after a gap of few years that the State is attempting to draw up the list. A similar effort was carried out by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board in 2013. The data thus prepared by the board was submitted to the National Biodiversity Authority, said K.P. Laladhas, former member-secretary of the board. Expert groups have been working on the ‘red list’ prepared by the International Union for Conservation of Nature for mining out the regional data. While evaluating the available data, they would also provide the latest data that was available with them to update the list and for future evaluations, said P.M. Sureshan, the officer-in-charge of the Zoological Survey of India, Western Ghat Regional Centre, Kozhikode, who is coordinating the programme. While extensive data is available in the case of some groups, there is data deficiency in case of others. The expert groups have been asked to put in all the available information on species to the list. The globally accepted tools for assessing the conservation status of animals will be used for drawing up the list. The board is funding the project. Some species, which may not be globally threatened, might be threatened in Kerala and the State needs to put in measures to protect their habitat and address the conservation threats. The National Biodiversity Act mandated the State boards to prepare such plans, said Dr. Sureshan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/red-list-of-animals-birds-to-be-updated/article33380674.ece
21 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Not trying to dominate Cong.: IUML||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) on Sunday strived to fend off the accusation that it had attempted to supplant Congress as the dominant partner in the United Democratic Front (IUML). IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty said his party would not fall for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's ploy to create divisions in the UDF. The IUML had decided not to get drawn into the internal mechanics of the Congress. Moreover, it would restrict its view on the workings of alliance partners strictly within the confines of the UDF. In a Facebook post, IUML Malappuram district secretary Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal said his party had never aspired to usurp the position of the Congress in the UDF. CM criticised Meanwhile, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) vice president V.D. Satheeshan slammed Mr. Vijayan for ‘attempting’ to stoke fear of Islam to open the door for the BJP in Kerala. The Chief Minister had adapted a hard-right stance to attract the Hindu votes he had lost due to the government’s intractable position on preserving the traditions of the Sabarimala temple. BJP’s statement Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said Mr. Vijayan had said nothing new. The IUML had already assumed the dominant position in the UDF. It now aspired to control a weakened Congress in Kerala. He alleged that the Congress, CPI(M) and IUML had worked in tandem to single out and defeat BJP candidates in the local body polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/not-trying-to-dominate-cong-iuml/article33380679.ece

21 December 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Stalin rolls out poll campaign, says DMK aiming at 200 seats||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday launched “We reject the AIADMK” campaign and called upon party workers to visit villages in their area for 10 days from December 23. “Our goal is Mission-200 (Assembly seats). A party requires just 117 seats to form the government. But we are contesting not to secure just 117 seats. It will not make us proud. We cannot be content with even one seat less than 200,” he said while addressing party workers from all the 234 Assembly constituencies. Mr. Stalin said he would launch his campaign from January as there were reports that the election could be advanced. “We have to prepare ourselves for the campaign early. The high-command will take care of alliances and candidates. Only those capable of winning the elections will be our candidates,” he said.  Reiterating that achieving victory was not magic and could not be secured easily, Mr. Stalin said the true victory would be repeating the performance of the DMK and its alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which they won 39 seats. “The DMK could have won the Assembly elections in 2016 because the difference between the ruling AIADMK and the DMK was just one per cent. Overconfidence led to our failure to capture power. So don’t be overconfident. Let us bury the differences and bitterness among us,” he said. Mr. Stalin said excuses such as the AIADMK won by distributing money and used the police to secure victory would not help. “The ruling party has amassed money through corrupt means and industrialists who are benefitted by the government will release money. We have to break the influence of money,” he said. ‘AIADMK failure’ Mr. Stalin said the DMK should win over the minds of the people. “People are angry because the AIADMK government has not done anything for their constituencies in the last 10 years. The anger will manifest itself during the election. We should remind people of the failures of the government and consequently, the fall of Tamil Nadu, during the campaign,” he said. Just like campaigns such as ‘Tamilagam Meetpom’ (Retrieve Tamil Nadu) and ‘Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural’ (Stalin’s voice towards dawn), “We reject the AIADMK” campaign too should win people’s faith, he said. “You should adopt a resolution that we reject the AIADMK with the help of people during your visits to villages,” he said. He said when a secretary of the city unit visits a village, he should take with him other functionaries. “Do not think that he contested against you in the organisational polls. Invite people the way you invite them for your family wedding. Sow in their minds the truth that Tamil Nadu was spoiled in the last 10 years. Tell them it is a shame to vote for the AIADMK,” he said.  The party high-command will take care of alliances and candidates. Only those capable of winning will be our candidates M.K.

21 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Residents demand consultation on canal project||As the project to give the Buckingham Canal a makeover is set be kick-started by various government agencies in Chennai, residents along the 48.5 km stretch from Ennore Creek to Muttukadu are demanding public consultation for proper design of the infrastructure associated with the waterway. Residents say the proper implementation of the restoration project of Buckingham and 52 other canals in Chennai is crucial to flood mitigation in most residential areas such as Chepauk, Triplicane, Mylapore, Velachery, Raja Annamalaipuram, Adyar, Mandaveli, Tiruvottiyur, R.K. Nagar, Pulianthope and Sholinganallur. K. Viswanathan, Secretary, Mylapore Residents’ Welfare Association, said residents had made a representation to civic officials for restoration of the Buckingham Canal because of flooding in areas such as Raja Annamalaipuram. “We have highlighted civic issues caused by the existing condition of Buckingham Canal. There has been a constant exchange of ideas between corporation officials and residents. Because of the MRTS stations in Mylapore, Mandaveli and Light House, the canal’s width has been reduced. True restoration of th canal can happen only if the water flows properly from north to south, without inundating residential areas,” said Mr. Viswanathan. Residents have stressed the need for engineering solutions for draining floodwater into Buckingham Canal near areas where MRTS stations have blocked the flow. Pointing to the variation in the width of the canal in the city, residents said they wanted officials to conduct public consultations at flood-prone locations to get information from engineers about the optimum width of the Buckingham Canal and 52 drains. Shrinking area The width of the Buckingham Canal has shrunk from 200 metres to less than 50 metres in many locations. Residents who have constructed houses along the Buckingham Canal have supported the project because of the possibility of appreciation in the market value of their property. S. Mangala Raj, former councillor, said residents who own property on roads approved by the Greater Chennai Corporation in the vicinity of Buckingham Canal support the project because the property valuers expect an increase in market value by more than 40%. “Residents who are identified for resettlement have resisted the move. Some residents have demanded houses in the same neighbourhood to prevent loss of livelihood,” said Mr. Mangala Raj. M. Satheesh, a resident of Ekambaram Street in Mylapore Assembly constituency, said residents were worried as officials had informed them about the visit of a team this week to identify households that need to be evicted. “My daughters are studying in a school in Santhome. One is in class 12 and the other is in class 10. Their education will be affected in the event of sudden relocation. We request construction of houses in a large parcel of land that was used as a garbage transfer station by the Corporation in Mylapore,” said Mr. Satheesh. Residents in the neighbourhood said the area had flooding of more than one metre during the 2015 floods. Inside the houses in the area, there was water up to one feet during the rain this year. At least, 378 households have been identified by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board as per Rajiv Awas Yojana survey on Ekambaram street many years ago. But the actual number of households was expected to be more than 1,000 in the area now, residents said. As a result, the demand for in situ development of new high-rise houses has gained momentum in the Corporation land that was earlier used as a garbage transfer station in Mylapore near Ambedkar Bridge. Demand rejected But the Corporation officials have rejected the demand to build houses in the garbage transfer station in Mylapore. After the Corporation stopped using the garbage transfer station as per the new system of garbage clearance, the civic officials are planning to reserve the land for development of civic infrastructure instead of permitting the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board to build high-rise buildings for the poor. At least 60 slums along the Buckingham Canal are expected to be demolished for restoration of the 48.5-km stretch of the canal. According to some estimates, more than two lakh people are expected to be affected by the project to restore Buckingham Canal after the enumeration is completed. Civic officials said the project would prevent pollution of the canal and improve public health in more than 25% of the 200 wards of the Corporation. Pollution in Tiruvottiyur, Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Teynampet, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur zones are expected to reduce after the completion of the first phase of the project. In the first phase, the Corporation will create infrastructure to prevent dumping of solid waste in Buckingham Canal and 52 drains in various parts of the city. Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board will develop infrastructure to enlarge sewage pumping main, enlarge existing gravity sewer main, construct new sewage treatment plants and improve existing pumping stations. Administrative sanction for Rs. 1,001-crore worth projects has been given by the government. Officials pointed to the increase in allocation of Rs. 608 crore for plugging sewage outfalls in the Buckingham Canal when compared to Rs. 31 crore for the Cooum river and Rs. 89 crore for the Adyar river. The first phase is expected to be completed by December 2022 and the restoration project is expected to be completed by 2023.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-demand-consultation-on-canal-project/article33380820.ece

21 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||83 kg gold seized at Chennai airport during lockdown||On November 29, a passenger from Dubai, Syed Nadeem Ur Rehaman arrived in Chennai and was seemingly in a hurry to leave the terminal. Customs officials, who grew suspicious, checked his baggage. It had some cosmetics, toy cars, tiger balm and nail cutters but all of these hidden inside deftly. Wondering why these should be hidden, they opened the articles one after the other. They discovered thin pieces of gold underneath the bottle caps of tiger balm, face cream boxes and gold concealed in the base of toy cars. They recovered 286 g of gold worth Rs. 14.12 lakh from him. From hiding gold in wrist watches to footwear straps, there have been numerous such cases during lockdown where passengers have attempted to smuggle gold into the country. This despite there being limited number of international flights. There have been 218 cases of gold smuggling and 52 persons have been arrested. In the lockdown period, customs officials have seized 83.35 kg of gold worth Rs. 37.55 crore at Chennai airport. Recently, there were some passengers who tried to smuggle gold by bringing them as foil and wrap them in layers in the covers of carton boxes too. While a few have tried to stitch gold paste within the jeans, gold has been hidden even under medical bandage and under mobile covers too. Rajan Chaudhary, Commissioner of Customs, Chennai Airport, says as soon as the relief flights and subsequently followed by air-bubble flights started operating from West Asia, gold smuggling resumed. “Not many flights are operating in Chennai as compared to other airports but we have been making good seizures. We are trying to be thorough in profiling passengers, physical checking, scanning, and this has resulted in preventing smuggling to a great extent,” he says. He said in a majority of the cases, passengers have tried to hide gold in the form of a paste in their rectum. “This is obviously difficult to detect. So, we have developed a network and based on intelligence inputs, we have been able to find these cases,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/83-kg-gold-seized-at-airport-during-lockdown/article33380824.ece

21 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||The violin that strings together the East and the West||The violin made of ivory remains a testimony to the collaboration between the Western and Carnatic music. A visitor to the ancient house of the Thanjavur Quartet — Chinnaya, Ponnaiya, Sivanandam and Vadivelu — at 1880, West Main Street, Thanjavur, can see the instrument which was played by Vadivelu, the youngest of the family. “It was presented to Vadivelu by Travancore King and composer Swathi Tirunal in 1834. Conch, the emblem of Travancore, has been carved on the right hand side of the instrument,” said dance teacher K.P.K. Chandrasekar, who belongs to the eighth generation of the Thanjavur Quartet. Vadivelu had learnt the instrument from a Christian priest at the Thanjavur palace. He had also accompanied his brothers in their concerts with his instrument. There is a difference of opinion over who first introduced the violin to the Carnatic music. One section says it was Baluswami Dikshitar, the brother of Muthuswami Dikshitar, and the other says it was Vadivelu. Since Baluswami Dikshitar (1786-1859) is senior to Vadivelu (1810-1845), it is believed that he was the first to adopt the western instrument for Carnatic music. However, dance teacher K.P. Kittappa, Mr. Chandrasekar’s father, who taught Vyjayanthimala, Hema Malini, Sudharani Raghupathy and Narthaki Nataraj, in his book, Bharatha Isaiyum Thanjai Nalvarum , published by Tamil University, Thanjavur, said it was Vadivelu who first played Carnatic music on the violin. He had cited musicologist Sourindra Mohun Tagore and British scholar Charles Russell Day to support his argument. ‘Singer of repute’ “A singer of repute and composer of many ‘varnas’ and ‘svarajatis’, he is believed to have introduced the use of the European violin in Southern India,” wrote Day in his book, The Music and Musical Instruments of Southern India and the Deccan . Day spent his days in India as an Army officer before being sent home because of an injury. According to Kittappa, the brothers, after developing a difference of opinion with Maratha King Serfoji II, left Thanjavur for Travancore. “Swathi Tirunal built a house, Sankara Vilas, for the brothers in Thiruvananthapuram,” he wrote. Swathi Tirunal presented an ivory violin and a case made of ivory. But only the violin remains in a wooden box today. “It has four strings and has not been taken out of the box for decades. We lost the key and I remember my family opening it once when I was a child,” Mr. Chandrasekar recalled.

21 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NHAI invites tenders for Chittoor to Thatchur greenfield expressway||The National Highways Authority of India has invited tenders for constructing the 116 km-long Chittoor-Thatchur greenfield expressway – NH 716 B – that will provide direct connectivity to Bengaluru and Chittoor and also the proposed Chennai–Kurnool economic corridor. The project would be taken up on a hybrid annuity mode (HAM) under Bharatmala Pariyojana, as four packages in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh at a cost of around Rs. 3,100 crore. The six-lane road with a 70 mt carriageway, would be designed for speeds of up to 100 km/hr and would run via 75 km of Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh and 41 km of Tiruvallur district covering Pallipattu and Uthukottai taluks in Tamil Nadu. It will begin at 152 km-point of the proposed Bangalore-Chennai Expressway and end at Thatchur near Panapakkam on the Tirupati Road. Various locations in the chainage are Kumarajapet, Veera Kaverirajapuram, Pondavakkam and Kanigaiper.  Protest continues With around 75% of the land required for the project being agricultural, farmers have been staging protests. Annually, the farmers produce an estimated 6,000 tonnes of rice, 3,500 tonnes of sugarcane and oil seeds and vegetables. Around 1,000 acres of rich agricultural lands that have at least two harvests a year and 221 acres of cattle grazing lands would be lost to the project. It will directly affect 15 lakes, 11 ponds and 47 irrigation channels. “We supply most of the produce to Chennai and Tiruvallur. This will be lost if the project runs through our villages. Documents related to the project only talk about the economic advantage to ports and container movement. They do not even take into consideration the loss of livelihood due to agricultural activities taking a hit,” said Sambandam, a farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/despite-protests-nhai-invites-tenders-for-chittoor-thatchur-greenfield-expressway/article33380940.ece

According to the police, on Saturday, a man made purchases for Rs. 300 at a provision store run by Jayanthi at Subramaniam Nagar, Valasaravakkam. He handed over a note with a face value of Rs. 2,000 and she returned Rs. 1,700 balance amount. The man gave her two more notes and sought change. “Ms. Jayanthi gave him four notes of Rs. 500 denomination and he started praising her.

Ramachandran’s political heir, as he embarked on the second phase of his election campaign in Injambakkam, Porur, Poonamallee and Sriperumbudur outside Chennai. Speaking near the Porur signal, he said Porur had been urbanised, but infrastructure had not been upgraded. “The quality of life has not grown as much as the real estate rates in the area. The Chennai Port-Maduravoyal Expressway has not been built for the last 10 years. The situation can be changed if honest people are voted to power, instead of criminals,” he said. Mr. Haasan said he was not suddenly claiming MGR’s legacy. “They ask why I have been speaking about MGR only before the election. They have been deaf and blind. Our first slogan was ‘Naalai Namadhey’. We are not a party to keep repeating his name to make money,” he said. He added, “We will speak of Gandhi, MGR, Periyar and Ambedkar. We want their good intentions to become ours. Those who want good things for people are MGR’s heirs. His legacy is not a waste land to sell.” Speaking at Poonamallee, Mr. Haasan said his political opponents were angry with his claiming MGR’s legacy because so many people had come together without taking money. “They are worried that so many people have gathered without taking ‘quarter and money’,” he said. Visits ECR Earlier, he met around 400 residents of East Coast Road, who were protesting against a storm-water drain (SWD) project being implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). Addressing the residents at Injambakkam, he said his party wanted to protect the environment and reverse the damage done over the decades to waterbodies. “When I went for film shootings as a child and wanted to go boating in a lake near Kodambakkam, I was told I could do so after I grew up since I couldn’t swim. That lake has vanished...,” he said. R. Balakrishnan, treasurer, VGP Golden Seaview Residents Welfare Association, said, “We don’t want the project since it would spoil the underground aquifer that provides water to many areas in the city. The sandy soil in our area already does the job of recharging the groundwater table and absorbing rainwater effectively.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mgrs-legacy-not-a-waste-land-to-sell-says-kamal/article33380846.ece

21 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Avinashi Road elevated corridor work highlights Coimbatore Corpn.’s failure to develop scheme roads||As the Highways Department is all set to start work on the 10-km Avinashi Road elevated corridor project, the traffic congestion that the work will cause and the absence of alternative roads to go east of the city throw light on the Coimbatore Corporation’s failure to develop scheme roads. The department taking up the project even as another east-bound road, the Trichy Road, witnesses traffic congestion because of flyover project has caused apprehension in the minds of the public that the city will soon witness heavy traffic congestion. The most affected will be those who want to go east and those from areas sandwiched between the Avinashi Road and Trichy Road, rues S.P. Thiyagarajan, a civic activist. “Avinashi Road acted as an alternative for those who wanted to avoid Trichy Road because of the flyover work. Very soon, road users will have no alternative to drive east as the department will take up the Avinashi Road project as well.” For people from areas south of Avinashi Road and north of Trichy Road, the next four years is going to be difficult to move one way or the other as the carriageway in both the arterial roads is reduced, he adds. It was highlighting this fact that DMK MLA N. Karthik issued a statement a few days ago, asking why the department is showing urgency in taking up the Avinashi Road project even as the Trichy Road work is in progress. He says road users have fewer alternative roads to avoid either of the two roads and it is here that the Corporation’s failure in developing scheme roads is glaring. “The city has seen no scheme road development in the last 10 years, since the World Classical Tamil Conference that was held in 2010,” he points out. The corporation under the then Mayor S.M. Velusamy did make the right noises about developing scheme roads. He had said that the Corporation would develop one scheme road in a year for five years so that the road users would get five roads in five years. As of date the announcement is on paper, Mr. Karthik recalls. A similar project that is on paper is the road along the Sanganoor Canal, starting from Mettupalayam Road to Trichy Road, connecting Sathyamangalam Road and Avinashi Road, says consumer activist and District Road Safety Committee member K. Kathirmathiyon.  ‘Remove encroachments’ As the department proposes to complete the Avinashi Road project in four years, the Corporation can at least look at widening and removing encroachments on roads that may serve as alternatives, he suggests. Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian says when the issue came at the recent District Road Safety Committee meeting, the Corporation has assured full cooperation to ease traffic congestion. The civic body is looking at alternatives and working with the City Police and the Highways Department and very soon will start work on roads identified as alternatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-may-soon-witness-heavy-traffic-congestion/article33380859.ece
21 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Spurt in demand has impacted textile supply chain’||With the global and domestic market said to be buoyant for garments, the textile supply chain is grappling to meet demand. Raja M. Shanmugham, president of the Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, said that textile mills have stopped supplying cotton yarn and are not taking fresh orders from garment manufacturers. “The current decision of mills will certainly impact garment units, largely affect exports, and more workers will also incur job losses,” he said. “The strong domestic market is a permanent one, and when the business eco-system prevailing at present is disturbed, the future would be unpredictable,” he added. Mr. Shanmugham said, “Export orders are good for garments now, and garment producers buy yarn depending on the export orders. However, of late, the textile mills are stopping yarn supply by mid-month. Ours is a design-driven industry and the production process should go on uninterrupted. If there is disruption in yarn supply, it affects exports. There is an impression that the mills are focusing on yarn exports.” He urged the textile mill associations to ask their members to continue yarn supply to the garment units without disruption. Textile mills, however, say the current situation is a temporary one that has risen because of demand-supply mismatch. Chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association, Ashwin Chandran says the textile mills are operating at 80 % to 85 % capacity on an average. “It is not that mills are hoarding yarn. But, they do not want to commit beyond their level of comfort,” he says. Labour shortage is the biggest challenge faced by the mills to increase production, he says. There is a significant increase in the demand for garments and these units want more yarn. But mills are unable to meet that demand because of the constraints they face. Average monthly yarn exports are 80 million kg which is not as high as it was in 2018 or before, he says. Prabhu Dhamodharan, convenor of Indian Texpreneurs Federation, says textile mills are engaging with their customers on a one-to-one basis to ensure supplies. “This is the time where better collaborative efforts across the value chain will help capitalise post-COVID-19 opportunities,” he says. Companies, in the domestic and export segments, are building inventory to manage supply side disruptions. With demand bouncing to pre-COVID-19 levels and a focus on inventory, demand is high for yarn and fabrics, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spurt-in-demand-has-impacted-textile-supply-chain/article33380874.ece
21 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Raw material price hike hits construction sector||The spiralling prices of steel is affecting construction activities, especially ongoing projects, according to builders here. Builders Association of India Coimbatore chapter president Paneerselvam says that steel prices are up by Rs. 10,000 a tonne in the last three weeks. If construction of an independent house consumes eight tonnes steel, the customer will now face escalation of Rs. 80,000 in the building cost. Similarly, prices of all PVC items are up by 10% or more. Builders who are into government projects will be the worst affected as they had committed a price when the works commenced, he says. According to Rajesh B. Lund, former head of Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India, Coimbatore chapter, the prices of labour, steel, and cement have shot up. “We cannot afford such steep hike in raw material prices, especially for ongoing projects. Customers who have already booked units at these projects will not agree for 40% increase in prices,” he says. Both said that construction activities have revived after lockdown relaxations and are doing well now. However, the high input costs are affecting builders and property developers. Meanwhile, on the steep increase in prices of raw materials, including steel, for the engineering sector, Coimbatore MP P.R. Natarajan has demanded action from Central and State governments to control prices. “The Central government should explain the reasons for the hike in prices,” he said. About 400 small-scale foundries in Coimbatore are on indefinite strike, affecting thousands of workers. They had to take the decision only because continuing operations was unviable. The government should form a committee to study the reasons for price increase and come out with a clear export-import policy for raw materials, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/raw-material-price-hike-hits-construction-sector/article33380873.ece
21 December 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Nominations for vehicles must be compulsory’||The Coimbatore Consumer Cause (CCC) has welcomed the proposal made by the Central government which would allow vehicle owners to specify a nominee during vehicle registration and urged that these nominations must be made compulsory. In a recent statement, secretary of CCC K. Kathirmathiyon said that this has been the body’s long-pending demand as there are no provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act to nominate a person for a vehicle, so that the ownership of the vehicle could be transferred to the nominee in case of the vehicle owner’s death. Third parties “Hence, not only the legal heirs, but also the general public (third parties) face lots of difficulties in case of death of the owner,” he said. As part of the CCC’s suggestions, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said that the vehicle owner must be able to change the nominee any time as long as the vehicle is in his/her name. Existing owners “All the existing vehicle owners should be allowed to incorporate their nominee to their vehicles in a simple and hassle-free procedure,” he added. In case of the vehicle owner’s death due to accident, the nominee will be able to get compensation from the insurance companies without any difficulties if this proposal is implemented, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said in the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nominations-for-vehicles-must-be-compulsory/article33380857.ece
21 December 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Cotton association calls for fibre policy||The Indian Cotton Federation has appealed to the government to announce a National Fibre Policy soon. J. Thulasidharan, president of the Federation, said at its annual meeting held virtually on Sunday that this will be one of the demands that it will pursue with the government. Further, the Central government should establish a Cotton Board of India, similar to Coffee Board and Jute Board. It should also have a time-bound plan to implement the mini missions of the second phase of Technology Mission on Cotton (TMC). Mr. Thulasidharan also pointed out the need for free flow of finance to the cotton and textile sector. He said that all financial controls should be eased to encourage investment and the government should immediately address the challenges that entrepreneurs face to get finance. Financial institutions, including those in the co-operative sector, need to be revamped to meet the current day requirements. Cotton plays a significant role in social uplift, especially in rural areas. No other fibre can replace cotton as the prime fibre for the Indian textile industry. The country’s economy can be strong by encouraging the cotton sector. Hence, the government should come out with measures so that Indian cotton is contaminant free and is graded properly. It should standardise cotton packaging and make it cloth-friendly. There should be bar-coding for cotton as it is in the United States.  The Central government should establish a Cotton Board of India, similar to Coffee Board and Jute Board  J.

Sangam president Kongu K. Devaraj said the four major caste groups — Gounder, Chettiar, Mudaliar and Pillaimar and their 40 sub-divisions — opposed the move to confer the title on the Devendrakula caste. However, the Sangam was not against the plan to include the Devendrakula caste in the list of Most Backward Classes for reservation, he clarified. The AIADMK government was doing it at the behest of the BJP government at the Centre with the 2021 Assembly election in mind. And, the Devendrakula caste people, led by Puthiya Tamilagam leader K. Krishnasamy, favoured the move so as to gain more seats to contest. Sunday’s protest, Mr. Devaraj said, was aimed at drawing the governments’ attention. If it did not evoke the right response, Sangam representatives would meet Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to submit their objection. The Sangam had sent its objection to the Hans Raj Verma Commission, constituted by the State government, but it was not heard, he said.  If the protest does not evoke the right response, Sangam representatives will meet the Chief Minister Kongu K.

Natarajan, has urged the State government to disburse without any further delay Rs. 30.87 crore due to owners who had given land for the establishment of the Bharathiar University. In a letter recently to the Chief Secretary, Mr. Natarajan said it was unfortunate that the government delayed the compensation due to the farmers by failing to implement court verdict and filing appeal. Though a Coimbatore court had ordered payment of compensation to the land owners and the Madras High Court had confirmed it in its interim order, the government, three years after the interim order, had chosen to file an appeal. Mr. Natarjan said that during the pendency of the case a few land owners had died and their families were in dire straits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensate-owners-who-have-given-land-for-bu/article33380853.ece

In a letter to the Commissioner, the committee’s chief coordinator C.M. Jayaraman said the nothing other than corruption seemed to be motive behind the Corporation taking up the project worth over Rs. 40 crore as the existing infrastructure was very good and there was no need to improve it. The committee and residents of the area were at a loss to understand the rationale behind the civic body taking up the project, relegating all other pressing infrastructure needs to the background. After demolishing well-laid parapet wall near the walkers’ track, the Corporation was using substandard materials to beautify the place. The Corporation had also uprooted a number of trees, thereby permanently damaging the Race Course ecosystem, he said. Mr. Jayaraman said the committee was also opposed to the Corporation’s move to increase commercial activity in the area, which he said would only inconvenience the residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forum-alleges-corruption-in-road-project/article33380860.ece
21 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Treated water to recharge groundwater: Velumani||Treated water from a treatment plant in Ondipudur would be used to recharge groundwater and help farmers irrigate lands, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani said here on Sunday while participating in the ground-breaking ceremony organised to launch the scheme. A release from the district administration quoting the Minister said the State Government, based on representation from farmers in Chettipalayam, Pattanam and Peedampalli, had sanctioned Rs. 4.76 crore to pump the treated water from the plant to fill ‘kadukuttai’. The 60 million litres to be treated at the Ondipudur plant would flow into a 2.60 lakh litre sump. A motor near the sump would pump 3.06 cusecs water in such a way that in 16 hours it pumped 50 lakh litres. At this rate, the release said, it would take 15 days to fill the 2.60 mcft (million cubic feet) kadukuttai tank. As the water flowed through 4,590 metre-long pipeline, it would recharge 14 tanks in Chettipalayam, nine in Peedampalli and four in Pattanam. In short, the scheme would help recharge groundwater and thereby farmers can irrigate 10,000 hectares. In the process, the scheme would also help increase water level in wells and borewells. And, the number of beneficiaries would be around 30,000 farmers. The scheme was in keeping with the State Government's commitment to help farmers, the release said and quoted the Minister referring to the ‘kudi maramathu’ and River Noyyal Rejuvenation schemes to underscore the point.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/treated-water-to-be-used-to-recharge-groundwater/article33380862.ece

21 December 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||‘Close polluting industries on Sipcot premises’||Members of Perundurai SIPCOT Affected People Welfare Association urged the district administration to close industries that functioned on Sipcot premises and polluted air, water and land. In a petition submitted to Perundurai Tahsildar G. Muthukrishnan, the members said over 200 industries functioned on the 2,700-acre premises for the past 25 years in which over 20,000 workers were employed. Farmers in Ingur Panchayat and Perundurai Town Panchayat had provided their farm lands for Sipcot and they were given compensation ranging from Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 2 lakh an acre. Many industries, particularly tannery and textile processing, failed to ensure zero liquid discharge (ZLD) and polluted the groundwater in the region. The petition said that water had a maximum level of 11,250 total dissolved solids (TDS) and the colour of the water had also changed. “Criminal action should be taken against industries that violate the norms and those industries should be closed,” the petition said. Demands Their other demands were conduct of monthly meeting by officials with the association members regularly as agreed during the meeting on June 16, 2018, immediate settlement of compensation to farmers who had given their land for Sipcot, monitoring industries to ensure ZLD, obtain the report from National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, that tested water samples from Sipcot and initiating action against polluting industries, including 25 water bodies in the region under the Athikadavu-Avinashi Groundwater Recharge Project for refilling, removing all the industrial waste from the premises, conducting medical camps once in six months in villages around the premises and providing protected drinking water to the villagers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/close-polluting-industries-on-sipcot-premises/article33380958.ece

According to the fishermen association leaders, the Centre should respect the farmers and not be adamant in its attitude. After all, the laws are for the people. If the people protested and demanded withdrawal, the governments had the obligation to do so. Even after the demise of farmers, the government’s attitude to remain silent and not repeal the laws only showed that they were ‘anti-people’ and ‘pro-corporate houses.’ In Ramanathapuram, the CPI, CPI (M), Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers' Association, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, and All India Farmers' Association among others staged a demonstration in front of Aranmanai.

Laying of approach road and pathway encircling the temple, construction of stormwater drain, lighting and renovation of Theppakulam constitute components of the project. The temple, located at Kathaparai panchayat on the outskirts of the town, receives devotees not only from Karur but also Sivaganga, Dindigul, Madurai and other districts. The number of devotees has gone up in recent years. The facelift programme is aimed at enhancing facilities for devotees, officials said. The departments of Rural Development, Tourism and Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment have jointly funded the development works. As per the project, a sum of Rs. 1.2 crore will be spent for laying of approach road and the circular path around the temple for about 1.5 km. A storm water drain will come up at a cost of Rs. 30 lakh. It will be implemented under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme. There is also a provision to provide lighting facilities around the temple. A high mast light will also be installed. To add green cover around the temple, arrangements are on to plant 150 saplings. Karur-based MRV Trust promoted by Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabaskar will plant them besides taking care of maintenance. Paver blocks will be laid to an extent of about 5,000 sq ft on the temple premises. In addition, a multi-purposemandapamwill be built for devotees, a senior official told The Hindu .

In his petition, advocate S. Muthukumar said he was involved in various social activities that included cremation of unclaimed dead bodies. The Police Department was often finding it difficult to establish the identity of the deceased. The legal heirs too could not claim the dead bodies and faced hurdles in claiming insurance, he said. He pointed out that Aadhaar unique identification number was generated by submitting demographic and biometric information. It would be easy to identify the deceased persons using Aadhaar information, if the details were shared to the Police Department by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). The Centre, State and the UIDAI should get together in this regard. Sharing information to the Police Department to ascertain the identity of the deceased would help uphold the dignity of the deceased. No prejudice would be caused to the secrecy of the information by sharing it with the Police Department, the petitioner said. He sought a direction to the State to take steps to get Aadhaar information from the Centre by using fingerprints taken from dead bodies. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi sought a response from the Centre and the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/use-fingerprints-aadhaar-details-to-establish-identity-of-the-dead/article33380943.ece
21 December 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Dams in southern districts brim, thanks to copious rain||Major dams in southern Tamil Nadu have reached their maximum storage level, thanks to a good northeast monsoon and the rainfall brought in by Cyclone Burevi, PWD officials said on Sunday. The officials told The Hindu that the copious rain along the western ghats benefited Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Theni districts. While the Tamirabharani in Tirunelveli district had been in spate since Saturday, water in the Vaigai reached the tail end in Ramanathapuram district, meandering through Theni, Dindigul, Madurai and Sivaganga. Interestingly, many of the dams, both big and small, have received a copious inflow after five to seven years. The Kamarajar dam at Athoor in Dindigul reached its full capacity a few days ago. Schemes helped Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam members in Sivaganga district thanked the government for the ‘kudimaramathu’ project to desilt tanks and ‘ooranis’ since 2016-17. The generally bone-dry Ramanathapuram district has also benefited from the project. The rain has resulted in the Big Tank getting a good flow. K. Veera Raghava Rao, who was until recently Ramanathapuram Collector, said a lot of effort was made to revive waterbodies in the last two years. Out of the 640 PWD tanks, 150 were desilted in 2018-20; of the 1,112 minor irrigation tanks, a little over 200 were desilted; and 998 of the 3,500 ‘ooranis’ were cleaned. The creation of one lakh farm ponds won the Skoch Award for the district. The district had reeled under drought during 2016, 2017 and 2018, but it saved rainwater in the subsequent two years, thanks to the government schemes, he said. The efforts of the then Collectors, Shilpa Prabhakar Satish in Tirunelveli and Sandeep Nanduri in Thoothukudi, helped to speed up the desilting of tanks and waterbodies in these districts. One of the biggest dams — Papanasam — had 142.40 feet of water as on date against the maximum of 143 feet. Farmers in Tirunelveli, Thootukudi, Kanniyakumari and Tenkasi say the sustained efforts of officials helped in water sufficiency. Besides water conservation, value additions like fish culture were made possible by farm ponds, they said. In Tenkasi, except the Adavinainar dam, all others, including the Karuppanadhi dam, had full storage. Thoothukudi, which received below-normal rainfall until the first week of November, almost reached its average with the very heavy rain in the latter part of the month. In Theni and Dindigul, enough rain in the catchments ensured a good yield and increased the area under cultivation, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reservoirs-in-south-districts-brim-thanks-to-copious-rain/article33380840.ece

21 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai Bench calls for stricter punishments to tackle graft||Awarding the death penalty on charges of corruption and invoking the Goondas Act to detain those polluting waterbodies and engaging in food adulteration were suggestions made by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, to the government, to look into an order to tackle the menace of corruption. Though it appears to be an extreme step, it has to be considered, the court observed. Taking serious view of the issues plaguing society, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi called for a response from the Centre and the State governments as to why the relevant Acts cannot be re-visited and amended to bring in stricter punishments for those involved in these offences. People are compelled to accept corruption as routine. It has become deep rooted and is spreading like cancer, the judges observed, while suggesting that the Centre revisit the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Act should be strengthened and stringent penalties imposed to curb the menace of corruption, the court said. The court, which initiated suo motu proceedings, taking cognisance of news reports on the pollution of waterbodies, has asked whether the Goondas Act can be invoked against the offenders. When the State government, to safeguard the interest of the cinema industry, included video piracy under the Goondas Act, why not include polluters as well, the court asked. Similarly, the court wanted to know why those indulging in food adulteration should not be included under the Act. They should be termed ‘goondas’, as per the definition in Section 2 of the Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982, by amending the provisions to include them and to detain them under the Act, the judges said. The State government has to take steps, at the earliest, to amend the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Sand Offenders, Slum Grabbers and Video Pirates Act, 1982, referred to as the Goondas Act, the judges said.

21 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Revised target of 22,200 set for PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme||Around 8,600 loan applications for street vendors under PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme have been submitted till date by Madurai Corporation. After crossing the initial target of 6,000 applications, a revised target of 22,200 applications has been fixed for the civic body. The PM-SVANidhi scheme was announced as part of the government's economic relief package in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the scheme, a capital loan of Rs. 10,000 is given to street vendors to be paid back in one year. The urban local body is the authority to approve the loan beneficiaries. Madurai Corporation is among the urban local bodies in the state that has submitted the highest number of applications under the PM-SVANidhi scheme, say officials. City Health Officer P. Kumaraguruparan said the Corporation, along with the Street Vending Committee, has been submitting loan applications for the past four months. “After we crossed the initial target of 6,000 applications, a revised target of around 22,200 applications has been fixed,” he said. S. Santhiyagu, general secretary of the CITU- affiliated street vendors’ association, said a survey conducted by the Corporation a couple of years back identified 12,000 street vendors in the city. Identity cards were issued to around 5,400 of them. Recently, ID cards were issued to 2,800 more vendors. Around 3,400 street vendors, who were registered in 2016, were yet to receive their identity cards, he said. Apart from the registered street vendors, the civic body authorises loan applications for street vendors who were not registered earlier. When unregistered street vendors apply for loan, the civic body conducts field-level inspection and then approves their loan applications. “So far, we have given letters of recommendation to around 4,600 unregistered street vendors for the PM-SVANidhi loan application,” said Dr. Kumaraguruparan. Out of the total loan applications submitted under PM-SVANidhi scheme, loans have been credited to the accounts of around 2,500 street vendors till date, said Mr. Santhiyagu. “Although the civic body submits applications under the scheme, banks often reject our applications. The street vendors have to endure severe hardship in availing the loan,” he added. However, there is poor cooperation from the street vendors in availing loan under the PM- SVANidhi scheme, said Lead District Manager K. Arivalagan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revised-target-of-22200-set-for-pm-street-vendors-atmanirbhar-nidhi-scheme/article33380946.ece
21 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||No more hotel quarantine for health workers||The quarantine facility at hotels, provided to all health workers of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) while on COVID-19 duty for the past nine months, was discontinued from Sunday. This decision has evoked criticism from a section of health workers. Since April, all health workers of GRH - including doctors, nurses and sanitary workers - were accommodated at various hotels across the city during their quarantine leave. However, the decision to discontinue the facility was taken due to shortage of funds with the Department of Health and Family Welfare, say senior health department officials. “Madurai was the first district in the State where hotel quarantine facilities for health workers was introduced. But the quarantine facilities for health workers were cancelled in other districts from last month. Since the number of positive cases are low, it was decided to discontinue the hotel quarantine facility in Madurai too,” said an official. Members of Tamil Nadu Medical Department All Employees, Sanitary Workers and Nursing Assistants Association petitioned the Collector on Saturday urging that hotel quarantine facility be continued. Association president M. Venkatachalam said most health workers in the lower cadre were worried about the safety of their family members as they have to go home after completing their COVID-19 duty. “All these months we have been told that it was important to stay isolated after completing the COVID-19 duty. So, this decision to discontinue hotel quarantine facility has made the health workers anxious,” he said. Dean J. Sangumani said all COVID-19 protocols were followed for health workers after they complete their COVID-19 duty. The number of COVID-19 positive patients being treated at the hospital has also come down, he added.

21 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Strict home isolation monitoring strategy to be devised for Puducherry||A review of the recent progression of COVID-19 in the Union Territory has pegged the cause for the bulk of the new infections to a combination of factors — a flawed home isolation system and the lax screening of travellers from the neighbouring States. Feedback from officials of various departments, who participated in a virtual review meet called by Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi at the Raj Nivas, said the lack of monitoring of those with a travel history to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala; the high attendance at family functions; visits to crowded places, and the non-adherence to home isolation guidelines were some of the key causes. On the home isolation front, it was observed that symptomatic patients were triaged at the IGMCRI, and advised home isolation, instead of admission. Medical officers said many under home isolation meant further transmission among family contacts. It was also revealed that those under home isolation were not following guidelines, and were moving around, freely, making it difficult to keep a watch. Ms. Bedi said a strict home isolation monitoring strategy would be devised, in consultation with the police. With workplaces, including healthcare institutions, also linked to new infections, the Lt. Governor instructed COVID-19 hospitals/care centres to strictly adhere to the SOPs, to stop the further spread of the infection. Besides, as a result of non-adherence to testing norms, several primary contacts were not being tested when referred to the IGMCRI, since many of them were asymptomatic. The lax enforcement of COVID-19-appropriate behaviour in crowded places was also among the contributing factors. All areas suggested by medical officers should be strictly watched, and COVID-19 norms must be strictly enforced in public places by the police, Ms. Bedi said. Officials have flagged areas such as Kumaran Nagar and Pethuchettypet, which have been reporting more cases, indicating a higher transmission of the virus. An analysis of the situation in Puducherry on Saturday showed that of the 180 active cases, eight PHCs had reported over ten cases each. These were Lawspet, Reddiarpalayam, Muthialpet, Mudaliarpet, Kirumampakkam, Mettupalayam and Kosapalayam. According to officials, some of the other PHCs that have been seeing more cases included Villianur, Kalapet, Odiansalai, Thavalakuppam, Thirubhuvanai and Murungapakkam. A mobile enforcement team has been asked to monitor sensitive spots. Given the non-adherence to COVID-19 norms while travelling, attending functions or visiting crowded places, it was decided that people would be sensitised through reoriented IEC/awareness activities. The police would set up check-points.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/strict-home-isolation-monitoring-strategy-to-be-devised-for-puducherry/article33381240.ece

21 December 2020||Rajapalayam,TAMIL NADU||AIDWA members stage stir against hike in cylinder price||Members of All India Democratic Women’s Association staged a protest here against the sudden hike in cooking gas cylinder price, on Sunday. The protest was led by its Rajapalayam town secretary Mary. As part of their protest, the women garlanded LPG cylinders and put up a firewood stove to highlight that the women were forced to switch over to cooking with firewood due to lack of affordability to LPG cylinders. Addressing the protesters, its State general secretary, P. Suganthi, said that the increase of Rs. 100 in price of gas cylinders in the last 15 days had not only hit the women who manage the family expenses, but also the hotel industry badly. Women had opposed a few years back when the Centre brought in direct benefit transfer system of depositing the subsidy amount to the savings bank account of heads of the families. “Because, the subsidy amount only goes back to TASMAC shops as the men do not give it to the women. Besides, over the years, the subsidy has been drastically reduced. It used to be Rs. 120 per domestic cylinder few years back. But, it has now come up to Rs. 46,” she said. It is now clear that the Modi Government has only cheated the people with its direct benefit transfer that was launched in 2013, she said. The free cooking gas scheme is also a failure as many women have not bought refills due to higher cost. The Rs. 100 hike in cylinder price has badly hit the household budget. It also affects the common man in more than one ways as hotels that face additional burden on cooking gas cylinder would increase the price of the food items, she said. She also criticised the Centre for blaming increase in international price of crude oil for increasing the price of petrol, diesel and cooking gas. “Did the Centre bring down the price of fuel when international price of crude oil went down to rock bottom during the lockdown? This Government is only putting burden on the common people to fill up the coffers of the corporates,” she alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aidwa-members-stage-stir-against-hike-in-cylinder-price/article33380951.ece
21 December 2020||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Mutharasan criticises CM’s Pongal gift announcement||The announcement of “Pongal gift” made by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is like offering bribe to the public and demanding votes in exchange, R. Mutharasan, State secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) said on Sunday. “It is like a bribe using taxpayers’ money for votes. The CM’s plan to gain political gains misusing public funds will never succeed,” he told reporters here. “Amma mini clinic was a good scheme but no new doctors, nurses or workers have been hired for the clinics. It is just a publicity stunt ahead of the elections. The Chief Minister cannot deceive people,” he said. On the farmers’ protests in Delhi, Mr. Mutharasan said the protests would continue till the laws were repealed. He criticised the Chief Minister for supporting the laws. Mr. Palaniswami was also compelled to support the BJP, he added. To a question on whether the State government had given up on its fight against NEET after announcing 7.5% reservation for government school students, the CPI leader said, “All parties support and appreciate the State government for the horizontal quota. It is true that over 300 students had benefitted, but thousands of students are being affected due to NEET. Though Tamil Nadu has the most number of medical colleges, students from the State are unable to study here. This is just a diversion technique.” Mr. Mutharasan said the BJP was trying to split votes in the State and that it would not succeed. Along with District Secretary A. Mohan and other party leaders, he paid floral tributes to farmers who died during the protest in Delhi. He also condoled the death of senior party leader S.R. Perumal on December 19.

21 December 2020||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||‘Agri contractors cannot pass on loss to farmers’||Individuals or entities entering into procurement contracts cannot pass on losses to cultivators under the new farm laws, V.K.Singh, Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, said on Sunday. At a press briefing here on Sunday, he said there was no cause for fear about not getting the assured price in the event of the contractor incurring loss in business with the third party. “The pact between the farmer and the contractor under the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 will specifically govern the business transaction between the farmers and the contractors. “Under the agreement, the contractor, who will be procuring the agriculture produce for a third party by entering into an agreement with the farmers, will have to absorb the loss if the third party backed out,” he explained. “Also, any dispute arising between the farmer and the contractor could be settled at the district-level itself. There will be no need to approach courts or spend money on litigation.” The farmers, who have been staging protests in New Delhi against the laws have expressed preference to settle such issues through courts. Claiming that agriculture lands would remain under ownership of the farmers under the contract system, Mr. Singh said there were also provisions in the Act for additional benefits to farmers in case the contractor reaped extra benefits due to escalation in cost of produce in the market towards the end of the contract period. “Moreover, the farmers have been freed from the clutches of commission agents who have been fixing the price for the agriculture produce.” The provisions in the F(EP)APAFS Act and in the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Protection and Facilitation) Act, 2020, enabled farmers to fix the price for their produce and also choose the marketto get a better price for their produce, the Minister pointed out. The ongoing agitation at the border of National Capital Territory of New Delhi was politically motivated. Farmers must not be misled by distorted versions of the farm laws being spread by the opposition parties. The onus was on the farmers to understand the benefits inherent in the new laws in the interests of their livelihood, Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/agri-contractors-cannot-pass-on-loss-to-farmers/article33380933.ece
21 December 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Murugan clarifies on chief ministerial candidate issue||Reiterating his statement that his party’s national leadership will make a formal announcement on Chief Minister candidate in Tamil Nadu, BJP State president L.Murugan said on Sunday that he had only meant that the AIADMK’s choice of candidate will be endorsed. Mr. Murugan denied what he viewed as speculations that the BJP had not accepted the AIADMK’s decision to project Edappadi K.Palaniswami as CM candidate. “We have never said that we did not accept the AIADMK’s decision,” he said. There was no difference of opinion between the two parties, Mr. Murugan said, referring to AIADMK’s recognition of NDA’s strength in Tamil Nadu in the presence of the former BJP national president and the Union Home Minister, Amit Shah recently. In fact, the difference of opinion in the United Progressive Alliance on many issues would cause a break-up in their alliance, he said. The DMK and corruption are “inseparable” and it had failed in its efforts to project the BJP government at the Centre as anti-farmer, he said. Moreover, the DMK, in its election manifesto in 2016 Assembly elections, had promised measures to enable farmers sell their produce nationally and internationally without any middlemen, at the market-determined prices, he added. Mr. Murugan welcomed the Chief Minister’s announcement of Rs. 2,500 as Pongal gift for family card holders.  ‘No confusion’ Meanwhile, BJP’s State vice-president K. Annamalai said Mr. Murugan’s remarks on the choice of Chief Ministerial candidate has not caused any confusion in the alliance. Speaking to reporters in Coimbatore on Sunday, after a meeting organised by the Scheduled Tribe wing of the BJP Coimbatore urban district unit, he said the AIADMK continued to be part of the NDA. The BJP parliamentary board, the party’s decision-making body, is yet to make any official announcement on the State assembly elections. BJP national president J.P. Nadda is scheduled to visit Tamil Nadu on December 30 and 31 for a review meeting and his arrival will clear many doubts, he said. In November, when Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the AIADMK-BJP alliance would continue, Mr. Shah did not speak about the alliance because he was no longer the the BJP national president, Mr. Annamalai said. Resolutions The resolutions passed at the meeting urged the State government to ensure hassle-free issuing of community certificates to the STs. It also sought 5% reservation for them in government jobs besides allocating five Assembly constituencies in areas with large population of tribal people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/murugan-clarifies-on-cm-candidate-issue/article33380848.ece

21 December 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK has silenced its detractors through achievements: Kadambur Raju||The announcement to give Pongal gift hamper of Rs. 2,500 was just a beginning, said Information and Publicity Minister Kadambur S Raju here on Sunday. Speaking at a party workers’ meeting, he said that when many critics claimed that after the demise of Amma (Jayalalithaa), the party would vanish, the efforts taken by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had only silenced the critics over the last four years. “Next year, when the State faced the general election, the AIADMK would win hands down...The people have decided. There was no doubt in it,” he claimed. Normally, as a gift to the people, the AIADMK government gave away Rs. 1,000, but the State was well placed that the government had enhanced it to Rs. 2,500. Such populist schemes would be raining soon, Mr. Raju said and added that it would be better for the DMK to stay away. In his address, party coordinator and former Minister Natham R Viswanathan said that after Amma's demise, the party had moved forward in her footsteps. Today, Amma was not with us, but the soul guided the State. He lauded the schemes of the government and urged the cadres to take them to the masses. Already the CM had commenced the campaign from his hometown Edappadi and hence the election mode had begun, Mr. Viswanathan said and wished to teach a lesson to the political detractors that the AIADMK would live long as long Tamils lived in the globe. Mr. Raju said the Chief Minister would arrive here on December 22 from Chennai and drive to Kanniaykumari district to participate in a Christmas function. He appealed to the cadre to accord a rousing reception to the CM at the airport on the day. The CM would return on the same day to Chennai, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-has-silenced-its-detractors-through-achievements-kadambur-raju/article33380952.ece

21 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘UGD work in monsoon not smart’||Residents of Ramalinga Nagar in Woraiyur lament that they have been subjected to enormous inconvenience due to the ongoing Underground Drainage System (UGD) work, citing damages caused to pipelines and contamination of drinking water. Early December, the civic body began work on Ramalinga Nagar First Main Road. The workers dug up large pits along the road for drainage chambers. Since December 16, there is no space even for a two-wheeler to pass, especially on the far end of the road, residents point out. “We have been forced to take a longer route, through Amman Nagar, where the roads are even worse,” a resident said. What is more, it has no street lights and is ridden with potholes and trenches. The residents wonder why the civic body undertakes such works during the peak of monsoon. “What did they do during the summer months? I have friends in areas where the UGD work has been left incomplete for over a year,” said P. Muthu, a resident. The workers say the work will be completed during the coming summer and this has caused further anxiety among locals. “They say they will give connection in the summer as rain has filled the pits. Did they not know this before they dug up our roads?” Mr. Muthu asked. Adding to their woes, the workers have damaged the corporation water pipeline, causing contamination. Black-coloured water flowed from the taps on Saturday morning, they claim. “For the next month or so, we will have to buy drinking water despite having a water purifier. How can these kind of inconveniences caused to the public help in making Tiruchi a smart city?” another resident asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ugd-work-in-monsoon-not-smart/article33380926.ece
21 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Civic body sneaked in workers at night, say residents||Residents of Fathima Nagar near Vekkaliamman Kovil in Woraiyur staged a protest on Sunday against construction of a microcompost yard in their locality. The residents claimed that the land where the microcompost yard was coming up was originally alloted for a recreation park. They held a demonstration at the site of construction where workers of the civic body had dug up the ground overnight. “They thought that we would not know if they did it at night. We have been demanding basic facilities for over two years, and the civic body has paid no heed. Why must such a yard be made here when there are no roads, lights and any basic facilities?” they asked. The residents said they submitted several petitions to the district administration and local ministers seeking relaying of roads after underground drainage connections were given, police beat, streets lights and other needs, but in vain. The stealthy ways of the civic body irked the residents. “Should they not approach the residents' welfare association? We have written many petitions demanding a park in the very spot they plan to construct the compost yard,” another resident said. The protesters relented and withdrew their protest after police intervened and civic officials promised to consider their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-body-sneaked-in-workers-at-night-say-residents/article33380928.ece
21 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Post-Gaja, change in behaviour of migratory birds’||There has been a change in pattern of arrival of migratory birds to sanctuaries, wetlands and waterbodies in delta districts after Gaja cyclone, according to a study. The three-month duration from November is a standard period for avian visitors to the bird sanctuaries in the State. The migratory birds belonging to distant continents come in large numbers, stay for three to four months and fly back. The bird sanctuaries at Point Calimere in Nagapattinam district and Karaivetti in Ariyalur district and Vaduvoor lake on the border of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts are among the most sought destinations for the winged visitors. At times, the birds arrive in early November and fly back in February after extended stay by three to four weeks. There are years in which birds return a bit early, says A. Kumaraguru, Conservation Scientist, Biodiversity Foundation, Tiruchi. November to January is not just a period of rainy and winter season. It is the peak of paddy cultivation period. The abundant availability of food particles, small organisms, insects, fresh water and warm temperature attract the migratory, terrestrial and aquatic birds, Mr. Kumaraguru points out. His study indicates some deviations in the pattern of arrival of migratory birds, particularly after Gaja cyclone that caused extensive damage to the flora and fauna at the Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary at Point Calimere. Scientists, who are on a project to compile a detailed data on bird census, have spotted the migratory birds visiting various wetlands in non-seasonal months including May, June and July in 2019 and 2020. They returned after a brief stay of three to four weeks. “We mainly spot migratory birds from November to January and February. But, we often come across birds in farmlands and water bodies across delta districts in non-seasonal months. It is a new phenomenon after Gaja cyclone. We need to study whether it is a temporary or not,” Mr. Kumaraguru said. Open billed stork, great egret, black headed ibis are among the birds spotted in significant numbers across paddy fields, water bodies and wetlands in the delta region in non seasonal time. ‘Not just cyclone’ S. Ramasubramanian, Chief Conservator of Forest-In-Charge, Tiruchi, toldThe Hinduthat the pattern in change of arrival of migratory birds could not just be the impact of the Gaja cyclone. Climate change and disturbances in their habitats could also be the reasons. An in-depth study was required, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/post-gaja-change-in-pattern-of-arrival-of-migratory-birds-study/article33380924.ece

Radhakrishnan said on Sunday that the cash gifts were being given by the State government every year for the Pongal festival.

Eswaran asserted on Sunday that the Pongal cash gift will not help the AIADMK in the Assembly elections. Speaking to the mediapersons in Palladam, he alleged that the State government was unable to provide cash assistance during the COVID-19 lockdown but has now announced it for Pongal. The AIADMK’s alleged support of the three farm laws will also affect its prospects in the election, he claimed.

21 December 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Accent on human-animal coexistence in Gudalur||Local conservationists as well as Forest Department officials think that a long-term solution to the problematic human - animal interactions in Gudalur and Pandalur should involve efforts to facilitate co-existence between the two. Residents living in the Cherambadi TANTEA estate in Kolapalli, where two of the people who died after attacked by a wild elephant, have requested the Forest Department’s help to relocate them from their current dwellings and move them to safer locations. The demands were made to the officials during a recent visit to their houses. Kannagi, a resident, said the surrounding regions of the Glenrock Estate, Kottamalai, Samiyarmalai and Kappikadu, are used regularly by wild elephants. “There are around 15 families in two housing lines in the estate, and due to the presence of elephants, we wish to be moved to safer locations,” she said. Srinivas R. Reddy, Managing Director of TANTEA, said they were open to helping families working in government tea estates to relocate to safer locations. The TANTEA was working with the Forest Department to help mitigate conflict by handing over portions of the estates which were under their control for increasing habitat availability for elephants. Mr. Reddy said that the TANTEA had already handed over 256 hectares of plantation land back to the Forest department in Cherambadi, Cherangode, Devala and Pandiar to help with conflict mitigation. Conservationists said that the human - elephant interactions could be reduced by moving people away from pathways used by elephants and ensuring effective elephant-monitoring. “A micro scale zoning exercise is vital. In areas where overlap of people and elephants is inevitable - in coexistence zones - the welfare of both people and elephants need to considered. As land tenure in this region is highly volatile and unstable, any such efforts at zoning are extremely challenging. No long term solutions are possible without first sorting this out," said a local conservationist and elephant researcher. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, I. Anwardeen, said that Gudalur was a traditional “wildlife-bearing area” comparable to the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. “People living in this region need to be sensitised on the need to share the space with wildlife,” he said. “Gudalur is a diffuse-boundary landscape, and elephants have to cross landscapes populated by humans, and some of these habitats, need to be restored and made wildlife-compatible. Even if this is achieved, there needs to be a certain amount of coexistence between people and animals and this is the kind of relationship that we are trying to facilitate for the future,” he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accent-on-human-animal-coexistence-in-gudalur/article33380856.ece

He told journalists in Hubballi on Sunday that he would appeal to the Muslim community to stop eating beef. “I support the ban on cow slaughter. I will also request Muslim community members not to consume beef. But I have other problems with the Act. It does not have provisions to care for cows that are old or have stopped producing milk. Farmers are forced to sell such cows as they get at least half of their original price. That would help them buy new cows. But this law does not envision that,” he said. “I would request the State government to open cow shelters in each gram panchayat to take care of old, sick and unproductive cattle,” he said. He urged the government to set up a machinery to buy old cattle from farmers at reasonable prices. He said he was visiting old friends and making new friends in various districts. However, there is speculation that he plans to quit the Congress to join the JD(S). He evaded questions on his quitting the Congress and said that he would work for the two parties - Congress and JD(S) - to come together in a stronger alliance, like in the olden days. “There is no point talking about the divorce of two parties. We are exploring possibilities of a remarriage,” he said. He said he was opposed to forced conversions in case of marriages, but would not support a law against the so called ‘Love Jihad’. “We should respect the rights of consenting adults. The government should not interfere with such issues. It should focus on development instead,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ready-to-support-anti-cow-slaughter-law-says-ibrahim/article33380776.ece

21 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Resorts, homestays see business pick up as 2020 draws to a close||The State government may have banned parties and revelry in public spaces for the New Year in the light of the pandemic, but that does not seem to have dampened the spirits. For the first time since the pandemic forced us into a lockdown in March earlier this year, many have booked a holiday for the Christmas–New Year season. Sanjar Imam, president of the Karnataka Tourism Forum, said though the business was still nearly 80% lower when compared with the same time last year, the industry started seeing the first signs of “green shoots” this year since October and the upcoming holiday season looked “promising”. Fully booked “Most of the resorts and homestays within a radius of 300-350 km from the city, are booked to full capacity from December 25 to January 10. However, people are making shorter trips by road, in their own cars or hiring taxis, as they are still wary of taking any public transport, including air travel,” said M. Ravi, joint secretary , Karnataka Tourism Society. Darshan K., a software engineer has planned a family holiday in Puducherry for the last week of the year. “We wanted to end the year on a positive note and hope 2021 is nothing like the current year. We have booked a room in a large resort and plan to drive down,” he said. Shobha T., who is hoping to make a trip home to Mumbai for Christmas, was surprised to find that all pet care facilities are already filled up. “I need to board my cat at a facility, and I called the few I knew and trusted in the second week of December. All of them were fully booked and many said it came as a pleasant surprise as they were expecting people to remain at home,” she said. Kumar Pushkar, managing director, Jungle Lodges and Resorts Ltd., said they were seeing a 99% occupancy rate during December 21-31. In fact, we are doing better business when compared with last year, he said. “People seem to prefer going to locations that are not crowded where they can maintain social distancing,” he explained. The most popular destinations seem to be Kannur, Wayanad, Puducherry, Goa, Kabini, and Kodagu. A few, who have ventured to take up air travel, are travelling to the Maldives and Dubai. “In Maldives, each resort is almost like a different destination and offers seclusion and is safe, and hence has now become popular,” Mr. Imam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/resorts-homestays-see-business-pick-up-as-2020-draws-to-a-close/article33380781.ece
21 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Action sought against schools stopping classes over non-payment of fees||Parents of children studying in private schools took to the streets on Sunday to protest the decision of some school managements to stop online classesover non-payment of fees. The same day, the Recognised Unaided Private Schools Association (RUPSA), Karnataka, announced that it would stop online classes in all schools affiliated to it over delays in payment of fees. At the protest organised by Voice of Parents, families demanded that the government take legal action against private schools that restricted online classes for children and demanded a 75% reduction in tuition fee. Their other demands included the government not issuing any order to collect second-term fees, and legal action against schools allegedly collecting money from students admitted under the RTE Act. In a statement on the protests, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar had created differences among parents and school managements to cover up their failures. “Private schools have been blackmailing parents who have been forced to pay fees and online classes have also been stopped. The government has no control and the Education Minister is blind to this development. Private schools, which are collecting tuition fee, laboratory fee, library fee, and non-academic charges, are not scared of the government,” he said, and added that the government should convene a meeting of private school managements and parents to clear the confusion.” Meanwhile, RUPSA’s State president Lokesh Talikatte claimed that the association represented over 12,000 ‘budget schools’ across the State. He said the decision to not conduct online classes was taken in protest against the government favouring “corporate schools”.“We have not collected more than 30% fees for the current academic year and the government has now said we should not collect admission fees for the next academic year. We have, for months, been demanding the government to fix school fees,” he said. However, the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, which has over 3,800 schools affiliated to it, said online classes would continue  We have not collected more than 30% fees for the current academic year and the government has now said we should not collect admission fees for the next academic year.

Local councillor Vijay Kodavoor and the swamiji’s confidant Vasudeva Bhat Perampalli had informed the residents about the visit of the seer a couple of days ago. Accordingly, the residents decorated the colony to welcome the seer, a commiunique from Pejawar Mutt here said. The residents welcomed the seer with mass bhajan, after which Sri Vishwa Prasanna Tirtha visited the houses of three residents in the locality. Lighting the “Ram Lamp”, the swamiji interacted with the inmates there and gave them the Rama Deeksha with “Sri Rama Jaya Rama, Jaya Jaya Rama” mantra. Inmates of the three houses felicitated the swamiji with flowers and fruits. From there, the swamiji visited the Sri Mookambika Bhajan Mandir in the locality and offered puja to Mookambika. Addressing the residents, Sri Vishwa Prasanna Tirtha said that he was touring many parts of the country soliciting support of all for the construction of Ram Mandir.

21 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Work on two waste treatment plants to commence soon||Five years after it was first proposed and approved in principal by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), all paths have been cleared for establishing two new solid waste treatment and recycling plants to handle the city waste. The two plants will come up at Kesare and Rayanakere and will augment the city’s waste handling capacity for at least a decade. The plant at Kesare will have a capacity to treat and recycle 200 tonnes of waste per day while the one at Rayanakere will treat 150 tonnes per day. MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde told The Hindu that the tenders and financial bids have been cleared and the work order will be issued this month. “We expect the contractors to begin the work in the first or second week of January and it will be operational within a year’s time,” Mr. Hegde said. Apart from basic civic works, only machinery has to be installed and they were confident of making the plant operational in 2021, he said. The city generates nearly 450 tonnes of garbage daily of which bulk of it – almost 200 tonnes – goes to the waste treatment plant at the sewage farm at Vidyaranyapuram. About 150 to 200 tonnes go to landfills and dumping sites and the rest are processed at the zero waste management facilities. In addition to the two solid waste management plants, the MCC is also confident of getting the construction debris recycling plant started in 2021. The site for the proposed C and D recycling plant has been approved at Kopplur and it will have a capacity to recycle 100 tonnes of building debris daily. In the absence of a C and D recycling plant, bulk of the construction debris is being dumped along the outer ring road. The ORR has also become a dumping yard for untreated garbage though the MCC has repeatedly “warned” that it will penalise those found guilty of dumping the waste. Though the new development is expected to ease the pressure on waste management in the city, the project pertaining to clearing legacy waste of nearly 2 lakh tonnes accumulated at the Sewage Farm is going slow. While bioremediation has been proposed and the government has cleared it, it wants the tenders to be split into three: transportation, treatment and processing, and waste disposal. But the authorities have appealed against it on the grounds that it is not practical and wants it to be a single tender. There are concerns that splitting a project and inviting different agencies could lead to hiccups in the smooth implementation and functioning of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/work-on-two-waste-treatment-plants-to-commence-soon/article33381188.ece
21 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘HDK and Siddaramaiah did not do enough to save coalition govt.’||Former Minister and JD(S) MLA representing Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency G.T. Deve Gowda on Sunday said former Chief Ministers H.D. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah did not do enough to save the coalition government from collapsing. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Gowda said Mr. Kumaraswamy had himself confessed that he was not in favour of the coalition government that he was heading and had let it go. “So, he had remained in the United States, where he was on a tour, even when the coalition MLAs were resigning,” he said. On the other hand, Mr. Siddaramaiah also did not make an honest effort to save the Congress-JD(S) coalition. MLAs resign The MLAs, who were unable to get their work done and disenchanted with the coalition government, decided to resign. But, neither did Mr. Siddaramaiah make an effort to retain them nor did Mr. Kumaraswamy. “If the two leaders had prevented them, why would they have gone?” Mr. Gowda asked. Reacting to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s charge that Mr. Siddaramaiah was opposed to the coalition government headed by him, Mr. Gowda said the Congress leader abided by the party High Command’s decision to have an alliance with the JD(S) and make Mr. Kumaraswamy Chief Minister even though he was not in favour of the coalition. When his attention was drawn to Mr. Kumaraswamy running the government from a star hotel, Mr. Gowda said Mr. Kumaraswamy considered his room in the star hotel “auspicious” as he received the call to become the Chief Minister of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government when he was in the hotel room. Merger with BJP Fielding reporters’ queries on the speculation over JD(S)’ merger with the BJP, Mr. Gowda said it will not happen as long as former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda permits it. “As long as Mr. Deve Gowda is there, the JD(S) will not merge with the BJP,” he said before adding that there may an alliance like there was in 2006 when the party tied up with the BJP to form a coalition government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-and-siddaramaiah-did-not-do-enough-to-save-coalition-govt/article33381192.ece
21 December 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||They’ve something to cheer about||After nearly eight months, homestays across Kodagu have received bookings — for Christmas and the year-end. Nearly 50 to 60% occupancy has been recorded since the beginning of this month in registered and active homestays, say industry insiders. Many resorts, especially the high-end ones, have been booked till the year-end even as the Kodagu district administration has issued guidelines to the hospitality sector on the dos and don’ts for New Year’s Eve revelry. Curbs on celebrations Kodagu Homestays’ Association founder secretary and past president Karumbaiah said, “Homestays are getting more bookings from couples and families and not group bookings like earlier. With curbs on celebrations and gatherings, playing music, bonfires, and dancing in place, homestays have been told to stick to the guidelines.” Last year, all homestays were booked for the entire December. As of now, about 50% are booked, it’s a big improvement when compared with previous months. “More enquiries are coming from Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kerala, and also from Maharashtra,” he added. However, there is a shortage of rooms in some places as not all registered homestays have opened. Many have decided to take bookings only from the next year. B.G. Ananthashayana, president of the association, said the 2018 and 2019 calamities devastated tourism in Kodagu and this year it is the turn of the pandemic. “But there seems to be signs of revival, going by the bookings for the New Year. People are now coming out to holiday in Kodagu without any fear. This is a big relief for us and homestays have been told to take all precautions,” he added. He clarified that there is no bar on tourists coming to Kodagu but there are curbs on celebrations. Low demand for hotels While homestays and resorts are getting bookings, it is not the case with hotels. The response is poor for budget hotels, said B.R. Nagendra Prasad, president of the Kodagu Hotels, Restaurants and Resorts Association. “The hotel sector does not have high hopes for the New Year since curbs have been imposed. We knew this and therefore we are not investing much since not many tourists will be coming to celebrate,” he said, adding that it may take some more time for tourism to revive fully in Kodagu.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/theyve-something-to-cheer-about/article33380786.ece

21 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||2018 elections: GTD denies understanding between BJP and JD(S) in Chamundeshwari||Former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda, who defeated former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency during the 2018 polls, on Sunday denied there was any understanding between the JD(S) and the BJP during the elections. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Mr. Gowda said the BJP’s vote share had actually increased during 2018 compared to 2013. The BJP candidate during 2013 Assembly elections had secured about 8,300 votes while its candidate during 2018 elections Gopalrao polled around 12,000 votes. The BJP did not hold any meeting to decide that its party should support the JD(S). However, he admitted that some people opposed to Mr. Siddaramaiah may have voted for the JD(S). But, nobody from the BJP openly identified with the JD(S), Mr. Gowda said. With regard to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s allegation that the Congress leaders themselves sabotaged his chances in Chamundeshwari constituency, Mr. Gowda said he received no support from the Congress either from the State-level leaders or the local taluk-level leaders or workers. “Let alone supporting me, nobody from the Congress called me on the telephone expressing support,” he said. He said Mr. Siddaramaiah was pained by his loss in the elections from Chamundeshwari as he felt betrayed by the people despite contributing so much to the State as the Chief Minister. “He has a lot of attachment with the constituency that he was representing since ‘83. After winning from the constituency in the earlier elections, he had served as Minister and even Deputy Chief Minister. So, he was deeply hurt by the loss,” Mr. Gowda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/2018-elections-gtd-denies-understanding-between-bjp-and-jds-in-chamundeshwari/article33381186.ece

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||A sector disrupted, rebooted, and reorganised in a year||Shutting shop hadn’t occurred to me even as a vague possibility in the three decades that I have spent in the travel industry. Driven by the government directive to lockdown the country, I had to take the tough call of closing my office down, temporarily, and asking the staff to go on indefinite leave in March 2020. It was a heart-wrenching time for my business partner and I, with whom I had co-founded ‘Panache World’, a boutique travel company that specialised in customised trips, an enterprise we built brick by brick over the past 19 years. That was the beginning of a nightmare that lasted 75 days, during which time almost all countries across the world had closed their borders and grounded aircraft, bringing travel to a grinding halt. The consensus was that the travel industry, which was the first to shut down and hardest hit, would be the last to revive. If one is to draw an analogy to a travel scare of the scale as the present pandemic, the closest would possibly be 9/11, which happened almost a couple of decades ago. Yet, then, the recovery was relatively swift as the travel industry bounced back in a calendar quarter. It has since continued to thrive and pre-COVID-19 contributed to 10% of the world GDP, employing 330 million people, and was worth $9 trillion. Calls of despair During the lockdown, I received many calls of despair from stakeholders in the travel industry, seeking answers, a path forward. As president of the Karnataka Tourism Forum, I was often asked to throw some light and provide guidance. Not having experienced anything of this nature before, I could do little but share my hope that the situation would improve and give a ‘guesstimated’ timeline of when I expected things to get better. The gloom was grounding, humbling, and anguishing. Employees dependent on monthly salaries to meet expenses saw their incomes reduce, and in some cases stop. And while their incomes may have stopped, not so their expenses. Sadly, I heard of many seeing their businesses dwindle away. They were forced to give up their offices, let go of their staff and seek alternative means of income or resort to borrowing to sustain themselves. Fragmented industry The impact in India has been particularly harder to deal with because the tourism industry is fragmented and made up of a longtail of small businesses, many of which are not registered as MSMEs. The government, even if it willed and attempted, could not ascertain potential beneficiaries and dole out relief financially. The Indian travel industry is tough, but it had its resilience tested to extremes. The lockdown did lift eventually in June and businesses started opening up gingerly, as did my office, but the fear prevailed for months that followed with the dreaded cases of infection surging unabated. ‘Leisure Travel’ is discretionary and travellers continued to refrain from venturing out. It was not until almost half a year since the lockdown had passed that the first brave hearts attempted driving trips in the cocoon of their cars for weekends in hotels and resorts that offered natural distancing such as independent cottages or villas. Gradually, flights opened up as did people’s willingness to travel. At large, having our lives disrupted, rebooted, and reorganised, we have now lived a time frame that will get to be known as pre- or post-COVID. Some things will never go back to the way they used to be, and generally there will be a caution that this generation will live with going forward. As international borders start to reopen ever so slowly, the travel industry will also go through rationalisation. For instance, with the advent and adoption of ‘Zoom’, business or corporate travel will practice fiscal feasibility and curtailment. On an optimistic front, travel may perhaps become more meaningful. Travelling only for enjoyment or escape from daily life will become a conscious thought. A deeper knowledge of the destination, its people, and its history will seem more pertinent when planning a trip. Connecting with the experiences, the places and people we interact with will become more fulfilling and rewarding, to us, individually. Sharing stories of your experiences so as to inspire others will make your travel worthwhile. It is going to be about giving meaning to your own life … and in a way to people around you who you care for and inspire you.  Sanjar Imam is the president of the Karnataka Tourism Forum and the founder-director of Panache World.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-sector-disrupted-rebooted-and-reorganised-in-a-year/article33380792.ece

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar (in picture) has had to face quite a bit of trouble over the last few years, especially at the hands of Central agencies. Going by the number of temples he has been visiting ever since he took the reins of the party and the rituals he has performed, it appears that he has placed high hopes on divine intervention to tide over his troubles. The most curious among his various pilgrimages was the recent one to Mailaralinga temple at Mailara in Hoovina Hadagali of Ballari district. He had apparently flown over the temple in a helicopter to reach the shrine and participate in the Karanika festival in 2017. According to his spiritual guru, this was a “blunder” which might have enraged the Mailaralinga and provoked him to “hit back.” Following a “remedy” suggested by the guru, Mr. Shivakumar came to the shrine (of course by road this time) and offered a model of a helicopter made in silver as a penance for his “sin” and prayed to Mailaralinga to forgive him. The deity’s response is awaited.   Elections come with a fair share of threats and inducements, but rarely do they come neatly printed and handed out as pamphlets. One woman candidate in Kalkere village (Tumakuru district) appears to have decided to be forthright and put it in black and white. A pamphlet by her (or at least attributed to her) has two columns — “Things I will do if I win” and “Things I will do if I lose.” While the first part is about “good deeds” such as roads to be laid and temples to be rejuvenated, second is a list of “threats” to expose those who have something to hide, such as fake ration cards and encroachment of government lands. Such “honesty” being rare, one even wonders if the pamphlet, widely shared on WhatsApp groups, be just another prank.   During a recent chat with reporters in Mysuru, BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath’s humorous description of the JD(S) as a “child that can be lured by whoever offers it a sweet” may have sent his supporters and journalists into peals of laughter. But little did Mr. Vishwanath realise that his analogy would expose him also to criticism. It did not take long for JD(S) leader Ravichandre Gowda to question Mr. Vishwanath which “sweet” was offered to him by the BJP when he went to Mumbai before the coalition government was brought down. The message from the JD(S) was loud and clear — those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Kumar Burdikatti Bageshree S. Laiqh A.

21 December 2020||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Christmas cakes on a life-saving mission||They are selling cakes this Christmas season to make some quick bucks not to make merry but to buy an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ambulance for the public. Team Prahladaa, under the aegis of Thuravoor-based Prahladaa Social Service Trust, which is behind the initiative is holding the ‘cake challenge’ by setting up a temporary cake sales counter by the side of National Highway-66 opposite the Thuravoor taluk hospital. “A lot of ambulances are available in the area but none has critical care facilities. There have been instances where people’s lives could have been saved if an ICU ambulance was available. Hence we decided to buy such an ambulance. We are selling cakes to raise funds for the purpose,” says Bharath Jagadeesh, secretary, Prahladaa Social Service Trust. Team Prahladaa, consisting mostly of youngsters and students, is getting good support for their fund-raising efforts. ‘Ambulance challenge’ The ‘ambulance challenge,’ launched in July 2020, urged people to donate Rs. 150 or more for the cause. “We raised Rs. 3.54 lakh through the initial challenge, the details of which are available on our website. The ‘cake challenge,’ its continuation, was launched last week. We are conducting it as an event and our aim is to raise as much money as possible. The cakes are provided by a wholesale dealer at a lower rate. The entire profit will be used to purchase the ambulance,” he says. More events planned They will have to raise Rs. 30 lakh to buy the ambulance, for which they are planning more such events. “The cake challenge is helping us raise money, but it will not be enough. We are also looking at other options including securing CSR funds,” says a member of the trust. The Prahladaa Social Service Trust, launched two years ago, has been involved in various activities since. It provided food and essentials to flood-affected people of tribal colonies in Nilambur. During the COVID-19-induced lockdown, the trust provided medicine, food and grocery to more than 500 families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/christmas-cakes-on-a-life-saving-mission/article33381080.ece

21 December 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||Non-political parties lose their relevance in Idukki||As the emergence of local collectives like Twenty20 was much talked about in the local body elections in the State, the political space for similar ones had only a short life in Idukki. The main non- political entities that came to the electoral front in the district in 2015 local body elections were the High Range Sanrakshana Samithy (HRSS ), a collective of various religious groups under the Church and Pengal Outrumai, a platform of women tea estate workers based in Munnar. While HRSS which contested the local bodies elections in 2015 as a partner of Left Democratic From (LDF) got rich dividends, Pengal Outrumai, which stood independently also proved its might in Devikulam taluk. Both of them, however, withdrew from electoral scene this time. Usually when a non-political organisation enters the political space, it loses the base on which it stood. Both of the collectives came to the public realm through the massive agitations they launched and were supported by by the general public. The independently elected members of Pengal Outrumai in Munnar joined with the UDF as their support was needed in the otherwise hung council. The Pengal Outrumai also witnessed a vertical split and the main group returned to its shell ‘to achieve the goal for which it was formed.’ To continue An office-bearer of HRSS said it would continue its agitations for protecting the rights of farmers for which it was formed. In addition, the AIADMK, a political party based in Tamil Nadu also widely fielded candidates in the plantation areas of Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peerumade taluks where majority of people are of Tamil origin. The party which had a president in Peerumade grama panchayat in 2015 did not even get a member this time. According to a mainstream political leader, those organisations that come to political scenes at the height of their activities soon lose relevance as they have no political plans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/non-political-parties-lose-their-relevance-in-idukki/article33381115.ece
21 December 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||Shigella alert issued in Wayanad||The Health Department has issued a shigella alert in Wayanad in the wake of a recent outbreak of the disease in the neighbouring Kozhikode district. Fever, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea (with stool containing blood) are the symptoms of shigella infection, which could be fatal if not treated in time. “If the symptoms are seen in infants who are not breastfed, persons with nutrition deficiency, elders, and those recovering from measles, immediate medical help should be sought,” said Health Department sources. If diagnosed with shigella, patients should be given oral rehydration treatment at once for replenishing the fluid level in the body. Sunken eyes, low blood pressure, dry skin, dry mouth, and fall in urine level are the general symptoms of dehydration. In cases of diarrhoea with repeated vomiting, fever and stool with pus and blood, the patients should be taken to a medical facility. Personal hygiene Maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene is the main preventive measure. Frequent hand washing with soap is important, and it should be done before consuming food and after using the toilet. Drinking water should be boiled and soft drinks and juices from street vendors should be avoided. Food should be kept covered. Those handling food should be extra cautious and should ensure that their hands are washed thoroughly. Patients can infect others if they handle food or water without care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shigella-alert-issued-in-wayanad/article33381053.ece

Being the first Ayurveda college in north Malabar to receive the recognition, several opportunities for research will be opened up for the academia, said E. Kunhiraman, director, MVR Ayurveda Medical College. He added that the institution at present offers PG courses in Agada Tantra, Panchakarma, Rasa Shastra, and Bhaishajya Kalpana, and they have now been recognised for doctoral research. He said the Pappinissery Visha Chikitsa Kendram under the medical college had played a crucial role in bringing down death rate due to snake bite. Mr. Kunhiraman said since 1964, the centre had treated close to two lakh snake bite cases with a unique record of less than 1% of casualties. He said the Panchakarma department at the college had successfully adapted modern technical advancements in therapy techniques to ensure optimal results in treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ayurveda-college-upgraded-to-research-centre/article33381056.ece

Anil Kumar, a probable Mayor candidate of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). NDA presence The presence of five National Democratic Alliance (NDA) councillors will also be a first in the council. The NDA, which has never won more than two seats in the council, bagged five this time. Besides Ernakulam Central and Cherlai, which have remained BJP bastions for decades, the NDA won Island North, Amaravathy, and Ernakulam South. Benedict Fernandez, who won from Fort Kochi Veli, C.D. Valsala Kumari who won from the Vennala Division, Sheeba Lal who bagged the Nazreth seat, and Jagadambika Sudarshan from Kunnumpuram are among the sitting LDF councillors who will return to the council. Deliberations within the LDF on the posts of Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and standing committee chairpersons are likely to make some headway after the swearing-in ceremony. CPI claim The CPI, which won four seats, has staked claim to the post of Deputy Mayor. The election for the post of Mayor is set to take place on December 28. The Congress leadership is smarting from the UDF’s loss that will leave senior party leaders, including outgoing Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar and N. Venugopal, out of the new council. “Ten sitting councillors contested again this time. Some councillors who returned to contest after a hiatus have also won. Some eight seats were lost only by a very small margin, where V4 Kochi and UDF rebels ate into the vote share,” said Dominic Presentation, UDF district chairman. V.K. Minimol, M.G. Aristottil, and Antony Painuthara are among the sitting UDF councillors returning for another term.  Having won 34 seats and secured the backing of two Independents, the LDF is set to return to helm the corporation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-corporation-councillors-to-be-sworn-in-today/article33381064.ece
21 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Call to streamline traffic on service roads near flyovers||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) or the Public Works Department (PWD) will have to step in with measures to streamline traffic through service roads, soon after the commissioning of the Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers, according to official sources. The NHAI owns the 16-km Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass and collects toll, while the PWD (NH Wing) spearheaded the construction of the two six-lane flyovers. At Vyttila “A potential and visible bottleneck at Vyttila is the watch tower of the traffic police at the entry to SA Road, which will have to be relocated to enable smooth traffic along the service road on the western side of the flyover,” PWD sources said. “This will result in vehicles coming from the Aroor side in two rows having to proceed towards Ponnurunni or the service road of the NH Bypass in a single row, as they reach the bottlenecked portion between the flyover and the tower. We have already requested the police to relocate the tower towards SA Road, where space is available, by at least five metres,” they added. The flyover has been constructed in such a way that there is four-lane width on the immediate southern side of the junction. This leaves ample space for free left turn towards SA Road, and a ‘refuge lane’ beneath the flyover for vehicles from the Aroor side waiting to turn right towards Thripunithura. While the service road on the south-western side (city side) of the flyover is more than two metres wide, the service road on the south-eastern side and north-eastern side (Thripunithura side) does not have two-lane width at many places. Minimal land acquisition will invariably have to be done to avert traffic hold-ups and accidents at these places. This needs particular attention, since substantial number of vehicles from the Palarivattom side wanting to turn right towards SA Road will converge at the junction, occupying two-lane width, sources said. Another bottleneck is the narrow underpass beneath the Vyttila railway bridge, which is not wide enough. The NHAI will have to take a call on extending service roads northward, towards the railway line by around 30 metres, where there is width and height for an alternative underpass, they added. At Kundannoor At Kundannoor, the condition of service roads ought to be improved, while the duct on the south-eastern side of the junction that carries water pipelines has to be relocated to enable smooth traffic. This is because the slabs over the duct are uneven, and they often hold up traffic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-streamline-traffic-on-service-roads-near-flyovers/article33381063.ece
21 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||One-vote defeat throws up legal challenges||The one-vote defeat of Congress leader N. Venugopal in the Island North Division of the Kochi Corporation in the civic body polls has thrown up interesting legal challenges. Mr. Venugopal, the Mayor aspirant of the UDF, has moved the Kerala High Court, challenging the decision of the presiding officer casting vote in favour of T. Padmakumari of the BJP. The petition may come up before the court on Monday. Discrepancy According to Mr. Venugopal, the presiding officer pressed the button in favour of the BJP candidate at 6.45 p.m. on the polling day to tally the votes that were polled in the machine and in the records, as agreed by all the candidates. While the entries in election records indicated that 496 votes were polled, only 495 votes were seen polled in the electronic voting machine, said Mr. Venugopal. As confusion prevailed, said Mr. Venugopal, a consensus was arrived at by the candidates to cast vote in favour of one candidate, who was to be selected by drawing lots. As Ms. Padmakumari won the lot, the vote was cast in her favour, which eventually turned out to be the winning vote, he explained. Even if agreed by the candidates, the presiding officer cannot cast vote and that too after polling hours. There are no provisions for such a practice. The decision of the officer will be legally challenged, he said. No election petition will stand against the action of the presiding officer, which was unprecedented, Mr. Venugopal said. Plea dismissed Though Mr. Venugopal moved the State Election Commission, the plea was dismissed, as the role of the commission in the election process ended with the conduct of polls and declaration of results. “The State commission cannot intervene in the issue, which cropped up after polling of votes and declaration of results. The only option available for the lost candidate is to challenge the decision of the presiding officer before a munsif court,” said V. Bhaskaran, State Election Commissioner. Civil court Mr. Venugopal can seek legal recourse for his grievance. He has to approach a civil court, which will look into the various aspects of the case. Evidence needs to be taken in the case and documents verified. Only a judicial order can solve contentious issue, Mr. Bhaskaran said.  The State Election Commission cannot intervene in the issue, which cropped up after polling of votes and declaration of results.

21 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Resentment brews over closure of Mattancherry jetty||Resentment is brewing against the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) for not resuming ferry services to Mattancherry. The services were halted in 2018 following the floods. A few thousand commuters from the region, most of whom from economically weaker sections, who relied on ferries to commute to Ernakulam and other places, have to either travel by bus or go all the way to the Customs Jetty in Fort Kochi to board ferries. Bus commuters end up paying over thrice the ferry fare of Rs. 6 and also spend more than double the time to reach mainland Ernakulam, said Govind Madhav Mallaya of West Kochi Passengers’ Association. “The SWTD has been citing inadequate depth at the Mattancherry Jetty for ferries to safely call at. They say wooden logs were washed into the jetty during the floods, although West Kochi was among the few places in the State which were unaffected by the floods. Moreover, double-decked tourist boats, which are much bigger than ferries, have been calling at the nearby tourist jetty without any hindrance. Even presuming that the SWTD jetty is shallow, we keep wondering why neither the department nor the Cochin Port Trust dredged the locale during the past two years,” Mr. Mallaya said. Ticket counter closed Even worse, the SWTD has closed the ticket counter at the Fort Kochi ferry jetty, citing the pandemic situation. Subsequently, it has cut down the number of schedules too. This has resulted in commuters left to wonder when the next ferry will arrive from the mainland. Services to Vypeen have been operating despite all this, since the MLA there has taken a strong stand against reducing services. The SWTD has also failed to roll out modern catamaran vessels it had promised in the region, while the fast ferry that operated in the corridor has been withdrawn, he added. A senior SWTD official said the Irrigation Department had to dredge the Mattancherry Jetty to ensure safe landing of ferries. “The counter at Fort Kochi was closed after many personnel tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. There has been a steep fall in the number of passengers, especially during off-peak hours, and hence we have cut down the number of services,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/resentment-brews-over-closure-of-mattancherry-jetty/article33381065.ece

Inaugurating the paddy harvest at Ezhippuram, she added that measures should be taken to market value added products along with rice. “In a bid to attain self-sufficiency in production the government has introduced many initiatives including royalty for those who continue farming for three consecutive years, farmer pension and various subsidies. The government could create over one lakh job opportunities even in the middle of natural disasters and COVID-19,” she said. The paddy cultivation project at Gurunagappan field was launched by Nadakkal Service Co-operative Bank with the support of Kalluvathukkal grama panchayat and Agriculture Department as part of Subhiksha Keralam project. Paddy was cultivated in 12 acres of land that had been lying idle for several years and 250 kg seeds were sowed in the field. Harvested rice will soon hit the market in one, five, 10 and 25 kg packs under the brand name Nadakkal rice through Civil Supplies Department.

While the Tourism Department has opened all major destinations, private operators have announced discounted rates and a range of special packages to attract the festival crowd. “We are slowly bouncing back though it will take time for the sector to revive completely. At present we have no foreign tourists, but there has been a considerable surge in the number of domestic travellers. Tourists have adapted to the new normal and COVID-19 protocol is strictly followed in all places,” says a DTPC official. The Department had resumed its packages to backwater destinations like Munroe Thuruthu and currently DTPC boats are operating up to four services a day to the island. “While Adventure Park and the beaches have a steady crowd, the newly-opened centre at Malamel and Sambranikodi are also attracting a lot of visitors. Similarly, Thenmala Eco-tourism centre and Jatayu Earth’s Centre have come alive after the break,” she adds. According to private tour operators, the situation started changing in December with hotels and resorts getting enquiries for Christmas and New Year eve. For those operating houseboats and homestays, the festival season is the last hope. “We had nearly zero income during the last nine months. and Since tourists are slowly coming back, we have made elaborate arrangements to host them with all the initial amenities,” says Vishwam, homestay owner. Even before December the eco-tourism destinations under Forest Department in the district were witnessing a spike in the number of enquiries. At present Palaruvi is the only destination that is not completely opened for tourists due to the ongoing renovation works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steady-flow-of-tourists-into-kollam-district/article33381116.ece

21 December 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Draw of lots to break the tie||The chairperson of the Kottayam municipality, where both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) do not have the minimum numbers to form the administrative council, is set to be decided through a draw of lots. In the urban body that has 52 seats, the UDF currently possesses 21seats as against the 22 seats by the LDF. But with Bincy Sebastian, the lone independent councillor in the municipality, deciding to extend her support to the Congress-led coalition, both the coalitions will have an equal number of seats in the council. With this, the stance of the National Development Alliance that has eight seats in the council becomes decisive. However, none of the leading coalitions appear to be willing to align with the BJP-led coalition, at least for the time being. As part of extending her support to the UDF, Mrs. Sebastian on Sunday attended a meeting at the District Congress Committee office in Kottayam and held discussions with the senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy. On her arrival at the party office in the afternoon, Mrs. Sebastian was accorded a warm reception by the party leadership. “Now that we have confirmed the support of the independent councillor, the chairperson will be decided through a draw of lot,” said Joshy Philip, president of the DCC, Kottayam. Mrs. Sebastian, who had contested from Ward 52 of the municipality as a Congress rebel, won by a slender margin of eight votes. Upon winning the election, she had been approached by both the coalitions for support. In lieu of extending her support to the coalition, Mrs. Sebastian is learned to have demanded the chairperson's post in case of the UDF winning the lot, besides withdrawing the disciplinary action initiated by the party against her supporters. Meanwhile, the UDF leadership has succeeded in assuring the support of two out of the three independents in the municipality as well. The stance of the Independents has become crucial for the UDF and the LDF, which has won 13 and 12 seats respectively. Hopeful The Congress, which has been holding active consultations with the three Independents in Changanassery, remains hopeful of retaining power in the urban body as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/draw-of-lots-to-break-the-tie/article33381120.ece

The looming long-weekend that coincides with the Christmas-New Year season has provided a welcome boost to tourism in the village destination, which continues to reel under the impact of a COVID-19 induced lockdown. Majority of the hotel and resort operators here have witnessed a near 100 percent bookings since the second week of December, bringing some relief to the stressed hospitality sector. But with the rooms booked far below the usual rates, the business margins too have fallen sharply. “The bookings have increased gradually since the reopening a couple of months ago and it has now hit a peak with the Christmas season. The overall business, however, remains well under the volumes recorded usually during the same period in the previous years when the village gets jampacked with tourists,” said K. Arun Kumar, secretary, the Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts (CVHR). With expectations mounting on the reopening of international borders, the hospitality industry remains hopeful of the business gaining momentum once the foreign clients begin to flow in. “The current spate of bookings is expected to last only till the first half of January and from there on, we will need the foreign clients to push on,” he added. Meanwhile, the visitors have begun trickling into the village interiors as part of the village-life experience packages offered by the Responsible Tourism Mission Kerala. Last week, the Mission had as many as 20 guests - mostly from other States, while it is set to receive 40 more in the coming week. “We are on a clear path to recovery and this may well hit the right track with the ongoing season,” said K.Rupesh Kumar, Coordinator, RT mission. While the tourists within the State are looking to explore the new destinations like Vaikom or Punnayurkulam, the guests from other States have mostly stuck to conventional destinations like Kumarakom, he added. The 120 house boats and the 100-odd shikara and motorboats s too commenced operations. Without work Tourism in Kumarakom has survived devastating crises before, including the 2018 mega floods and the Nipah scare. But the impact of COVID-19 is beyond comparison as a majority of its local populace, who are employed in the tourism industry, went without work for months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/christmas-boost-to-tourism-in-kumarakom/article33381118.ece

Muraleedharan has said. He was here on Sunday to open a felicitation event for the recently elected people’s representatives of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  “If the election victory is being considered as a clean chit, the government should have resigned after the LDF rout in the Lok Sabha polls.

Plainclothesmen of both squads are on the field to prevent attempts to smuggle narcotic drugs and Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) from other States. Checking of inter-State goods carriers is on in full swing near the district borders and highways. The Thamarassery Ghat Road will be monitored by a special police team in the wake of recent seizures of huge quantities of ganja from trucks. The squad is also likely to monitor closed circuit television cameras on the route. Ecstasy drugs  According to police sources, there has been a steady rise in the smuggling of ecstasy drugs in various parts of the State ahead of the New Year celebrations. Considering the huge demand for drugs, many persons have turned carriers, hoping to make a quick buck. Homestay and resort owners will have to be more cautious and keep a record of visitors. Details of international tourists will have to be intimated to the nearest police station. The rules will also be applicable for those operating health tourism projects and houseboats. According to Excise Department sources, the striking units under various excise circle limits will remain alert during the period. They will mainly check attempts at illicit liquor brewing and supply. Special control rooms have been set up to receive complaints from the public about suspicious activities. The Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force also have launched surprise inspection squads to track the movement of suspicious consignments through trains.

21 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||AICC unlikely to alter leadership in State||The national leadership of the Congress is reportedly opposed to any ‘knee-jerk’ leadership change in Kerala in the wake of the poor showing of the party in the local body polls. According to indications on Sunday, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy are likely to lead the party into the Assembly polls. Meet from Dec. 23 A party insider said leadership change at the KPCC level was unlikely to be on the table when district-level office-bearers, MPs and MLAs meet for a post-poll stocktaking from December 23 to 27 here. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar would attend the meeting on its penultimate day. He had on Saturday warned State leaders against playing the blame game. The bickering and name-calling in the party had manifested in the open mostly as posters that lampooned some leaders for their ‘ineptitude’ while championing the cause of a few others as potential saviours of the Congress. Mr. Anwar had promised a fair hearing and quick resolution of grievances in the KPCC. By one account, the KPCC seemed to have revolved around to the view that the optics of the United Democratic Front’s ‘overt alliance’ with the Welfare Party of India (WPI), the political arm of the Jamaat-e-Islami, had created an impression among some Hindu and Christian voters that the Congress had opened the door for radical Islamists. Secular image News reports and images of UDF convener M.M. Hassan calling on Jamaat-e-Islami Amir M.I. Abdul Aziz had arguably provided ammunition to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take potshots at the secular image of the Congress. The BJP had used the opportunity to raise the spectre of ‘love jihad,’ a highly ambivalent but politically explosive word employed by the Sangh Parivar, to discourage ‘orchestrated’ inter-faith marriage with an eye on conversion, particularly between Muslim men and Hindu women. Several church factions in Kerala had also raised concern about ‘love jihad,’ which law enforcement agencies had debunked as misleading. The Congress also reportedly felt that the BJP had attracted some of the anti-incumbency votes that should have fallen into the UDF’s kitty. Some leaders believed the party should have put the government in the dock more forcefully for refusing to forsake the State levy on fuel and LPG. Such a poll campaign would have possibly resonated among households.

21 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||SAAC set for peer team visits||The State Assessment and Accreditation Centre (SAAC) is gearing up to conduct peer team visits to higher education institutions in Kerala for the first cycle of accreditation. After being initially cold-shouldered by a section of the academic community, around 20 colleges, including arts and science, engineering, teacher training, and nursing colleges, have expressed willingness to undergo assessment. Considering the government’s intention to make SAAC accreditation a criterion for new courses and affiliation, many other colleges are expected to follow suit. While the COVID-19 scenario stalled the activities of SAAC, the Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) has targeted completing the peer team visits by March. Guided by former NAAC director Ranganath H. Annegowda, the exercise will involve academicians who have been part of NAAC peer teams and other experts of various disciplines. Institutions that have registered for the process mainly include aided and unaided colleges. Sources point out that the exhaustive task of preparing self-study reports, coupled with the restricted attendance of faculty in colleges owing to the pandemic situation, has posed hurdles for government colleges. State-specific norms KSHEC member secretary Rajan Varughese attributed the new-found inclination towards the SAAC accreditation process to its State-specific parameters, including social inclusiveness and equity, which do not figure among the criteria set by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in its grading process. “Some colleges have also sought an assessment by the SAAC to identify their deficiencies to prop up their prospects in time for the next cycle of NAAC accreditation. Besides, the exercise can be regarded as a threshold accreditation for first-timers to evaluate preparedness for national accreditation. Accreditation by multiple agencies is also bound to improve their chances in various pursuits, including rankings,” Prof. Varughese said. The government’s recent move to consider NAAC grading as a yardstick while allotting new courses for colleges is also perceived to have created an awareness regarding the need to go in for assessments. Lauding the government for adopting the strategy, academicians urged resolve against bowing down to pressure groups that could defeat the purpose. Sources suspect that a section of private college managements had held back from seeking assessment fearing that submission of their staff details and other information could expose certain inadequacies relating to permanent staff and teacher-student ratio.

Communist Party of India district secretary D. Jagadeesh, TDP Polit Bureau member Kalava Srinivasulu and Congress official spokesperson Golla Nagaraju along with leaders of other parties, at a press conference here, said they were perplexed at the way the State government was going about with regard to weather-based insurance and payment of compensation for crop loss. “As per the State government figures, 12.26 lakh acres of groundnut was sown in Anantapur district, but compensation was being offered only to those who did e-crop booking at the Village Secretariats and premium was paid only for farmers in 4.5 lakh acres. The crop cutting experiments were not done properly and officials just cooked up the figures sitting at their offices,” alleged Mr. Srinivasulu. Challenge to govt. A farmer in Nagasamudram of Guntakal mandal has challenged the State government to prove that he had got higher yield and was not eligible for the crop insurance or input subsidy compensation after the crop cutting experiment showed their village having more than the average yield and excluded from the scheme, the TDP leader pointed out. “If the Village Secretariats were meant to take the administration closer to them and subsidised groundnut seeds were given from there, why were all farmers not registered for the weather-based insurance scheme and the onus put on the farmers to do crop booking,” questioned Mr. Jagadeesh. The all-party meeting decided to throng the Village Secretariats for three days from Monday with applications for the e-crop booking and compensation and weather-based insurance. If there was no response from the government even then, the JAC members at mandal level would picket the Tahasildar offices seeking justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/groundnut-crop-loss-opposition-parties-to-agitate-for-compensation/article33381224.ece

21 December 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||All eyes on conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn today||Astronomy Club of the Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing (IIITDM) will be holding a special session to watch the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn on Monday evening through a special telescope. The Head of Department of Sciences at IIITDM, Devaraju Murali, told The Hindu that its students had been doing a lot of research on such celestial events for long. ‘Once-in-a-lifetime event’ One of the leading members of the club, Deepika Lahari, who is pursuing computer science, and who has prepared a leaflet based on her research for other members, explains thus: “Jupiter, the largest planet, takes 12 years to go around the sun, while Saturn takes about 30 years. Jupiter catches up with Saturn every 20 years when both come in a single line and we can see them as a single point in the sky. They coincide every 20 years, but what’s special about this time is that they will be coming this closest to each other after four centuries. The last time was in 1623.” On Monday, they would be positioned at an angle of 0.1 degree, the closest ever, explained Mr. D. Murali. “During the conjunction, both Jupiter and Saturn can be seen shining brightly in the southwestern sky.” When to watch This year, it is happening on December 21, called winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. If weather permits, the conjunction can be visible clearly in the night sky. “Anyone can watch the event with their naked eye or using a pair of binoculars. People should look for a suitable open place like a park or playground with an unobstructed view of the sky. The event might take place in about an hour after sunset and one can see a bright star in the southwest direction, which is Jupiter and Saturn.” With a pair of binoculars, one can also see Jupiter’s moons Lo, Europa, and Callisto. The next time such conjunctions can be seen are on October 31, 2040; April 7, 2060; March 15, 2080, and September 18, 2100. But among these, the next closest would again appear on March 15, 2080, almost 60 years from now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-eyes-on-conjunction-of-jupiter-saturn-today/article33381209.ece

21 December 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Roja vows to help orphan girl chase her dreams||Nagari MLA and APIIC chairperson R.K. Roja on Sunday came out with a gesture of charity by adopting P. Pushpa Kumari, a Class X girl and an inmate of the Government Home for Girls in Tirupati. Ms. Roja said she would do what all she could to fulfil the wish of the girl to pursue medicine. On the eve of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s birthday celebrations, Ms. Roja paid a visit to the girls’ home to spend some time with the inmates. Providing them snacks and gifts, Ms. Roja had a prolonged interaction with them. In the process, she was impressed with Pushpa Kumari, whose parents had died when the girl was a child, and which situation forced her to join government homes to pursue her studies. After going through her Class X and Intermediate marks memos and her NEET score, and listening to her interests, Ms. Roja was further impressed with her aspiration to pursue medicine and to serve the poor and downtrodden. Pushpa Kumari said both her parents of Tanapalle village near Tirupati had died in poverty and health problems. She had obtained 10 GPA in Class X and Intermediate. In the NEET this year, she had obtained 216 marks at the all-India level, which was not enough to get a seat in medical college. Responding to the girl’s wish, Ms. Roja said she took the opportunity to adopt her on the eve of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s birthday. She asked the girl to completely focus on education and pursue her fixed goal. “I am there for you to become a doctor,” Ms. Roja said as the girl went emotional. Ms. Roja said she had always been a votary to women development and empowerment. Parents should also come forward to encourage their daughters to compete in all aspects with boys, and this perspective was the need of the hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/roja-vows-to-help-orphan-girl-chase-her-dreams/article33381032.ece

21 December 2020||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Repairs on Musi embankments yet to be taken up||Two months after the city was wrecked by torrential rains and destructive floods, no attempts are visible on the ground to carry out repairs to the embankments on open drains and Musi river. Floods to the Musi had swept away the safety railings on the causeway bridges at Chaderghat and Moosrambagh, in mid-October. In place of the railings, wooden stakes were driven on both sides along the Chaderghat bridge, as temporary safety measure. The same arrangement has continued till date, with no effort to install new railings. On Moosarambagh though, temporary repairs were carried out, with a net fixed to metal poles, which anyway cannot act as crash barrier. “There is grave danger to vehicle-riders, especially during nights. Also, children and senior citizens from areas such as Shankarnagar, Padma Colony and Moosa Nagar could fall into the river if not careful,” says Syed Bilal, a resident of Chaderghat. At other places such as Chaitanyapuri and Saroornagar, retaining walls on the open storm water drain have collapsed, and the same arrangement with temporary wooden stakes was made here too. “The retaining walls on the nala on both sides of the road were broken to facilitate flood flow from the Saroornagar lake, which had inundated the highway on October 14. Till now, there is no attempt to rebuild them, though they posed grave risk,” said Narayana Swamy, a resident of Chaitanyapuri. An octagenarian woman fell into the nala and died near Seesala basti close to Saroornagar lake early in November, where the retaining wall had collapsed on the swirling waters. Her body was then recovered from the drain at Hanuman Nagar later in the day. No attempts were made to erect a retaining wall on the nala even after the incident. GHMC officials said estimates have been prepared for reconstruction of the retaining walls, and tenders are yet to be called for, for want of clarity on which wing should take up the works. “The government has constituted a separate wing within GHMC for implementation of Strategic Nala Development Programme. We have sought clarity on which wing should take up the works for building retaining walls. We will begin the works as soon as the clarity is given,” informed an official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/repairs-on-musi-embankments-yet-to-be-taken-up/article33381005.ece

21 December 2020||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State’s sole grasslands find themselves in a crossfire||The lush Gudisa hill range in East Godavari Agency is in the middle of a face-off between tourism officials and tribals, with both sides divided over the future of the only grasslands destination in the State. While tourism officials vouch for the untapped potential of the region, the Valmiki and Konda Reddy tribals inhabiting the hill range are staunchly opposed to any form of economic activity that might pose a danger to the pristine ecology of the reserve forest. Friction between the two sides began in early December after a fire erupted on a portion of the grasslands, damaging the horticulture fields. The fire was caused reportedly by tourists, who also allegedly polluted four streams in the area by dumping liquor bottles and plastic waste during a midnight sojourn on the hills. Sensing a threat to their tranquil way of life, the tribals, led by former Pullangi Sarpanch Andala Mangi Reddy, demanded authorities concerned to drop the plans of allowing tourism activity in the region. “We are in great worry as any untoward incident might happen in our sleepy habitations, with hundreds of tourists camping and roaming around the Gudisa hills during the night. We are not prepared to allow the grasslands to be opened for tourists due to the threat it poses to our way of life,” Mr. Mangi Reddy told The Hindu . Despite the objections raised by the tribals, the Forest Department and ITDA authorities are yet to respond to their grievances. As of Friday, the night camps are still being allowed on Gudisa hill, according to locals. An official investigating the issue told The Hindu : “The grasslands were burnt by tourists a few days ago. There are agents who are providing the night stay facility to tourists by making all arrangements despite a ban. The Gudisa grasslands is now a safe haven for every possible illegal activity, posing a threat to the ecology and the tribals’ way of life.” Grama Sabha Meanwhile, people from Pullangi panchayat, comprising 11 habitations of Valmiki and Konda Reddy tribes, have decided to hold a Grama Sabha on December 23 and pass a resolution against allowing the Gudisa hills to be opened for tourism. On Thursday, Divisional Panchayat Officer (Rampachodavaram) N. Haranadha Rao submitted a fact-finding report to ITDA Project Officer Praveen Adithya, recommending a strong regulation on tourism activities on Gudisa hill. Viability “Convincing tribals to set up a check-post at Chilaka Veedhi appears to be a viable solution to the issues arising out of the unregulated tourism activities. The idea is to check the vehicles, seize liquor and ban entry for those in a drunken state at the check-post that will be manned by the tribals. The ITDA authorities are yet to take a decision on the initiative,” Mr. Haranadha Rao told The Hindu . The Chilaka Veedhi point, two km from the Gudisa hill, is a strategic location from where two alternative routes to the Gudisa hill can be monitored. Meanwhile, some groups associated with various political parties are in touch with tribal elders to win their support to exploit the tourism potential of the grasslands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/states-sole-grasslands-find-itself-in-a-crossfire/article33381212.ece

Wide support Expressing solidarity with their counterparts protesting in New Delhi and other parts of the country for the 25th day, farmers cutting across party lines staged a demonstration in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here. They raised slogans against the three farm Acts and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020. Leading the protest, AIKSCC district convenor Ch.Ranga Rao said people should join the agitation against the ‘black laws’ in a big way as they would pave the way for black marketing of farm produce and spur food inflation. Removal of restrictions on holding of foodgrains would cause 150 to 200% increase in food prices in the future as the agri-marketing firms would release the hoarded stocks only when the market price reached their high target, he explained. Against corporatisation All India Kisan Sabha Prakasam District Secretary P. Venkat Rao said corporatisation of agriculture would spell doom to farmers going by the experiences of growers of herbal and social forestry plantations in the State. It would be the big agri-marketing firms that would rule the roost, said Andhra pradesh Rythu Sangam Prakasam District Secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy. CPI(ML) farmers wing president Paritala Koteswara Rao said the growing privatisation of the electricity sector would hit hard power consumers including farmers who could not expect the State Government to release subsidy on time for free power scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-fight-against-new-laws-continues/article33381207.ece

21 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP on a misinformation campaign, says Vijaya Sai||Rajya Sabha MP and YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) general secretary V. Vijaya Sai Reddy on Sunday alleged that Telugu Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu is indulging in a ‘misinformation campaign’ over the measures being taken to protect the government lands in the State. Addressing a press meet along with Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao here on Sunday, he said but for Mr. Naidu and his relatives, no one else in the State was objecting to the taking back of government lands from ‘land grabbers’. During Mr. Naidu’s tenure as Chief Minister, his men occupied several government lands but he had never bothered to stop them, Mr. Reddy alleged. Mr. Reddy wondered whether the TDP chief was seeking exemptions for his relatives. He also went on to allege that Mr. Naidu had lost his ‘mental balance’. “You are past 70, and have no future. You cannot fool the people any longer,” Mr. Reddy said. The YSRCP general secretary said the party leaders, coordinators and others met and discussed various issues pertaining to the district and the way ahead in the forthcoming GVMC elections. He explained that not even a single cent of private land was acquired for the proposed executive capital in Visakhapatnam. Mr. Srinivasa Rao alleged that Mr. Naidu was attempting to project that there was groupism within the YSRCP. The Minister alleged that Mr. Naidu had used a similar ploy to drive a rift in the NTR family, and appealed to YSRCP workers and leaders “to not fall for the game plan of the TDP chief”. No bauxite mining “Mr. Naidu is spreading falsehoods as he is upset at the YSRCP government for recovering lands grabbed by the rich, including TDP leaders,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao alleged. Replying to queries, Mr. Reddy said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had already clarified that bauxite mining would not be allowed in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam, and there would be no going back on it. The Anrak Aluminium refinery, constructed years ago in Visakhapatnam district, would require bauxite. This factory would provide jobs to locals, if opened. He, however, clarified that the raw material (bauxite) would either be imported from abroad or procured from Odisha. To another query, he said that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) report was ready and it would be handed over to the government soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-on-a-misinformation-campaign-says-vijaya-sai/article33381218.ece

He also alleged that Visakhapatnam district police have been arresting innocent tribals branding them as Maoist supporters while they are coming to weekly shandies, ration depots and other places. The police of A.P. and Odisha are trying to create a rift between the rebels and the tribals by spreading ‘false news’ against the Maoists, he alleged. The Maoist leader also claimed that a number of innocent tribals were being beaten and threatened. “The police claim that number of Maoist militia have surrendered themselves irked with Maoist ideology and after witnessing the development in their region. But the truth is that the police are threatening them that they will eliminate them in encounters,” he alleged in the audio message. Meanwhile combing operations have been intensified at the AOB.

21 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI(M) opposes decision on bauxite refining||The CPI(M) district committee has condemned the decision of the high-level committee to supply raw material from other States to Anrak Refinery. Anrak had constructed a bauxite refinery at Rachapalli village of Makavarapalem mandal in the district long ago. Party district committee secretary K. Lokanadham described the decision was nothing but injustice to the people of north Andhra. The bauxite refinery would poison the environment in the region, contaminate groundwater and result in scarcity of irrigation water, he alleged. He said that bauxite mining was a major issue before the elections and YSR Congress Party president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to withdraw the G.O. issued on bauxite mining. After taking over as Chief Minister, he withdrew G.O. no. 97 on bauxite mining, he said. The CPI(M) leader questioned as to how Anrak would be permitted to operate the refinery. Alleging that the State government was exerting pressure on the Centre to get the refinery started, he said that the Centre and State were trying to fool the people of Visakhapatnam district to benefit Anrak. He said that G.O. no. 97 was abolished after a decade of struggle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-opposes-decision-on-bauxite-refining/article33381229.ece

Patro said that the new finger millet variety called Indravathi has more nutritious value and is suitable for both Rabi and Kharif seasons. He said the new variety had become highly popular in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and other States within a few months of being released. “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been health-conscious and are eating more millets to boost their immunity. In this backdrop, the release of Indravathi variety has come as a timely move as it has more iron, calcium and zinc and other nutritious contents. The farmers also get more yield compared to other varieties. That is why we have been promoting it extensively in tribal and rural areas of both Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. Pest problem too will be minimised with this variety,” Dr. Patro said. According to him, it is resistant to finger blast, neck blast, foot rot and banded blight. It is also resistant to defoliators (grass hoppers and grey weevil), ear head caterpillar and aphids. The research station, which has been concentrating on millet since 1986, has released nearly 15 varieties including White Ragi. It has been supplying seeds to many farmers of L.N. Peta, Sithampet, Palakonda of Srikakulam district and Vepada of Vizianagaram district. Senior Scientist N. Anuradha, Scientist Y. Sandhya Rani and Agronomist V.

Truck loads of earth and also debris were being brought towards Moosanagar alongside the Chaderghat causeway bridge, and dumped into the river bed for levelling. It may be recalled that Moosanagar had been the worst-hit among slums abutting the river during the floods that occurred in October, when surplus flows from Himayatsagar were released into Musi. Flood water entered homes, and close to 200 dwellings were damaged in the event. Slums such as Moosanagar and Shankar Nagar had come up in the river bed, which put them in danger of inundation when water reached maximum level. On Sunday, attempts were seen in broad daylight to fill the river further from Moosanagar, with debris being dumped on the wrong side of the posts installed by authorities to indicate the inviolable river bed. Notably, a truck used for the breach bore a sticker indicating that the vehicle was on duty for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). Efforts to contact the chief of the GHMC Transport wing Viswajit Kampati for his version in this regard did not yield any result. He did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/caution-to-the-wind-attempts-to-fill-up-musi-in-full-swing/article33381007.ece

21 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCCL told to plan for better use of land degraded by mining activity||Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) has been directed by an expert appraisal committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to develop a robust mine closure plan to ensure better land use post-mining for the communities around through reclamation and reshaping of the land degraded by mining activities, with regard to an existing opencast mine. It is one of the specific conditions stipulated by the panel while issuing the terms of reference (ToR) for the appraisal of a cluster of opencast-cum-underground mines — Godavarikhani (GDK) No.1 & 3 (incline), 2 & 2a and 5 — in an area of 1,927 hectares near Jangaon and Vithalnagar villages of Ramagundam mandal of Peddapalli district with an extractable coal reserves of 63.5 million tonnes. While examining the proposal, the panel observed: “The present opencast mine and its closure plan has a severe environmental footprint, leaving behind large quantity of overburden dumps in the vicinities of thickly populated habitations. Therefore, it requires a revision of mine and mine closure plan to reduce the environmental footprint due to mining”. The panel was of the view that the project proponent, SCCL, must take a holistic and more scientific approach towards mine planning considering the adjoining opencast mining operation, selection of equipment systems for production of coal and overburden removal, including an option of merging the proposed opencast mine with the adjoining opencast mining operations, so that the requirement of external overburden dumps could be minimised. Public consultation Further, the panel has also stipulated conduct of public consultation about the present coal mining operations inviting comments and their redressal, preparation of time-bound action plan for railway siding from the mining pit to dispatch point, cumulative impact assessment with respect to existing mines, preparation of sequence of mining operations so that there is not requirement of second external overburden dump among others. According to the officials of SCCL, the cluster of mines proposed with a peak production capacity of 5.134 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), which includes 4 MTPA in opencast and 1.134 MTPA in underground, has coal linkage for super thermal power station of NTPC near Ramagundam. The cluster has G8 grade quality of coal and the cost of the project is Rs. 471 crore. As the coal from the proposed opencast mine, as part of the cluster, would be dispatched by trucks to Ramagundam-I coal handling plant (CHP) and Ramagundam OC-III CHP for further transportation by rail to the power plant, the MoEF panel wanted SCCL to study its impact. Further it wanted a study of the impact of blasting on nearby habitations along with mitigation measures and impact of diversion of two streams flowing through the project area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-tells-sccl-to-draw-plans-for-better-use-of-degraded-land/article33381029.ece

The girl belonging to a poor agricultural family went missing from her home while her mother was away from the village on Friday. Her sudden disappearance coincided with an alleged excavation bid by a local resident, who happens to be a relative of the girl, at his house in their neighbourhood for “hidden treasure” at the behest of a “tantrik,” sources said. Some villagers suspected something fishy and alerted the local police about what they called “strange late night rituals” at the house of local resident G Narasimha Rao in the neighbourhood at the behest of a self-styled "tantrik" under the influence of irrational belief. ‘Unearthing coal’ When the Yerrupalem police inquired into the incident, the house owner reportedly told them that he had dug up the nearly fifteen-foot-deep pit inside his house to unearth coal, the natural resource. Apparently unconvinced over his statement, the police launched a detailed investigation into the incident by examining the call data records of the house owner to determine the facts, sources said. The local police, on the other hand, ramped up efforts to trace the missing minor girl based on the complaint lodged by the latter's mother. "We are trying to find some clues and probing the case from all possible dimensions to locate and rescue the missing girl," said a policeman associated with the investigation into the girl missing case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mystery-shrouds-girls-disappearance/article33381039.ece

21 December 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Administration to speed up NIMZ land acquisition||With instructions from the higher authorities, the district administration has speeded up work for land acquisition for National Investment and Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ) that is coming up at Zaheerabad, bordering Karnataka. The NIMZ is to come up on 12,625 acres - spread in Nyalakal and Jarasangam mandals. The facility was sanctioned for the State as part of bifurcation of united Andhra Pradesh, and the land acquisition commenced in 2015. It was decided that in the first phase about 35,000 acres needs to be acquired, while the government has already acquired 2,964 acres, and the remaining is to be acquired shortly. Collector M. Hanumantha Rao had already held two review meetings in this regard and issued directions to the officials concerned. It was stated that notifications were issued for five villages, and residents of two villages have raised objections over the land acquisition. Though Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had requested the Union government to sanction Rs. 500 crore from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) for the development of internal road and other infrastructure at NIMZ, the Centre has clarified that the commitment from DPIIT is only to the extent of Rs. 3 crore for funding the cost of master plan. “Revising of land rates are mandatory before any land acquisition, and the government has issued notifications without revision of land rates. This is not acceptable for us. Secondly, environmental clearance was not taken for the NIMZ so far,” said B. Ramachander, president, NIMZ Bhubadhitula Porata Committee. “Why not this project at Narayanakhed, where lands are barren, instead of Zaheerabad?” asked Ganapathi Deekshitulu, a land owner of Hadnoor village in Nyalkal mandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/administration-to-speed-up-nimz-land-acquisition/article33381036.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao seemed to be dot on when he announced a few days ago that about 50,000 plus vacancies are likely to arise when a headcount of existing staff strength in government service was made After Mr. Rao asked officials to ferret out information about vacancy position in all departments, the General Administration and Finance officials met the secretaries and HODs of almost all departments in the last three days and arrived at a figure of 40,000. The number could touch 50,000 plus when an exhaustive list is prepared. It was said the Police Department with 19,400 vacancies topped the list so far followed by teachers - 5,000, Revenue - 4,500, Health - 3,500 and Power - 3,000. A clearer picture would emerge when Mr. Rao peruses the report in a week or ten days and hopefully announces issue of job notification.      When many ruling party and opposition legislators and Members of Parliament from Telangana have restricted their protest to the three farm laws enacted by the Union government a few months back to statements, TRS legislator from Gadwal, Bandla Krishnamohan Reddy, has chosen a unique way to register his opposition to the farm laws. Mr. Krishnamohan Reddy has been visiting villages in his constituency for over a week now collecting rice, a fist-full each from every household, from people. The legislator stated that he would send the rice collected in his constituency to farmers protesting outside Delhi against the new Acts for over three weeks now, as they have been getting voluntary supplies mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.    The State government has announced its decision to revert to registrations through the CARD (Computer-aided Administration of Revenue Department) at least for the time being. The development follows the technical and legal issues that cropped up in the implementation of online processes through Dharani portal and registrations will be undertaken through the old process from Monday. The release issued by the Chief Secretary’s office mentioned in detail about the sequence of events since the launch of slot booking for registrations on Dec. 11 till the decision to revert to the previous systems. But it failed to give clarity on whether or not the discretionary powers at various levels that brought bad reputation to the old system will continue.      The State government has no doubt succeeded in supplying clean and safe drinking water through its flagship programme, Mission Bhagiratha, to majority of households. And, the officials concerned are leaving no stone unturned to promote the success story. In the process, officials associated with the project are stressing on the use of Mission Bhagiratha water at all the official meetings so as to send a strong message to people, and bottles with the MB label have also been launched. But, doubts are being raised on the effectiveness of the campaign as these bottles are seldom seen in the pictures of the official meetings released to the media which show bottles of the branded packaged drinking water on the tables of the officials.

21 December 2020||Mumbai,||Parliament session cancelled to avoid debate on farmers’ protest, says Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday claimed that the winter session of Parliament was cancelled to avoid a debate on the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws. In his weekly column Rokhthok in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana , Mr. Raut also questioned the need for spending “Rs. 1,000 crore” on the Central Vista project when the Narendra Modi government was not interested in holding debates and Parliament session. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders since November 26 against the Centre’s new agricultural laws. They have been demanding a repeal of the legislations. “The winter session of Parliament has been cancelled so that there can be no debate on the ongoing farmers’ protest near Delhi,” Mr. Raut said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 10 laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building and described the event as a “milestone in India’s democratic history”. The revamp envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. Criticising the Centre over it, Mr. Raut said the existing Parliament building was fine and could have functioned well for another 50 to 75 years. “Nobody thinks that destroying the legacy and memories of earlier leaders and building new structures to build your own image was too much democracy,” Mr. Raut said. The Supreme Court on December 7 allowed the Centre to go ahead with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decided the pending pleas on the issue. Mr. Raut also said that former U.K. prime minister Winston Churchill worked to defeat his political rivals with all his might, but always treated his defeated opponents with dignity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/parliament-session-cancelled-to-avoid-debate-on-farmers-protest-says-raut/article33381105.ece

Talking to reporters after visiting Vaidya’s home, Mr. Bhagwat said, “M.G. Vaidya had saved and lived the ideology of the Sangh. He was an encyclopedia of the RSS, and there is a void created by his death. We feel we have lost a guardian.” “We used to take advice from him. Now, there is a dilemma whom to approach for advice. He has given us an example on how to live life. His absence will be felt,” the RSS chief said. A meeting will be held at Dr. Hedgewar Smruti Mandir at Reshimbagh here on December 31 to pay tributes to Vaidya. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari visited Vaidya’s residence on Saturday night to pay tributes to him.

A prolific writer, Shri Vaidya will always be remembered for his invaluable contribution towards nation building,” he tweeted. “May God give strength to his family in this hour of grief,” the BJP leader said in another tweet. Vaidya, the former chief editor of the city-based pro-RSS Marathi daily Tarun Bharat , became a member of the RSS in 1943 while at Morris College in Nagpur.

The agency recently filed charge sheets against Mirchi’s wife Hajra Memon and their two sons, Asif and Junaid, for alleged money laundering. The court took cognisance of the charges and issued the warrants. The three are currently said to be in the U.K., where the Indian enforcement agencies are already pursuing the extradition of businessmen Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, and defence dealer Sanjay Bhandari. The ED also moved an application seeking that the three family members of Mirchi be declared wanted under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act., as they had failed to join the probe despite several summons. A request to confiscate 15 properties worth Rs. 96 crore, and Rs. 1.9 crore in six bank accounts under the Act has also been made. Taking note of the plea, the court issued notices seeking their presence till February 16. Under the PMLA, the agency has so far attached properties worth Rs. 978 crore in India and overseas. Based on its findings, the competent authority has also forfeited three Mumbai buildings worth Rs. 500 crore under the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act. Five accused have so far been arrested in the case and chargesheets filed against them. The other overseas properties linked to Mirchi, including in the U.K., are also being identified and evaluated for attachment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ed-prepares-to-move-extradition-request-for-mirchis-wife-sons/article33381100.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Will hold padayatras over Rs. 2,500 cr. scam tomorrow: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday announced that it will be conducting ‘padayatras’ in all the 272 wards in Delhi on Tuesday to inform people about the alleged Rs. 2,500 crore scam in the BJP-ruled civic bodies of Delhi. The party hopes to turn the demand for a CBI inquiry into the alleged scam into a mass movement and expose the way in which the party has been running the civic bodies. Senior AAP leader and municipal corporation in-charge Durgesh Pathak questioned as to why the BJP was scared of a CBI investigation into the “scam”, if they know that there has been no scam at all. He added that the amount of Rs. 2,500 crore belonged to the people of Delhi and is a loss to the public exchequer. He added that the scam came to light when the North, South, and East civic bodies released their budgets. Last week, the Delhi Assembly also passed a resolution demanding a CBI probe into the alleged scam. “AAP will turn this case of Rs. 2,500 crore misappropriation into a mass movement. On December 22, AAP will take out ‘padayatra’ and visit all the 272 wards in Delhi. Our volunteers will meet and communicate with the people in those wards and will enlighten them about this scam,” Mr. Pathak said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/will-hold-padayatras-over-rs-2500-cr-scam-tomorrow-aap/article33380911.ece

The cumulative recoveries now stand at 17,83,905 while the State’s recovery rate has declined incrementally to 94.08%. “Of a total 1,21,19,196 laboratory samples tested thus far, 18,96,518 (case positivity rate of 15.65%) have returned positive with nearly 60,000 samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said, adding that the case fatality stood at 2.57%. Pune district reported more than 600 new cases to take its total case tally to 3,66,957 while seven deaths saw its toll reach 7,682. As per the district administration figures, the active cases stand at 8,782 while its recovery rate is 95.11%. Mumbai city reported 586 new cases to take its total tally to 2,86,850 of whom only 7,996 are active. As many as 16 fatalities saw the city’s death toll — following due reconciliation process — touch 10,996. Nagpur district in Vidarbha recorded nearly 450 new cases, taking the district’s total tally to 1,21,547 of whom 4,471 are active. Three deaths took the toll to 3,135. In contrast, western Maharashtra registered far lower cases and fatalities: Satara reported five deaths as its fatality toll following reconciliation dipped marginally to 1,736 while 67 fresh cases saw the total number of cases rise to 53,874 of whom 1,122 are active. Neighbouring Sangli added just 24 cases and two deaths as the district’s reported cases reached 49,905 of whom only 306 are active. Its death toll stands at 1,759. Kolhapur logged a mere 14 cases and no deaths as its total case tally touched 48,998 of whom 802 are active. The death count remains at 1,656. In north Maharashtra, Nashik district reported more than 300 cases and three deaths as its total tally climbed to 1,12,451 of whom 2,766 are active. Its death toll stands at 1,833. Jalgaon recorded only 31 new cases and a single death as its total infections touched 55,528 of whom only 522 are active, while its death toll went up to 1,434. Dr. Awate said that currently, 5,02,362 people across the State were in home quarantine and 3,730 were in institutional quarantine facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cases-surpass-recoveries-in-maharashtra/article33381109.ece
21 December 2020||Thane,||Multi-crore fraud: bail plea of Goodwin owners rejected||A court has rejected the bail application of two owners of Goodwin Jewellers, arrested in connection with a multi-crore cheating case involving thousands of investors. District and Sessions Judge (special cases) R.V. Tamhanekar in his order on Saturday said the accused, A.M. Sudheerkumar and A.M. Sunilkumar, both brothers and owners of the fraud-hit jewellery chain originally hailing from Kerala, did not deserve bail at this stage. Hence, their application was being rejected, he said. The duo surrendered to a Thane court on December 14, 2019. They were subsequently arrested by the city police’s Economic Offences Wing which is probing the cheating case. The jewellery firm had shut its outlets in Thane, Palghar, Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra a couple of days before Deepavali last year, leaving hundreds of people, who invested in its gold and fixed deposit schemes, in the lurch. The two accused were booked under various Sections, including 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and also provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishments (MPID) Act and the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act. The judge in his order said, “After perusal of the say filed by the investigating officer, it is clear that totally 11 crimes have been registered against the accused under the MPID Act and the defrauded amount is Rs. 1,76,96,83,413.” The accused are also booked under provisions of the IPC and the amount of cheating is Rs. 13,61,78,787, he said. So, when such kind of huge amount is involved, unless the interest of all investors is secured, the accused persons cannot be released on bail, the judge said. Earlier, additional public prosecutor Vivek Kadu said the amount and investors whom the duo cheated was very large. Hence, they should not be released on bail, he told the court. It is alleged that the accused persons accepted crores of rupees in cash and by way of cheques from various investors and transferred the amount in 14 accounts of different banks in the name of Goodwin Jewellers. The accused allegedly failed to return the amount or gold of investors and thereby, cheated them, according to the prosecution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/multi-crore-fraud-bail-plea-of-goodwin-owners-rejected/article33381103.ece

21 December 2020||WILMINGTON,||Biden introduces his climate team, says no time to waste||Just as the United States has needed a unified, national response to COVID-19, it needs one for dealing with climate change, President-elect Joe Biden said on Saturday as he rolled out key members of his environmental team. “We literally have no time to waste,” Mr. Biden told reporters as introduced his choices. The approach is a shift from Donald Trump’s presidency, which has been marked by efforts to boost oil and gas production while rolling back government efforts intended to safeguard the environment. The incoming Biden team will try to undo or block many of the current administration’s initiatives. There also will be an emphasis on looking out for the low-income, working class and minority communities hit hardest by fossil fuel pollution and climate change. In his remarks, Mr. Biden stressed the diversity of an emerging team that he described as “brilliant, qualified, tested and they are barrier-busting.” “Already there are more people of color in our Cabinet than any Cabinet ever, more women than ever,” said the former Vice-President, who has promised to assemble a group of department leaders who reflect the diversity of America. Compelling stories The nominees Mr. Biden introduced had compelling personal stories that they cited as guiding them if confirmed by the Senate. New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland would be the first Native American to lead the Interior Department, which has wielded influence over the nation’s tribes for generations. She said her life has not been easy. She struggled with homelessness and relied on food stamps at one point. “This moment is profound when we consider the fact that a former secretary of the Interior once proclaimed his goal, was to quote, ‘civilise or exterminate’ us,” Ms. Haaland said. “I’m a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology.” Ms. Haaland was referring to Alexander H.H. Stuart, who said that in 1851. Former two-term Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm is in line to be Energy Secretary. She described arriving in the U.S. at age 4 and brought from Canada by a family “seeking opportunity.” She said her father found work as a bank teller and retired as head of the bank. “It’s because of my family’s journey and my experience in fighting for hardworking Michigan families that I have become obsessed, obsessed with gaining good-paying jobs in America in a global economy,” Ms. Granholm said. Clean industries North Carolina official Michael Regan would be the first African American man to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Regan, the state environmental head since 2017, has made a name for himself by pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping the low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution. Mr. Regan said he grew up in North Carolina hunting and fishing with his father and grandfather and that he has great respect for the outdoors and the country’s natural resources, but he also had a respiratory condition that required him to use an inhaler. Mr. Biden’s nominee to oversee the Council on Environmental Quality is Brenda Mallory. Two other members of the team introduced Saturday do not need Senate confirmation. They are Gina McCarthy, to serve as national climate adviser, and Ali Zaidi, to serve as her deputy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-introduces-his-climate-team-says-no-time-to-waste/article33380652.ece
21 December 2020||London,||New virus strain out of control: U.K.||British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday that the government has imposed a strict Christmas lockdown in London and southeast England because a new strain of the coronavirus was “out of control”. The World Health Organization is calling on its members in Europe to step up measures against COVID-19. Outside Britain, nine cases of the new strain have been reported in Denmark, as well as one case in the Netherlands and another in Australia, according to the WHO. “Across Europe, where transmission is intense and widespread, countries need to redouble their control and prevention approaches,” a spokeswoman for WHO Europe said. Mr. Hancock warned that the strict measures that affect almost a third of England’s population could stay in place until the virus vaccine is fully rolled out. “Unfortunately the new strain was out of control. We have got to get it under control,” he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that millions must cancel Christmas plans and stay home because the new strain was spreading far more quickly. Around 16.4 million people entered the strictest “tier four” measures from Sunday, or 31% of the population. They are not allowed to hold family gatherings for Christmas, while in the rest of the country households are allowed to mix on Christmas Day alone. London’s Metropolitan Police said that it would take action against those who “make reckless decisions that risk lives.” Other U.K. regions have also tightened their anti-virus measures in response. Wales introduced a strict lockdown from Sunday, while Scotland has banned travel to and from other U.K. regions for Christmas. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland will enter fresh lockdowns on December 26. Mr. Hancock told Sky News that the situation was “deadly serious.” “It’s going to be very difficult to keep it under control until we have the vaccine rolled out,” he said, adding: “This is what we face over the next couple of months.” The U.K. hopes to reach a figure of half a million vaccinations over the weekend, he said. Scientists first discovered the new variant in a patient in September, Susan Hopkins of Public Health England said. She said that scientists in November found the new strain was behind a cluster of cases in Kent and spreading into London and Essex and informed the government on December 11. 70% more potent Public Health England then again notified the government on Friday when modelling revealed the full seriousness of the new strain, she said. She confirmed the figure given by Mr. Johnson that the new virus strain could be 70% more transmissible while saying this was an initial figure. “I think 70% looks like a good number to land on at the moment,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/new-virus-strain-out-of-control-uk/article33380654.ece
21 December 2020||Kano,||Over 340 students in Nigeria back with parents after ordeal||Nigeria’s freed schoolboys have reunited with their joyful parents after being held captive for nearly a week by gunmen allied with jihadist rebels in the country’s northwest. Relieved parents hugged their sons tightly on Saturday in Kankara, where more than 340 boys were abducted from the Government Science Secondary school on the night of December 11. Many of the schoolboys expressed worry about returning to school, saying their captors threatened them with death if they went back to classes. Nigeria’s Boko Haram jihadist rebels claimed responsibility for the abductions, saying they attacked the school because they believe Western education is un-Islamic. Another abduction of more than 80 students happened on Saturday night in an area nearby, but the pupils were quickly rescued by security forces after a fierce gun battle, police announced on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/dozens-of-students-freed-after-abduction-in-nigeria/article33380656.ece

The four suspects, aged 17 to 21, were in contact with the attacker, said a source. They are suspected of being aware of the attacker’s plot and inciting him to carry it out, according to another judicial source close to the investigation. Three of them were charged on Friday with taking part in a terrorist conspiracy and placed in pre-trial detention. The fourth had already been charged on Wednesday. “They share his ideology and one of them expressed his hatred of France a few days before the action,” said a source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/4-charged-over-attack-on-charlie-hebdo-offices/article33380660.ece

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Nepal set to face fresh election||Indicating fast-paced political changes, the rival faction of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by Mr. Prachanda and former Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal formed a joint platform to protest against Mr. Oli’s move, alongside the Janata Samajvadi Party of former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai and the Nepali Congress. The dissolution of Parliament prompted a meeting of the pro-Prachanda faction in the Standing Committee of the NCP. The group decided to take disciplinary action against Mr. Oli. Both the factions are expected to meet on Monday. In the meanwhile, at least three writ petitions were filed in the Supreme Court of Nepal on Sunday. Sources in the NCP said the party is expecting more such petitions to be filed on Monday. Mr. Oli’s government, in recent weeks, was unable to pass politically sensitive decisions due to the opposition in the Standing Committee, where Mr. Prachanda’s faction is in majority. The tension between the two factions has been growing since May, with Mr. Prachanda repeatedly accusing Mr. Oli of not consulting the party’s organs for key decisions. Both sides came together to claim the Kalapani region of India and helped in the passing of a new political map of Nepal. However, bickering began soon after Parliament passed the new map on June 13. It is well known that Mr. Prachanda had been unhappy about the appointment of key Ambassadors and Cabinet Ministers without adequate consultation with the Standing Committee. The situation worsened this month as Mr. Oli failed to get ordinances passed through the party’s higher organs because of the opposition from the Prachanda faction. The move to dissolve Parliament has drawn strong criticism both from the Opposition and the members of the ruling coalition. “The decision is unconstitutional as there is no provision in our 2015 Constitution to dissolve Parliament that is functioning perfectly well. The problem was inside the Nepal Communist Party and the Prime Minister cannot attack Parliament for his inability to deal with intra-party dissidents,” said Rajendra Mahto of the Janata Samajvadi Party. He added that Nepal faces an uncertain future due to the decision. “The decision amounts to a coup.” Former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai said: “Prime Minister Oli’s recommendation is extremely unfortunate and a blot in Nepal’s politics.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nepal-set-to-face-fresh-election/article33380688.ece

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Laying the foundation for faster growth||The year that is shortly coming to an end has been an extraordinary one. In recent memory this is the first economic crisis that has been triggered by a non-economic factor. It is a pandemic, a novel coronavirus pandemic, which has literally brought the economy to a halt. The actions that have to be taken to prevent the spread of the virus such as the lockdown have impacted the economy severely. As the restrictions were slowly withdrawn, the economy has also started looking up. This can be seen very clearly from the performance of the Indian economy in Q1 and Q2 of 2020-21. In Q1, the economy declined by 23.9%; it declined by 7.5% in Q2, when the relaxations were eased. At the dawn of the New Year 2021, several questions rise in our mind. How bad was the performance of the Indian economy in 2020-21? What are the prospects for 2021-22? What should the stance of monetary policy be in the coming months? What should the Budget to be presented by the central government in February 2021 focus on? Will the global environment for trade and investment improve and help India? What should be the medium-term focus including the role of reforms be? Performance in 2020-21 We now know the GDP numbers for the first half of 2020-21. Reductions in the first half of GDP at 2011-12 prices in 2020-21 as compared to the first half of 2019-20 is Rs. 11,15,879 crore which is 7.66% of the 2019-20 GDP. If the Indian economy at least maintains the second half GDP in 2020-21 at the level of the previous year, the full year contraction can be limited to about 7.7%. Our estimate (by D.K. Srivastava and I) is that if there is an increase in GDP at least in Q4 if not in Q3, the overall contraction in 2020-21 can be be limited to the range of 6% to 7%. This of course would require a substantial pick up in government expenditure. There are many indicators such as collection of Goods and Services Tax (GST), improved output of coal, steel and cement and positive growth in manufacturing in October 2020 which point to better performance of the private sector. Of course, some segments of the economy such as the hospitality sector will take time to recover. Thus on the whole, it looks that the setback to the economy can be limited to minus 6% to minus 7%. Of course, this is a substantial improvement over the forecasts of some agencies such as the International Monetary Fund which had estimated the economy to decline by 10.3%.  What to expect in 2021-22 It is important to remember that if only if the Indian economy grows at 8% in 2021-22 will we be compensating for the decline in 2020-21. Thus, even with a strong growth of 8%, we will only be back to where the economy was at the end of 2019-20. The two years taken together cancel each other. Thus, it is imperative that the Indian economy grows at a minimum of 8% in 2021-22. This should be possible if by that time restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 are withdrawn and the nation goes back to a normal state. Some sectors can act as lead sectors or engines of growth. This is where increased government capital expenditures become relevant. The private sector seems to be revising its future prospects and many new issues in the capital market have met with good response. The global environment for trade and growth is an uncertain factor. Many developed countries are still struggling to find answers to COVID-19. Though vaccines may ultimately provide a solution, this may take time. The attitude to trade must also change. Closing borders may appear to be a good short-term policy to promote growth. But actually it kills growth all around. A strong surge in our exports will greatly facilitate growth, i.e. 2021-22. However, much of Indian’s growth must rest on domestic factors. Growth must not only be consumption driven but also investment driven. It is the latter which in a developing economy can sustain growth over a long period. Monetary policy The stance of monetary policy in 2020-21 has been extremely accommodative. The circumstances warranted it. Three major elements in the policy are: a reduction in interest rate through changes in policy rate; providing liquidity through various measures, and regulatory changes such as moratorium. There has been a substantial injection of liquidity into the system. According to the recent monetary policy statement, reserve money increased by 15.3% as of end November 2020. Money supply however grew by 12.5% because some of the injection of liquidity ended up in excess reserve. With a large injection of liquidity, one should expect inflation to remain high. In the final analysis, inflation is determined by overall liquidity or money supply in the system in conjunction with the availability of goods and services. While there may be sufficient justification for an accommodative monetary policy in a difficult year such as 2020, there will be need to exercise more caution as we move into the next year. Fiscal initiatives Government expenditures play a key role in a situation such as the one we are facing. The performance of the sector “Public Administration, Defence, and other services” which is subject to policy intervention is disappointing. In the second quarter of 2020-21, there was a contraction of this sector by 12.2%. The stimulus policies involving higher government expenditures were expected to arrest the contractionary momentum. On certain assumptions, we had earlier projected that the fiscal deficit of the Centre in 2020-21 would be 8% of GDP. With the slower momentum in government expenditures, perhaps the fiscal deficit of the Centre may be only 6% of GDP in 2020-21. As indicated earlier, government expenditures should be speeded up from now on so that the contraction in the current fiscal year as a whole can be reduced. In 2021-22, government revenues should pick up with the rise in GDP. The process of bringing down the fiscal deficit must also start. This will still leave the government sufficient space for maintaining the expenditure at a reasonably high level. What is required is a sharp increase in government capital expenditures which can act as a stimulus for growth. A detailed investment plan of the government and public sector enterprises must be drawn up and presented as part of the coming Budget. Growth and investment Even as we combat the effects of COVID-19, we must lay the foundation for faster economic growth. A sad fact is that over the past decade, the investment rate has been falling. In 2018-19, the rate fell to 32.2% of GDP from 38.9% in 2011-12. Some of the recent measures including corporate tax rate changes may help in augmenting investment. A strong effort must be made to improve the investment climate. The National Infrastructure Pipeline is a good initiative. But the government must come forward to invest more on its own. We must also remind ourselves that the climate for investment is also influenced by non-economic factors of which social cohesion is most important. Reforms are important in the context of rapid development. Recent controversies over reforms have shown that timing, sequencing and consensus building are equally important. Labour reforms, for example, are best introduced when the economy is on the upswing. Many have cherished the idea of India reaching the status of a $5 trillion economy by 2025. But increasingly the idea is becoming a more distant goal. The Indian economy in 2019 was at around $2.7 trillion. To achieve the level of $5 trillion, we need to grow continuously at 9% for six years from now. That is the challenge before the economy. Jobs and employment will come from growth. They are not independent of growth. Will policymakers eschew other considerations and focus only on growth? C. Rangarajan is a former Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and a former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/laying-the-foundation-for-faster-growth/article33380638.ece
21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Losing the plot on women’s safety||Most governments, when faced with the question of improving women’s safety, inevitably turn to enacting new laws rather than ensuring a more effective legal system. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra seems no different, however well-meaning it may be. The Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the accompanying Special Courts and Machinery for Implementation of Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law follow the same cliché of harsher punishment, more authorities, and wider definitions. The Bills’ content reflects the absence of a larger consultative process and lack of understanding of existing criminal laws. For any criminal justice system to be effective, fair and just laws, a robust investigative mechanism, a dynamic judiciary and adequate infrastructure are indispensable. The criminal law amendments post the Nirbhaya case and the recommendations of the Verma Committee brought in several progressive amendments to curb violence against women and children. What is currently lacking is the infrastructure required for effective implementation. The Maharashtra government should hence focus on improving infrastructure, rather than bringing in harsher and unreasonable provisions in the guise of securing women’s safety. Contrary to the government’s stated intention of curbing violence against women, the Bills are draconian and threaten the lives of sexual assault victims.  Patriarchal ideas The Bill proposes punishment in cases of false complaints and acts of providing false information regarding sexual and other offences against women with the intention to humiliate, extort and defame. The only other law which has a similar provision is the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal Act), 2013. The provision only points to the patriarchal conception that women are manipulative liars and unworthy of being trusted. Even as most laws are indeed susceptible to misuse by individuals and authorities, no other legislation has such a provision. Offences against women often occur behind closed doors or at desolate places, making finding eyewitnesses difficult. Investigation and prosecution are often shabby and negligent. This results in unfair acquittals, and the victims, in turn, may be accused of having filed false complaints. A provision for punishing false complaints would result in counter cases being filed against victims, and may thus dissuade many victims of sexual assault and acid attacks from filing complaints, thereby muffling women’s voices. In a country where courts have directed women to marry their abuser, the possibility of a counter case would only make it more difficult for a woman to say ‘No’ to such a proposition. The other aspect of the Bill is the introduction of the death penalty for rape, acid attacks, and for rape of a minor. The amendment to the relevant sections adds that in cases where “the characteristic of the offence is heinous in nature and where adequate conclusive evidence is there and the circumstances warrant exemplary punishment”, the offence shall be punishable with death. However, it does not define what cases would qualify as being “heinous in nature”, thus leaving it open to the interpretation of courts. To date, courts have held cases of varying standards to be “heinous” and there is no uniform benchmark to identify what circumstances make an offence “heinous”. Further, the death penalty has been in the statute books for a long time, but there is no evidence affirming its potency as a deterrent in preventing crimes. It is time legislators realise that death penalty is not the absolute answer to the issue of rape — only the certainty that there will be effective investigation, trial, and therefore punishment, can act as an effective deterrent. Contrary to the State’s understanding, the death penalty will only mean that an accused may not stop at just rape and may murder the victim to get rid of the only witness, as the punishment for both will be the same. Importantly, studies have shown that often, the accused in sexual assault crimes are relatives or persons known to the victims. If the punishment for the crime is death, then not only the family of the victim, but the victim herself may choose not to report the crime or may turn hostile during the trial. Research has also indicated that judges are unlikely to convict a person when the punishment is death. Another provision stipulating that investigation should be completed within 15 days, the trial in 30 days and the appeal in 45 days, even if well-intentioned, will only result in improper investigation and trial. This timeline is glaringly insufficient for gathering all evidence or conducting a just trial and would result in hasty functioning and miscarriage of justice. Similar existing mechanisms for speedy and effective investigation and trial under the Juvenile Justice Act and the POCSO Act are rarely adhered to as neither the police nor the courts have the infrastructure to comply with these timeframes. Further, the Bill does not state what happens if the investigation, trial, or appeal is not completed within the prescribed time. In the current system, police officers are saddled with a large number of cases at the same time. There are not enough prosecutors at trial courts and in high courts; most of them are assigned three-four courts at a time and they prosecute hundreds of cases simultaneously. Unless these systemic problems are solved, new laws will only be a facade. Redundant proposals Lastly, the proposed amendments seem to have been recommended without considering similar, already-existing provisions in the criminal laws. For instance, the Bill seeks to introduce Section 354E (Harassment of Women by any mode of communication) into the IPC, aiming to punish intimidation of women through social media and electronic platforms. Similar provisions exist under the IPC and the Information Technology Act, 2000, which comprehensively cover all the offences mentioned under the new section. Similarly, the provision to punish public servants for failing to assist in investigation or perform their assigned duties is also sufficiently covered under the IPC, in terms of contravention of law or disobedience of orders and duties. Hence, in effect, these proposed amendments are of little significance. It would be more pragmatic if the government focused on improving the implementation of existing laws and infrastructure. The Bill was opposed by several women’s rights organisations and lawyers from Maharashtra, which seems to have led the State government to refer it to a joint select committee. This is a welcome move and it would be in the interest of women, and justice itself, if the committee has a larger consultative process, engages with stakeholders and experts to understand the existing criminal laws, and reconsiders passing this regressive legislation.

It is 70% private and 30% public in a country where 80% people do not have any protection for health and the out-of-pocket expense is as high as 62%. With public spending at 1.13% of GDP and a huge shortage of health-care workers particularly nurses and midwives, policy moves and plans appear like a sound in emptiness. The novel coronavirus pandemic has revealed the mismatch between the overwhelming presence of the not so well-to-do and private health care with its revenue modelling that borders more on greed and rent gouging. The system now Whenever the market leaves out the majority or has an incentive to cream off, the public sector would have to step in for the allocation and production of health services. The fact is 85% of the population cannot afford high cost, corporate private health care. Where demand is created by the latter by homogenising all submarkets such as preventive, general, specialists, emergency and remedial services — where inducement is the norm — the exploitation of the unsuspecting is inevitable . While too little is being done too slowly to have any impact, private hospitals gain under the social insurance scheme in the interregnum.. Even with avowedly 12 crore card holders under Ayushman Bharat, only 1.27 crore people have taken advantage of the scheme. Private sector health care is driven by return on capital. What makes insurance and private health care an egregious combination is that the insurance backup incentivises hospitals to expand the bill but the patients do not get attended to in their best interests. The agents of the government, on the other hand, have an incentive for driving down the price of procedures; as a result, hospitals selectively offer some services and procedures (while denying some). But the ceiling level of the insurance gets claimed regardless in the interest of the hospital. When the government adjudicates the claim without having the capacity to do so under a trust model, the system will unravel sooner rather than later. Under Obamacare, in the United States, where professionals with expertise in health-care cost carried out the scrutiny of unnecessary procedures and interventions, problems were encountered often despite inherent superiority in the match up. Social insurance has solved the pooling equilibrium problem when the majority has an affordability problem. While the issue of asymmetric information gets ironed out, the inefficient behaviour which is associated with moral hazard still remains. The doctor and patient are not constrained by the ability to pay and while the marginal private cost is zero, the social cost can be high. Consumption is high for those health-care services which are often inefficient because of supplier-induced demand created and provided by doctors and hospitals which have superior knowledge, compared to patients. They encourage patients to demand tests and interventions, though the improved quality of care and outcomes are uncertain. Health economics This pervasive demand inducement has an impact in terms of increases in health expenditure. This results in an upward bias in insurance premium which in turn creates a fiscal externality in the long term. In health economics, where competitive equilibrium often does not exist, the behaviour of a private corporate hospital is skewed in favour of profitability. Any attempt to cover the non-poor and the rich will result in advantageous selection for those better-off crowding out the poor. In any case, insurance of secondary and tertiary care pushes out long-term investment by the state and people and leads to the continued neglect of primary health care. Finally, a social insurance scheme of such type with our demographic profile only prospers at the cost of neglecting public hospitals. It is deeply erroneous and problematic. India’s health problem has a 80:20 rule; 20% of people can afford modern health care, 40% cannot afford it at all and the other 40%, the so-called non-poor, pay with difficulty. Nearly 70 million of the non-poor slide into poverty on a year-to-year basis. Because of the problem of access, affordability, absence of quality manpower and the rent-seeking behaviour of staff, more than 80% of people routinely reach Registered Medical Practitioners who are not trained to treat patients. But they routinely prescribe antibiotics and steroids for quick relief. The country could be sitting on a dormant volcano of antibiotic and steroid immunity. There are three options here. Ramp up the number of doctors with counterpart obligation to serve in rural areas. The result is uncertain with far greater career options in the private sector (with its better infrastructure which is required for job satisfaction). Second is to revive the Licentiate Medical Practitioner as we had before Independence in the rural areas. This requires starting it de novo with the attendant resistance. The third one is to empower graduates of BSc (Nursing) to be nursing practitioners — as prevalent in many countries. In any case, nurses have been able to deal with a large number of cases independently in government facilities in understaffed primary health centres (PHCs) where the doctor is either mostly absent or available for a few hours. From the gender perspective too, this is preferable from the angle of maternal and child health The neglect of primary care While the primacy of primary health care is emphasised by everyone, work on the ground does not bear it out. Admittedly, it is the critical piece of health care but government funding is disturbingly skewed against it. Primary health care should receive three times more allocation in the budget and doctor and paramedic strength should be doubled merely on the basis of population increase. If necessary, doctors can be given incentives in terms of extra salary and post graduate seat preference, but in parallel, given penalties for absenteeism for rural posting. Staff ratio But the most important thing is that States should be incentivised to carry out the appointments of health workers and doctors. It is not common knowledge yet that India’s public system has a shortage of nurses too. The ratio of 0.6 nurses per doctor while the World Health Organization specification is three nurses per doctor. In States such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other north Indian States where the percentage of nurses is abysmally low, the health outcome is understandably the poorest. PHCs should be well-staffed and well-provisioned through a reasonable fee which will cover at least part of the cost. Once the services become predictable, people will return to these health facilities. We lose sight of the wood because we have let trees come in the way and we are busy edifying them instead. Can we get real and work with the bigger picture of health care? Dr. Satya Mohanty is a former Secretary, Government of India.

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Values that govern advertising||I had promised in my earlier columns, “Queries, complaints and allegations” (November 2) and “Universal values and partisan interests” (November 16) that I will write about the advertising policy of this newspaper. A section of social media carried out a vicious campaign against this newspaper for the publication of a full-page advertisement on behalf of the People’s Republic of China, celebrating its National Day on October 1. Another section hauled the newspaper over the coals for carrying an advertisement on December 13 in the Delhi edition, from a trust seeking donations for building a temple at Ayodhya. Samina Yasmin, an academic from Jaipur, felt that the advertisement shook the secular foundations of the country. She objected to the title of the advertisement that read, “Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir: Re-establishment of national self-respect”. Her question was, “Is it in accordance with the editorial policy ofThe Hinduto carry an advertisement which states that building a temple at the site in Ayodhya, where Babri Masjid stood, will re-establish national self-respect?” Guiding principles Though my remit is to address editorial refractions if they happen, I decided to ask the management about this particular issue because there was an attempt to conflate the editorial policy of the newspaper with its business policy. Readers are familiar with the editorial policy of the newspaper, ‘Living our values’. But there is a similar value system that governs the business arm of the newspaper as well. The code of business values is also titled ‘Living our values’ and it has eight governing principles: honesty and integrity, respect, humility, excellence, consumer focus, transparency and fairness, neither favour nor discrimination, and finally, commitment to social good. If journalism is about maintaining a fair balance between what is in public interest and what the public is interested in, the ethical business practice for a news organisation in its pursuit of a sustainable revenue model is to refrain from interfering with editorial practices. The code of editorial values has an additional directive that clarifies the scope for each of the participating arms in the business of news. It reads, “There is no wall but there is a firm line between the business operations of the company and editorial operations and content. Pursuant to the above-mentioned values and objectives, it is necessary to create a professionalism in the editorial functioning independent of shareholder interference so as to maintain an impartiality, fairness, and objectivity in editorial and journalistic functioning.” A rational view The advertising team is guided by a triad: the laws governing the sector, the code adopted by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), and the in-house code of ‘Living our values’. It is important to understand the context for evaluating the two advertisements that have become contentious. First, let us examine the advertisement regarding the National Day celebrations of the People’s Republic of China on October 1. It was clearly marked as an advertisement. It was from a neighbouring nation-state, with whom India has excellent diplomatic relations. Both countries are represented by full-fledged ambassadors. There have been a number of summit-level interactions between the heads of the two governments over the last seven years. Can we use the Galwan Valley exchanges, where the Prime Minister himself is yet to name the aggressor, to deny advertising space to an embassy to celebrate its foundation day? China accounted for over 5% of India’s total exports in financial year 2019-20 and more than 14% of imports. According to Invest India, an agency under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India’s imports from China jumped 45 times since 2000 to reach over $70 billion in 2018-19. Is it ethical to be oblivious to these factors? I would have felt violated if the newspaper had carried an advertisement from the apartheid-era South Africa. In the case of the advertisement for the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra seeking donations for its proposed temple construction, we have to keep in mind that this trust was created by the Government of India based on a ruling by the Supreme Court. The newspaper’s views on the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi controversy as well as its reservation about the Supreme Court’s ruling have been well-documented in the editorial pages. In its deep commitment to the plural traditions of India, can a newspaper deny advertising space to a trust that came into being because of an apex court ruling? readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/values-that-govern-advertising/article33380648.ece
21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Beyond just persuasion||In light of protests against the new farm laws, the Centre has attempted to educate farmers — a form of instrumental reasoning based on exchange of superior information and data — to convince them of the merits of its reform agenda. Since it is presumed that complex matters of economic policy are beyond the intellectual capacities of agrarians, policy implementation often becomes a teacher-pupil dialogue, where persuasion is akin to enlightening ‘lesser intellectuals’ to the merits of technocratic governance. If people (in this case farmers) ‘know better’, they would support the government. However, persuasion is a qualitatively distinct psychological process from mere information-gathering and ‘rational’ decision-making. Most notably, in circumstances that involve vulnerability, it always includes an element of trust. But, do the farmers of India trust their government? This situation is vexed by the precarity of the agricultural sector. In 2019, as many as 10,281 farmer suicides were reported. Small and marginal farmers own only 47% of the total crop area. Farmers’ incomes are expected to rise “by about 9% to 16,017.96 rupees ($214) this year”, but there is still a high degree of financial precarity in the sector. Considering this, one can sympathise with the anxieties about disruptions in the Mandi system. Farmers recognise the exploitative nature of the existing supply-chains. But, how will they be persuaded that the alternative is better? Certainly not by signalling from the government, that mistakes information as a panacea for trust deficits. So, what needs to be done? Interpersonal dialogue is a good choice (something that is already being done). Trust is a ‘psychological attitude’ that reflects ‘a positive expectation of behavior’ and it can be built between individuals more easily than between groups. This also makes possible interactive problem-solving. But, for this to work, farmers would have to be convinced of the government’s sincerity. Negotiations should not be instruments to pacify protesters. This requires, firstly, public commitments by key government functionaries with high degrees of social credibility, to reassure farmers of their intent to make policymaking an inclusive process. Secondly, symbolic gestures such as visits by key government functionaries to grassroots areas may help. Shared vulnerability The most potent pathway for the government to build trust with farmers would be to develop what I call ‘shared vulnerability’. To accept risks associated with agricultural reforms, farmers would have to trust the government’s competence and willingness. This can be best achieved if farmers believe that the government’s self-interests are also being directly served through the success of these farm laws (this may seem tautological in a democratic society, but it is not, since politicians’ promises are frequently left unfulfilled). Simply put, the government needs to raise the stakes for itself. One way to do this would be to treat the promise of doubling farmers’ income as the determinant yardstick to judge the success of the NDA regime and actively invite electoral costs in case the government fails to deliver. Lastly, if specific quantitative markers or indicators are put in place to judge the success of the new farm laws at every stage, monitoring and feedback loops can become important sources of trust. This would require distinguishing clearly between deficiencies in implementation that lead to tweaks and course correction and a conclusive failure of the reform agenda requiring a dramatic overhaul or potential reversion (opt-out clause). Certainly, effects of policy reform cannot be realised in the short term, but neither should farmers be asked to concede to an indefinite process of realisation. Building trust for the purpose of persuasion is not about providing more information and creating rational disciples. It is a process of proving one’s sincerity, credibility, and moral character.

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||The right call||The Supreme Court on Friday quite rightly stayed an Andhra Pradesh High Court order that sought to convene a judicial inquiry into whether there is a “constitutional breakdown” in the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government in the State. The top court’s intervention must be welcomed as it quickly halted an untenable adventure by the High Court that might have required the imposition of President’s Rule. While hearing habeas corpus petitions filed by relatives of persons remanded in judicial custody or on bail, on October 1, the High Court had suo motu summoned the State counsel to assist in deciding “whether in circumstances prevailing in the State of Andhra Pradesh, the court can record a finding that there is constitutional breakdown in the State or not”. This was clearly a case of judicial over-reach by the A.P. High Court. The question of a “constitutional breakdown” or the failure of constitutional machinery is dealt with under Article 356 of the Constitution, whose invoking comes under the prerogative of the executive and not the judiciary. In the S.R. Bommai case, a nine-member Bench of the Supreme Court construed the scope of Article 356, which also allows the imposition of President’s Rule in the States, with stringent conditions for the valid exercise of that power by the President after being presented with a proclamation by the Union Council of Ministers. These included ascertaining whether objective conditions exist which render it impossible to carry out governance in the State where the proclamation has been made and the process has to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before consideration for judicial review. But the A.P. High Court’s order seemed to have reversed the scheme of things by putting the cart before the horse in asking to ascertain if there is a “constitutional breakdown in the State”. The Chief Justice of India noted that the Court found it to be “disturbing” before staying it. The Supreme Court’s order comes in the wake of incidents pointing to a tussle between the judiciary and the elected government in Andhra Pradesh. Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy had, in an unprecedented letter to the CJI, complained about the alleged hostile attitude of the High Court against him and his government besides making controversial allegations against a senior Supreme Court judge. This was even as the High Court ordered a CBI probe into what it termed was a social media campaign against the judges. The onus is now on the Supreme Court to put an end to the unseemly tussle between the judiciary and government in the State. Ordering an internal inquiry into the Chief Minister’s letter would be a good beginning. A clear nullification of the High Court order will also ensure that such legal adventures impinging upon the separation of powers in the State are not repeated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-right-call/article33380633.ece
21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Smouldering unrest||On Saturday, global personal technology major Apple placed all fresh production orders on hold for its Taiwanese supplier Wistron. This embargo may affect all Wistron units, but the trigger was one of the biggest expressions of industrial unrest in India in recent years — at a new facility set up by the firm in Kolar, Karnataka, to manufacture iPhones, among other things. Violence broke out at the unit on December 12 after several workers raised slogans protesting against non-payment of their dues, a protest that escalated. In Kolar, Wistron claimed Rs. 437 crore of damages from the incident even as the Centre and the State government reacted with alacrity, given the importance of the project for India to establish its credentials as an alternative manufacturing base to China. The State said it was disturbed and around 160 people were arrested. The Centre asked the B.S. Yediyurappa administration for an expeditious inquiry to identify the culprits and ensure that investor sentiment is not affected due to the ‘one-off incident’. The Prime Minister has been reported to be ‘very worried’ about the development, and all necessary support has been promised so that the firm may restart operations. That may take a while now given that Apple’s own probe has found glaring lapses in Wistron’s treatment of its staffers. From playing victim initially, Wistron has been compelled to change tack — it now claims the damages from the violence were about Rs. 50 crore and has fired a top official handling its India operations for failing to ensure employees got their entire dues in a timely manner. Perhaps, if designated officials for hearing labour grievances had reacted adequately when Wistron’s 1,300-odd regular staffers or its 8,000 odd contract workers at Kolar raised a red flag about wages, this may not have come to pass. If anything, enforcement of labour laws for employees’ benefit will make India an even more attractive and contrasting alternative to China where labour exploitation is rife. With global firms under pressure to exhibit higher standards in environmental, social and corporate governance, India also needs to up its game on enforcing compliance with the laws of the land and treating labour-employer disputes in an even-handed manner. When a showcase project becomes an exemplary basket case within months, for whatever reasons, the repercussions are deeper and wider. With the country on the cusp of a new labour law regime being marketed as a business-friendly regimen, misgivings about their provisions or unresponsive systems for employees’ grievances can only foment more such unrest. It may be a good time for the government to rekindle a tripartite dialogue mechanism with trade unions and employers like the erstwhile Indian Labour Conference, not held since 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/smouldering-unrest/article33380634.ece
21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Lok Sabha Dissolution: Is President Bound to Accept P.M.’s Advice?||[New Delhi, Dec. 20] Is the President of India bound to accept the advice of the Prime Minister to dissolve Lok Sabha and order fresh poll? This question was discussed at a seminar here yesterday. No consensus could emerge as the participants — constitutional experts, men in public life and journalists — express divergent views on the subject. The seminar was held under the auspices of the Institute of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies. Mr. H.N. Kunzru, President, Indian Council of World Affairs, said that the right of dissolution was the reserve power in the hands of the President and not for party advantage. He also added that before this advice was accepted, the President should explore the possibility of forming an alternative Ministry. Mr. R.C.S. Sarkar, former UPSC Chairman, said that the President was not bound to accept the advice of the Prime Minister, if the Prime Minister had lost majority support of the House. Mr. Justice S.K. Das, former Supreme Court Judge, was of the view that the “discretionary power” of the President in regard to dissolution of Lok Sabha should be exercised in “exceptional circumstances”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/lok-sabha-dissolution-is-president-bound-to-accept-pms-advice/article33380642.ece
21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Dealing with rejection Q.My father is 61 years old. He suffered a minor brain stroke in 1999 because of which he was paralysed on the left side. However, he recovered within 6 months and has been doing perfectly fine for last 20 years. He does not have any pre-existing conditions. I tried several health insurance companies for availing of health insurance for him but all of them rejected the same on account of the history of brain stroke. Please suggest a policy which is affordable and covers such pre-existing diseases. ANKIT SAXENA A.Technically, an insurance company can issue a health policy for your father specifying that hospitalisation due to stroke and related reason is an exclusion. Having said that, the underwriting decision, whether to issue a policy to a particular proposer or not, is entirely in the hands of the insurance company in spite of the background you list. While you can continue your quest for a good health policy for your father, his age can anyway make it difficult to buy a new policy. Self-financing his health cost needs would be a plan B for you to work on. Back to basics Q.My father is 58 and has just retired. My mother, a homemaker, is 51. Both don’t have any prior health insurance covers. I’m interested in providing them a health insurance cover but am not clear on factors to consider in choosing the best scheme. Also, are Mediclaim and health insurance similar? VIGNESH A.Mediclaim is the brand name of hospitalisation insurance provided by the four public sector general insurance companies: The New India Assurance Company Limited, United India Insurance Company Limited, The Oriental Insurance Company Limited and National Insurance Company Limited. Other general insurance companies and standalone health insurance companies too provide hospitalisation insurance under different brand names. These policies are indemnity policies which reimburse hospitalisation and related expenses as per the terms and limits of the policy. The claims are against bills and hence can be claimed only under one policy even if you have more than one overlapping policy. You can have multiple policies covering different tiers of your requirement so that higher expenses can also be claimed. These policies are annual in nature and can be renewed for life, and you can continue to make claims when they arise. There are other health policies that are called benefit policies. They will pay the sum insured on diagnosis of the specific health condition or when a specific major surgery is prescribed, that the policy covers. Once the claim is paid, the policy ceases to exist. If an insured is hospitalised for a coronary bypass surgery for example, the hospitalisation policy will pay the expenses and, over and above this, a benefit policy covering cardiac conditions will pay the sum insured as a lumpsum. Any health policy offered by an Indian life insurance company will be a benefit policy while both types of policies are available with general insurance and health insurance companies. Coming to your parents, you should go in for a basic hospitalisation policy from a company of your choice, and you are likely to get only a limited sum insured to begin with and can enhance it on later renewals. You also have waiting periods of pre-existing conditions to contend with. If you want more coverage, choose a suitable top-up policy and supplement this combination with a critical illness policy or a specialised policy for specific health conditions.

He retired hurt while batting in the second innings at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday after he was hit on the right arm by a short ball from Pat Cummins. Sources in the know of developments said that the terrible pain was a result of the fracture he has sustained. “Yes, he has a fracture and that is why he could not grip the bat and lift it at the crease. It looked bad and the worst fear has come true,” the source said. Lot of pain India skipper Virat Kohli had earlier spoken about how Shami was in pain and scans were conducted to check the extent of the injury. “No news on Shami, he is going for a scan now. Was in a lot of pain, could not even lift his arm. We will probably know in the evening what happens,” he had said at the post-match press conference. Australia pacer Josh Hazlewood had said that the visitors would find it hard to have a replacement for the “class bowler” if he was indeed unavailable for the remainder of the series. “It is obviously a blow, we gonna see how bad it was. He will undergo scans to see if there is any fracture or bruising. We wanna find out how much damage is done,” Hazlewood had said during the virtual post-match press conference. “He is a class bowler and he showed this in the game. So India might have to dig deeper in their arsenal to try and cover and him but we probably expect him to play, I am not sure how bad the injury is,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shami-out-of-series-with-fractured-arm/article33380739.ece

21 December 2020||ORLANDO,||Charlie’s journey takes off with ‘first eagle’||Charlie Woods wowed his 15-time Major champion father Tiger with an impressive eagle for Team Woods in the PNC Championship family tournament on Saturday. Charlie, 11, put his drive in the fairway at the par-five third hole of the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, then hooked a five-wood approach around some trees. The ball bounced short of the green and settled three feet from the pin, Charlie giving a fist-pump just like his old man's before rolling in the putt. A beaming Woods had a hug for his son, noting as they walked off the green “First eagle!” Charlie, whose swing, so reminiscent of his famous father's, drained another birdie putt in the first-round scramble format, following the ball as it rolled toward the cup and in at the ninth. At the 13th, Charlie struck a sweet tee shot and signalled to his father — playing off the tournament tees further back — that he didn't even need to hit a tee ball. ‘Incredible shots’ “It was some of the most incredible golf shots,” said Woods with a laugh. “He had the best time to be out there in this environment. I've seen this all along. A lot of the shots he hit I've seen this entire year.” The Woods duo got off to a hot start, with six birdies and an eagle on the front nine. They combined for a 10-under 62 that left them sharing sixth, four shots behind Matt Kuchar and son Cameron. Vijay Singh and son Qass were second two shots adrift, with Australian Greg Norman and son Greg Jr. another shot back and tied with Tom and Sean Lehman and David and Brady Duval. The two-day exhibition tournament features 20 teams of Major champions paired with a family member. Charlie is the youngest competitor to take part, and Woods has stressed all week that the main aim was to have fun with his son. “I really don't care about my game. I’m just making sure that Charlie has the time of his life and he's doing that,” Woods said. “I'm making sure he is able to enjoy all of this.” The two played alongside Woods family friends Justin Thomas and his father, Mike.  Justin noted earlier in the week that the young Woods was already an accomplished trash-talker, and he trolled team Thomas with a note when they were in a bunker. “It started in the pro-am. Charlie drove one through the fairway and my dad was playing in front of them and he'd hit it through the fairway and into the trees,” Justin said. “My dad wrote on a piece of paper 'draw hole' on it and put it under his ball. “In typical Woods fashion, he kept the piece of paper, and when my dad hit it in the bunker, he put the exact same piece of paper behind his ball,” said Justin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/charlies-journey-takes-off-with-first-eagle/article33381175.ece

It dominated the match, created more chances and should have got its maiden ISL victory comfortably but that was not to be. Kone, the tall Blasters defender, desperately attempted to intercept a cross from Mohammed Rafique from the right to Anthony Pilkington in the 13th minute but to his horror, he pushed it in as he got into a tangle with another defender Nishu Kumar to give East Bengal the lead. Kibu Vicuna’s Blasters appeared to be a bit disjointed and could not create enough chances in the opening half. But the half-time changes brought some spark to the Blasters game. Samad was full of life. Shortly after the hour mark, the youngster’s shot, off a Nishu Kumar cross, went over. And 10 minutes later, Jordan’s attempt off a Sahal pass was smartly pushed away by the Bengal goalkeeper Debjit Majumdar. And then came the equaliser.  The results:   Kerala Blasters 1 (Jeakson Singh 90+4) drew with East Bengal 1 (Bakary Kone 13-og)   Mumbai City 2 (D. Vignesh 38, Adam le Fondre 59) bt Hyderabad FC 0.

21 December 2020||New Delhi,||AIFF elections to be kept in abeyance||The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will hold its Annual General Body Meeting in virtual mode on Monday, with the elections of its office bearers set to be kept in abeyance. Term ends today The four-year term of the current executive committee ends on Monday and under normal circumstances, the elections would have to be held during the AGM with Praful Patel, who has been AIFF president since 2012, ineligible to contest as per the Sports Code. The AIFF last month moved an application before the Supreme Court, seeking continuation of its existing executive committee beyond its term on the ground that the court-appointed administrators are yet to frame a new constitution to conduct elections. “There was no election process such as appointment of returning officer, filing of nominations for various posts etc. So, there will be no elections. “But, we don’t know whether a resolution will be passed to extend the term of existing executive committee,” a top official of a member unit of the AIFF said. “The AIFF moved the Supreme Court to extend the term of the Executive Committee. But the matter has not come up for hearing till now. So, the AIFF best knows what is going to happen tomorrow,” he added. A FIFA spokesperson simply said that it expects the AIFF to fulfil its obligations under Article 14 of the statutes of the world body. “FIFA is in contact with the AIFF in relation to the upcoming electoral process. While respecting the principle of autonomy, FIFA expects all its member associations to fulfil their obligations in line with article 14 of the FIFA Statutes,” the FIFA spokesperson told PTI. The Article 14 of FIFA Statutes mainly relates to members associations’ obligations to follow Standard Statutes of the world body, to manage their affairs independently and not get influenced by any third parties, to comply fully with the Statutes, regulations, directives and decisions of FIFA bodies as well as the decisions of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The agenda of the AGM issued early this month only mentioned election of office bearers, if applicable. It had said that it will wait for the directions of the Supreme Court and will accordingly modify the agenda of the AGM.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aiff-elections-set-to-be-kept-in-abeyance/article33380877.ece
21 December 2020||Saint-Paul (France),||Mayer books early Olympics ticket||Decathlon world record holder Kevin Mayer booked his ticket for the Tokyo Olympics in a specially-arranged event on the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion on Saturday. Mayer, the French 2017 world champion, scored 8552 points, easily above the 8350 points set as the qualification standard by World Athletics. The 28-year-old produced a personal best of 13.54sec in the 110m hurdles to set up a solid performance. The only nervous moment came on Friday when Mayer fouled his first attempt in the long jump before achieving a cautious 7.40m with his second jump. “I'm relieved. It takes off a lot of pressure and a burden has been lifted,” he said after the competition in the French overseas territory. Mayer won the silver medal behind American Ashton Eaton at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Ashton has retired and will not be competing in Tokyo. The Frenchman, whose world record stands at 9126 points, had to drop out of the 2019 world championships in Doha due to injury. Even as Mayer was securing his place at the Games, 20-year-old Australian Ashley Moloney marked himself out as a potential rival for the Olympic title as he set an impressive first-day total of 4613 in the Queensland championships. “I'll burn him off,” Mayer said with a smile. “A decathlon lasts two days but he's unbelievable. He's light years ahead of me at that age, and even now. “I like the challenge from these young guys but I'm going to try to hold onto my territory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mayer-books-early-olympics-ticket/article33381167.ece
21 December 2020||Karachi,||Amir blames team management for decision to quit||Pacer Mohammad Amir has held the Pakistan team management responsible for his decision to quit international cricket at 28 and slammed coach Misbah-ul-Haq and bowling coach Waqar Younis for “spoiling” his image. Speaking on his official Youtube channel, Amir said his problem was with Misbah and Waqar. Mercenary, they said! “These people have been trying to slowly poison people’s minds by saying that I didn’t want to play Test cricket and only wanted to play in T20 leagues to earn money. They built a narrative that I had let down the team despite all the investment in me,” Amir said. “It was a very hard decision for me but I think the time has come when one shouldn’t keep quiet. I took this decision to raise this issue and let people know what is happening,” he said. Amir said he had made himself available for the while-ball formats after retiring from Test cricket but since last year, when the current management took over, they had been ignoring him despite good performances. Amir said the biggest problem was that every time he was sidelined, he learnt about it through social media. Amir said he had been “tolerating the negative narrative” against him from the management since last year. “What performances do they talk about... since I came back I had a PSL hat trick, I bowled well in the Asia Cup and Champions Trophy, I was the highest wicket-taker in last year’s World Cup despite playing with a shoulder problem. “I am still in the ICC bowlers rankings. I have given performances in leagues. What more can I do?” Amir also hit back at his critics for reminding him of his involvement in the 2010 spot-fixing scandal, saying he had paid for his mistake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/amir-blames-team-management-for-decision-to-quit/article33381168.ece

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||MCFC blanks HFC||Mumbai City FC maintained its position at the top of the table, with an emphatic 2-0 victory over Hyderabad FC in an Indian Super League encounter at the Tilak Maidan Stadium, Vasco on Sunday. Mumbai City’s twin strikes came in open play by D. Vignesh and Adam le Fondre. Mumbai City now has 16 points from seven matches. Hyderabad’s first defeat in six matches means it remains on nine points and in sixth place. What was turning into a quiet first half exploded with a wonderful goal in the 38th minute. Ahmed Jahouh’s long ball from midfield saw Bipin Singh volley to D. Vignesh. The 24-year-old advanced a few steps and fired a powerful left-footer that found the back of the net. Hyderabad had the best chance to equalise in the 44th minute. A fine cross by Akash Mishra found Mohamad Yasir in the right place to head in, but he messed it up. Mumbai striker le Fondre made it 2-0 with a firm right-footer on a pass from Rowllin Borges on the left.  The results: Mumbai City 2 (D. Vignesh 38, Adam le Fondre 59) bt Hyderabad FC 0.   Kerala Blasters 1 (Jeakson Singh 90+4) drew with East Bengal 1 (Bakary Kone 13-og).

21 December 2020||Liverpool,||‘Arsenal ‘hurting’ after Everton defeat’||Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta admitted his players were in a “big fight” after slipping to an eighth defeat of the Premier League season at the hands of high-flying Everton on Saturday. Carlo Ancelotti’s side moved five points behind leaders Liverpool after beating the Londoners 2-1 in front of 2,000 delighted fans at Goodison Park. At the other end of the table, the Gunners remain 15th after just one win in their past 10 league games, putting Arteta’s position under intense scrutiny just four months after they won the FA Cup. Self-inflicted After red cards undid Arsenal in their previous two games, much of the damage was again self-inflicted as Rob Holding's own goal opened the scoring. Nicolas Pepe's penalty briefly levelled the scores, but Yerry Mina’s header on the stroke of half-time secured a third consecutive win for Everton. Arteta said the game hinged on two key moments. “We reacted really well,” he told Sky Sports. “We dominated the game. We created enough chances at least to not lose. We hit the bar. We don't have the luck.” “The boys are absolutely still fighting,” he added. “They're hurt right now.” Arsenal were dealt a major blow before kick-off, losing captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to a calf injury. He had just re-found his scoring touch with a first goal from open play in the Premier League since September in a 1-1 draw at home to Southampton on Wednesday. That point briefly stemmed the spiral of decline for Arsenal but the club, who have been in English football's top flight since 1919, find themselves in uncharted territory, facing a relegation battle. Relegation fight? Should results go against them on Sunday and Monday, Arteta’s men could be just two points above the drop zone, with Chelsea to come on Boxing Day. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was usurped by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah as the Premier League's top scorer earlier in the day and while the England international failed to score for the third straight game, he did have a big part to play in the opening goal. Former Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi’s cross was headed towards goal by Calvert-Lewin, but his effort was going off target until it was turned in by Holding’s thigh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/arsenal-hurting-after-everton-defeat/article33381169.ece

21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Kalaripayattu included in KIYG||The Sports Ministry has approved the inclusion of four indigenous sports, including Gatka and Kalaripayattu, in the Khelo India Youth Games (KIYG) 2021, scheduled to take place in Haryana. The other two games included are Thang-Ta and Mallakhamba. A priority Speaking about the decision, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju said, “India has a rich heritage of indigenous sports, and it is a priority for the sports ministry to preserve, promote and popularise these games. “There is no better platform than the Khelo India Games where athletes of these games can compete. “I am confident that in the 2021 Khelo India Youth Games these four disciplines, along with yogasana, will get their much deserved attention among sports enthusiasts and youth of the country. “In the coming years we will be able to add more indigenous sports at the Khelo Games” he said. The four selected games represent different parts of the country. Kalaripayattu has its origin in Kerala and has practitioners all over the world, Bollywood actor Vidyut Jammwal being one. Mallakhamba, meanwhile, has been well-known across India. Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have been the hotspots of this sport. Gatka originates from the state of Punjab and this traditional fighting style of the Nihang Sikh warriors is used both as self-defence as well as a sport. Thang-Ta, a Manipur marital art has passed into oblivion in the recent decades, but the sport will get national recognition again with the help of the Khelo India Youth Games. “We are sure that this effort of Khelo India will certainly help to promote and revive a forgotten Indian traditional martial art having a historical significance,” said National Gatka Association of India president Harjeet Singh Gerwal. The Thang-Ta federation also said that the competition will vastly popularise the sport. “Over 400 athletes from different states will participate in the competition. We want to be very successful in the competition and this will help us get more recognition nationally and internationally,” said Thang-Ta Federation of India secretary Vinod Sharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ministrys-move-to-give-a-fillip-to-indigenous-sports/article33380882.ece

21 December 2020||December 21 2020 00:00 IST,||Nature of samsara||In the Gita, Lord Krishna compares samsara to a peepal tree. In a tree, old leaves fall, and new ones come up. An atma is born in the body of a human being, or animal, or bird or plant etc, and when that birth ends, the atma is born again as something else. Just as leaves fall, and new leaves appear, so does one birth end, but a new birth begins. This tree called samsara has branches that grow upward and downward. In this tree, devas and gandharvas are at a higher level; humans rank lower. Then come animals, and below them come lower forms of life like worms. This tree is nourished by the gunas. The sense objects are the newly appeared shoots of the tree. These shoots are attractive to look at. In the same way, sense objects also attract us, and keep us trapped in samsara, said Valayapet Ramachariar, in a discourse. A tree depends on its roots for its existence. Karmas are the roots of the tree called samsara. The Vedas are the leaves of this tree. Leaves, through photosynthesis, make the food required by plants and trees. This is a scientific fact. But if the Vedas are leaves of the tree of samsara, what is their role in keeping samsara alive? The Vedas prescribe all the karmas we need to do in this life, and so in this sense they keep samsara alive. But the Vedas also show us how to get rid of samsara. Those who understand the nature of samsara, have taken the first step towards liberation. The main root of the samsara tree is Brahma, which is why the tree is described as an upside down tree, with its roots at the top. Karmas are the secondary roots. Those who have not comprehended the nature of samsara can only think in terms of “I am so and so,” or “I am so and so’s son.” Detachment from worldly desires cuts down this tree of samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/nature-of-samsara/article33380725.ece

21 December 2020||GURUGRAM,||Stir against farm laws politically motivated, says Haryana CM||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Sunday said the agitation against the three agriculture sector laws was “politically motivated” and those behind it were not the well-wisher of the farmers. Mr. Lal added that the people of Haryana should talk to their brethren from Punjab holding demonstration at the Delhi-Haryana border about the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal. The Chief Minister was speaking at a “Jal Adhikar Rally” at Mahendragarh here on Sunday. Mr. Lal reiterated that he would quit politics if there was any dilution of the Minimum Support Price scheme and added that the government was thinking beyond the MSP through the three farm laws. “The MSP scheme will never cease to exist. It will continue,” he said. Mr. Lal said the SYL matter had been pending for decades, the BJP government petitioned before the Supreme Court for an early hearing after coming to power and a decision was made in Haryana’s favour. He said that South Haryana faced acute water scarcity two decades ago, but the water supply in the region had improved over the past few years. Mr. Lal said that his government had prepared a Rs. 2,000 crore project to recharge groundwater in the region. The groundwater level had gone up by 10-15 feet in Rewari because of the efforts of his government, he claimed. Referring to the farmers agitation, Haryana BJP chief Om Prakash Dhankar said those holding “red flags” sided with China in 1962 and the people should identify them. “Once they are identified, you can understand their motive behind the agitation,” said Mr. Dhankar.  ‘PM with farmers’ He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi understood the pain of the poor farmers and had directly transferred Rs. 6,000 to their bank accounts. Mr. Dhankar said that SYL canal was important for Haryana and it was the right of the people of the State. “It is the right opportunity to talk about our share of water through SYL canal. Those who don’t talk about SYL now are not well-wisher of farmers,” said Mr. Dhankar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/stir-against-farm-laws-politically-motivated-says-haryana-cm/article33380898.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Medical camp set up at protest site to treat eye issues due to pollution||A team of nine doctors from Punjab’s Garhshankar on Sunday set up a two-day medical camp at the Singhu border to treat protesting farmers suffering from eye-related issues due to the pollution. Volunteers give socks Meanwhile, another group of volunteers were found treating elderly protesters suffering from knee pain by applying ointments and providing them with woollen socks. The doctors included ophthalmologists, physiotherapists and general physicians. They had earlier visited the spot three times.  Due to the excessive cold, dust and pollution, many farmers complained of several eye-related issues, said doctors. “We have come with medicines and eye-examination devices. These medicines could give temporary relief to farmers but if the situation remains the same, many of them would need to be hospitalised as weather is extreme cold,” said a volunteer. Twenty-year-old ophthalmologist Rajdeep Singh said: “This is our fourth visit here. Earlier, we had set up general medical camps on weekends.” He said during their third visit to Singhu border, they had realised that there was a need for a separate eye camp at the protest site. “During our last visit, many people came up to us with eye-related problems. While some complained of dry eyes, others said they felt burning sensation or irritations in the eye. So, we realised that no such facility was available and decided to set up an exclusive eye-checkup camp here,” he added while attending to 50-year-old Mehrunisa, who have been complaining of pain and weakness in her eyes for the past few days. She was advised to take anti-allergic eye drops twice a day. Hailing from Delhi’s Wazirabad, Mehrunisa has been camping at the Singhu border for one week now. When asked if she was a farmer, Mehrunisa said: “I am not a farmer but we get our food because of our farmer brothers. If we do not stand with them today, we should be ashamed of ourselves.” A physiotherapist, Amandeep Singh, said: “We are here only to serve the farmers. It is our duty. All medicines are free of cost. Our only intention is to give them our best medical facilities.” There was a group of volunteers, who helped the elderly farmers clip their nails. “My friends and I have come here to help the farmers. I come from a family of farmers and I understand their pain,” said a volunteer, who did not wish to be named.  During our last visit, many people came up to us with eye-related problems. So we decided to set up an exclusive eye-checkup camp at the Singhu border Rajdeep Singh Ophthalmologist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/medical-camp-set-up-at-protest-site-to-treat-eye-issues-due-to-pollution/article33380907.ece

21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Man who jumped red light gets bail, asked not to leave city||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a man who was arrested for jumping the red light and fleeing from the scene with a police constable clinging on to his car’s bonnet for about 100 metres. Justice Vibhu Bakhru noted that the accused Vaibhav Malhotra has admitted to the charges made by the prosecution and also that the investigation in the case is now complete. The High Court, however, ordered Malhotra to provide a contact number to the Station House Officer of Paschim Vihar (West) police station and ensure that he is reachable at all times. The judge also directed Malhotra not to leave the Capital. Constable’s complaint The case against Malhotra was registered at the complaint of constable Virender, who stated that on September 11, 2020, at 8 p.m., he was on duty near a red light in Paschim Vihar and was regulating the traffic. Constable Virender stated that he saw a car approaching from the wrong side and jumping the red light. He signalled the driver to stop. However, the driver, who was identified as Malhotra, did not stop the vehicle and instead accelerated the vehicle. Constable Virender stated that since he was in front of the car he came on to the bonnet of the car but that also did not deter Malhotra from stopping the vehicle. Constable Virender said Mr. Malhotra drove the vehicle for about 100 metres, with him clinging on to the bonnet, and then stopped to provide him an opportunity to get down. When Virender tried to apprehend Malhotra, he fled from the spot. The constable sustained minor injuries. Subsequently, Malhotra was apprehended. In his bail application, Malhotra admitted that he was learning how to drive and had mistakenly jumped the red light.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-who-jumped-red-light-gets-bail-asked-not-to-leave-city/article33380902.ece
21 December 2020||New Delhi,||Anti-CAA protest: report documents chilling testimonies of students||Students of Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University have recounted chilling testimonies of facing the police as they set out to control protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 15, 2019. Even the female students were not spared. “The male police officers were pressing our feet and hands with their boots,” says a student, quoted in the 124-report compiled by the Citizens Against Hate, a Delhi-based collective of individuals and groups. Released recently, the report also finds substantive loopholes in the National Human Rights Commission’s investigation of the incidents in the two universities. Documenting 209 testimonies, the report, titled ‘The Dismantling of Minority Education: Police Violence in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia’ is based on six months of fieldwork by the CAH team comprising human rights experts, lawyers and researchers. Excessive force The report says the police and Rapid Action Force officials made disproportionate use of force against students – tear-gas shells were thrown inside the old reading hall and Zakir Hussain Library of JMI and students’ devices such as laptops were broken. It says women students in JMI were beaten by male police officers on December 15 and police used communal slurs and targeted the Muslim identity of students, particularly Kashmiris. The officials paraded the students with their hands up in the air. In AMU, the report notes, the police, and RAF officials entered the campus on December 15 and fired tear-gas shells, rubber bullets, and stun grenades indiscriminately on protesting students, causing severe injuries. Some shells blew up in the hands of the students while they attempted to throw them away. Three students were critically injured, including one who lost his hand. Room 46 of AMU’s Morrison Court Hostel, the report says, caught fire after the police broke open the gates and threw tear-gas shells inside, asphyxiating three students. In a semi-conscious state, the students were taken to the Bab-e-Syed gate and beaten, claims the report. Blaming the authorities for the delay in legal and medical aid, it goes on to add that the harassment of students including arrests and criminalisation have continued beyond the events of December 15 when two separate FIRs were filed against 56 individuals and 1,200-1,300 unnamed persons. The report also takes into account the immediate and long-term psychological impact on students and family members as it has noted instances of panic episodes disrupting sleeping patterns and reducing self-esteem among students. Taking a critical view of NHRC’s findings in these incidents, the report says the human rights body blamed the violence on students based on “questionable grounds”, providing legitimacy to police action. The report points out that it is a settled principle of law that mere lack of permission doesn’t make a protest unlawful. The report says the NHRC didn’t take into account circumstantial evidence — fire in the room, empty tear-gas shells, the gatekeeper becoming unconscious — before concluding that due to non-availability of material evidence such as CCTV footage of the attack on the hostel and specific spaces, the allegations are neither proved nor disproved. Probe recommended The CAH has recommended immediate constitution of a commission of inquiry chaired by a retired judge of the Supreme Court to conduct a judicial inquiry into the incident and ensure accountability of the police as well as reparative action. Recommending ratification of the Convention against Torture, to which India is a signatory since 1998, it has asked the Central government to formulate proper guidelines for police and other forces regarding the conduct of police in dealing with protesting students inside educational institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/anti-caa-protest-report-documents-chilling-testimonies-of-students/article33380900.ece
21 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Three men nabbed for killing nursing attendant||Three persons have been arrested for allegedly murdering a 17-year-old nursing attendant in Patparganj here, the police said on Sunday. On December 15, the police received a PCR call at 10.30 p.m. about an unattended body lying near Patparganj industrial area.

A team then got a tip-off that the murder was committed by three men, one of whom was from Mandawali and the other two from Madhu Vihar. Next, raids were conducted and the accused — Piyush, Sumit and Rahul — were nabbed. The accused said they committed crime to earn quick money.

21 December 2020||Guwahati,||NSCN(IM) takes member to task over peace march||The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland or NSCN (IM) has allegedly punished one of its members for taking out a peace march carrying the flags of India and ‘Nagalim’. The NSCN (IM) calls itself the National Socialist Council of Nagalim that covers Naga-inhabited areas in Nagaland and beyond. Y.S. Mashungmi, a Tangkhul Naga from Manipur’s Ukhrul district, had walked 70 km from Nagaland’s commercial hub Dimapur to State capital Kohima a few days ago for “spreading the message of peace”. Fellow NSCN (IM) members caught him in Kohima and took him to their camp at Hebron, about 35 km southwest of Dimapur. None, including those in the NSCN (IM), recognised him during the peace march as he was wearing a mask. The NSCN (IM) admitted Mashungmi was one of its members and was brought to its camp, but denied torturing or punishing him. In a statement on December 19, the NSCN (IM) said Mashungmi went for the “so-called peace march carrying both the national flags of India and Nagalim without taking the authority into confidence”.  ‘Conduct code violated’ It said the member was being debriefed for the unauthorised “one-man operation with sensitive political implication”. The outfit also stated that his “daring venture, no matter how patriotic it may appear in the eyes of the beholder, amounts to violation of disciplinary code of conduct.” W. Saya, the NSCN (IM)’s deputy publicity minister, denied reports about Mashungmi having been punished. “He is in our camp but not in custody,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nscnim-takes-member-to-task-over-peace-march/article33380895.ece
21 December 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||NGT panel for protection of Mahanadi floodplain||The National Green Tribunal has constituted a high-level committee to identify floodplain zones of the Mahanadi — Odisha’s largest river — in wake of State government reclaiming 424 acres of land from the river for development projects. One Dillip Kumar Samantray had moved the NGT accusing that the Mahanadi riverbed was slated to be affected by setting up of a Medical College and other permanent constructions in the floodplain of the river. He had stated that there was need to prevent irreversible damage to the riverine ecology by enforcing the applicable rules, if any. In January this year, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had announced that every inch of the 424 acres reclaimed land would be utilised to add ecological, recreational, sporting, cultural and technological value in the lives of the people of Cuttack. It was also proposed that 25 acres of land reclaimed from the river Mahanadi would be used for construction of new campus of SCB Medical College library and playground and the proposal included setting up of musical fountain, light system, garden, footpath, coffee bar, lavatory, ticket counter and arrangement of special galleries. The tribunal has directed the committee to consider the issue and laid down norms so as to ensure that the proposal of the State for construction of the medical college and river front development takes place in accordance with law, without damage to the floodplains of the rivers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ngt-panel-for-protection-of-mahanadi-floodplain/article33380896.ece
