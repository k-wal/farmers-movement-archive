19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC finds HC order on A.P. govt. ‘disturbing’||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed an Andhra Pradesh High Court order intending to embark on a judicial inquiry into whether there is a constitutional breakdown in the State machinery under the Jagan Mohan Reddy government, requiring a declaration of President’s rule. “Has anybody seen an order like this before... As the apex court, we find this disturbing. We are staying this order... We will take up this case immediately after the vacations,” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, observed. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta asked why the High Court “should go into whether there is a constitutional breakdown in the State”. The government, represented by advocate Mahfooz Ahsan Nazki, said it was not up to the High Court to enquire and recommend President’s rule in a State. “It is Article 356 that deals with failure of constitutional machinery in a State... This power [to impose President’s rule] exclusively vests in the Executive. The power in this regard, like sending a report either to the Hon’ble President or to the Hon’ble Governor or to record a finding in that regard, cannot be exercised by the judiciary,” the petition filed by the government said. The “unprecedented” order of the High Court, on October 1, came while deciding habeas corpus petitions filed by relatives of persons remanded in judicial custody or out on bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-finds-hc-order-on-ap-govt-disturbing/article33369283.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||PM makes a strong pitch to farmers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday made a strong pitch to farmers, advocating the benefits of the agricultural reforms initiated by his government and criticised the Opposition parties for “shooting from the shoulders of farmers” in first pushing the reforms in their poll manifestos and now opposing them for the sake of opposition. He was addressing farmers at a function organised by the Madhya Pradesh government to release compensation to those who had incurred losses due to hailstorms. Significantly, Mr. Modi said his government was more than ready to continue the dialogue with farmers groups on any doubts they may have about the laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-makes-a-strong-pitch-to-farmers/article33369285.ece
19 December 2020||Mangaluru,||Clear encroached parking space in complexes, say police||Taking serious note of the Mangaluru City Corporation’s inaction in getting parking space vacated in 50 commercial complexes in the city, Police Commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash on Friday said the city police will do the task instead. Seven days will be given to these establishments to clear parking space, he said. Hearing issues related to parking during his maiden phone-in programme at the office of the Police Commissioner, Mr. Vikash told reporters that motorists are concerned over the lack of parking spaces and they are forced to park their vehicles in non-parking areas, which was also holding up traffic flow. While notifying the no-parking areas, he said, the police had identified 50 commercial complexes in the city that did not leave any space for parking of vehicles in their buildings. “It is two months ago that we sent the list to the MCC for action. As no action has been taken so far, we will take up the matter. Notices will be issued shortly to these establishments asking them to clear the encroached spaces,” he said. Following a call about about parking of vehicles on the footpath near the Saibeen Complex in Lalbagh, Mr. Vikash directed Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Nataraj to take action to clear the same immediately. He also asked Mr. Nataraj to clear vehicles from the pavement in other parts of the city. Another caller expressed need of barricades or any other measure for reducing speed of vehicles coming from Udupi and taking a right turn towards Urwa Market at Kottara Chowki. “This is logical demand, we will discuss with National Highway authorities and take necessary action,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/clear-encroached-parking-space-in-complexes-say-police/article33369958.ece
19 December 2020||Mumbai,||Uddhav asks MMRDA to explore other sites for Metro car shed||Days after the Bombay High Court ordered a stay on construction of integrated Metro car shed in Kanjurmarg, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra is reportedly looking alternative sites. According to senior government officials, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to explore alternative sites for Metro car shed, as the State is adamant on not constructing it at Aarey forest as it will cause environmental damage. The official said three sites were under consideration including a plot in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), kept aside as the originating point for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. “The other lands are at Pahadi in Goregaon and a plot in Kalina. We have however, not finalised anything, but considering all options,” said the officer. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) termed the intention as immature and wrong. Transport Minister Anil Parab confirmed that the BKC plot has been considered. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the government does not need to listen to Opposition advise on what is good for the State. Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, asked, “Who is advising this government? They will drown the State if this plan goes through. The cost of per hectare plot is around Rs. 1,800 crore and the car shed requires 25 hectares.” Mr. Thackeray had in the Assembly earlier this week slammed the BJP and Centre for obstructing the car shed at Kanjurmarg. “Did anyone ask Maharashtra whether we want the bullet train? Do we really need it to travel to Gujarat from Mumbai? Was any study done before finalising it? But we agreed. Why are questions being raised about the car shed?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uddhav-asks-mmrda-to-explore-other-sites-for-metro-car-shed/article33369981.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||Hathras victim was gang-raped, murdered: CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday filed a chargesheet against the four persons accused of the gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras in September. The victim was allegedly raped and assaulted by Sandeep, Luvkush, Ravi and Ramu on September 14 in Hathras, the agency said. She was admitted to a hospital in Aligarh, from where she was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. She died on September 29. The CBI has invoked Sections 302 (punishment for murder), 376 (punishment for rape), 376A (punishment for inflicting injury while committing rape, resulting in the death of the woman) and 376D (gang-rape) of the IPC, besides the relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act. The four accused are currently in judicial custody. On October 1, U.P.’s Additional DGP (Law & Order) Prashant Kumar said the forensic report from the government laboratory in Agra confirmed that the victim was not raped. He also cited the autopsy report to corroborate his point. “The lab report clearly says that no sperm was found in the sample,” he said. However, he added that the victim first mentioned about rape on September 22 and that the samples were sent to the laboratory on September 25. Stating that the truth had prevailed once again, All-India Congress Committee general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the filing of a chargesheet raised serious questions on the Adityanath government, the police, ADG (Law and Order), the District Magistrate of Hathras and the senior functionaries of the State administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hathras-victim-was-gang-raped-murdered-cbi/article33369875.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Talks on to give another chance to IAS aspirants’||The Union government told the Supreme Court on Friday that discussions were on for granting another chance for UPSC aspirants, especially whose last attempt at cracking the prelims expired in October 2020. “The Centre as well as the UPSC are taking decisions on a proposal to give one more opportunity to the affected students due to the pandemic,” a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar remarked. The court was hearing a petition filed by 59 aspirants, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and advocate Anushree Prashit Kapadia. They were either unable to take the October prelims or handicapped in their preparations due to the pandemic and lockdowns. They argued for a second opportunity and corresponding age relaxation. They said their preparations were crippled by lockdowns and restrictions. Many could not even take the exam. On October 26, the Department of Personnel and Training informed the court that the government was considering giving last-chance candidates another shot at the exam. On Friday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the issue was not adversarial and a decision would be taken on giving another opportunity in the next three or four weeks. The government referred to the September 30 order of the court in this regard in the case of Vasireddy Govardhana Sai Prakash Vs UPSC . In September, the court refused to postpone the October prelims but recorded the government’s assurance to take an expeditious decision on granting a second chance for “last-attempters”. ‘Last attempt’ “Some of the candidates may be giving last attempt, and if such candidates are unable to appear in the examination due to COVID-19 pandemic situation, it would cause great prejudice to them,” the order read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/talks-on-to-give-another-chance-to-ias-aspirants/article33369605.ece

19 December 2020||Mangaluru,||Teacher swims 1 km in sea with legs chained||As the locks of the chain around his legs were removed, Nagaraj Kharvi’s four-year-old son Sanchit ran to hug him. For Mr. Kharvi returned safely after swimming a kilometre in the Arabian Sea, with his legs chained on Friday at Tannirbhavi here. Mr. Kharvi’s wife Krupa, his brothers, his friends, and fellow swimmers from the Mangala Swimming Club, where he swims daily at the Tannirbhavi beach, followed. Mr. Kharvi, a teacher from Government Higher Primary School at Kalmanja village in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada, did a breaststroke to cover the distance in 25 minutes and 16.63 seconds. His legs were chained in the ‘Padmasana’ pose and he had made a claim for entry into the India Book of Records. It was around 9 a.m. that Mr. Kharvi’s legs were chained in the presence of two district officials. His friends carried him to the water. A boat carrying expert swimmers, which included Kharvi’s trainer B.K. Naik and Gopal Kharvi, who has the record of swimming between Malpe Beach and St. Mary’s Island by handcuffing his hands and legs, followed him. The Coastal Security Police followed in another boat and kept a close watch on Mr. Kharvi. As he neared the finishing point , Mr. Kharvi started floating towards the north. “It was because of the direction of the wind. My colleagues pointed it out. I had to cover few extra metres to reach the destination,” said Mr. Kharvi, who comes from a family of fishermen. For the past three years, he practised the art of floating in the sea by doing ‘Padmasana’. “The key aspect in today’s feat was preserving the energy to cover the extra distance,” he said. After he reached the destination by 9.25 a.m., Mr. Kharvi then climbed aboard the paddling board, and came back to the shore. Mr. Kharvi praised his coach, his colleagues, and family to help him in achieving this feat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/teacher-swims-1-km-in-sea-with-legs-chained/article33369960.ece
19 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||HC relief for man booked under U.P. conversion law||The Allahabad High Court on Friday issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition challenging the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Petitioner Saurabh Kumar of Prayagraj prayed for declaring the ordinance ultra vires , saying it was “both morally and constitutionally repugnant”. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Piyush Agarwal heard the petitioner and the Additional Advocate-General representing the government. Counter affidavit The court allowed the government time to file a counter affidavit on or before January 4. A rejoinder affidavit, if any, may be filed by the petitioner on or before January 6, 2021, the court said. The matter has been listed for January 7, on which date the writ petition would be heard for final disposal. The PIL plea also prayed for an interim direction to the government not to take any coercive action in cases of conversion by marriage or for the purpose thereof. The provisions gave the state policing powers over a citizen’s choice of life partner or religion militate against the fundamental rights to individual autonomy, privacy, human dignity and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner submitted. The ordinance led to an unreasonable intrusion into the domain of personal autonomy, the petitioner said, referring to the advance notice of 60 days required to be given to the District Magistrate before an intended conversion, which was to be followed by a police inquiry into the circumstances of conversion. “The very concept of forcing an individual to explain and justify a decision, which is closely personal to him or her, before an officer of the State is contrary to constitutionalism,” the petitioner argued. The Constitution imposed limitations on state power and burdened the state to explain and justify the decisions taken by it affecting the rights and lives of citizens. The ordinance inversed this equation, the petition stated. Obligation to seek permission for conversion two months in advance was fundamentally arbitrary and a violation of the “right to privacy”, the petitioner submitted. “The state has no role to play in the personal choice of individuals in consummating a union and embracing the religion of the partner. The State can certainly regulate acts of forced conversion but the starting point of such regulation has to be a complaint made by the individual who opts to convert,” the petitioner said. In most of these cases, it was the parents who complained that their daughter had been fraudulently enticed into a relationship and was a victim of forced conversion. This made the ordinance an instrument of harassment in situations where interfaith marriages were voluntary, the plea said. The petitioner submitted that the provisions of the Ordinance had the potential to give the State sanction and administrative support to the societal hostilities that persons intending to have inter-faith marriages faced. “Numerous petitions filed in High Courts, seeking police protection for inter-faith couples, denote the level of community threat and social ostracism which they have to face,” the petitioner noted. The ordinance makes religious conversion a cognisable and non-bailable offence, inviting penalties up to 10 years in prison if found to be effected for marriage or through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or other allegedly fraudulent means. Violation of the provisions of the law will invite a jail term of not less than one year, extendable to five years with a fine of Rs. 15,000. However, if a minor, a woman or person belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes communities was converted through the said unlawful means, the jail term would be a minimum of three years and can be extended to 10 years with a fine of Rs. 25,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-notice-to-up-on-conversion-law/article33369250.ece

19 December 2020||Kolkata,||BJP raises concerns over burqa-clad voters||A fresh row has erupted over West Bengal BJP’s letter to the Election Commission over the difficulty in verifying the identity of burqa-clad voters. The letter states that Central Police Force (CAPF) jawans are unable to establish the identity of female voters clad in burqas and demanded that adequate numbers of female CAPF personnel are deployed in minority areas. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) was quick to dismiss the letter as an “insidious attempt to communalise the elections”. “In minority (Muslims) areas, female voters normally come clad in burqa. It is not possible for the CPF jawans to establish their identity before permitting them entry in the booth. You are requested to ensure that these areas are mapped in advance and adequate numbers of female CPF are deployed,” the letter signed by four State BJP functionaries said. The letter addressed to Deputy Election Commissioner, dated December 17 also alleged a sharp rise in the number of electors, especially in many parts that are close to Bangladesh border. “As an example, we would draw your attention to 149 AC [Assembly Constituency] Kasba; 151 AC Sonarpur Uttar; 157 Metiabruz. In 149 AC Kasba ward number 66 there has been a rise of approximately 10% in the number of electors,” the letter signed by State BJP vice-presidents Pratap Banerjee, and Bharati Ghosh, and BJP leaders Shishir Bajoria and Sabyasachi Dutta. TMC leader Omprakash Mishra said the letter was part of , “insidious and hideous attempt by which the BJP is attempting to communalise the process and conduct of free and fair elections”. Prof Mishra said he cannot recollect any instance in the past where there has been such a “malafide intent” on the part of a ruling party to polarise the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-raises-concerns-over-burqa-clad-voters/article33369512.ece

In the letter, which focused on the CMP for betterment of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities, Ms. Gandhi said, “The budget allocation for the development of SC/ST communities should be proportionate to their share in the population. Focus may be on the schemes that benefit SC/ST communities to bring them on par with rest of the society at the earliest.” The letter comes against the backdrop of criticism of the Congress for being the weak link in the MVA with its ministers not being able to assert themselves. A number of instances have also put Congress ministers on the backfoot where the Finance department, headed by NCP leader Ajit Pawar, chose to curtail funds. Ms. Gandhi recommended legislative backing to utilise the funds allocated during the same fiscal, referring to similar action by Congress governments in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The letter also advocated reservation in government contracts and projects for enterprises promoted by SC/ST professionals to stimulate entrepreneurship in these communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sonia-writes-to-uddhav-on-scst-projects/article33369986.ece

A decision to this effect was taken at an emergency meeting of APMC workers at the Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) in Hubballi on Friday. APMC merchants from Haveri, Ranebennur, Byadgi, Gadag, Koppal, Ballari, Dharwad, Vijayapura, Mahalingapur, Laxmeshwar, Bagalkot, Belagavi, and other places had taken part in the meeting.

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||India, China to hold next round of LAC talks||India and China on Friday agreed to hold another round of talks between senior military commanders to take forward the slow-moving process of disengagement on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This was agreed to at the 20th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs, held via video link. The WMCC, ordinarily convened twice a year since its launch in 2012, has met six times since June this year, after the unprecedented crisis in Ladakh erupted in early May. At Friday’s talks, led by Naveen Srivastava, Joint Secretary (East Asia) in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and Hong Liang, Director-General of the Department of Boundary and Oceanic Affairs of China’s Foreign Ministry, both sides “reviewed the developments along the LAC”, the MEA said in a statement. The statement said both sides had “agreed that based on the guidance provided by senior leaders and the agreements reached between the two Foreign Ministers and Special Representatives, they would continue to work towards ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector at the earliest”. They also agreed to hold the ninth round of Corps Commander-level talks “at an early date” so that “both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity”, the statement said.  A statement from China’s Foreign Ministry said both sides agreed to “focus on the disengagement of front-line troops and take concrete measures to deal with the issues on the ground to further de-escalate the border situation” and to hold the ninth round of commander-level talks “as soon as possible to properly resolve remaining issues on the ground and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border area”. At the last round of talks between Corps Commanders on November 6, both sides continued discussing modalities to finalise a plan for phased disengagement. One of the sticking points is China’s insistence on India first withdrawing from the strategic heights it occupied in late August south of Pangong Lake in response to China’s transgressions. Tensions have remained high south of the lake, where shots were also fired in warning, marking the first such instance of firing since 1975. Officials told The Hindu, following the last round, that proposals were under discussion and would be taken up at the ninth round, and “once agreed upon, it will be done in multiple phases with on the ground verification after each step”. North of the lake, China has moved troops up to Finger 4 since May and has prevented India from reaching Finger 8, up to where India has patrolled previously. Under the first phase of disengagement, both sides had moved back in the Galwan Valley and in the Gogra-Hot Springs area. The situation at Pangong Lake remains unresolved, as also in the Depsang plains in the far north where India has been prevented from reaching patrolling points in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-china-agree-to-hold-next-round-of-lac-talks/article33369280.ece

19 December 2020||New Delhi,||PM ‘lied’ on MSP: farmer unions||Protesting farmer groups accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “attacking” them in his speech on Friday, adding that his claims on minimum support prices (MSPs) were “lies”. With regard to the ongoing Supreme Court case, farm leaders have not yet made any firm decision on whether to implead themselves as proposed by the court. “The Prime Minister has launched an open party attack on the farmers of India by claiming that they are linked to Opposition parties,” said a statement from the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), responding to Mr. Modi’s address to Madhya Pradesh farmers. “In place of addressing the issue of repeal of the three farm Acts which erode farmers’ hold on land and farming and establish the MNCs and big business to grow in agriculture, he has reduced himself to a party leader undermining his role as a responsible executive head of the country, expected to solve problems.” The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) dismissed the Centre’s claims of helping farmers by increasing the MSPs. It pointed out that the MSPs of major crops had an average yearly increase of 8-12% in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) era, in comparison to only 1-5% under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). “These are Modi ji ’s lies about MSP,” said the group’s leader Rakesh Tikait, adding that most pulses were not being bought at MSP prices. Even with regards to paddy, a farmer in Bihar is still forced to sell his crop at half the rate of MSP because government procurement has not reached him, he said. Mr. Tikait also termed the Centre’s claims of implementing the Swaminathan Commission’s recommendations as a “lie”, pointing out that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) formula for calculating MSP does not follow the Commission, and has resulted in “suppressing the rights of farmers”. The PM’s claim that the new laws would promote investment in farm storage infrastructure would only help corporates, said Mr. Tikait. “This means that Modi- ji is promoting agri business, not farmers. Privatisation is being promoted in farming. After the Navratna companies were privatised, Modi is now eyeing the privatisation of agriculture,” he said. All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) general secretary Hannan Mollah questioned Mr. Modi’s claim that the farm reforms were not a sudden move but the result of two decades of consultation and planning. “Without discussing with farmers, what is the use of saying we have been talking for 20 years in bureaucratic rooms? No farmers’ group was consulted before these laws were brought, no farmer has asked for these laws,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-lied-on-msp-farmer-unions/article33369244.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. lists papers for vaccine registration||The Union Health Ministry on Friday listed out the documents that can be used for registering to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Beneficiaries can produce driving licence, health insurance smart card issued under the scheme of the Labour Ministry, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) job card, official identity cards issued to MPs, MLAs and MLCs, PAN card, bank or post office passbook, passport, pension document, service identity card issued to employees by the Union or the State government or public limited companies and voter ID cards. After online registration, a beneficiary will receive an SMS on the registered mobile number on the due date, place and time of vaccination. After all the doses of vaccine are administered, a QR-code-based certificate will be sent to the registered mobile number, the Ministry said. A photo ID is a must for both registration and verification at the session site. “Protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and it must be ensured that the entire schedule of vaccination is completed by only one type of vaccine, as different vaccines are not interchangeable,” the Health Ministry stated. It is also advisable to receive a complete schedule of vaccine, irrespective of past history of infection with COVID-19. This will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease, it noted. ‘Defer vaccination’ “Persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of spreading the same to others at vaccination sites. For this reason, infected individuals should defer vaccination for 14 days after symptoms resolution,” it added. The vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. “As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection. The States have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any vaccine-related side effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among masses,” the Health Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-lists-papers-for-vaccine-registration/article33369253.ece
19 December 2020||KALABURAGI,||Polls to four GP constituencies in Ballari countermanded||The State Election Commission has countermanded the elections to four constituencies at Byluru village [which falls under the Sindigeri Gram Panchayat] in Kurugodu taluk of Ballari district, where the members were elected unopposed through an illegal auction. Based on the recommendations of Ballari Deputy Commissioner S.S. Nakul, State Election Commissioner B. Basavaraju, exercising the powers conferred under Article 243-K of the Constitution read with Section 308 of the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Act 199 and Karnataka Panchayat (Conduct of Elections) Rules 1993, passed an order on Thursday declaring the four constituencies countermanded with immediate effect. He also directed the Ballari Deputy Commissioner to give effect to this order immediately and report compliance to the State Election Commission. 13 people paid As per the enquiry conducted by the model code of conduct team, comprising Kurugodu Deputy Tahsildar Yakub Ali and Kolur Hobli Revenue Inspector Karisiddappa, a few prominent people of Byluru village held a meeting on the premises of Eshwara Temple in the village on December 5 and decided to elect 13 members unopposed in return of a payment of Rs. 51,20,000 to the village deity. At the meeting, others were restricted from filing their nomination papers against the 13 who had agreed to pay the amount together to the deity after the elections, which are scheduled to be held on December 22. The Deputy Director of the taluk panchayat, the Revenue Inspector, and the village accountant subsequently visited the village and appealed to the people to participate in the election in a free and fair manner. The Deputy Commissioner of Ballari sent a report to the State Election Commission as well as the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj on December 19.  Even after an FIR was registered against the 18 people – including the village heads who conducted the meeting and the 13 persons who had agreed to pay the money – under Sections 171(A), 171(B), 171(C) and 171(E) of the Indian Penal Code, the village heads had managed to auction the 13 seats of the Sindigeri Gram Panchayat. Tahsildar’s report The Kurugodu Tahsildar reported the development to the Deputy Commissioner on December 14 and also requested him to declare the election of the 13 candidates from the village as void for the violation of the model code of conduct. The Deputy Commissioner, in return, wrote to the State Election Commission with the same recommendation and requested the latter to disqualify 13 members from taking part in the election in the future just to avoid the repetition of such incidents. “... auctioning of seats of Gram Panchayat vitiates the entire process of election. As there is no specific provision to apply the present situation, a vacuum is created, and, therefore, I invoke Article 243(K) of the Constitution of India which empowers the State Election Commission to exercise control over the conduct of elections in a free and fair manner. As such, it is a fit and proper case to declare the elections to the 13 seats as void,” Mr. Basavaraju said, in the preamble to the order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/polls-to-4-gp-constituencies-in-ballari-countermanded/article33369408.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC stays High Court order to hold Bengaluru civic body polls||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a Karnataka High Court judgment of December 4, which directed the State Election Commission to conduct elections in only 198 wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) within six weeks. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Election Commission and original petitioners in the High Court — M. Shivaraju and Abdul Wajid — on an appeal filed by the Karnataka government. The government said the High Court judgment nullified the unanimous will of the State legislature, comprising the representatives of the people, which amended the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, to increase the number of wards in Bengaluru to 243. The 1976 Act governs the BBMP. The High Court, on December 4, ordered the BBMP elections to be held for 198 wards under the delimitation of wards published on June 23. The State government, represented by advocate Subhranshu Padhi, said the High Court had severely handicapped efforts to “improve urban governance in one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in India”. “The increase in the number of wards was necessitated by fact that the population and demographics of the city have undergone a vast change since 2009 (when the number of wards were increased to 198) thereby necessitating an increase in the number of wards and their redrawing into smaller and more administrable sizes,” the State argued. The petition said the HC erroneously read down the provisions to “mean that the amended provisions would not apply to elections of those corporations where elections became due prior to coming into force of the amended provisions”. The State government contended that the HC directed the State to conduct elections in a manner which was contrary to “a validly and unanimously enacted piece of legislation by the Legislature”. It said Article 243-ZA(2) of the Constitution has conferred the power on the State Legislature to, by law, make provision with respect to “all matters relating to or in connection with elections to municipalities”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-high-court-order-to-hold-bengaluru-civic-body-polls/article33369223.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ordinary people cannot afford COVID-19 care: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday said it was the government’s duty to ensure affordable medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. It said medical care during the pandemic had become so costly that ordinary people could not afford it at all. The court also said a successful “World War” on the virus depended on “government-public partnership”. For this, the government should be transparent about the facts and figures regarding COVID-19 infection spread. A three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan addressed the issue of the deteriorating health of fatigued doctors, nurses and medical workers. It said the government needed to work out a mechanism to give them “intermittent rest”. In a 17-page order, the court said right to health is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. “Right to health includes affordable treatment. For whatever reasons, the treatment has become costlier and costlier and it is not affordable to the common people at all… Even if one survives from COVID-19, many times financially and economically he is finished,” the court said. Fee cap The Bench said the State and local authorities should either make more provisions for affordable treatment in their hospitals or there shall be cap on the fees charged by the private hospitals in exercise of the powers under the Disaster Management Act. “Corporate or private hospitals should strictly comply with directions issued under the Disaster Management Act to keep 50% or any other percentage of free beds. There shall be free helpline numbers to redress the grievances of common man, when there is non-compliance of the directions by the private hospitals/corporate hospitals,” the court ordered. It said local authorities should, as far as possible, decline permission for celebrations/gatherings even during the day hours. The court said States should consider curfew on weekends/nights. It said any decision to impose curfew and/or lockdown must be announced long in advance. The court issued a series of directions on fire safety in COVID-19 hospitals, including steps to be taken by the States to constitute committees to conduct monthly fire audits and the appointment of nodal officers in these institutions.

19 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala CM to kick-start election tour next week||The State committee of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Friday moved to secure an early-bird advantage in the campaigning for the Assembly elections in mid-2021. It hoped to steal a march on rival Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by foraying early into the electoral arena. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would spearhead the campaign. He would commence a tour of Kerala on December 22 to consolidate the advantageous position of the LDF in the local body elections. He would camp at district headquarters and interact with opinion leaders and a galaxy of persons emblematic of diverse sections of society. The LDF would use the input from the meetings to understand the development and social welfare aspirations of the people. The information would form the LDF electioneering strategy. The LDF felt that social security benefits doled out to the public during the pandemic had helped it tide over the "calumnious and recriminatory campaign" unleashed by Opposition parties against the government. Moreover, the voters had rewarded the LDF for the development work it had undertaken. The modernisation of Primary Health Centres (PHCs), taluk and district hospitals and government medical colleges had resonated among the masses. Schools’ transformation So had the transformation of government schools to international public school standards. The LDF has decided to forge ahead with the developmental activities and social welfare measures in the run-up to the Assembly polls. The meeting reportedly noted the inroads made by the BJP in urban areas. It also warily eyed the modest gains made by the Social Democratic Party of India and the Welfare Party of India. LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan said the people would forsake the politics of communal resentment promoted by the BJP and Islamist parties. The Congress rarely criticised the anti-people policies of the Central government. The Congress had lost credibility by aligning with the Sangh Parivar and Islamist forces simultaneously. The Indian Union Muslim League has embraced radical Islam. It would soon supersede and eclipse the Congress as the dominant party in what remains of the UDF. Muslim fundamentalism would encourage Hindu majoritarian politics in the State. The LDF would fight both. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said Jose K. Mani's induction had helped the LDF. The coalition remained robust as ever. It had the strength to settle any dispute between allies amicably.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pinarayi-to-kick-start-election-tour-next-week/article33369229.ece
19 December 2020||Chennai,||Research finds indomethacin beneficial in COVID-19 care||A pre-print published recently in Medrxiv has advanced the case to use indomethacin, a drug conventionally used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, for faster symptomatic relief and preventing progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. A total of 104 patients who had tested COVID-19 positive received the drug, along with standard care in two centres — Narayana Medical College, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, and Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, Maharashtra. The study was conceived by Rajan Ravichandran, senior nephrologist, MIOT Hospital, here, and executed along with R. Krishnakumar of the Department of Engineering Design at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, besides researchers from the participating hospitals. The authors have called for indomethacin to replace paracetamol if there is no contraindication for its use. It was an open-labelled, single-arm, propensity score matching study for the efficacy and safety of indomethacin. “Though a double arm randomised clinical trial would have been ideal, we felt that ethically it would be unfair to deny patients indomethacin, given that we had seen such good results in our pilot study,” Dr. Ravichandran said. “We did not refuse anyone the drug, but patients could opt out of the indomethacin arm,” he added. The study was done in two groups. One, involving 82 mild and moderate patients, used the Propensity Score Match technique to compare indomethacin and paracetamol-based treatments. In the second group, severe patients (22) were treated with indomethacin in addition to remdesivir. The authors wrote that those treated with indomethacin had a reduction in the number of days to become fever-free, and reduction in cough and muscle pain by half compared to the paracetamol set. Only one patient of 82 in the indomethacin arm of the first group required supplementary oxygen, while 28 of 109 patients on paracetamol required supplementary oxygen. No one in the second group deteriorated enough to require mechanical ventilation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/research-finds-indomethacin-beneficial-in-covid-19-care/article33369235.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||Ahead of key meeting, Cong. downplays dissent in ranks||Ahead of a crucial meeting of Congress president Sonia Gandhi with senior leaders including some from the group of 23 (G-23) dissenters, the Congress on Friday downplayed internal dissent by asserting that “all issues stood resolved” with the announcement of election of the next party president. At a press conference, the party’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Surjewala, said Rahul Gandhi was the “right person to lead the Congress and take on the Narendra Modi government”. However, several G-23 members were upset that the Congress officially downplayed the importance of Saturday’s meeting, with many asking what was the need for a meeting if “all issues were resolved”. Sources told The Hindu that Mr. Surjewala’s press conference prompted a late night meeting of some of the dissenters. Referring to Saturday’s meeting, Mr. Surjewala said, “This is not a meet of any special group of leaders. This is not a meet of any dissenters or rebels. Because we consider each leader and each worker as part of the family.” “All the issues stood resolved with the announcement of the next election of the Congress President. So, there are no internal issues of dissensions that are pending in the party of any nature,” he added. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Deputy Leader Anand Sharma, former Chief Ministers Bhupinder Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, former Union Ministers Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari are among the G-23 leaders who have been invited, sources said. There has been no official confirmation from the party about those attending the Saturday meeting. Talking about leadership, Mr. Surjewala said, “Congress workers and the electoral college including the AICC members of the party will choose a person best suited for the post. It is my belief and the belief of overwhelming majority of 99.9% leaders and workers that Rahul Gandhi is the right person to lead the party.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-downplays-internal-dissent/article33369247.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||Parliamentary panel calls for migrant workers’ database||A national database of migrant workers should be collated at the earliest to ensure that if ever there is a repeat of a COVID-19-like pandemic, the relief measures should reach the intended beneficiaries, the Standing Committee on Home Affairs has noted in its report. The committee also recommended an urgent review of the 123-year-old Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The committee, headed by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma, unanimously adopted the report “Management of COVID-19 pandemic and related issues” at a meeting on Friday. It noted that during the extended lockdown, the task of identifying the location and disbursing relief measures to the migrant workers became difficult as the Central government did not have any data of the migrant workers. “In the absence of a comprehensive national database, it is difficult to extend the relief measures by the government to the intended beneficiaries,” the committee report said. The database, as per the committee, should have details of the source State, the destination State, skill set of the worker and other contact details. Many members at Friday’s meeting noted that this pandemic might not be the last one to hit the country and the government should not depend on international trends to tackle it. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 — the two guiding laws during the pandemic — are insufficient, the committee has said. The Home Ministry is already reviewing the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The committee has recommended that a similar effort needs to be made for the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Ancient provisions “The Committee observes that the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, have helped in managing COVID-19 but this Act is outdated as it was framed in the colonial era, which was even well before the Spanish flu of 1918. Therefore, the committee recommends that the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, should be revisited updated and amended so that it is fully equipped to respond to the challenges posed by the an anticipated onset of the pandemic in the future,” the report noted. The committee said that the incoming international passengers who entered throughout March 2020 were screened only for high temperature. “Thus, asymptomatic patients as also those who travel after taking medicines for controlling temperature could not be diagnosed at the time when they could practically be the only source of infections of COVID-19 in the country,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parliamentary-panel-calls-for-migrant-workers-database/article33369255.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Pandemic far from over, says Soumya||Cautioning that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over though the world now seems to be closer to getting a vaccine, Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), on Friday said, “Though there is light at the end of the tunnel, the road ahead is still dark and long.” Participating in a panel discussion “The people need to know: the challenges of developing a COVID-19 vaccine”, Dr. Swaminathan said, “The next few months are going to be critical and tough for many countries and we have to keep ourselves safe while waiting for a vaccine. Luckily so far, we have seen a few vaccines that have met the benchmark of 50% efficacy in the interim results. That is very good news.” She said the WHO was working towards continuously providing accessible and reliable information during this pandemic. “We have been working very closely with social media and tech companies because we recognise that along with the pandemic, there has been something that we are calling the infodemic. It is important that we communicate with people and also listen and address their concerns. Majority of the people are keen on the vaccine and want to come out of this ongoing pandemic,” she said at the fifth Global Technology Summit organised by the External Affairs Ministry the think tank Carnegie India. Legal challenges Speaking about the need to protect vaccine manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits, Dr. Swaminathan said, “It’s only right that vaccine manufacturers are indemnified for a certain period of time.” “And for advance market commitment [AMC] countries, we are also creating a compensation fund, so that individual countries don’t have to get into legal negotiation with every individual,” she said. Also seeking government protection against “frivolous lawsuits” during the pandemic, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India (SII), who participated in the discussion, noted that “these lawsuits would bankrupt manufacturers”. “We need the government to step in and protect us as the U.S. government has done during this ongoing phase of pandemic,” he said. Explaining how the SII opted to work towards a COVID-19 vaccine early on in the pandemic, Mr. Poonawalla said: “If we rewind to the beginning of the pandemic, I had two choices — either we sit on the sidelines and wait for vaccines to prove itself in Phase 3 trials, or we commit heavily in partnerships, tech transfers and re-jigging of facilities to make COVID-19 vaccines. It was a big gamble when we chose to produce millions of doses in advance. We chose the technology carefully with the criteria of affordable pricing.” Equal access Stating that his company believed in equal access of vaccine to all, Mr. Poonawalla said people now needed to be cautious for the next few years till the country was able to vaccinate majority of its population or attain herd immunity against the virus. “Along with vaccines we need to keep COVID-safety measure in mind,” Mr. Poonawalla said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-far-from-over-says-soumya/article33369812.ece
19 December 2020||Kozhikode,||BJP Central leadership to look into Kerala factionalism||With the factionalism in the Kerala unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party coming into the open more intensely, the Central leadership of the party is giving a serious thought to rejigging the organisational set-up in State. The intervention of the Central leadership comes close on the heels of State vice president Shobha Surendran shooting off a protest letter seeking the removal of State president K. Surendran for his “dictatorial style” of functioning and “poor performance” of the party in the local body election. Besides, former president and national executive committee member P.K. Krishna Das called up the BJP president to apprise him of the situation in Kerala. Realistic assessment The four big decision makers of the party — Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, president J.P. Nadda, and general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santhosh — will examine the performance of the party and make a realistic assessment to face the challenges of the Assembly polls. Ineffective electoral strategy, selection of candidates, factionalism, acrimonious infighting, and failure to convey the Central schemes to the electorate led to the dismal performance of the party at the hustings. All decisions on the matter would be taken in the first week of January, sources said. 500 seats lost A senior party functionary in New Delhi told The Hindu on Friday that the performance of the BJP had been gloomy even though the party secured about 14% of the total votes polled in the election. Though the party individually won about 1,600 seats, it also lost over 500 seats that its nominees had won in the 2015 polls. Also, before the polls, the State leadership painted a rosy picture for the Central leaders that the party would come to power in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and form the ruling councils in Thrissur and Kozhikode Corporations, emerge victorious in 10 municipalities and block panchayats, and another 200 grama panchayats. All these calculations have now fallen flat. Over 15 years The Central leadership, the sources said, was of the view that the BJP leadership in the State had only seen the party’s growth in terms of arithmetic progression and not geometrical progression over the past 15 years. The factions led by Mr. Krishna Das and also Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan all these years indulged in carving a niche for themselves within the organisational apparatus rather than preparing the party to take on the established coalitions, the sources said.

19 December 2020||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan High Court allows private schools to collect fees||The Rajasthan High Court on Friday allowed private schools to collect fees from the parents of their students in terms of the State government’s order issued in October this year, subject to the special determination of fees for the period when they remained closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will be able to charge 70% of tuition fee, while those affiliated to the Rajasthan Board will charge 60% of tuition fee. This was recommended in the State government’s order issued on October 28. A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty pronounced the judgment on a bunch of appeals filed by a dozen parents’ association against an interim order of a Single-Judge Bench as well as the writ petitions moved by some private schools and the Society of Catholic Education Institutions in Rajasthan. The court said there was no need for interference in the State government’s policy decision, as it had tried to strike a balance between the schools’ management and the parents. “The government has taken necessary steps in due exercise of its powers in the wake of the unprecedented situation of COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the plight of citizens,” the 45-page judgment said. The State government had deferred the collection of school fees for three months on April 9 this year and subsequently extended the order till the opening of schools with the stipulation that the schools would not strike off name of any students for non-payment of fees. The court directed all private schools to form necessary bodies required for special determination of fees within 15 days. The schools will determine the fees for the period when they remained closed during the pandemic as well as after their reopening in 2020-21, in terms of the provisions of section 8 of the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-high-court-allows-private-schools-to-collect-fees/article33369613.ece
19 December 2020||KOCHI,||Guruvayur Devaswom cannot give funds to CMDRF: HC||A Full Bench of the Kerala High Court on Friday held that the Guruvayur Devaswom managing committee has no power to contribute amounts from the Devaswom fund either to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) or to any other government agencies under the provision of the Guruvayur Devaswom Act. The Bench of Justice A. Hariprasad, Justice Anu Sivaraman and Justice M.R. Anitha observed that “all properties dedicated to or endowed in the name of Lord Guruvayurappan or any property acquires in any manner by the Guruvayur Devaswom shall vest in the idol of Lord Guruvayurappa, consecrated in Sreekrishna Temple, Guruvayur.” The Bench passed the verdict on a petition filed by R.V. Babu, general secretary, Hindu Aikya Vedi Kerala; A. Nagesh, BJP Thrissur district president; Bijesh Kumar, general secretary, Guruvayur Kshetra Raksha Samithi; challenging the decision of the Devaswom to contribute Rs. 5 crore to the CMDRF. The Bench made it clear that the managing committee was bound to administer all properties belonging to the Guruvayur Devaswom and their status as a ‘trustee.’ Though the administration of the temple was a secular act, the property of the temple was religious trust property. Managers of religious trusts should adhere to legal principles when dealing with trust properties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/guruvayur-devaswom-cannot-give-funds-to-cmdrf-hc/article33369540.ece

19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||87% loss in passenger revenue due to COVID-19: Railways||The Railways have so far incurred an 87% loss in passenger revenue, down from Rs. 53,000 crore last year to Rs. 4,600 crore, owing to COVID-19. However, an increase in freight loading revenue is expected, compensated by the enhanced transportation of non-traditional commodities such as grains and fertilizers. At a press conference on Friday, Railway Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vinod Kumar Yadav said the Railways were working towards the objective of meeting the operational expenditure from their own revenue earnings. A projected increase in loading revenue was an indicator of an improving economy and industrial growth, he stated. Cumulative loading The Railways’ yearly cumulative loading was currently about 97%, with a deficit of 10% in revenue, which was expected to cross last year’s corresponding figures. The Railways would circulate the final draft of the National Rail Plan to all the stakeholders. The plan was expected to be finalised by January. A subset of the plan was business and infrastructure development in order to attain the objective of 2,024 million-tonne freight loading capacity by 2024. Vision-2024 would be implemented with a capital expenditure of Rs. 2.90 lakh crore. Mr. Yadav said the Railways currently accounted for about 27% of the overall transportation of goods in the country and the plan was to increase it to 45% by 2030. In 2019, the total freight movement was 4,700 million tonnes and the Railways’ share was 1,210 million tonnes. As per an estimate, the freight ecosystem would reach 6,400 million tonnes by 2026. The National Rail Plan aimed to reduce the transit time and cost, rationalise freight tariff and also bring down the operating cost, besides achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The average speed of freight movement had to be taken to 50 km per hour. As the regular passenger trains were not operating due to COVID-19-related restrictions, the Railways was able to achieve a speed of 47-48 km per hour. Under the Vision-2024 project, the Railways planned multi-tracking of 16,373 km. It would include 58 super critical projects, 68 critical projects, 32 other essential projects, 20 additional coal connectivity projects, 146 railway electrification projects, 120 traffic facility works, 686 signalling and telecommunication works, northeast connectivity projects and elimination of manned level crossings on certain routes by March 2025. Freight corridors Three dedicated freight corridors, spread across 3,958 km, were to be completed. Several new high-speed rail corridors have been identified, while the Varanasi high-speed project was underway. Mr. Yadav said the Railways was currently operating 1,089 special trains. Suburban services had resumed by 88% in Mumbai, 60% in Kolkata and 50% Chennai, in coordination with the respective States. During festivals, 618 trains were operated and reserved seats allocated to all passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/87-loss-in-passenger-revenue-railways/article33369265.ece

19 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Hyderabad techie in debt trap ends life||A 29-year-old techie was found dead at his residence in Rajendranagar on Wednesday afternoon. However, the incident came to light only on Thursday after his wife lodged a complaint with the local police alleging that her husband, P. Sunil, took the extreme step due to harassment and humiliation by the app-based finance companies. Sunil, who lost his job during COVID-19 lockdown, availed loans in small amounts through various apps to meet his monthly expenses and to clear existing loans and credit cards bills, police said. This is the third such death in Telangana in the last one week due to harassment of app-based finance companies. Earlier this week, Eddu Srawan Yadav (23) from Narsapur, Medak and Kirni Mounika (28), AEO from Nangunur in Siddipet committed suicide over harassment and humiliation by these companies. “He was being threatened and blackmailed by representatives of instant loan mobile app companies, who also phoned and messaged his friends and family members of the amount he defaulted,” Rajendranagar police said. On Wednesday afternoon, Sunil, a native of Guntur, died by hanging himself from a ceiling fan, while his wife was sitting in another room. “He ran into due to job loss due to lockdown. In order to overcome his debts and to meet regular expenses, he started taking loans from online instant loan apps,” police said. According to the investigators, Sunil availed nearly Rs. 2 lakh from various instant loan apps. “As he failed to repay the loans, some app companies started blackmailing him and threatening him by contacting his family members and friends over social media platforms, including WhatsApp,” they said. Even his father and wife got calls from the app companies declaring him a defaulter. When he learnt about those calls, Sunil got depressed and committed suicide by hanging at his flat at Kismathpur. Based on the complaint lodged by his wife, a case under Sections 420, 306, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code and 67 IT Act was registered against some financiers. Preliminary police investigation revealed that Sunil took loans through some 35 apps, including In Cash, Cash era, Cash lion, Mastermelon, Lucky wallet, Coco cash, Rupee Pus, Indian Loan and Credit finch “The genuinity of these apps and the transactions made by the deceased are being probed. These companies allegedly obtain data such as contacts, photographs from mobile phones of the customers and contacted them to defame or blackmail the customer to make the repayment,” police said.

19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||Builders pour out woes against new registration process||As the technical glitches continue to hamper the registration of the non-agricultural properties started from December 14, builders are raising concerns over the absence of several key provisions in the new registration processes. Builders lamented that the portal is generating its own sale deed format, which was not in conformity with the RERA guidelines, and there was insistence on payment of full consideration without an option for semi-finished registrations. The server is not recognizing the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation lands for payment of stamp duty and registration fee for slot-booking as the ownership details are not uploaded in Dharani portal. As a result, properties under the GHMC and other municipalities were being displayed in the portal. Excluded areas “The server is notifying the sale, mortgage and gift deeds relating to the GHMC and municipality limits and not the properties under the TSIIC,” the builders claimed. The server is seeking information with regard to property tax identification number regarding only GHMC and other municipal areas and it had not so far been upgraded with the provision for the lands owned by the TSIIC. “Dharani portal is being used in full contrary to the orders issued by the High Court,” a builder said on the condition of anonymity adding personal information with respect to authorized signatories like Aadhaar and PAN card are being sought. Entry of data pertaining to vendors name was only possible while the other data is not being accepted in the Excel sheet format, they said citing that the message “please upload the data in correct format” that was appearing every time a transaction was being processed. Payment options There is no option clause for payment of consideration details through DD/cheque/cash and there was no provision for taking the details of more than one vendors as well as purchasers. “Instruments like mortgage areas deed, rental/lease deeds, gift and exchange deeds are some of the basic needs of the business, but there is no provision in this direction,” the builders lamented. They also expressed concern that there was no clarity on the legal status of the PTIN and whether the authorities concerned could identify the properties on the basis of the PTIN. There was absence of mechanism to check assigning multiple PTINs to same property as also the documents which are relied on for assigning the PTIN. Sanctity of data The builders are also questioning the sanctity of the municipal or panchayat data in regard to ownership and other details and they were found sceptical about the utility of the passbook on whether it is going to be a title for the purposes of bank loans. “A legal scrutiny of PTIN and passbooks is required as the opinion of the banks forms the core of the issue,” the builders claimed. The issue of insistence on electricity number for under construction units had also come under scrutiny as the builders aver that these numbers would not be allotted to under construction units. There was also no clarity on whether the registration would be based on general power of attorney and special power of attorney in case vendor is not able to make it to the sub-registrar’s office. “There is no provision for registration based on representation and no provision for registration on commission at the residence in case of sick, aged and handicapped persons,” the builders alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/builders-pour-out-their-woes/article33369925.ece
19 December 2020||Kolkata,||Ahead of Shah’s rally, many quit Trinamool||A day ahead of Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s scheduled rally in West Bengal’s Midnapore on Saturday saw frenetic activity among the rank and file of the Trinamool Congress, with many resigning and giving ample hints that they would join the BJP. Mr. Shah meanwhile arrived in Kolkata late on Friday evening. Speculation is rife that several Trinamool leaders, including party heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, will join the BJP at the rally. The latest addition to the list of dissident Trinamool leaders was Barrackpore MLA Silbhadra Datta, who sent in his resignation to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Speaking to journalists, Mr. Datta said he had resigned from the party but will remain an MLA. Thursday had a steady stream of resignations. While Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari and Pandaveshwar MLA Jeetendra Tewari resigned in the morning, later in the evening Shyamapada Mukherjee, another former Minister, joined the list. Along with these leaders, TMC MP from Bardhaman Purba Sunil Kumar Mondal and leader Diptangshu Chowdhury have also struck a discordant note and are likely to join the BJP. On Friday, the list of disgruntled leaders crossed a dozen, including a number of district and block leaders who resigned, expressing their support to Mr. Adhikari. Posters of Mr. Adhikari have come up in several places in Kolkata and other parts of the State. The former Minister meanwhile, was provided security by the Union Home Ministry. While several Trinamool leaders have indicated their willingness to join the BJP, Asansol MP and Union Minister Babul Supriyo came out publicly against the possibility of inclusion of Jeetendra Tewari, saying that he was behind the attack on many BJP workers in Asansol. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh appeared to echo Mr. Supriyo, adding that Mr. Tewari had come in the way of development of Asansol. Similarly protests erupted in Bankura BJP leadership over the possibility of inclusion of Shyamapada Mukherjee in the party. CPI(M) MLA Tapashi Mondal from Haldia has also expressed displeasure with her party. A video of Ms. Mondal having a meeting with Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh also surfaced on social media. The CPI(M) leadership described the action of the MLA as a “treachery”. In a late night development, Banshri Maity, TMC MLA from Kanthi Uttar, also resigned from the party. Her constituency is in Purba Medinipur district. According to her letter, she has quit from the primary membership and all posts and assignment given by TMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ahead-of-shahs-rally-many-quit-trinamool/article33369241.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||Centre seeks better security coordination||The Union Home Ministry on Friday asked the top officers of the West Bengal government to ensure coordination with Central agencies for better security arrangements of individuals with Central security cover. Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and Director-General of Police Virendra were asked to appear before Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Friday days after an attack on the convoy of BJP president J.P Nadda in the Diamond Harbour area of West Bengal. No Delhi visit After the two officers expressed their inability to travel to Delhi because of the pandemic, a video conference was held. The Ministry on Thursday wrote for a second time to the officials to appear before the Union Home Secretary in Delhi to discuss the law and order situation. In the virtual meeting, the two officers are said to have asserted the State’s inability to relieve three IPS officers for Central deputation. The Ministry had earlier ordered three senior IPS officers responsible for Mr. Nadda’s security to report for Central deputation. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Thursday that the orders were a “blatant misuse of emergency provision of IPS Cadre Rule 1954” and that West Bengal was “not going to cow down in front of expansionist and undemocratic force”. However, the Home Ministry is the cadre controlling authority of IPS officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-seeks-better-security-coordination/article33369249.ece
19 December 2020||BENGALURU,||Karnataka Council Secretary issued show-cause notice||Close on the heels of the unruly episode in the Legislative Council on December 15, Council Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty has turned the heat on the Upper House Secretary by issuing a show-cause notice to her, accusing her of irresponsibility and dereliction of duty. Mr. Shetty, whose resignation is being demanded by the Opposition parties, has issued the notice (dated December 15) to House Secretary Mahalakshmi. Mr. Shetty in the notice has cited allowing the Deputy Chairman to sit in the presiding officer’s chair even before quorum bell stopped, closing of the designated entrance of the Chairman to the House, and “misguiding” the Deputy Chairman to continue the session though he had unauthorisedly occupied the seat as grounds to believe that she had indulged in dereliction of duty. Maintaining that her conduct was not befitting a Karnataka legislature staff and that she had overstepped her jurisdiction, Mr. Shetty asked her to show cause within 48 hours of receiving the notice as to why action should not be initiated against her under the Karnataka Civil Services rules. He also directed her to submit a report on the incidents right from the commencement of the session till the end so that he could provide a factual response to public criticism and media editorials on the unruly episode witnessed by the Council. He pointed out that she was witness to the entire episode. Mr. Shetty’s notice has provided a new dimension to the December 15 incidents as the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress have been accusing each other as being responsible for the episode that coincided with the BJP members’ plans to initiate a no- confidence motion against the Chairman. Already, the BJP has petitioned Governor Vajubai R. Vala in this regard and sought his intervention. They have appealed to the Governor to direct the Chairman to convene the session immediately to help take up no-confidence motion. While the ruling BJP members have taken exception to the Congress members allegedly manhandling the Deputy Chairman who was in the chair, the Congress members have expressed anger over blocking the entry of the Chairman into the House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chairman-issues-show-cause-notice-to-council-secretary/article33369446.ece

19 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Congress zeroes in on reasons for debacle||A protracted meeting of the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on Thursday reportedly blamed lack of dynamic leadership, inadequate election preparedness, scarcity of funds and ill-informed selection of candidates for the party’s debacle in the recent local body elections. The Congress largely failed to actively enrol voters in advance. A large number of women Congress candidates, most of them new to electoral politics, felt unsupported by the party. The party was largely unsuccessful in ironing out differences between factions at the ward level. It was reportedly found wanting in establishing a connect with social organisations and religious communes. Some leaders reportedly dismissed the argument that the social welfare measures of the government, including free rations and distribution of food kits, had carried the day for the Left Democratic Front. They pointed out that the Congress had registered modest gain in several districts despite several handicaps and apparent advantages of the ruling front. The PAC reportedly felt the selection of candidates did not always reflect winnability factor and age, caste and religious demographic patterns and appeared to lean heavily towards appeasing factional leaders. Moreover, a few influential leaders were away from the hustings and confined themselves mostly to press conferences and statements. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said on Friday that the party messaging did not seem to have percolated from the leadership to the voters entirely. An attempt was afoot in the media to "isolate and attack" him for the failure. He compared himself to a deer beset by wolves. "Success has many fathers. But, failure is an orphan," he said. Mr. Ramachandran had reportedly come under criticism for his "obsolete, cut-off and impervious" leadership style. Mr. Ramachandran said the PAC had perceived a shift in the Congress votes. But he did not identify which party or coalition had benefited from the swing. The PAC saw a conducive political climate for a resilient Congress to emerge victorious in the Assembly elections in 2021. KC(M) issue Mr. Ramachandran stayed clear of stating whether the PAC had deliberated the "political cost" of ousting Jose K. Mani from the coalition.

The High Court had suo motu summoned the State counsel to assist it in deciding “whether in circumstances prevailing in the State of Andhra Pradesh, the court can record a finding that there is constitutional breakdown in the State or not”. The State said an application to recall the October 1 order was not taken up by the High Court, compelling the government to move the top court. The government said the High Court’s observation violated the Basic Structure doctrine of the Constitution. “Under the constitutional framework, it is not for the courts to decide as to whether there is a constitutional breakdown in a State. The said power has been specifically conferred upon a different constitutional authority – and rightly so. It is needless to mention that the constitutional courts do not have any judicially discoverable and manageable standards to determine if there has been a constitutional breakdown,” the petition contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-finds-hc-order-on-ap-govt-disturbing/article33369236.ece

Mr. Modi proceeded to give a point-by-point rebuttal of all the objections raised by the agitating farmers groups and the Opposition parties. “These are reforms that have been thought about by many governments in the past, discussed across a wide section of people, and finally implemented by our government,” he said. ‘Urea shortage tackled’ He accused the Opposition parties of opposing the three farm laws just because it was the Modi-led government that had initiated them. Mr. Modi said, “Our government not only implemented the Swaminathan Committee report but also resolved the chronic urea shortage faced by farmers. Also, new fertilizer plants will be coming up in Gorakhpur, Barauni, Sidri, Talcher and Ramagundam, which will make urea abundantly available and these plants will also give employment to thousands,” he said. “MSP has remained, and will remain. It is a myth being spread that MSP will be discontinued,” he said. “The three farm laws have been in place for the last six months and not only has MSP been paid but procurement has also been done at record levels,” he claimed, citing figures for the same. Mr. Modi asserted that there was no move to dismantle the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) or ‘mandis’ under the new laws. “Not a single mandi has been shut down in the past six months that the laws have been in place,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-makes-a-strong-pitch-to-protesting-farmers/article33369237.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||CBI: Hathras victim was gang-raped, murdered||The CBI has invoked Sections 302 (punishment for murder), 376 (punishment for rape), 376A (punishment for inflicting injury while committing rape, resulting in the death of the woman) and 376D (gang-rape) of the Indian Penal Code, besides the relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act. The four accused, who were arrested by the local police, are currently in judicial custody. On October 1, Uttar Pradesh’s Additional Director-General of Police (Law & Order) Prashant Kumar said the forensic report from the government laboratory in Agra confirmed that the victim was not raped. He also cited the autopsy report to corroborate his point. “The lab report clearly says that no sperm was found in the sample,” he said. However, he added that the victim first mentioned about rape on September 22 and that the samples were sent to the laboratory on September 25. Stating that the truth had prevailed once again, All-India Congress Committee general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the filing of a chargesheet raised serious questions on the Adityanath government, the police, ADG (Law and Order), the District Magistrate of Hathras and the senior functionaries of the State administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-hathras-victim-was-gang-raped-murdered/article33369238.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Talks on to give another chance to IAS aspirants||The Union government told the Supreme Court on Friday that discussions were on for granting another chance to aspirants of the civil services examination, especially those whose last attempt at cracking the preliminary exam expired in October. “The Centre as well as the UPSC [Union Public Service Commission] are taking decisions on a proposal to give one more opportunity to the affected students due to the pandemic,” a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said. The court was hearing a petition filed by 59 aspirants, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and advocate Anushree Prashit Kapadia. They were either unable to attend the October preliminary exam or handicapped in their preparations due to the pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns. They argued for a second opportunity and corresponding age relaxation. They said their preparations were crippled by lockdowns and restrictions. Coaching centres were closed and study material was scarce. Many could not even attend the exam. Last chance candidates On October 26, the Department of Personnel and Training informed the court that the government was considering giving last-chance candidates another shot at the exam. On Friday, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said the issue was not adversarial and a decision would be taken on giving another opportunity in the next three or four weeks. The government referred to the September 30 order of the court in the case of Vasireddy Govardhana Sai Prakash v UPSC . In September, the court refused to postpone the October prelims but recorded the government’s assurance to take an expeditious decision on granting a second chance to “last-attempters”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/discussions-on-to-give-another-chance-to-ias-aspirants-govt/article33369261.ece
19 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||All have equal right to practise religion: HC||The Allahabad High Court on Friday said no coercive action should be taken against a Muslim labourer Nadeem, who had filed a petition seeking the quashing of an FIR against him under the new Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Article 25 provides that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion, the judges said. “Present is a case where all the allegations are prima facie based on suspicion,” observed a Division Bench of Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Vivek Agarwal. “There is no material before us that any force or coercive process is being adopted by the petitioner to convert the wife of the informant,” the court said. Mr. Nadeem and his brother were booked on November 29 for allegedly trying to force a married Hindu woman to marry the former for converting her to Islam. In his complaint, Akshay Kumar Tyagi, who works as a labour contractor in Haridwar where he has been living with his wife Parul and two children, alleged that one Nadeem had “trapped” his wife in a “net of love” with the aim of converting her. Mr. Nadeem, 32, a resident of Bhagwanpur in Haridwar, is a labourer, and used to frequent their house leading to his friendship with Ms. Parul, said Mr. Tyagi. Mr. Nadeem wanted to marry Ms. Parul for conversion, alleged Mr. Tyagi. In his petition, Mr. Nadeem submitted that he had no connection with Mr. Tyagi or his wife and alleged that the latter had lodged a case to avoid paying Rs. 9,000, which he owed him. The court issued notice to Mr. Tyagi and asked the respondents to file their counter affidavits within two weeks. Ordering that no coercive action be taken against the petitioner till the next date of the hearing on January 7, the court clubbed the case with a PIL that has challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-have-equal-right-to-practise-religion-hc/article33369813.ece
19 December 2020||Shiv Sahay Singh Kolkata,||Barrackpore MLA resigns from Trinamool Congress||Barrackpore MLA Silbhadra Datta on Friday resigned from the Trinamool Congress, sending his resignation to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Mr. Datta has been vocal against the party for quite some time. He had also announced his decision not to contest the coming Assembly polls on Trinamool ticket. Mr. Datta told journalists that he would remain an MLA. The development comes a day after Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari and Pandaveshwar MLA Jeetendra Tewari, resigned from the party. On Thursday evening, Shyamapada Mukherjee, former Minister and Trinamool leader, announced his decision to quit the party. Along with these leaders, party MP from Bardhaman Purba Sunil Kumar Mondal and Diptangshu Chowdhury have also struck a discordant note and are likely to join the BJP. A number of block leaders of the Trinamool have also resigned, expressing their support for Mr. Adhikari. His posters came up on Friday morning in several places in Kolkata and other parts of the State. When all eyes are on Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally at Midnapore on Saturday, discontent has come to the fore in the BJP. The party’s Asansol MP Babul Supriyo came out publicly against the possibility of inclusion of Mr. Tewari, saying he was behind the attack on many BJP workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/barrackpore-mla-resigns-from-trinamool-congress/article33369515.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||India, China agree to hold next round of LAC talks||They also agreed to hold the ninth round of Corps Commander-level talks “at an early date” so that “both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity”, the statement said. A statement from China’s Foreign Ministry said both sides agreed to “focus on the disengagement of front-line troops and take concrete measures to deal with the issues on the ground to further de-escalate the border situation” and to hold the ninth round of commander-level talks “as soon as possible to properly resolve remaining issues on the ground and jointly maintain peace in the border area”. At the last round of talks between Corps Commanders on November 6, both sides continued discussing modalities to finalise a plan for phased disengagement. One of the sticking points is China’s insistence on India first withdrawing from the strategic heights it occupied in late August south of Pangong Lake in response to China’s transgressions. Tensions have remained high south of the lake, where shots were also fired in warning, marking the first such instance of firing since 1975. Officials told The Hindu, following the last round, that proposals were under discussion and would be taken up at the ninth round, and “once agreed upon, it will be done in multiple phases with on the ground verification after each step”. North of the lake, China has moved troops up to Finger 4 since May and has prevented India from reaching Finger 8, up to where India has patrolled previously. Under the first phase of disengagement, both sides had moved back in the Galwan Valley and in the Gogra-Hot Springs area. The situation at Pangong Lake remains unresolved, as also in the Depsang plains in the far north where India has been prevented from reaching patrolling points in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-agree-to-hold-next-round-of-lac-talks/article33369221.ece
19 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||High Court notice to Uttar Pradesh on conversion law||The Allahabad High Court on Friday issued a notice to the U.P. government on a PIL petition challenging the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Petitioner Saurabh Kumar of Prayagraj prayed for declaring the ordinance ultra vires, saying it was “both morally and constitutionally repugnant”. A Division Bench heard the petitioner and the Additional Advocate-General representing the government. The court allowed the government time to file a counter affidavit on or before January 4. A rejoinder affidavit, if any, may be filed by the petitioner on or before January 6, 2021, the court said. The matter has been listed for January 7, on which date the writ petition would be heard for final disposal. The PIL plea also prayed for an interim direction to the government not to take any coercive action in cases of conversion by marriage or for the purpose thereof. The provisions gave the state policing powers over a citizen’s choice of life partner or religion militate against the fundamental rights to individual autonomy, privacy, human dignity and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner submitted. The ordinance led to an unreasonable intrusion into the domain of personal autonomy, the petitioner said, referring to the advance notice of 60 days required to be given to the District Magistrate before an intended conversion, which was to be followed by a police inquiry into the circumstances of conversion. “The very concept of forcing an individual to explain and justify a decision, which is closely personal to him or her, before an officer of the State is contrary to constitutionalism,” the petitioner argued. The Constitution imposed limitations on State power and burdened the State to explain and justify the decisions taken by it.The ordinance inversed this equation, the petition stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-court-notice-to-uttar-pradesh-on-conversion-law/article33369876.ece

Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said Mr. Modi and his Ministers should apologise to the farmers for branding them as ‘Khalistanis’ and part of ‘tukde tukde’ gang. He held the Modi government responsible for the death of 24 farmers during the protests. The party said the government must give up its stance of no repeal and immediately roll back the laws. Mr. Surjewala said that as Gujarat Chief Minister and head of a working group of CMs on agriculture years ago, Mr. Modi had suggested that minimum support price (MSP) should be given statutory provision and legal guarantee. Responding to Prime Minister’s outreach among farmers in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress leader claimed that 47 of the 269 government registered agricultural produce markets have not had any business ever since the news farm laws were brought in; while another 143 farm produce markets had seen only 50% business.

The fresh cases took the overall tally to 8,04,650. Another 1,170 persons were discharged and 12 persons succumbed to the infection. So far, 7,82,915 persons have been discharged, while the toll has reached 11,954. A total of 9,781 persons remain under treatment. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said Chennai was registering a positivity rate below 3.5% continuously. “This may be good news but it was during such times that places like Delhi and countries such as the U.S. and those in Europe were casual owing to fewer infections, resulting in a faster spread of the disease,” he said. Of the fresh cases, Chennai reported 341, followed by Coimbatore with 115 cases. While Chengalpattu had 69 cases, Tiruvallur had 51 and Tiruppur 43 cases. There were 41 cases in Salem. While Perambalur had no fresh cases, the remaining districts reported less than 40 cases each. In whichever district that had less than 10 cases, the aim was “virus suppression”. No district should become complacent owing to the decline in cases, Mr. Radhakrishnan said. The State government was keen on reducing the case fatality. The weekly case fatality was 0.86% two weeks ago, and 1.1% now, he added. A total of 75,347 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. So far, 1,33,10,701 samples were tested in the State. One more private laboratory — Arthi CT and MRI Scans, R.S. Puram, Coimbatore — was approved for testing. Following the COVID-19 cluster at the IIT-Madras, the Health Department has arranged for walk-in test facilities for educational institutions, working women’s hostels and mansions where group dining happens, Mr. Radhakrishnan said. “We are intensifying testing. The Greater Chennai Corporation carries out 11,000 tests a day, of which 7,000 are their direct samples. We are carrying out intensive testing in markets too,” he said. Urging the public to continue wearing masks, he said vaccination, when ready, would be rolled out in phases. “The Centre would first supply the vaccines for doctors, nurses and healthcare workers. They would be followed by frontline workers, and subsequently, persons aged above 50.” He said the government had identified 46,000 places for vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-reports-1134-fresh-infections/article33369336.ece
19 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Deep sea fishing scheme makes slow progress||With the Sri Lankan authorities resuming the arrest of Tamil Nadu fishermen for having crossed over the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL), the focus turns to the pace of implementation of a Rs. 1,600-crore scheme, billed a few years ago as the remedy to the Palk Bay fishing conflict. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the scheme in July 2017 in Rameswaram, whose fishermen have been at the centre of the conflict, the Central and State governments expected that in three years, 2,000 trawlers would be replaced with deep-sea fishing boats having long lines and gill nets. It was planned to have 500 boats built in the first year (2017-18). Of the unit cost of each vessel (Rs. 80 lakh), 50% would be borne by the Centre, 20% by the State government and 10% by the beneficiary, and the remaining 20% would be met through institutional financing. More importantly, the Centre feels that deep sea fishing is the “only solution” to promote ecologically sustainable fishing and reduce “fishing pressure” around the close proximity of the IMBL and the incidents of cross-border fishing. Vessels handed over But when Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, through video-conference, handed over eight vessels to beneficiaries on December 11, the State government’s release stated that 24 boats had so far been given away. On Friday, K. Gopal, Principal Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, said the figure now stood at 39. A total of 689 applications had been received, of which agreements were signed for 100 beneficiaries. Work orders had been issued in respect of 96. Notwithstanding the gap between the progress and the target, the Central and State governments are happy with what has been achieved. In a written response to The Hindu , the Central government’s Department of Fisheries said the scheme, launched under the Blue Revolution programme, had given “very positive and encouraging results” as “it is providing economically higher returns” to the fishermen concerned. Dr. Gopal said the development of trawling boats, introduced under the Indo-Norwegian collaboration in the 1960s, peaked only in the 1990s, whereas “this scheme is playing out faster”. As for the delay, the Central government’s Department of Fisheries acknowledged that it took “considerable time” to design the prototype of a deep-sea fishing vessel — which was decided by the State government in consultation with the fishermen — incorporating technical inputs from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) and Cochin Shipyard Limited. The applications were obtained from the beneficiaries only on finalisation of the prototype in early 2018. Shift to new venture Also, “it takes some time to shift the fishermen from their traditional methods to a new venture, as it involves behavioural changes and requires constant motivation, which the State government has taken up very seriously,” the Central department said. It added that the State government had empanelled 20 shipyards, besides Cochin Shipyard, to “expedite the manufacturing of deep-sea fishing vessels”. On the reports of the financial institutions’ reluctance to lend to the fishermen, Dr. Gopal said his department was pursuing the matter with the lenders and was also taking steps “to create fish farmer producer organisations or companies which can increase the coverage”. The Central government’s Department of Fisheries, while stating that it had “not received any such report regarding constraint in institutional financing”, suggested that the financial arrangements be made through the National Cooperative Development Corporation, for which discussions had already begun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deep-sea-fishing-scheme-makes-slow-progress/article33369346.ece

19 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Crowds queue up for permits to open shops on Marina||The Ripon Buildings, the headquarters of the Greater Chennai Corporation, has been witnessing long queues for two days with the civic body issuing over 5,400 applications for the allotment of shops on Marina Beach. Applications are being issued under two categories — category A for vendors who already have shops on the beach and B for others. The issuance of applications started on December 14. There has been a sudden rise in the distribution in the last two days and the number of applicants are now running into a few thousands. Shops selling eatables, soft drinks, snacks and trinkets will be permitted. Those dealing in cloth, tattoos, books, electric and electronic goods will not be allowed, said sources. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (revenue and finance) Meghanatha Reddy said the response from the public was good. “An average of 1,000 applicants a day have come in. As per the directions of the High Court, work to issue smart carts is on in full swing,” he said. According to officials, the first batch of 300 smart carts are expected to be launched on the beach by January-end. All 900 smart carts will be launched by March. However, residents of fishing hamlets, who used to run shops on the Marina said they had been managing them for over three decades, and a reduction in the number of allotments to them, from 1996 to just 600, would mean a loss of livelihood. “It was the idea of senior police officials to allow us to sell food items on the Marina. It was meant to rehabilitate fishermen and also to ensure the safety of visitors. It helped at least 500 single mothers,” said K. Bharathi of Nochikuppam. Sashikumar of the Ayodhyakuppam Marina Beach Vendors’ Association said they had been attending meetings with Corporation officials, with no end in sight. “They say there were cartels on the beach, managing the shops. But those have all gone now,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crowds-queue-up-for-permits-to-open-shops-on-marina/article33369830.ece

They, however, sought time till Monday to get instructions from their clients on the plea seeking permission to meditate. During the course of arguments, Justice Kumar told the counsel for the defendants that it is the culture of Indians to treat even their enemies with compassion and respect.

In a panel discussion on the film House Owner, depicting the challenges of caregivers of those affected by Alzheimer’s, at the Frame of Mind 2020 film festival organised by the Schizophrenia Research Foundation, he said the film, directed by Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, accurately showed their daily experiences. He recollected how several caregivers break down and feel devastated when their loved ones, with dementia, do not recognise them. “People often confuse normal ageing with dementia. This needs to change. If you find anything different from your previous lifestyle, then please seek medical attention,” he said. The film’s director and actor, Ms. Ramakrishnan, spoke about how her sister’s experience with her brother-in-law, during the floods in the city in 2015, inspired her to make the film. “I wanted to show the way caregivers were tending to Alzheimer’s patients and their spirit of survival during such a crisis. For 30-33 hours, with no help — for them, it felt like reliving their whole life together, and that’s what the film is all about.” Gomathy Radhakrishnan, who tended to her mother-in-law who had dementia, spoke about the challenges she faced. Mitchell G. Weiss, chairperson of Frame of Mind, said the film also beautifully showcased the love story between the two individuals during a crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/depicting-challenges-of-dealing-with-dementia-on-screen/article33369831.ece
19 December 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Stalin criticises Central Ministers for calling farmers ‘anti-nationals’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday condemned the remarks of some Union Ministers of the BJP labellingfarmers protesting in Delhias anti-nationals, terrorists, and stooges of foreign governments. He termed such descriptions “shameful”. Speaking at a fast organised in support of the farmers by the DMK, Mr. Stalin said the farmers were being labelled that way by the Central government when all they wanted was a repeal of the three laws. Leaders and functionaries of the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance also took part in the fast. Centre not bothered “The whole of India is up against these farm laws. Delhi is under siege. Farmers from North India are going towards Delhi with their families and are braving the harsh winter, staying on the roads. But the BJP government is not bothered about any of this. All the farmers are protesting against these three Acts, as these will destroy their livelihood and lives,” he charged. Mr. Stalin said the government should have held talks with the farmers and a discussion in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha before tabling the bills. The government should have upheld democracy. “But the Central government didn’t do any of this. What is the urgency to bring in these laws, for whose protection have they brought these in?” he asked. The DMK president alleged that the Central government was enacting a drama saying that it was holding talks with the farmers. The farmers, however, have only one demand — the repeal of the three farm laws. He said farmers were protesting with the sole objective of saving their lives and are moving towards Delhi every day. “The Centre is not bothered. We are holding this protest to condemn the Centre and to extend support to the farmers. The demand for the repeal of the laws is the demand of the farmers, our demand and the people’s demand,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the alliance’s protest will continue till the laws were repealed. Stalin booked Later in the day, the Nungambakkam police booked Mr.Stalin and 1,500 others for holding the protest without any permission from the city police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-criticises-central-ministers-for-calling-farmers-anti-nationals/article33369353.ece
19 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||WRD to study increasing capacity of Baby Canal||The Water Resources Department (WRD) plans to study the possibility of increasing the Baby Canal’s carrying capacity to transfer more water from the Poondi reservoir to the Cholavaram reservoir. Various projects taken up on waterbodies, channels and storage structures were reviewed on Friday by K. Satyagopal, Chairman, Tamil Nadu Water Resources Conservation and Rivers Restoration Corporation, along with officials of the WRD and the Tiruvallur Collectorate. Mr. Satyagopal suggested that the width of the canal be increased to 40 m to allow four times its capacity of 100 cusecs (cubic feet per second). He also suggested that the damaged Velliyur check dam, which is downstream of the Poondi reservoir and is proposed to be restored, be improved with a regulator to store up to 400 million cubic feet. Water from the Kosasthalaiyar could be diverted to the Cholavaram reservoir through the Baby Canal nearby. Similarly, there were recommendations to improve the Tamaraipakkam check dam to store more water and convert it into a riverine reservoir with the strengthening of flood banks. Officials inspected the confluence point of the Adyar and the surplus course of the Chembarambakkam reservoir at Thiruneermalai. Widening of river It was decided to check the land records along the river for widening the river up to 65 m to carry nearly 60,000 cusecs-70,000 cusecs of floodwater. This might help to ease inundation in areas such as Mudichur and Varadharajapuram and up to Anakaputhur, said officials. The team also checked the irrigation channel that could be used to transfer more water from the waterbody at Chembarambakkam to the Sikkarayapuram quarries. These abandoned quarries were developed as storage structures and buffer sources for water supply to the city. It was recommended to increase the width of the channel linked to the quarries.  The damaged Velliyur checkdam, which is downstream of the Poondi reservoir and is proposed to be restored, too can be improved with a regulator to store up to 400 million cubic feet K.

He was nabbed when the police were executing non-bailable warrants issued by a judicial magistrate court in Poonamallee against two of his associates. Similarly, the city police have arrested more than 700 criminal suspects in a month, executing non-bailable warrants pending against them in various courts. As per provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, a magistrate has the jurisdiction and power to issue a warrant of arrest, which can be directed against any escaped convict, a proclaimed offender or any person who is accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest. As part of crime prevention, City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal instructed police personnel to execute all pending non-bailable warrants against the suspects. Mr. Aggarwal told The Hindu , “We are following the proper system contemplated in the Criminal Procedure Code to tighten the grip on criminals. We are now executing non-bailable warrants that have been pending for a long time, so that criminals appear before courts and face trial. As many as 700 non-bailable warrants were executed by the city police in a month.” “We are also going for the cancellation of bail of those committing repeat offences, so that they remain in prison for a longer period. When a criminal is released on bail by the court, he/she should give an undertaking that he/she will not commit similar offences. When they commit offences again, we file petitions through our law officers for the cancellation of bail in previous cases and arrest them,” he said. City public prosecutor Gowri Ashokan said, “At least five to 10 bails of repeat offenders are rejected by the Principal Sessions Court here every day. Whenever bail petitions come up for hearing, we urge the court to reject the pleas of habitual offenders.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-execute-700-non-bailable-warrants-in-a-month/article33369850.ece

19 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New farm laws will be a game changer: CII||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has said the new farm laws will be a game changer for the southern States’ leadership in agriculture and related sectors. In south India, agriculture is a high priority sector in terms of meeting national demand and sustenance of farmers. Some of the main crops cultivated in south India include paddy, sorghum, pearl millet, pulses, sugarcane, cotton, chilli and ragi, according to a statement. New era “This critical sector of the Indian economy has indeed received a welcome boost, and with larger investments, adoption of technology and digitalisation and robust partnerships, it is possible to envisage a new era of next generation agriculture that will raise farmer incomes and trigger a virtuous cycle of progress and prosperity,” it added. Coupled with the amendment to the Essential Commodity Act and legal framework around contract farming, the marketing reform agenda will help drive investment and modernisation of food supply chain, the CII added. The reforms announced by the Centre will create the right enabling environment for market and investment-led agricultural growth, and increased income generation opportunities for farmers and will also give great impetus to investment in extension services to the farmers to further improve productivity and returns, Satish Reddy, chairman, CII Southern region, said. Augmenting incomes C.K. Ranganathan, deputy chairman, CII Southern region, said that the new laws will help transform the sector and more importantly help augment farmers’ incomes. Creation of an additional ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers’ produce will help facilitate remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels, he added. “The apprehensions raised on MSP have been cleared by the Prime Minister and there is clarity that the procurement and support price will continue. The Act on contract farming enables even the FPOs and farmers’ groups to enter into an agreement with the buyer and creates opportunities for assured incomes.”  The apprehensions raised on MSP have been cleared by the Prime Minister and there is clarity that the procurement and support price will continue||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-farm-laws-will-be-a-game-changer-cii/article33369378.ece

19 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC says no to caste-based census||Observing that the endeavour of the country must be to move towards a casteless society, the Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) petition which sought a direction to the Registrar General and Census Commissioner to consider a plea to conduct a caste-based census in 2021. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Pongiappan refused to entertain the petition filed by advocate R. Anandha Babu, also treasurer of the Chennai Vanniyakula Kshatriya Maha Sangam, on the ground that he had not made out a case to issue a direction to the Census Commissioner to consider his representation. The judges took note that the State government had already constituted a commission headed by retired High Court judge A. Kulasekaran to conduct a survey for collecting caste wise data. Invoke RTI Act They also said the petitioner could invoke the Right to Information (RTI) Act to know the status of a representation made to the Census Commissioner on March 14. The Bench said Article 38 (2) of the Constitution requires the State to strive to minimise the inequalities in income and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations. However, pointing out that the Article falls under Part-IV (Directive Principles of State Policy) of the Constitution, the judges said that Article 37 makes it clear that the provisions in Part-IV shall not be enforceable by any court though the principles laid down therein would be fundamental in governance of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-says-no-to-caste-based-census/article33369350.ece

19 December 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||A bus conductor brightens the day for passengers in Coimbatore||The troubled times that people have had in the past year have made even modest attempts at brightening up a day worthy of praise. A welcome message on a bus trip and the offer of free masks have delighted passengers in Coimbatore. The conductor, who became popular on social media platforms with his welcome address to passengers, is also giving away free masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. K. Sivashanmugam is the conductor of the Coimbatore-Madurai bus of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) that leaves the Singanallur terminus. He buys masks and offers them to passengers not having one. “Many assume that I am selling these masks and offer me money, but I decline it,” he says. He himself has recovered from COVID-19 recently. A resident of Perur, Mr. Sivashanmugam, 54, has been a conductor throughout his career. He started working in private buses in 1985 and joined the TNSTC in 1995. In 2019, he became famous after videos of his delivering a welcome address to passengers went viral. “Thank you for choosing Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation for your journey and giving us an opportunity to work with you,” begins his address. Requesting the passengers to keep the bus clean, he goes on to inform them that plastic bags and sour candies are available for those suffering from motion sickness. “Driver Shanmugam and I wish you success of your journey and I thank you for this opportunity to work with you,” he concludes, prompting a round of applause. Before he begins his welcome address, he gives sanitiser to all passengers. He insists that passengers wear masks and says those who do not have one may get it from him. He keeps the masks in a bag near the driver’s seat, along with sour candies and plastic bags that he has bought with his own money.  Mr. Sivashanmugam says he has been delivering the welcome address for two years, motivated by another conductor who recited Thirukkural couplets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-bus-conductor-brightens-the-day-for-passengers-in-coimbatore/article33369339.ece
19 December 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Opposition playing with the lives of innocent farmers, Vanathi Srinivasan||Opposition parties are playing with the lives of innocent farmers in the name of farmer agitations on the borders of Delhi, alleged Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Mahila Morcha president Vanathi Srinivasan on Friday. ‘Political reasons’ After participating in a ‘Tractor Rally’ organised by the BJP Coimbatore Urban District Unit and agriculture wing from Perur to raise awareness about the benefits of the three new farm laws, Ms. Srinivasan claimed that the promises made to farmers by Opposition parties such as Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in their election manifestos have now been enacted as legislations by the Central government. However, these parties are now opposing these laws for “political reasons,” she alleged. Alleging lack of adequate cold storage units for farmers cultivating grapes and small onions in Thondamuthur region, she added that anyone could now provide these units. “Not just Adani and Ambani, even Sun Network which runs corporate companies could construct these cold storage units for the farmers,” she told journalists. On actor-politician Kamal Haasan questioning the necessity for a new Parliament complex, Ms. Srinivasan asked whether hosting the reality show ‘Bigg Boss’ was necessary for him at a time when people were facing hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  While the Central government has introduced various schemes for the economic benefit of farmers, these three laws will ensure that the farmers get the right price for their produce, she asserted. State BJP agriculture wing president G.K. Nagaraj, state vice-president P. Kanagasabapathi and other leaders participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/opposition-playing-with-the-lives-of-innocent-farmers-vanathi-srinivasan/article33369863.ece

However, there was no confirmation as of Friday regarding the whereabouts of the tusker, according to the official. Estimated to be around 50 years old, the elephant had killed a man and his son near Gudalur on Sunday.

It was confirmed by the Centre at the hearing of a public interest litigation petition that sought to expedite the construction. Additional Advocate-General K. Chellapandian said the foundation was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 27, 2019. Then, a proposal was sent to “enter” the 200 acres identified for the project. Further, 22.49 acres of additional land was identified. In August 2020, the State received a communication from the Centre to hand over the land. Following a communication to send the handover certificate, it was prepared and sent to the Centre for being signed and returned on November 3. A communication in this regard had already been made, Mr. Chellapandian submitted. Confirming it, Assistant Solicitor-General L.

Due to COVID-19, they could not countersign the documents and send. They have clarified that they have to countersign. The JICA could not come for the pre-appraisal activity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-has-transferred-land-to-centre-for-aiims-hc-told/article33369852.ece
19 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court stays sale of edible oil in loose||Expressing shock over the extent to which edible oil can be adulterated and the threat it can pose to the health of the common man if sold in loose, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday granted a stay on the sale of edible oil in loose. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that Right to Life is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and Right to have healthy food was also one of the fundamental rights. It is the duty of the government to ensure that people get healthy food without adulteration. The very objective behind the enactment of Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 now amended as Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 was to enhance quality standards, the judges said. The court relied upon reports and submissions that said the edible oil available in the market was mostly adulterated and took into account the fact that by mixing a portion of Cashew Nut Shell Liquid in Palmolein, Palmolein could look like gingelly oil. Section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 prescribes severe punishments for those who adulterate, be it the manufacturers, the distributors or the sellers. The punishment varies from six months to seven years of imprisonment, the court said. The court observed as to why not stricter punishments be prescribed for those indulging in such acts and put forth a series of queries for the government to respond to including as to how despite a prohibition on the sale of edible oil in loose, it was still being sold in loose. The court also sought to know the number of testing labs in the State, the number of tests carried out, what action was taken against the offenders, what was the conviction rate and the consequences of adulterations on the health conditions of the consumers. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by advocate S. Arunnithy of Madurai who sought a direction to the authorities concerned to ensure that edible oil sold in the market was in accordance with the food safety and standard norms. The case was adjourned till January 18, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-stays-sale-of-edible-oil-in-loose/article33369370.ece

Victoria Gowri submitted that the cabinet had approved the establishment of AIIMS at Thoppur at a cost of Rs. 1264 crore in 2018 and the project was to be completed within 45 months from the date of approval of the cabinet. The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was financing the project. The pre-investment work was at the advanced stage and the fact finding mission of the JICA representatives met in November. The loan signing agreement can go beyond December as per present situation. The next stage will be the signing of the loan agreement before March 31, 2021, the ASG submitted. Taking cognisance of the submissions made, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi asked as to why there was a delay in the project when the same was announced way back in 2015. The establishment of the premier health institute will not only benefit Tamil Nadu but also south India, the judges observed. The judges also took note of media reports on an RTI reply that had stated that the State was yet to hand over the land for the AIIMS project to the Centre. The judges wondered how such a communication was sent. The court said that it will pass detailed orders in the petition filed by K.K. Ramesh of Madurai who sought a direction to expedite the construction work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-govt-has-transferred-land-to-centre-for-aiims/article33369953.ece
19 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Verify if buildings have fire safety measures: PIL petition||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday ordered notice to the State government in a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to the authorities concerned to inspect and verify if all buildings in Madurai including showrooms, hotels, shops, shopping malls, theatres and marriage halls had fire safety measures. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi ordered notice to the State in the PIL petition filed by advocate S. Muthukumar of Madurai. The petitioner sought a direction to the State to crack down on buildings that did not have fire safety measures and also take action against the officials who issued completion certificates on such buildings. Pointing out to the recent fire accident incident in Madurai, the petitioner said two firefighters lost their lives while fighting fire at a textile shop when the roof of the building collapsed. Following the incident, 112 buildings were identified by the Fire and Rescue Services Department as not safe public buildings and notices have been issued, the petitioner said. He said that this was only the tip of the iceberg. Many marriage halls were functioning without adequate safety measures. The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities concerned to come out with a report on the 112 buildings that were identified as not safe and submit the same to the court along with the details of the officials who had granted the no objection certificate to the buildings. The case was adjourned till January 2021 for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/verify-if-buildings-have-fire-safety-measures-pil-petition/article33369375.ece
19 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Car runs amok, five injured||N. Udhayakumar of Aruppukottai, a driver, carrying four youths knocked down five persons, including motorists and pedestrians with a speeding car on North Veli Street on Friday. The police have picked him up and his friends. They said the youths who were studying in different colleges had come to the city for a party hosted by one of them for having bought a new high-speed motorbike. After reportedly consuming liquor at a hotel near Railway junction, the car had come in high speed knocking down one after the other road users between the Simmakkal outpost and the traffic signal at Chokkanathar temple junction late in the evening. Only after hitting another car, the car stopped at the traffic junction, the police said. Five persons, including a bike-rider, a cyclist and two pedestrians had sustained bleeding injuries. An elderly man sustained head injuries and his nose was badly damaged. Three of them were admitted to the hospital. An angry mob reportedly assaulted the driver and others.

19 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Honour appointment given by courts: HC||Emphasising the need to follow a certain discipline and a reasonable timetable, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday observed that the Bar and the litigants need to realise that every time courts give a posting for hearing their case, it is an appointment given to them that should be honoured and made use of. Justice N. Seshasayee asked as to whether they would miss their appointment with their physician. It is time they realised courts are doctors of injured rights. When litigants do not miss a train, plane, social events, examination or interview, what makes them believe that their appointments with courts alone should figure least in their priorities. The institution of courts are available for remedying a wrong done to the right for the justly aggrieved. The courts do not invite the litigants to its premises, but merely make a remedial forum available and keep their doors open to those who seek remedy.It is an invitation by appointment for those who have a reason to access the courts for justice, the judge said. It is their choice. But, once approached they need to follow certain discipline and reasonable time table. Is it a problem of inadequate professionalism of the Bar or plain irresponsibility of the litigants or the unmindful generosity of courts that they themselves chose not to take the appointments that they have given the litigants seriously? the judge asked. The courts may not be solely responsible for this, but it cannot seek an exemption either. With pain it has to be stated that for the sin of a section of the Bar and the litigants, courts are forced to carry the cross all alone, struggling to explain the delay for the disposal of cases to the citizens of the country all the time, the judge said. Also, taking into account that procedural laws have its inherent elasticity and flexibility to accommodate multi various circumstances, the judge observed that courts cannot afford to assume a disciplinarian attitude and obstruct litigant’s aspiration for securing justice. Watch, weigh and value may be a reasonable approach for balancing justice in individual cases. “May the Bar and the litigants be now told firmly, but not impolitely, that the appointment which the courts give them is as precious as an appointment a physician gives his patient, for the courts are doctors of bleeding rights”, the judge said while dismissing a civil revision petition of a litigant who had wasted considerable time of a civil court. The court was hearing the petition filed by Fathima of Madurai who had challenged the order of the Principal District Munsif Court, Madurai. The court observed that the trial judge reasoned how the petitioner had abused the appointments. The attitude of the petitioner was plainly and painfully nonsensical and somewhere the game had to end, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/honour-appointment-given-by-courts-hc/article33370089.ece

19 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai Corporation identifies dilapidated buildings||Madurai Corporation is currently identifying weak and dilapidated buildings in the core city and issuing notices to the building owners. An official from the Town planning wing of the Corporation said that currently a total of 225 dilapidated buildings have been identified in Zones 3 and 4, and notices have been issued to their owners. The operation is being carried out along with the Fire and Rescue Services department, he said. "More focus is being given to the buildings around Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, Vilakkuthoon, four Masi streets and the core city. Identification of such weak buildings are underway in the remaining zones also," he said. While the civic body usually inspects weak buildings in the city during rainy seasons, it was the first time that notices were issued to the building owners. "More emphasis is given on identifying such weak buildings after the incident on Deepavali festival, where two firemen were killed when the roof of a textile shop collapsed on them while they were battling a fire," he added. The notices issued by the Corporation mentions that the building is unsafe and is in a dilapidated condition. Hence, the owners have to demolish the buildings within 14 days, according to the notice. The civic body had also sealed five shops last week for not complying with the rules after notices were issued to them. The traders criticised this move of the civic body. Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association Secretary Ashraf Tayub urged the civic body to conduct proper assessment before issuing notices to building owners. "The officials have issued notices based on the appearance of the buildings. It will only be correct to assess buildings and then issue notices," he said. The traders also urged the civic body to stop sealing the buildings where notices were issued. The Corporation official said that the notices were issued as a warning urging the building owners to take steps to improve the safety of the buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-identifies-dilapidated-buildings/article33369951.ece

19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||SC to hear plea against Act on land acquisition||The Supreme Court on Friday decided to examine a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition Laws (Revival of Operation, Amendment and Validation) Act, 2019. A Bench, led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, issued notice to the State of Tamil Nadu on a petition filed by G. Mohan Rao and others, who contended that the law and its notification should be struck down as “unconstitutional, illegal and void”. “The petitioners submit that the Act is violative of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013,” the petition said. Senior advocate P. Wilson, who led the lawyers appearing in the case, said the 2019 Act was a means to revive the laws already struck down. After hearing his submissions, the Bench posted the case for hearing on January 18, along with similar petitions on the State amendments to the 2013 Act. ‘Bits and pieces’ The petitioners said the agricultural lands owned by them were being acquired in “bits and pieces” for connectivity from the Ennore port to Mamallapuram under the Chennai Peripheral Ring Road Project. “Lands which are to be acquired under the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001, are highly irrigated, and multiple crops are cultivated,” they said.

19 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Centre dealing with farmers in an authoritarian way: CM||Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Friday said the Union government was dealing with the farmers, agitating against the farm laws in the national capital, in an “authoritarian” manner. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a one-day fast, in support of the farmers’ protest, near Anna Statue, the Chief Minister said that no serious efforts had been made to end the agitation by the agriculturists. The laws passed by the Centre, without holding any consultation, would destroy the farm sector. The laws will only benefit corporates, he said, adding that the farmers were not taken into confidence before the new laws were framed. The government should immediately withdraw the agricultural legislation, he said. The “secular” parties in Tamil Nadu will continue to support the farmers’ agitation, he said. The Chief Minister also tore a copy of the three laws, while winding up the fast at around 8 p.m. In his address, ending the protest, he reiterated that he would “sacrifice power to protect the identity of the Union Territory, under any circumstance.” Ministers A. Namassivayam, M. Kandasamy, M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, PCC Chief A.V. Subramanian, leaders of the Left parties and trade unions were among those who took part. Braving the cold DMK leaders too, on Friday, staged a one-day fast in Thirukkanoor village, Puducherry, in support of the farmers. The party’s north and south conveners, S.P. Sivakumar and R. Siva (MLA), respectively, and legislator Venkatesan took part. VCK principal secretary Deva Pozhilan also participated. Mr. Siva said the Centre had not considered the fact that the farmers were staging the protest, braving the cold weather. Even when the health of the farmers was at risk, the Centre had ignored their pleas to withdraw the laws, he said. If the Centre failed to withdraw the farm legislation, the party, with the approval of its leadership, would intensify the agitation, Mr. Siva added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-dealing-with-farmers-in-an-authoritarian-way-cm/article33370041.ece

A circular issued by the Health Department to the Centralised Admission Committee, on December 17, revealed that the three private medical colleges would part with only 33% seats.

The government has curtailed the chances of those from several socially backward sections of society by implementing the quota, he said. The Tamil Nadu government had not implemented the EWS quota in government medical colleges, he said.

Hence, considering the request from party cadres, I would be launching party’s election campaign from here,” he said. Lorry strike To a question on the strike announced by Lorry Owners’ Federation, Mr. Palaniswami said, “Transport Minister has already clarified in this regard. It is a Central government scheme [installing GPS] and permission has been granted to install devices from six other companies based on their request.

19 December 2020||Salem,TAMIL NADU||People are the heirs of MGR, Jayalalithaa, says Palaniswami||With several politicians staking claim to the legacy of AIADMK founder M.G.Ramachandran, Chief Minister Edappadi.K.Palaniswami on Friday said that the people are the heirs of the former Chief Ministers MGR and Jayalalithaa. Launching Amma ‘mini clinics’ at Panamarathupatti and Muthunaikenpatti in Salem, he said, “MGR and Jayalalithaa did not have any heirs and people are their heirs. Considering this, both the leaders implemented various schemes for the welfare of the people.” Referring to 7.5% reservation in medical admission, he said 435 students from government schools would benefit from the policy next year. The ‘mini clinics’ have been launched for the welfare of the poor with all medicines that would normally be available at a PHC. Mr. Palaniswami said that during his childhood he had to travel 14 km to Edappadi or 24 km to Bhavani for medical treatment and he did not want the people to undergo such sufferings. Talking about various welfare schemes implemented by his government, he said Tamil Nadu was the only State which had got the farmers crop insurance to the tune of Rs. 9,200 crore in four years. Criticising the Opposition, Mr.Palaniswami said the government had been winning awards at national level for its performance, but the DMK president M.K.Stalin alone failed to see it. While Mr. Stalin is interacting with party cadres through video conferencing, he (CM) is visiting people in all districts in person and reviewing progress of COVID-19 measures, as wells as various welfare schemes. Mr. Palaniswami claimed that the DMK was a selfish party and right from leader to cadre, they were concerned only about the welfare of their own family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-are-the-heirs-of-mgr-jayalalithaa-says-palaniswami/article33369387.ece

19 December 2020||SIVAGANGA,TAMIL NADU||Look for regular income other than cultivation, farmers told||Collector P Madhusudhan Reddy has urged farmers to look for regular income apart from earning by cultivation of paddy during a particular season. Presiding over the grievance meeting here on Friday, he said the animal husbandry department officials had so many schemes and projects. By rearing goats or other milch animals or by raising organic produces, farmers can earn an income on a monthly basis. Growing paddy may bring in revenue only during a season. Instead of remaining idle in the remaining months, farmers can look for value-addition in the sector. The Collector said that a WhatsApp group would be started soon for the benefit of farmers by the Department of Agriculture officials here. Exchange of ideas and schemes offered by the government may benefit farmers. Similarly, whenever any farmer living in any corner of the district could capture the picture of the crop, where he/she may have encountered pest related problems, the officials may be able to give a solution promptly, he added. Farmers wanted special camps to be held for treating animals in their blocks. Collector directed officials to examine the modalities and announce dates. With the change in weather, many farmers raised the issue separately during the meeting. Hence, it was proposed to organise camps. The officials said that many farmers had established their own ponds and raised fishlings in them. The Collector said the district administration would be happy to encourage more and more farmers to come forward and set up their own ponds and announced to issue 1,000 fishlings free of cost for such progressive farmers through the Fisheries Department. The Collector said farmers need not have any apprehension over the opening of Direct Procurement Centres. ‘Like last year, wherever the DPCs functioned, officials would keep them open this season. As and when the harvest of paddy starts, they can approach the DPCs and sell them,’ he said. The farmers said the PWD was not releasing water in the Vaigai properly so that some hamlets in Manamadurai could not get water and channels/ ponds remained dry.

19 December 2020||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Courtallam waterfalls experience flood||Tourists who came to Courtallam on Friday with the hope of having a memorable weekend after the district administration allowed tourists to take bath in the waterfalls from last Tuesday onwards after a gap of eight-and-a-half months were disappointed as heavy flow of water kept the visitors away from Main Falls while Five Falls offered them some solace. After incessant drizzle drenched the Western Ghats since Thursday night, Main Falls and Five Falls experienced huge inflow of water since Friday forcing the police to ban bathing in Main Falls while visitors were allowed to take bath in Five Falls, Tiger Falls and Old Courtallam Falls. Tourists especially Ayyappa devotees, who would take bath in the waterfalls of Courtallam even as they would be on their way to the shrine, were quite disappointed as most of them would visit Sri Kutralanatha Swami Temple after taking a bath in nearby Main Falls. “We expect decent crowd on Saturday and Sunday at Courtallam which will be a consolation for traders as they have lost the entire season between June and August due to lockdown. If this situation continues up to mid-January, traders would get some revenue ahead of Pongal,” said Senthur Pandian, a trader from Courtallam. However, tourists and bus drivers find it really difficult to manoeuvre vehicles to Courtallam as the Tirunelveli – Tenkasi Highway which is reportedly to be upgraded into four-lane thoroughfare is in the worst shape. “The busy highway, riddled with hundreds of dangerous potholes and craters, is a death trap now. Don’t try your luck along this highway especially during the night,” warns Mr. Senthur Pandian. For the past few years, officials attached to the Department of Highways say that the 50-km long Tirunelveli – Tenkasi could neither be re-laid nor repaired in a big way as it was going to be a four-lane highway. This stand has increased the 75 minute-long travel as two-hour-long nightmarish experience and cause accidents everyday, road users say. Manimuthar Falls, which is beyond the reach of visitors ever since the lockdown came into force, too witnessed flood on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/courtallam-waterfalls-experience-flood/article33369360.ece
19 December 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||CM’s support for farm laws irks ryots||Criticising Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for supporting farm laws enacted by the Central government, farmers in the district on Friday extended their support to their counterparts staging demonstrations on the State borders of New Delhi. At a meeting here to discuss the fallout of the large-scale demonstrations, functionaries of the Thanjavur District Committee of the All India Farmers Protest Coordination Committee took exception to the supportive statement of Edappadi K. Palaniswami. “It was absurd on the part of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to express his views on the subject at a time when his counterparts in Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States refrained from commenting on the laws,” functionaries of the Committee said. Alleging that the AIADMK government had betrayed the farmers in Tamil Nadu on many issues, they said the Chief Minister’s claim that the three Farm Laws would not put the farmers in disadvantageous position was a “blatant lie.” “The Chief Minister should tender an apology to the farmers for making the misleading statement,” they demanded. End to procurement? The three Farm Laws would put an end to paddy procurement exercise and wind up of the Public Distribution System, they said, apprehending that the free power supply to farming activities would also get abolished once the Electricity Amendment Bill was through. A massive rally and a public meeting would be organised in Thanjavur on December 29 to force the Union government to withdraw the Farm Laws and urge the Tamil Nadu government to withdraw its support to the “anti-agriculturalist” laws. Meetings would be held in villages on December 20 to mourn the demise of some agriculturalists who lost their life while participating in the protest against the new Farm Laws near New Delhi, the forum said.

19 December 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers urged to become entrepreneurs||Avenues for farmers to become -entrepreneurs were explained to paddy cultivators in delta districts by experts during a three-day training programme to improve their living standards. The Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute (TRRI) conducted the programme with funding from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Delivering the special address on the inaugural day, S. Viswanath Kanna, District Development Manager, NABARD, Tiruvarur, presented a brief account of the increasing trend of non-Basmati rice exports and exhorted the Delta farmers to elevate themselves from paddy producers to entrepreneurs. Addressing the trainees, V. Ambethgar, Director, TRRI, highlighted the need to increase the production in the backdrop of decreasing cultivable area. He also stressed the need to preserve the health of soil. A. Justin, Joint Director of Agriculture, Thanjavur district, presented a brief note on the concept of doubling the agricultural production and tripling the income of the producers. The importance of selection of season-specific varieties coupled with crop management and protection was explained to the farmers by A. Ramanathan, Professor and Unit Head (Plant Protection). The training programme included a presentation and field visits focussing on technologies related to high-yielding varieties, new planting techniques, solutions for problems in rice cultivation, and an overview of plant protection and rice-based cropping system. Scientists of different disciplines from the Aduthurai Institute interacted with farmers, R. Manimaran, Associate Professor (Plant Breeding), TRRI, said. The participants were taken to bio-fertilizer and bio-pesticide production laboratories at TRRI, Aduthurai and Department of Agriculture, Sakkottai.

19 December 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Devotees take holy dip in sea||After a gap of nine months, the devotees visiting Tiruchendur Lord Subramaniya Swami Temple were allowed to take holy dip in the sea on Friday. As the coastal town would receive a few thousand devotees on any given day and the number would easily cross one lakh during festival seasons, the devotees were not allowed to come to the temple for offering prayer and take bath in the sea as they would offer prayers after taking bath in the sea in the wake of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. As the lockdown got relaxed, the devotees were allowed to come to the temple from last September 1 onwards while ban on holy dip in the sea continued even during the ‘soorasamhaaram’. Similarly, tonsuring the head was also stopped. As the devotees were allowed to take bath in the sea since noon on Friday, the shrine attracted decent crowd which is expected to swell during this weekend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devotees-take-holy-dip-in-sea/article33369407.ece

19 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Carol singing is in the air, as never before||Come Christmas, carol singers would be singing Silent Night or the catchy Jingle Bells, announcing the good news of the birth of Jesus Christ through the cold December night. But this year, things are quite different. While many have chosen to keep the spirit alive through online concerts and recordings, some have given their instruments a much-needed rest, waiting to resume after the pandemic is over. Members of Singspirations, a choir boasting of an eclectic mix of school and college students to retired senior citizens, say that while the pandemic kept people apart, music always brings them together. “We upload videos to our YouTube channel every week. Carols in Tamil and English are recorded for viewers,” said Singspirations’ director B. Jonath Backia Seelan. The choristers record individual parts at home, which are brought together and synced through video editing, says Mr. Seelan. “Post-recording involves more work, but it is worth the effort,” he says with pride. Those who miss attending carol concerts this time of the year can watch the videos and listen to the music and hope all will get better soon, he says. Anglo-Indians’ plan Meanwhile, members of Tiruchi All India Anglo-Indians Association have decided to herald the Christmas season through performances both online and offline. While an online concert will be held for all members from Tiruchi, who have settled in other parts of the country and the world, the group plans to visit some homes, especially those of senior citizens. “On the night of December 22, we plan to take the youth and children to sing at some houses where old and invalid reside, as singing songs of the season will bring immense joy to them,” said Creswell Engles, a member of the association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/carol-singing-is-in-the-air-as-never-before/article33370082.ece
19 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||School girl translates Aathichudi into Hindi||A Class 11 student has endeavoured to expand the reach of Avvaiyar’s Aathichudi across the country by translating them into Hindi. N.S. Apsara, a student of Zamindar Higher Secondary School, Thuraiyur, had translated and recited part of the one-line verse when she was in Class VII itself, which was recognised by the Department of Social Welfare. Her father K. Sasikumar, a teacher at the Government Higher Secondary School, Sengattupatti, said, “Apsara has been studying Hindi since Class 4 and is proficient in the language. She did the Tamil to Hindi translation on her own.” Work began in January 2019 and Ms. Apsara translated one or two verses per week. “Since she was preparing for the board exams, we did not put pressure on her, but she completed it in a year,” he said. Ms. Apsara approached her Hindi tutor in Srirangam for editing the translated verses. To refine it, they approached a Hindi lecturer at a private institution in the city. “The book was ready by December 2019, but we were waiting for her to finish Class 10 to publish it,” Mr. Sasikumar said. Hard work The book is the fruit of one-and-a-half years of work, Ms. Apsara said. “It features translations and transliterations of all 109 verses of Aathichudi , which are important lessons for all children,” she said. Collector S. Sivarasu recently honoured Ms. Apsara with a letter of appreciation for her efforts. On his part, Mr. Sasikumar translated the work into English.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/school-girl-translates-aathichudi-into-hindi/article33369848.ece
19 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Concern over migration of munia bird species to human settlements||Indications of munia bird species modifying their habitat to get closer to human settlements are being viewed with concern by conservation biologists. A study in Tiruchi and surroundings by Q. Ashoka Chakkaravarthy, (Hiyoshi Young Leaf Environment Awardee, Japan) Field Conservation Biologist, and Supriti Sarkar, Post-Doctoral Fellow and Associate Professor of Zoology, City College, Kolkata, indicates that Scaly-breasted Munia or Spotted Munia (Lonchura punctulata), and Indian Silver bill or White-throated Munia (Euodice malabarica) that resembles sparrow, though biologically different, have adapted to human habitat over a period of time. Depletion of the natural abode is apparently the reason for the bird species finding their way into human settlements, said Mr. Chakkaravarthy, who also teaches Ecology and Environmental science in city colleges as a visiting faculty member. “Munia species is of the order of Passeriformes (sparrow-like bird) and Estrildidae family (Old World sparrow). Scaly-breasted Munia, as the name suggests, has scaly texture on breasts; the body of adults is brown with white underbelly. The team monitors their nests. They mainly depend on grassland eco systems over the last three years. The study areas are in Tiruchi, Perambalur, Thozhudur and Ariyalur. Through a closer observation of the bird’s nest near Thozhudur to Veppur road beside bypass near Aavati village, the researchers learnt that the Munia builds its ball-shaped nest using grass blades in bushes and trees with low canopies with a lateral entrance. Pesticides, rain The changing agricultural pattern reflecting in widespread use of of pesticides in paddy cultivation is not conducive for the bird species that breed from June to August. The untimely rainfall earlier this year had caused the birds further harm. The birds had built the nests and laid seven eggs before the rains. But the intensity of the rainfall had caused collapse of the nest. Only three eggs remain and the scope for hatching is low since the birds had abandoned the nest. There was a high probability for the fragile eggs to be consumed by predators. Habitat loss poses greatest threat to such bird species as also butterflies, insects and snakes, Mr. Chakkaravarthy said. His study on bird ecology over the last 10 years in Tiruchi region confirms that ecological factors caused a drastic decline in the population of munia species. The nests get destroyed due to deforestation. There has also been a decrease in insect population on which the bird species forage. For example, fire flies that were once common was very rare now in rural localities, he said. Also, munias are trafficked and sold. A pair of munias is sold for Rs. 1,000 by poachers.The consequence will be a ripple effect in the long run. For, these birds perform critical role in the ecosystem by keeping insect population under control, alongside pollinating and disseminating seeds, Mr. Chakkaravarthysaid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/concern-over-migration-of-munia-bird-species-to-human-settlements/article33369357.ece

19 December 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Tirunelveli records 15% deficit rainfall||Though storage level in dams especially in Manimuthar, Papanasam and Servalar reservoirs is quite comfortable and farmers are busy with ‘pisanam’ paddy season operations, the district has so far experienced 15% deficit rainfall. Of the 1,290 irrigation tanks in the district (740 system tanks and 550 rain-fed tanks), 156 tanks including 66 system tanks and 90 rain-fed tanks are bone dry now. Addressing the farmers’ grievances meet held on Friday even as agriculturists participated in the meet from Agriculture Extension Offices across the district, Collector Vishnu said the district, which used to get 814.80 mm of rainfall till December, had received 695.37 mm of rainfall till December 17 which was 15% less than the average. While dams had 91.42% of water during the corresponding period last year, reservoirs now have 84.44% of water revealing that the rainfall in the catchment areas was not so impressive. With the rainfall received so far, the district witnessed cultivation of paddy during the current ‘pisanam’ season on about 14,261 hectare and it was expected to go up further before December-end. Moreover, cultivation of cereals on 757 hectares, grams on 6,629 hectares, cotton on 653 hectares, sugarcane on 31 hectares and oilseeds on 674 hectares had been completed. “Since water for ‘pisanam’ paddy season and other farming operations is available now, chemical fertilizers, certified seeds, pesticides and other agro inputs have been stocked adequately. Besides instructing traders to sell these goods as per the prescribed price, checks are being conducted for seizing inferior quality seeds. So far, 12.67 tonnes of substandard seeds worth about Rs. 33.50 lakh has been seized,” Mr. Vishnu said. Since the district has received Rs. 10.68 crore towards grant for installing micro irrigation equipment such as drips and sprinklers in farms for nourishing horticultural crops, the Collector urged farmers to make use of this opportunity to save water. Mr. Vishnu exhorted all corn growers to insure the crop by paying the premium of Rs. 268.50 per acre towards the insured sum of Rs. 17,900 and the banana cultivators to pay Rs. 3,211 per acre. “Since the farmers of Ervadi, Moolaikkaraipatti, Nanguneri, Poolam, Vinayanarayanayam, Munneerpallam, Radhapuram, Samooharengapuram, Thisaiyanvilai, Levingipuram, Pazhavoor, Panagudi and Valliyoor firkas have been notified for insuring banana, farmers can get the insured sum of Rs. 64,220 per acre by paying this premium in case of crop loss,” Mr. Vishnu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirunelveli-records-15-deficit-rainfall/article33370095.ece
19 December 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Water level reaches maximum capacity in Papanasam Dam||The Papanasam Dam, the second largest dam in the district that plays key role in determining farming operations in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi district besides quenching thirst of Virudhunagar district, reached its maximum storage level of 143 feet on Friday. Consequently, over 4,680 cusecs of water is being discharged from Papanasam Dam and Servalar reservoirs since 6.30 a.m. and people living close to the watercourse of the Tamirabharani have been asked to stay alert even though flow of water into the dam is still in manageable quantum. Moreover, 1,000 cusecs is likely to be released in the Tamirabharani from Gadana Dam which has water for 83.50 feet against its maximum capacity of 85 feet. Though inflow of water into this dam in the Tenkasi district is just 132 cusecs, the increased inflow of water may force officials to discharge 1,000 cusecs of water within a couple of days. “Since the sudden flow of water into the dams will force officials to release increased quantum of water, the public have been asked not to take bath in the Tamirabharani. There is no need for panic as we’ve taken these steps only as precautionary measures,” Collector V. Vishnu said. Revenue and police officials have been deployed in prominent bathing spots like Papanasam, Vickramasingapuram, Ambasamudram, Kallidaikurichi, Mukkoodal, Cheranmahadevi, Tirunelveli and beyond. The district’s largest reservoir, Manimuthar Dam, with the capacity of 5,511 million cubic feet, has water for 106.45 feet (4,382 mcft or 79.52%) against its maximum storage level of 118 feet on Friday even as the inflow of water stood at 1,132 cusecs. “It will take at least next three or four days to surplus unless the catchment areas experience heavy downpour,” said the PWD sources. Though the Papanasam and the Manimuthar Dams have comfortable storage level now, both dams have received less rainfall than the precipitation recorded last year. After getting 303 mm rainfall in December 2019, the Papanasam Dam has so far got only 284 mm till Friday (December 18). Manimuthar Dam has so for recorded only 149 mm of rainfall this year against the last year’s precipitation of 328 mm.  As farming operations in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts has assumed decent pace with farmers getting confidence of water till the end of the ‘pisanam’ paddy season, 340 cusecs of water is being diverted in Kannadian Channel, 600 cusecs in Marudhur Melakaal, 377 cusecs in Marudhur Keezhakaal, 457 cusecs in Srivaikundam South Main Channel, 154 cusecs in Srivaikundam North Main Channel to feed the system tanks under these channels. A distressing feature of this year’s north-east monsoon is that rainfall in the plains is far from satisfaction as 66 of the 740 system tanks in the district are still bone dry. And, 90 of the rain-fed tanks are also dry. In other words, 156 of the 1,290 irrigation tanks in the district are dry now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-level-reaches-maximum-capacity-in-dam/article33369361.ece
19 December 2020||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Stone structures used for irrigation discovered near Udumalpet||A group of archaeological enthusiasts recently discovered portions of stone structures called 'thoombus', which were estimated to be around 1,000 years old, near Udumalpet in Tiruppur district. The team from Virarajendran Archaeological and Historical Research Centre discovered the structures during a field survey at Vadaputhinatham village near Udumalpet on November 12, said the Centre’s director S. Ravikumar. These were found near Periyakulam, a tank situated near the Thirumoorthy hills. The two structures had Lord Ganesh and Goddess Lakshmi sculpted on them respectively. Both the structures had a hole with a diameter of 18 cm on its back. Out of these, the structure with Lord Ganesh was around 140 cm tall and had four lines of inscriptions in the Grantha script. The team sought the assistance of historian Y. Subbarayalu to decipher the script, Mr. Ravikumar said. The inscription, which was incomplete, read that the land irrigated by the tank remained wet. Based on the Grantha script, Mr. Subbarayalu estimated that the structure might have been installed at 1000 CE, according to Mr. Ravikumar. Sluice gates He added that these stone structures must have been a part of ‘thoombus’, which were used as sluice gates to open and close the water flow from a tank to a canal for irrigating the agricultural lands. “Such ‘thoombus’ with Grantha script inscriptions were earlier found only in Pudukkottai district,” he said, adding that this could be the first such discovery in Kongu region. The other structure with Goddess Lakshmi sculpted on it was around 70 cm tall and had no inscriptions, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stone-structures-used-for-irrigation-discovered-near-udumalpet/article33369384.ece

19 December 2020||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Credit potential of Rs. 8,668 cr. projected for Virudhunagar||The Potential-linked Credit Plan (PLP) for 2021-22 prepared by NABARD has assessed a credit potential of Rs. 8,668.44 crore for Virudhunagar district, with a projected growth of around 4% more than the projections for the current year. The PLP forms the basis for finalization of the Annual Credit Plan (ACP) of the district. Collector R. Kannan released the PLP during the district consultative committee meeting held here on Thursday. District Development Manager, NABARD, B. Rajasureshwaran, and Lead District Manager (LDM), K. Shanmugavel, were present. Collector advised banks to allocate more funds for agriculture as there is good potential to promote farm mechanisation, micro irrigation systems, animal husbandry sector. Based on the potential estimated in the PLP, a background paper will be circulated by the lead bank, along with the block-wise / activity-wise potential identified in the plan. Banks will prepare their branch level credit plans so as to finalize the Block Credit Plans and then District Credit Plan for the year 2021-22. Mr. Rajasureshwaran said that the district has good banking network and the overall credit-deposit ratio of all the banks in the district during 2019-20 was 100%. Highlighting the sector wise credit plan, he informed that the PLP projection is 22% more than the ACP target for 2020-21 which can be attributed to the national priorities of Government of India to scale up lending to the various sectors of the economy, the statement said. The share for agriculture sector in the PLP estimates for 2021-22 is Rs. 3,445.89 crore, with farm credit estimated at Rs. 2,971.29 crore. Keeping in view the recent policy changes of Centre to push the MSME sector, an amount of Rs. 3,274.42 crore has been estimated for the district.

The protesters alleged that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is spreading lies about the project. The Chief Minister on Thursday said in a Ariyalur that 92% of farmers and landowners are in favour of the project and only a few are opposing it. The protesters said that they would not part away their lands at any cost for the project. The protesters also raised black flags at their residences and farmlands here condemning the statement. They demanded that the green corridor project which would be constructed destroying several acres of farmlands and forests here should be stopped. The protesters demanded that the CM should meet them and hear their grievances. R. Mohanasundaram, one of the protesters said, “Is the Chief Minister ready to release the details of survey numbers and landowners who are in favour of the project? Why is CM lying about the project? Governments should scrap the project and expand existing highways.” He added that the Chief Minister, who is also a farmer, has disgraced the farmer protest in Delhi by calling them brokers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cms-statement-on-green-corridor-project-flayed/article33369401.ece

19 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Stay doesn’t augur well for city, say activists||The stay on the order of the Karnataka High Court to hold polls to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) within six weeks has dashed the hopes of citizens and civil society members of having an elected body in place. Many were of the view that a postponement of polls to the local body will not augur well for the city. M. Shivaraju, former Opposition leader in the BBMP Council said the amendment to Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, increasing the number of wards to 243, and the hurried approval to the BBMP Bill 2020 were ruses to put off polls. “The BBMP, with an administrator in place of an elected body, has been taking decisions such as imposition of user fee, increasing cess etc. These are decisions that should be taken by an elected council and not an administrator,” he said. Mr. Shivaraju, along with Abdul Wajid, also a former Opposition leader, had filed a PIL petition in the Karnataka High Court challenging the government’s decision to defer elections to the BBMP council. The HC issued directions for holding elections expeditiously, which was stayed by the SC on Friday. Highly placed sources said with this development, all activities taken up for the polls, such as delimitation, fixing reservation, etc. will come to a stop, albeit temporarily. “The MLAs will reign supreme in the absence of councillors. As it is, the MLAs’ roles in the new BBMP Bill encroaches on the duties and roles of councillors,” sources pointed out. Concurring, former Mayor G. Padmavathi said with no councillors, citizens were finding it difficult to get their problems addressed. “If there is no water supply or if the street lights are not working or parks are not maintained properly, can the citizens approach the MLA? The biggest complaint is also that officials are not approachable. In these difficult times, the citizens don’t have anyone to turn to,” she said. V.S. Ugrappa, former MP, termed the development as unfortunate. He pointed out as per Article 243 of the Constitution, it is clear that there shall always be an elected body in place in the local bodies/ authorities and that there shall be no administrator. He also said that giving MLAs deciding powers in the affairs, duties and responsibilities of the local body was against the spirit of the Constitution and 74th Amendment. Activists too held a similar view. Polls to the BBMP need to be held as early as possible to ensure there is a council in place to address the affairs of the city, said Sapna Karim, head of Civic Participation, Janaagraha. “Infrastructure issues abound and without ward councillors, the current structure of administrators and nodal officers are not sufficient for any medium to long term period,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stay-doesnt-augur-well-for-city-say-activists/article33369823.ece
19 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Missing health officer traced||Hoskote taluk Health Officer Manjunath, who was reported missing on December 15 when he did not reach home after leaving office in his car, was traced to Hassan on Friday. Fearing the worst, the police had intensified their search after his colleagues staged a protest on Thursday. “We were very relieved to learn that the taluk health officer is unharmed. In his statement, he said that he had been depressed and stressed over events after conducting a raid recently on a private hospital, and decided to go on a long drive,” said an officer attached to the Nelamangala police station. He left his office four days ago after work in his car, but instead of driving home, he switched off his mobile phone. He told mediapersons that he drove to Chikkaballapura, Ramanagaram and from there headed to Mangaluru. “He then decided to return home and drove back to Hassan,” the officer added. By this time, the police had launched a massive search. A police team saw his car and escorted him to the Nelamangala police station. Aide of MLC involved According to sources, Manjunath was being harassed by Jayaraj, an aide of MLC M.T.B. Nagaraj. On December 10, Manjunath had raided a private hospital and seized medicines worth Rs. 10 lakh that were stored in the premises and sold illegally. “Family members and colleagues claimed that he became very tense after the raid. On the day he disappeared, Jayaraj and his accomplices confronted Manjunath at his workplace demanding that he return the seized drugs,” said a police source. After the confrontation, Manjunath went to lodge a complaint with the Hoskote police only to find Jayaraj there. “At the station, the police reportedly advised the official against filing a complaint and urged the two men to compromise. While he was leaving the station, Jayaraj once again allegedly threatened him,” said a source, adding that these events that precipitated Manjunath’s decision to drive away on his own. A highly-placed source said the police discouraged Manjunath from filing a complaint due to the upcoming gram panchayat elections. While the taluk health officer has not filed a complaint against Jayaraj, his family members are demanding that action be taken. “I was so upset that I had switched off my phone and was not following the news. However last night, I saw my office staff staging a protest and many of them crying, which made me realise that I had to come back,” Manjunath said.  “I was so upset that I switched off my phone and was not following the news.

19 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Those detained had no role in violence at Wistron plant’||Activists and trade unions have questioned the detention of several contract workers claiming that their involvement in the recent violent protest at the Wistron Infocomm Manufacturing Ltd. facility in Narasapura in Kolar is questionable. One of the people the police had detained was Kolar taluk president of Students’ Federation of India, Srikanth, who was interrogated on his alleged role before he was released on Thursday. According to Varalakshmi from the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Mr. Srikanth had no part to play in the protest at the facility, which manufactures iPhones for Apple. “Many of the workers have been detained for over 36 hours. There is no information of whether FIRs have been filed against them or if they have been sent to jail. Parents of these workers are just waiting outside the office of the Superintendent of Police in the hope of getting some information about their children,” she said. Thousands of contract workers, allegedly led by an armed group of men who broke into the facility early Saturday morning, ransacked the premises demanding their wages, which were pending for three months. They were also protesting 12-hour shifts without overtime pay. She said that most of those working at the plant were aged between 18 years and 24 years. “With colleges shut, students had joined the facility to earn what they could so that they could pay their fees. When the salaries were not being disbursed properly, students had formed a group on WhatsApp. Here, they were discussing the next course of action, which included a protest at 11 a.m. on December 12,” she said. However, the unrest started early on December 12 around 3 a.m. and took a violent turn. Earlier in the day, members of the Joint Committee of Trade Unions said that Wistron had failed to adhere to labour laws while also blaming the government for failing to keep a check. They also demanded withdrawal of all cases against the workers and their release.  With colleges shut, students had joined the facility to earn what they could so that they could pay their fees Varalakshmi, Centre of Indian Trade Unions||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/those-detained-had-no-role-in-violence-at-wistron-plant/article33369441.ece
19 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 fallout: Govt. college enrolments pick up||The number of students enrolling in government degree colleges has seen an increase over the past few weeks as students are choosing them over private colleges because of the lower tuition fee. Many parents have been unable to afford high fees in private colleges on account of circumstances resulting out of the pandemic. According to data provided by the Department of Collegiate Education (DCE), 1.28 lakh students were admitted in the first year for UG programmes in the 2020-21 academic year. The number of students admitted in first year in the previous academic year too was 1.28 lakh. Pradeep P., Commissioner, DCE, said that though initially admissions to government degree colleges were low, they later picked up after principals and lecturers of all 430 government first grade colleges were asked to conduct enrolment drives. D.S. Prathima, principal, Government First Grade College, Malleswaram, said this year, 421 students had enrolled for UG programmes for the first year, an increase from 353 last year. She, and other principals, pointed out that one of the reasons students preferred government colleges was the reasonable fee. While the annual fee is around Rs. 4,000 for UG programmes, in private colleges it is in the range of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 45,000 B. Chandrashekar, principal, Government First Grade College, Vijayanagar, said 1,200 students were admitted in the first year this academic year — the same as last year. “This year, we received around 2,000 applications, which is an increase from the previous year. We were not able to accommodate around 400 students who wanted to enrol in the B. Com programmes as we have only a few classrooms and run the college on a shift system,” he said. The principal of a city-based private degree college admitted that admissions were low as many students were unable to afford the fees. “We have even given students the option to pay the fees in three instalments. But, many students said they’ll be unable to pay as their parents have lost jobs or seen huge pay cuts.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-fallout-govt-college-enrolments-pick-up/article33369426.ece
19 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Notice to govt. on plea about traffic police not using cameras||The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to the State government and the Bengaluru City Police on a PIL petition complaining of the non-use of 50 body-worn cameras procured at a cost of Rs. 75 lakh to monitor the behaviour of traffic police personnel and motorists during the checking of traffic norm violations. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order on a petition filed by Geetha Misra, a resident of Rajajianagar engaged in social and animal welfare activities. The petitioner also sought a direction to the government to strictly put to use the already procured cameras for Bengaluru city and procure more such cameras to be put to use across major cities in the State. It was contended in the petition that the body-worn cameras would help in two ways — firstly in keeping tabs on the behaviour of traffic police personnel and verifying allegations of bribery, and secondly in ensuring the safety of the police when they encounter motorists behaving rudely. Fifty body-worn cameras, to be fixed on the collar flap or the shirt pocket, were procured in early 2019. The storing unit attached to the cameras have the facility to record video and audio for up to 10 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/notice-to-govt-on-plea-about-traffic-police-not-using-cameras/article33369433.ece
19 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||One more special court to deal with criminal cases against lawmakers||Now, one more special court has been set up in the city to exclusively deal with criminal cases against MPs, MLAs, and MLCs. The first one was set up in 2018. Following this, the High Court has posted district judge Shridhar Gopalakrishna Bhat as the judge of the newly set up 90th Addition City Civil and Sessions Court, which has been designated as the second special court to deal with criminal cases against lawmakers. The State government set up the second special court based on the suggestions made by the Supreme Court and the High Court of Karnataka, which has taken up the issue of pendency before the special court set up in 2018 in a suo motu PIL petition initiated on the directions of the apex court to monitor progress of trial in criminal cases against MPs, MLAs, and MLCs.  Screening prosecutors Meanwhile, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty, while hearing the PIL initiated suo motu , has suggested to both the Central and State governments to set up a mechanism to screen the public prosecutors before assigning them with the task of conducting trial of cases against MPs, MLAs, and MLCs. Earlier, the State government, in response to details sought by the court in an earlier hearing, said that it had appointed public prosecutors, who had a minimum 11 years of experience as prosecutors, to the special court dealing with cases against lawmakers. On the other hand, Senior Advocate Adiya Sondhi, amicus curiae appointed by the High Court, pointed out that the Income Tax Department had a screening committee headed by a senior officer to select prosecutors to defend its cases in courts and similar procedure could be followed while posting public prosecutors to the special courts dealing with cases against MPs, MLAs, and MLCs. There are about 162 cases pending against lawmakers in the special court in Karnataka of which 36 have been booked by the State police and 136 by the agencies such as the Lokayukta, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-more-special-court-to-deal-with-criminal-cases-against-lawmakers/article33369444.ece

19 December 2020||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||There is urgent need for revival of media: Vice-President||Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Friday felt there was an urgent need for the revival of media to uphold the ethos of journalism. He was delivering the 6th M.V. Kamath Endowment Lecture at Manipal, organised by the Manipal Institute of Communication under Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), virtually. Missing values are a major concern in journalism, Mr. Naidu said. Elaborating the historical significance of journalism, Mr. Naidu said he was disheartened over the state of it in the present day. The responsibility of the media lies in bridging the gap between the government and people, with an analytical approach supported by evidence. However, present-day journalism was far beyond the ethical expectations while the line between news and fake news was becoming thin. The advent of innovative technological revolution has made the rivalry intense thereby leading towards sensationalism and exaggeration, Mr. Naidu said. He further said paid news, declining values, and profit agenda in the media were highly disturbing. Speaking about the freedom of the press, Mr. Naidu said it was inevitable. At the same time, one should remember freedom comes with responsibilities, which should be executed on priority. The mushrooming of news media organisations has resulted in declining values. Quoting the recent propaganda techniques followed in the suicide case of a film actor, Mr. Naidu said it was disturbing to observe media playing the role of crusader for wrong reasons. He stressed on the need for serious thoughts enabling print media with a better share of revenue to ensure sanctity of the legacy media. He added the very idea of news gathering was devalued while stressing that news and views should stay always apart. The Vice-President praised the late M.V. Kamath and said he remained the testimony for several remarkable milestones in the history of pre- and post-independent India. He termed him an iconic personality with true values, who created his own charisma. MAHE Pro-Chancellor H.S. Ballal shared his rapport with the former journalist and MIC’s honorary director. MIC Director Padma Rani was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/there-is-urgent-need-for-revival-of-media-v-p/article33369417.ece
19 December 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Shetty should have emulated Shankaramurthy’||Legislative Council Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty should have followed the precedent set by former Chairman D.H. Shankaramurthy when a no-confidence motion was tabled against him, said Pratap Simha Nayak, MLC, on Friday. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Nayak said when the motion was to be put for voting, Mr. Murthy did not occupy the seat of Chairman and sat with the other members while Deputy Chairman Marithibbe Gowda conducted the proceedings on June 15, 2017. It was another matter that the motion was defeated by one vote, he said. However, on December 15, Mr. Shetty played to the politics of the Congress and refused to put forth the motion of no-confidence for voting, Mr. Nayak said. The MLC added that though Mr. Shetty was a tall personality as an individual, he appeared to be acting under the instructions of his party. “He should immediately step down on moral grounds.” He said there were three or four instances of Mr. Shetty appearing to not be acting impartially while holding high office, and hence the BJP had decided to move the no-confidence motion against him. Acting against the principles of natural justice that no one should be the judge in his own cause, Mr. Shetty rejected the no-confidence motion notice on technical grounds, Mr. Nayak said. He said there were only two options for Mr. Shetty after the notice of no-confidence was given — to face it or resign. He did neither and continued to occupy the post without any moral authority, the BJP leader said. Adopting Mangaluru Meanwhile, Mr. Nayak said he has adopted Mangaluru as the nodal taluk for development as an MLC. “Though I could assist development in any part of the State, I chose Dakshina Kannada in general and Mangaluru taluk in particular.” Mr. Nayak also opened his office at Mangaluru City Corporation building and said he would be available to the general public every Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shetty-should-have-emulated-shankaramurthy/article33369976.ece

More than 90% of them will win in Dakshina Kannada. With leadership crisis at the Centre and the State, gram panchayat candidates are not get the support from the Congress. The Congress is not getting candidates at several gram panchayats. The party will be thoroughly exposed in the elections,” he said. The BJP was confident of victory in the ensuing byelections to Begur, Basavakalyan, and Maski Assembly constituencies, he said. Welcoming the new members to the party, Mr. Kateel said there are good number of disgruntled Congress leaders who want to join the BJP. The party will not discriminate with the new members and there will be no harm to their reputation. Mr. Madhava, who has been in the Congress for 22 years, said he had to leave the party as there was a conspiracy to lower his reputation by people close to senior Congress leader B. Ramanath Rai. “I could not tolerate the way my husband was being treated,” Ms. Manjula said.

19 December 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Farm reforms being thwarted, says Shobha Karandlaje||Shobha Karandlaje, Udupi-Chikkamagalur MP, on Friday said a section of people was spreading lies for political gains and to defeat the Union government’s commitment to double farmers’ income. Speaking to reporters at Udupi, Ms. Karandlaje said the amendments to farm laws were passed after consultation with all political parties. “However opposition parties are now agitating against them solely for political gains. The Bills will ensure farmers that are not cheated by middlemen as they will now have the freedom to sell their produce outside APMCs to get better prices,” she said. The MP further alleged divisive politics followed by the Congress could be seen in the ongoing farmers’ protest rallies that were sponsored by vested interests. Real farmers have held protests in the past against the exploitation by middlemen in APMCs, she claimed. “In the Left-ruled Kerala, there are no APMCs. Then what is the rationale behind opposing reforms in the farm sector,” she asked. The bills were discussed in detail in the standing committee concerned where all political parties had expressed their views.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farm-reforms-being-thwarted-says-shobha-karandlaje/article33369966.ece

Importantly, the lab also carried out tests of the samples sent from far-off districts, including Uttara Kannada, Davangere, Gadag, Ramanagaram, and Tumakuru. The district had remained a “green district” for a considerable period of time when other districts in the State reported a spurt in COVID-19 cases. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had appreciated the efforts for keeping the district free from the pandemic for a long time. Tests per day The samples was being sent to Mysuru for the tests since Chamarajanagar lacked the lab and the necessary devices for conducting the tests in the beginning. However, within a short span of time, the lab was set up on the premises of CIMS and the swab tests crossed one lakh mark in a span of eight months. On an average, 1,000 tests are done at the lab. There have been times when the number of tests had exceeded 1,000. The lab has been upgraded into a facility for providing swab test results within 24 hours. When the cases had peaked, the lab and its staff had worked round the clock to handle the rush. According to the district administration, the district could control the spread of the infection because of the efficiency of the lab which gave faster results. The case load has dropped substantially and faster swab tests was attributed as one of the reasons for controlling the pandemic. Besides handling the swabs from the district, samples from other districts too were tested and the results were sent to the respective health authorities. The lab comprises of the head of the department of microbiology, three researchers, eight lab technicians, seven data entry operators, and three multitasking staff. Deputy Commissioner M.R.

19 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘If not for coalition govt., Cong. MLAs would not have resigned’||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday said the 14 Congress MLAs who joined the BJP last year would have remained with the party ifthe Congress had not formed a coalition with the JD(S). Addressing the ‘Grama Janadhikara’ convention of Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency, organised in connection with the upcoming gram panchayat elections, he said the Congress MLAs jumped ship because of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy’s inability to run the government. The MLAs fell out with the then Chief Minister because he was functioning from a five-star hotel instead of attending office and meeting legislators, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. Even if the MLAs met him and handed over representations, he would simply hand them over to officials without bothering to follow up, he added. “During my five-year tenure as Chief Minister, not even one MLA went against me.” Mr. Siddaramaiah also said the coalition government with Mr. Kumaraswamy at the helm would not have come about in the first place had he opposed the party high command’s decision to form the coalition. On C.M. Ibrahim Mr. Siddaramaiah also claimed that former Union Minister and party colleague C.M. Ibrahim would not join the JD(S). Fielding reporters’ queries in Mysuru, he asked, “He [Mr. Ibrahim]is an MLC from the Congress. How can he go?” Mr. Ibrahim had recently met JD(S) supremo and former Prime Minister H.D.

19 December 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah suspects his own partymen sabotaged his chances in Chamundeshwari||The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday suspected that his prospects in the 2018 Assembly elections in Chamundeshwari were sabotaged by his own partymen, besides the BJP and the JD(S) which entered into “an internal understanding”. “Whoever has worked against me in the elections should introspect and leave the party. If they do not believe in the leadership of the party, they should not continue in the party,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said addressing his first party workers’ meeting in Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency after the 2018 loss. While the BJP fielded a candidate who had lost even the gram panchayat elections and was unknown in Karnataka politics against the chief ministerial candidate, apparently to support the JD(S) as part of their “internal understanding”, a few others, who were averse to him becoming the Chief Minister again, plotted his rout in the polls, Mr. Siddaramaiah rued. Caste factor He recalled that people belonging to one caste were in favour of BJP leader B.S. Yediyurappa becoming the Chief Minister while another group rooted for H.D. Kumaraswamy for the top job in the State. But now people cutting across caste lines are convinced that the State witnessed the “golden rule” during his period as Chief Minister, he claimed. Expressing pain over his electoral rout in Chamundeshwari, Mr. Siddarmaiah said his political future would have been shrouded in darkness had he not won from Badami constituency. ‘Why did they lie?’ He claimed that he never expected to lose so badly, particularly afterpeople showered him with love and affection whenever he visited villages in the constituency. He also expressed hurt over the feedback he received from the booth-level workers who came back to him after polling and expressed confidence of his victory. “Why did they lie to me?” he asked. “I don’t know whether I will contest elections again or not. I can’t bear the pain,” he said, adding that he chose Chamundeshwari as the constituency for his last elections before retirement out of gratitude to the people of the constituency for giving him political rebirth in the 2006 byelection. Responding to a call from the crowd to come back as the Congress candidate in the next Assembly elections, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked “What will I do if I am stabbed again?” The next Assembly elections were still two years and four months away, he said while asking the party workers to remain united in the gram panchayat elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-suspects-his-own-partymen-sabotaged-his-chances-in-chamundeshwari/article33369448.ece

19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,KARNATAKA||HC order on BBMP polls stayed||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a Karnataka High Court judgment of December 4 that directed the State Election Commission to conduct elections to only 198 wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) within six weeks. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Election Commission and the original petitioners in the High Court — M. Shivaraju and Abdul Wajid — on an appeal filed by the Karnataka government. The government said the High Court judgment nullified the unanimous will of the State legislature, which is made up of the representatives of the people and which amended the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act of 1976 to increase the number of wards in Bengaluru to 243. The 1976 Act governs the BBMP. The High Court, on December 4, had ordered the BBMP elections to be held to 198 wards as per the delimitation of wards published on June 23. The State government, represented by advocate Subhranshu Padhi, said the High Court had severely handicapped efforts to “improve urban governance in one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in India”. “The increase in number of wards was necessitated by the fact that the population and demographics of the city have undergone vast changes since 2009 (when the number of wards was increased to 198), thereby necessitating an increase in wards and their redrawing into smaller, more administrable sizes,” the State argued. The petition said the High Court had erroneously read down the provisions to mean that the amended provisions would not apply to elections to those corporations that were due prior to the amended provisions coming into force. The government contended that the High Court had directed the State to conduct the elections in a manner contrary to “a validly and unanimously enacted piece of legislation by the State legislature”. It said that Article 243-ZA(2) of the Constitution conferred power on the State legislature to, by law, make provisions with respect to “all matters relating to or in connection with elections to municipalities”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-order-on-bbmp-polls-stayed/article33369431.ece
19 December 2020||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||State experiencing its most corrupt govt.: Priyank||Karnataka is now experiencing its most corrupt government, Priyank Kharge, MLA and KPCC spokesperson, said here on Friday. “The BJP came to power by spending money. When money plays a decisive role, how can the people expect a good governance,” he questioned. Mr. Kharge was speaking after inaugurating a programme where the newly nominated Yadgir block Congress president, Sudarshan Naik, took charge in Yadgir on Friday. He attacked the State government for neglecting Kalyana Karnataka and for the increase in illegal activities such as IPL betting and drug transportation. He said the people were getting confused as to whether the administration was being run by the RSS or the Chief Minister or the three Deputy Chief Ministers or others, as official transfers have taken the front seat while development the back seat. The former Minister targeted both the Centre and the State government for neglecting the State and Kalyan Karnataka with regard to development projects. “The State government has adopted a stepmotherly treatment for the region for which Article 371 (J) was introduced during the UPA-II regime to eradicate regional imbalance. The State government should release a grant of Rs. 1,500 crore every year to take up development works. But, this year, it just released half of it and also did not fill the vacant posts. When the government is keen in appointing posts and developing other regions even during a pandemic, why can’t it be done here,” he questioned. Mr. Kharge said that the situation in the country has been becoming more worrisome. “You will be projected as an anti-national if you don’t agree with the ideology of the RSS and the BJP,” he said. “Who are you to certify one’s patriotism merely because he opposes you on a development basis? Is it justifiable? No. This country should be ruled by equality, freedom of speech and by the Constitution,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-experiencing-its-most-corrupt-govt-priyank/article33369424.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Lockdown saw police learn on the job||The year 2020 dawned with the usual revelry, but what one was to discover very soon was that it would pose an altogether new set of challenges for the Karnataka police. As the pandemic took flight, country after country closed its borders imposing a lockdown of varying severity in their cities and States. In India, the onerous task of enforcing the lockdown fell on the shoulders of the police. It was a whole new ball game for which the police was neither equipped or trained nor prepared. Police high-handedness in the early days of the lockdown rightly led to loud criticism from aggrieved citizens. But during the tapering phase, the same police force was praised for the numerous acts of selfless service personnel rendered to different cross-sections of society. The picture of the brave Punjab Head Constable stopping lockdown violators at the risk of his arm being severed will be etched in our memory as long as the horrors of COVID-19 are remembered. That 11% of Karnataka’s policemen tested positive and 87 breathed their last as on November 2, 2020, is evidence of their major role as frontline warriors in our fight against the pandemic. The policemen have endangered their personal safety and those of their families by going beyond the call of duty, often working round-the-clock without relief or a break. Migrant labour camps The lockdown and the abrupt cancellation of road and rail transport stranded thousands of migrant workers from within the State and other parts of the country. Police handled the thankless job of maintaining order among restive labourers in camps, ensuring distribution of food and dry ration at these camps and other food shelters before transporting them to train and bus stations after coordinating with authorities. Kitchens had to be organised in many police stations to feed not just personnel working overtime, but also daily wage earners who were suddenly rendered without livelihood. Another feature of the lockdown was the imposition of day curfew, when people could not move out of their homes even for medical emergencies without a valid pass. Issue of local passes and those for inter- and intra-State movement became the responsibility of the police. While the pressure on the police was tremendous, the crisis for citizens was of such humongous proportions that they had to trace and recollect their long long-lost contacts in the police department to seek their intervention for a pass! On drug abuse During the latter part of 2020, close on the heels of the drug-related investigations by the Narcotics Control Bureau against Bollywood stars, the police launched raids on Karnataka film industry personalities. Many film stars were arrested, while some well-connected accused managed to evade arrest. Huge hauls of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances were recovered. This may mislead citizens into believing that there has been a sudden spike in drug crimes. On the contrary, drug abuse and related violations of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act have always existed and have been increasing by leaps and bounds. Enforcement of the NDPS Act, like any other special law, calls for proactive enforcement. Action in fits and starts is no solution. Now that we have functional narcotic units in Bengaluru city police and the CID, sustained action against drug crimes is the need of the hour lest they spiral out of control calling for extreme measures, like in Punjab. Drop in crime The month-long lockdown and other restrictions that followed resulted in a steep decline in crime. With little or no traffic on our roads, accidents came down drastically. With most institutions and industries, and even places of worship virtually closed for a major part of the year, there were hardly any gatherings and no scope for public order situations save the migrant workers issues. But the diversion of police resources to tackle COVID-19 related work came at a heavy price: day-to-day work, which is the bulwark of policing, was put on the backburner. Reeling under shortage of manpower even at the best of times, preoccupation with non-core functions and piling arrears of record updation, the pandemic set the clock back. Citizen-centric work, such as beat patrolling, investigation, and preventive action, suffered a setback. The damage done But then that is the nature of police work. The events that unfolded this year, from the pandemic to the sudden and stringent lockdown, are unprecedented in history. The Karnataka police will have to learn to live with it.  (S.T.

The candidates, who had filed nomination papers for the wards covering these two villages, have also withdrawn the papers. Many houses were damaged due to the heavy rain and the landslips in 2019. The five families of Malemane have been staying in rented houses at different places. The residents alleged that the government did not provide land and houses for the affected people. Susheela and Preethi, the two candidates who had filed nomination papers, withdrew the papers extending support to the boycott. “I have withdrawn nomination as the flood-hit people have not received the relief,” she said. Raju, who lost his house in the rain, said the government should rehabilitate the affected people. “If the government does not respond, we will protest outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Chikkamagaluru,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-of-two-villages-in-mudigere-taluk-to-boycott-polls/article33369576.ece

The accused has been identified as Mubharak, resident of Devanahalli. “The alleged incident took place on December 10 morning. The girl, who is 19 years old, took help from locals to lodge a complaint,” said a police officer. According to the police, the girl studies computer science but works part-time for an event management company. “On December 9, she had come to Thanisandra to host a marriage function. She spent the night in the marriage hall as the event wrapped up late,” the police officer added. Early next morning, she left the hall to take a bus home. While waiting for the bus, Mubharak drove up and offered to drop her home as it was on his way. She got into the auto. “After a while, he took a wrong turn. When the girl forced him to stop the auto, he told her that he wanted to collect money from his friend who lived nearby. He drove to an isolated location and raped her. He dropped her off near the main road and warned her not to report the incident. The girl took the help of a biker to reach Sampigehalli police station where she lodged a complaint. “She had taken down the vehicle number. We tracked down the accused,” the officer added.

Officials said that train services for air passengers, which were tentatively scheduled to begin this week, will be introduced only after the elections. Chief public relations officer of South Western Railways E. Vijaya said that the newly built halt station near the airport falls under thelimits of a gram panchayat near Devanahalli. “As the code of conduct is in place, introduction of new train services will be delayed till the elections are over.

19 December 2020||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||23,354 tonnes of paddy procured||The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) has procured 23,354 tonnes of paddy from farmers in Alappuzha as the additional (second) crop season is nearing completion. According to officials, harvest and procurement of the additional crop, except in one field in the Alappuzha municipal area, have been completed in the district. “The field in the Alappuzha municipal area will be harvested in the coming days. Around Rs. 40 crore has so far been disbursed to farmers as procurement price for the additional crop season,” said an official of Supplyco on Friday. Lower yield The yield is lower this time after the August floods destroyed the additional paddy crop in around 3,500 hectares, a majority in Kuttanad. However, crop in around 5,300 hectares survived the floods. This was the third year in a row that the district suffered crop loss in the additional crop season. Last year, heavy rain caused bund breaches and flooding, destroying paddy in large tracts. In 2018, back-to-back floods had destroyed the additional crop in its entirety. Earlier, a delay in the procurement of the additional crop had put farmers in some distress. The issue was triggered after mills decided to keep away from paddy procurement as they failed to reach an agreement with the government over compensation for the procured paddy which got destroyed in the 2018 floods. Following this, the government decided to rope in cooperative societies to procure paddy directly from farmers. However, lack of storage and other facilities for the cooperative societies in the district resulted in a delay in the procurement. The impasse ended after an agreement was reached between Supplyco and mill owners by October end. Sowing begins Meanwhile, sowing for the ‘puncha’ season is progressing in the district. So far, paddy was sown in around 20,000 hectares, with another 7,000 hectares is expected to be brought under cultivation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/23354-tonnes-of-paddy-procured/article33369548.ece
19 December 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||Upper hand for Joseph||The much-hyped ‘setback’ suffered by the Joseph faction of the Kerala Congress (M) in Idukki turns out to be hypothetical as the figures in the local body elections show. Compared to the Jose K. Mani faction, which contested the elections under the Left Democratic Front banner, the P.J. Joseph faction in the United Democratic Front scored well in grama panchayats and the district panchayat. While the Joseph faction won 84 seats in grama panchayats, the Mani faction got 47seats. In the block panchayat, the two factions got 12 seats each, and in the district panchayat, the Joseph faction bagged four seats while the Jose faction secured just one. In the Thodupuzha municipality, both the factions won two seats each. The two UDF rebels there will decide the ruling front as the UDF had 13 seats, LDF 12, and the National Democratic Alliance won eight seats. In the Kattappana municipality, the Joseph faction got three seats and the Mani faction, two. The UDF has a clear majority there. Mani group view A leader of the Mani faction, however, said they had made inroads in the Christian stronghold in the district and the trend would continue in the Assemlby elections. He said this was for the first time that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) got a major chunk of Christian votes after the party joined the front. Former president of the Muttom grama panchayat K.J. Kurien, who is in the Joseph faction, said it was the rebels in the Congress that played spoilsport to the party and the front. Only two win The media reports of the Joseph faction cutting a sorry figure were based on the initial results in the Thodupuzha municipality, considered the stronghold of party leader P.J. Joseph. Five candidates fielded by it were defeated there and only two managed to win. It gave the impression that the faction faced a reprisal in the entire district, according to leaders. In the plantation areas of Udumbanchola and Devikulam taluks, both the factions have little base.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/upper-hand-for-joseph/article33369543.ece

This will further delay their commissioning, which was slated to be held soon after the local body polls. A month ago, the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK), which awarded the contract for the Kundannoor flyover, had requested IIT-Madras to conduct a load test over the structure, to assess whether its deflection when fully-loaded lorries passed over was within norms. The test costing around Rs. 3 lakh had been included in the contractual agreement too. Defects, if any, will have to be rectified by the builder company at its own expense, sources said. They added that a load test might be conducted on the Vyttila flyover too. “A three-member panel of PWD chief engineers had inspected the structures a week ago. The date of the test could have been fixed earlier, but for the delay in completing work on the Kundannoor flyover. It will most likely be held in a week,” they said. Work on the Vyttila flyover got over a month ago, while allied infrastructure like retro-reflective direction boards and road markings were done a week ago. A few more boards will be installed this week. Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) has installed signal systems at the two junctions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-flyovers-awaiting-load-test/article33369452.ece
19 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Webinar series to promote good parenting practices||Taking serious note of the parenting gaps adversely affecting children in their growing stage, the Women and Child Development Department is set to launch a long-running series of webinars to promote good and responsible parenting. The first in the series of webinars on positive parenting will be held on Saturday at 7.30 a.m. T.V. Anilkumar, Professor of Psychiatry at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, will address the doubts of parents. “We allow advance queries from parents over a WhatsApp number (82818-99479) and in the first two days alone, we have received over 65 queries. These queries will be categorised by our team of nine resource persons based on which the topic of each webinar will be decided,” said Nishad K.M., programme officer, Integrated Child Protection Scheme, Women and Child Development Department. The webinar will be held live over Zoom but will be available over the department’s YouTube channel and Facebook page. Parents can send in queries during the course of a session through these social media platforms and the resource persons will address them at the end of each session. Webinars will be held every alternative Saturdays and will last two to three hours. “We will run the webinars as long as queries keep coming in, and based on the nature of doubts, we will bring in subject experts on parenting as well,” said Mr. Nishad. The department conceived the programme after numerous studies attributed the conflicts and propensity to crime among children to the absence of proper parenting. A recent study commissioned by the department on increased children suicides had also pointed at parenting issues, including excessive scolding by parents, for the psychological distress among children. The department had also run a campaign for good parenting in October the findings of which have inspired the creation of messages for the latest programme, which will focus, among other things, drug addiction, academic pressure and Internet and cartoon addiction among children. Plans are also afoot to take the message of good parenting to individual households with the help of a handbook using anganwadi workers. Publicity campaigns for the programme roping in parenting experts and celebrities are also being planned.  We will run the webinars as long as queries keep coming in, and based on the nature of doubts, we will bring in subject experts on parenting as well Nishad K.M.

19 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Chargesheet filed against four in Church forgery case||The police on Friday filed the chargesheet at the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kakkanad, against the four accused in a case relating to the alleged forgery of bank documents to de fame Cardinal Mar George Alencherry, Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church. Fr. Tony Kallookkaran, former secretary to Mar Alencherry, is the first accused. Fr. Paul Thelakkat, senior priest, figured as the second accused. Fr. Benny John Maramparambil is the third accused and Aditya Z. Valavi, an IT engineer, is the fourth accused. Money transfer The police said the forged documents were created by Mr. Aditya from his computer kept at his father’s hardware shop. It was stated that he forged the documents and emailed them to Fr. Thelakkat on the directive of Fr. Kallookkaran. The allegation was that the accused placed them before the synod of the Syro-Malabar Church with an intention to defame the cardinal, the Church, and its institutions. The fake documents that included details about money transfer of Rs. 16 lakh from the account of Mar Alencherry to a hotel chain company were created by the fourth accused on September 21, 2016. He created another fake document claiming that the cardinal had made investment in the company. The police stated that the documents were created on various dates starting August 20, 2018. The investigations revealed that Mar Alencherry did not have bank accounts in the private bank as mentioned in the forged documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chargesheet-filed-against-four-in-church-forgery-case/article33369569.ece
19 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Political alternatives catch voters’ imagination||The inroads made by V4Kochi into voters’ minds, four months since its launch promising tangible development and against corruption, has surprised the common man and political observers. “The candidates we fielded in 59 divisions of the Kochi Corporation got 10.20% of the total vote share, a substantial figure for a new political movement. Three of them bagged the second position, with Shibu Chammany Kodathu winning 1,213 votes in the Palarivattom Division,” said V4Kochi joint campaign controller G. Manoj Kumar, a merchant navy captain, who has taken a break from his job. “Moreover, our candidates secured over 500 votes in 15 divisions, making it to the third place. All this shows that people were very much frustrated with the civic agency’s functioning and wanted a viable alternative. Over the years, approximately 20% of development funds ended up in the hands of unscrupulous councillors or their cronies. We wanted to make a difference,” Mr. Manoj Kumar added. Close on the heels of Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam announcing that it would field candidates in the Assembly polls, V4Kochi has begun efforts to boost its organisational strength, and a political movement, V4Kerala, has been announced. Socio-environmental activist C.R. Neelakandan lauded the movement’s initiatives and said it must be consistent in its tirade against inefficiency and corruption. “Over time, it will evolve into a more democratic forum. Such movements have a future, since over 50% of voters in urban centres now accord the pride of place to developmental issues and a clean track record, unlike in the past when political affiliation mattered. They are at an advantage, especially at the level of local bodies, where State and national politics matter little,” he said. Kerala is the ideal place for movements like V4Kochi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam, said P.C. Cyriac, who served as Additional Chief Secretary, Tamil Nadu. After his candidature in the 2016 Assembly election from Kothamangalam, he joined AAP a month ago and was State coordinator of the party’s election committee. “There is tremendous room for those pursuing alternative, development-oriented politics, since most educated people of Kerala are fed up with the traditional dominance of the two political fronts,” said Mr. Cyriac.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/political-alternatives-catch-voters-imagination/article33369939.ece

19 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Multilingual call centre launched for aquafarmers||In a first of its kind initiative, the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) has launched a multilingual call centre for aquafarmers. Besides addressing technical issues, it will serve as a platform where domain experts will provide information on efficient farming methods. Launching the call centre at Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh through videoconferencing on Tuesday, MPEDA Chairman K.S. Srinivas said it would help aquafarmers in Andhra Pradesh seek advice from experts following the best management practices to boost production and ensure quality of products. “I request aquafarmers to make use of the toll-free number 1800-425-4648 using IVRS [interactive voice response system] to clear their technical doubts in consultation with experts. It will also help them in seeking information about the various support schemes extended by the field offices of MPEDA,” he said. The call centre will primarily cater for aquafarmers in Andhra Pradesh, which contributes more than 60% of the marine product export basket. It can also handle calls in English and Hindi. India produced 7,47,111 tonnes of shrimp last year, of which more than 68% had come from Andhra Pradesh alone from its over 52,000 shrimp farms covering a water spread area of 75,000 hectares. “Viewed in this context, it demonstrates the enormous importance of the call centre in the State,” the MPEDA chairman said. “It also underlines the fact that MPEDA has remained at the forefront in taking up initiatives to augment seafood exports from the country by extending all possible help to farmers,” he added. MPEDA Director Karthikeyan said small-scale aquaculture farmers were not getting proper guidance and technical support, especially during the culture period. “It forces them to seek advice from inexperienced consultants. This often leads to crop failures and quality issues,” he pointed out.  MPEDA has taken initiatives to augment seafood exports from the country by extending all possible help to farmers K.S.

19 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||‘Maths lab at home’ shows a new way||The pandemic crisis has prompted the Education Department to come up with the ‘Maths lab at home’ initiative to encourage students to perform simple experiments using materials available at homes. The move is expected to make up for the loss of practical sessions in classrooms and labs. Students of classes 1 to 7 will be part of the Maths lab at home project. “We have started training sessions for teachers. Block resource centres under the Samagra Shiksha Kerala [SSK] will coordinate the implementation,” said Usha Manatt, District Project Coordinator, SSK. Besides using materials and tools available at home to conduct experiments, the SSK district unit will procure cost-effective learning models and distribute them among students. The department has earmarked Rs. 30 for each student as aid to meet the requirements. “The resource persons in association with Maths teachers will finalise the experiments to be done by children. Teachers will share videos of experiments through WhatsApp and other platforms with students,” said Ms. Manatt. In addition, learners will be encouraged to shoot videos of their experiments. They will be documented by block resource centres and shared through YouTube. The objective of the initiative is to kindle interest in Maths among students. It also aims at encouraging parents to join hands with their wards in making Maths learning an interesting and innovative experience. Teachers handling work experience modules will be roped in for the project. The Education Department hopes that the Maths lab at home project will help in realising that simple learning models can be made at home at reasonable expense. Social Science lab Making a model of the solar system or a pictorial representation of life in the pandemic times will now be part of the ‘Social Science lab at home’ project of the Education Department. Similar to the Maths lab at home initiative, the Social Science lab at home programme is meant for students of classes 5, 6 and 7. According to officials, both the projects were conceived based on the inference that students were missing the feel and fun of doing experiments while confined to their homes in the pandemic times. “There were some gaps in the online learning process, and the absence of practical sessions figured top among them. Students used to have experimental sessions in the lab in the regular classroom learning mode,” they said. For the Social Science lab at home project, the department has devised simple experiments for each class. Accordingly, learners can use chart paper or similar material for making models. SSK block resource centres will support them by providing additional materials. Teachers will guide students and encourage parents to join in assisting their children in creating models.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/maths-lab-at-home-shows-the-way-during-new-normal/article33369459.ece
19 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Police seize ganja, drugs in two operations||The Ernakulam rural police arrested two persons in separate incidents with brown sugar and ganja. The Perumbavoor police arrested Pintu Mandal, 35, of Murshidabad in West Bengal with 5.60 grams of brown sugar. In another case, the Muvattupuzha police seized around half a kg of ganja from the rented house of one Aji Kumar, 44, of Thiruvananthapuram, at Pallippady. The police said that Pintu Mandal had returned to Perumbavoor from Murshidabad last week and was allegedly engaged in selling the drug in small quantities among migrant workers. He had been under police surveillance. Ganja was being sold in small quantities mainly targeting youngsters. The twin operations were carried out at the direction of District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Two separate teams comprising Perumbavoor sub inspector Satheesh S.R. and Muvattupuzha sub inspector Rajan E.V. made the seizures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ganja-drugs-seized-in-two-operations/article33369936.ece

After having won two seats in the 2015 elections, the CPI has notched the figure up to four this time, winning Mattancherry, Perumpadapu, Palarivattom, and Pottakuzhi. “With the CPI(M) taking the post of Mayor, the CPI is entitled to the post of Deputy Mayor. That is unlikely to cause any conflict within the LDF,” said P. Raju, district secretary, CPI. The CPI is likely to suggest the name of K.A. Ansiya, the only woman candidate of the party to have won. Now that the LDF has a majority, setting posts aside for allies will not be a problem, though no definite decisions have been arrived at, said CPI(M) district secretary C.N. Mohanan. After T.K. Ashraf, a former IUML councillor contested as a rebel and won from Kalvathy, he promised support to the LDF on Thursday, taking the front’s tally to 35. The UDF will have the support of 31 councillors in the 74-member council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpi-demands-deputy-mayors-post/article33369941.ece

Her family had expressed their disappointment over the slow pace of investigation and approached the CBI Director pointing out the delay. “I sent a mail when they failed to take our statement even after one year of my daughter’s death. Last month I made an appeal to higher officials and the Prime Minister saying there was no progress in the probe. According to the team of officials, they will be collecting the statements of her friends and classmates who are in different States at present,” said Latheef, Fathima’s father. The 19-year-old was found dead in her hostel room at the IIT Madras on November 9, 2019 and the Kottupuram police had filed a case. After protests demanding a fair probe, the case was first transferred to CCB and then to the CBI.

19 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Rift in JD(S) and NCP to the fore||A possible split in two constituents of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) — the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) — seems to have put in a dampner on the jubilation of Left parties in the just concluded three-tier local body polls in the State. A faction of the JD(S) led by former president C.K. Nanu, MLA, is reportedly planning to hold a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday. The proposed meeting comes when the Central leadership led by party president H.D. Deva Gowda had dissolved the State unit and constituted an ad hoc committee to be headed by his bête noire Mathew T. Thomas, MLA. Mr. Thomas said that those who are facing disciplinary action for anti-party activities had called the meeting and they had no association with the JD(S) State unit. Intense rivalry between the factions of the JD(S) saw the removal of Mr. Thomas from the Cabinet and another leader K. Krishnankutty occupying the Ministerial berth. Interestingly, the likely split may happen when the JD(S) leadership had put on hold a merger with the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), the nascent partner of the LDF. This also assumes significance when the CPI(M) plans to succumb to the demands of the LJD that wants to contest in Vadakara. Another trouble is brewing within the NCP led by Mani C. Kappan, MLA, and Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran. The bone of contention was the Pala segment represented by Mr. Kappan after the Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) has staked claim to contest the seat in the Assembly polls.  With the electoral success in the three-tier local body polls, the CPI(M) leadership would not want to see a split in these constituents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rift-in-jds-and-ncp-to-the-fore/article33369555.ece
19 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||As curbs ease, village tourism entrepreneurs bounce back||Cashing in on the seasonal rush, village tourism entrepreneurs are slowly bouncing back after the COVID-19 crisis, by improving existing facilities and introducing new packages to woo customers. With advance bookings on the rise, they are hoping that the Christmas-New Year season will end the financial crisis caused by the pandemic and the lockdown. “For us, the reopening of various ecotourism destinations has been good news as it has started attracting many domestic travellers. The lockdown-induced stress is now prompting many to explore ecotourism destinations and it is a good chance for tourism facility operators in villages,” says V. Jose, an entrepreneur from Vayalada. He says ecotourism spots such as Thusharagiri, Kakkayam, Peruvannamoozhi, Arippara and Kadalundi are back to usual business. Many small entrepreneurs, including homestay owners and food joint operators, say that they will be able to get back the profit they lost during the pandemic-induced lockdown. Some of them have invested money in improving facilities, hoping that the situation will be back to normal with the availability of vaccines. A homestay entrepreneur from Kayanna panchayat says the lockdown has been a productive period for him as it helped him to think of renovations and prepared him better to host domestic and international travellers. “The period also taught us a lot about safety measures to be followed in the future while running the facility,” he adds. All major tour operators in the city say that their bookings have increased to satisfactory levels. According to them, Wayanad is now on the priority list of most domestic travellers. “The majority of resorts in northern Kerala have bookings till December-end. It is a good sign that the industry is regaining its charm ,” says Vipin Nambiar, owner of a tourism start-up in Kozhikode.

19 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Work at police stations in district back to normal||After months of battling the COVID-19 crisis, police stations in Kozhikode city and rural limits now have adequate strength to manage daily law and order responsibilities. The situation has returned to normalcy after several months of strenuous shifts, work re-arrangement and unexpected additional duties in neighbouring stations for the police officers. The number of police officers in quarantine is also less now with improved vigil in the sector. It also helped in the peaceful conduct of the local body elections. The majority of rural and city stations now function with the support of their own personnel, without having to depend on officers from other stations. There are no restrictions at present for visiting police stations and filing petitions. A station house officer from the city said the biggest challenge during the initial days of COVID-19 outbreak was the stringent enforcement of regulations and curbing violations of the physical distancing protocol. A civil police officer from Vadakara said there were many occasions when police officers sacrificed leaves and important family functions to be on duty in the absence of their colleagues who had contracted the virus. It was a challenging time as many of them had to do field-level duties, including crowd control and safe management of protesters, amid staff shortage, he added. According to Kerala Police Association functionaries, the exemption from field-level duties for senior officers above 50 years of age also helped in managing the situation. Higher officials were also considerate in their approach towards subordinates suffering from serious lifestyle diseases, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-at-police-stations-in-district-back-to-normal/article33369466.ece

The Chief Minister, in his inaugural address, said that mathematics is an important part of human life. He also stressed the requirement of establishments such as KSoM in nurturing the young talents in the State to do advanced mathematical research. A press release of the KSoM, an institution under the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, said that the integrated MSc-PhD programme is a seven-year programme leading to PhD in Mathematics. As part of the regular research activity at KSoM, currently there is a doctoral programme in Mathematics. A press release by the KSM said that there has been an increasing demand that the KSoM play a bigger role in the academic development of budding mathematicians from a stage earlier than doctoral studies. The integrated MSc-PhD programme has been conceived after months of planning and discussions involving established researchers from leading research institutes in the country which have programmes of similar nature, the release said. A five-day international conference on “Recent advances in Mathematics and related areas” being organised by KSoM began on Friday in commemoration of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Leading mathematicians from across the globe, including winners of Fields medal (equivalent of the Nobel Prize), Fundamental Prize, Fellows of the Royal Society of London, and Bhatnagar Award are on the list of speakers. The organisers said that the conference was being organised with the intention of introducing the active areas of research in mathematics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/msc-phd-programme-in-maths-inaugurated/article33369463.ece

19 December 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||CPI(M) to look into candidate drawing blank at Chundappuram||The CPI(M) Kozhikode district committee will look into the defeat of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) nominee Abdul Rasheed, who drew a blank without getting any votes from the Chundappuram ward of Koduvally municipality where he contested in the recently concluded local body polls. Here, controversial businessman Karat Faisal, who stood as an Independent candidate, won the seat. He decided to enter the fray after he was denied a seat following the intervention of the CPI(M). In 2015 polls, Mr. Faisal had won from the Parambathu ward of Koduvally municipality, also as an Independent candidate with the backing of the LDF. However, this time, the CPI(M) leadership took a decision not to support him after the Customs Commissionerate (Preventive) in Kochi questioned him in October in connection with the gold smuggling through diplomatic channel.  Panel review CPI(M) district secretary P. Mohanan also rubbished reports that were aired on the TV channels and published on portals that the Chundappuram branch had been dissolved after the embarrassing defeat of the LDF candidate. “The district committee has already reviewed the performance of the party in the polls. We will examine the defeat of the INL nominee as a separate issue,” he told The Hindu on Friday. Mr. Faisal won the seat by a margin of 73 against nearest rival K.K.A. Khader of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). He received 568 votes while K. Faisal, another independent, got seven and BJP nominee Sadasivan, 50 votes. The CPI(M) district had decided not to support Mr. Faisal as he had been running into controversies. Significantly, P.T.A. Rahim and Karat Razak, both LDF-backed Independent legislators, had announced the candidature of Mr. Faisal from Koduvally. Mr. Faisal had left the IUML along with Mr. Rahim in 2008. In 2017, the former CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, had sparked a controversy when he used a luxury car owned by Mr. Faisal during the Jana Jagratha Yatra at Koduvally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-to-look-into-candidate-drawing-blank-at-chundappuram/article33369464.ece

19 December 2020||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Protests rage over BJP’s Jai Sriram banner||Protests raged against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) here on Friday condemning the hanging of a Jai Sriram banner from the municipal building as part of the BJP’s victory celebrations. The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) kick-started the protest and it was soon taken up by the Youth Congress. Tension gripped the municipal office premises as the protesters tried to break the police cordon. In a tit-for-tat gesture, the DYFI unfurled a tricolour from atop the municipal building having the same shape and size of the BJP’s controversial Jai Sriram banner, and shouted “down with communalism, long live secularism.” The attempts of the police to stop the DYFI protesters failed as they sneaked into the municipal building and staged a sit-in there. “This is not an RSS office; this is a municipal office. This is not Gujarat; this is Kerala,” they said. DYFI district secretary T.M. Sasi said that they would oppose any move to destroy the country’s democracy and secular values. He said the Hindu radicals were raising communal symbols widely in North Indian States where the BJP was in power. “But this is Kerala, and its people will not tolerate the Sangh Parivar actions meant to destroy its communal peace and secular fabric,” he said. Youth Congress district president T.H. Firos Babu said the BJP was trying to destroy the people’s peaceful co-existence in Palakkad. “The BJP has insulted not only the Constitution, but also the people of Palakkad,” he said. The protesters read out the Constitution, re-affirming their commitment to uphold its secular values. Several Youth Congress protesters were injured in a police lathicharge. Meanwhile, the police filed multiple cases in connection with the banner issue. A case was registered against the DYFI activists for unfurling the tricolour in an improper manner following a complaint by the BJP. A case was filed against dozen-odd BJP workers for hanging the banner from the municipal building, following a complaint by the municipal secretary. The CPI(M) too had filed a complaint against the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protests-rage-over-bjps-jai-sriram-banner/article33369473.ece
19 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSRTC resumes normal operations||The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) on Friday resumed full-fledged operations that had remained suspended since March 25 following the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The operations, ensuring the COVID-19 protocol, have made the depots and bus stations of the KSRTC lively again. In the KSRTC central bus station here, the usual crowd of commuters was still missing during peak hours. Patronage for the services was less as educational institutions remain closed and offices and commercial establishments are yet to function in a full-fledged way. 2,877 schedules The KSRTC was able to operate 2,877 schedules on Friday, 100 more than the schedules operated on Thursday. The sudden decision to advance the full-fledged operations from the earlier decided January 1, 2021 is in the wake of the government directive to the KSRTC management after Railways commenced most of the inter-city trains in the State as fully reserved specials. The KSRTC’s fast passenger services continue to be restricted to two districts and super fast services, to four districts. The restrictions that are already in place will be a hurdle for long-distance travellers as they will have to board two buses if they want to commute between six districts. The KSRTC was operating 5,218 schedules before the lockdown and the plan is to operate 4,791 schedules daily in a phased manner, a top official of the operations wing said.  Holiday season As the Christmas and New Year holidays approach, the KSRTC expects an increase in the number of commuters and revenue from the fleet. The KSRTC has already commenced inter-State services to Mysuru, Bengaluru, Mangaluru, and Mookambika in Karnataka using multi-axle buses in the fleet. But, the request to the Tamil Nadu government to commence inter-State services had not received any response. “After writing two letters, they have informed us that they have no plans to operate inter-State services at present and that they will let us know. However, we have decided to operate daily a super deluxe service from Chennai to Thiruvananthapuram via Tiruchirappalli and Nagercoil from December 21 to January 3, 2021 to clear rush,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-resumes-normal-operations/article33369560.ece
19 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Case graph continues to remain plateaued||Kerala’sCOVID-19 case graph hit the first peak in the last week of October when the State had 97,000-odd patients in its active case pool. One-and-a-half months later, the graph continues to be on an extended plateau, reporting 5,000-6,000 cases daily. The State now has the second highest active case pool in the country with 58,884 cases and accounts for nearly 20% of the nation’s active caseload. The graph has seemingly dipped in southern States, while in Kerala, it continues at a slow and steady level (test positivity between 8% and 10%), widely distributed across the State. Nothing unusual However, public health experts and epidemiologists see nothing unusual. “The disease epidemiology is no different in Kerala. The crucial difference is that because of the strong containment measures, Kerala’speak was much delayed. The graph is now on a plateau, but we predicted a surge post local body polls,” says Rajeev Sadanandan, former Additional Chief Secretary, Health, and Chief Minister’s adviser on COVID-19. “Based on what we know of the nature of the epidemic, it does not seem likely that the epidemic curve has actually declined in the rest of the country as is being projected. Better case detection is the only factor distinguishing Keralafrom the rest of India,” he adds. Case detection up If Kerala is reporting more COVID cases now, it is because of improved case detection due to focussed testing, officials say. “Rather than mass testing, we opted for efficient testing, focussing on the population at high risk of infection,” says T.S. Anish, Associate Professor, Community Medicine, Government Medical College here. The State has also been criticised for its reliance on rapid antigen tests over RT-PCR tests. “During the epidemic, we found that rapid antigen testing as a public health strategy had overall more efficiency than PCR because it was less time consuming and more accessible to people,’’ Dr. Anishadds. The sudden apparent increase in mortality, as seen in daily reports, now that the case graph has plateaued, has been another curious phenomenon “Now that the State’s “undercounting” of deaths has become a serious public debate, there seems to be some easing up as far as COVID death reporting is concerned,” a senior official says. However, it is reasoned that while most people recover from COVID within 10 days, those who succumb to COVID do so after a prolonged hospital stay of at least 25 days. Thus, it is natural for deaths to go up three-four weeks past the point when cases peaked. The situation in Keralaaround the epidemic is still evolving, for the State is just beginning to open up its public transport and schools. Post poll spike “We have to watch out for next week’s hospital admissions because we expected the case graph to spike after the elections.

19 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Rare aquatic plant discovered||It would be quite easy to overlook this seemingly uninteresting plant if you are not a botanist. But the plant in question, a rare aquatic species of the genus Ludwigia, newly reported from the north Kerala belt of the Western Ghats, shows why conservation is important. The team of researchers who spotted the species and christened it Ludwigia venugopalanii has recommended that it be classified as critically endangered, given its extremely low population. What makes the finding, reported in Phytotaxa, a science journal, botanically striking is that majority of the 82 species in the genus Ludwigia are concentrated in South America. Nearly all of them are found in Brazil. India has seven of the species and the newly spotted Ludwigia venugopalanii is reportedly endemic to India. Besides, a species of this genus is being newly reported from the country after a long time, according to the researchers. It has been spotted only in two locations — at Valayamchal in Kannur district and in the neighbouring Kasaragod district. “The habitat has been greatly reduced due to intense anthropogenic pressure for urbanisation and also by invasion of weeds,” the study in Phytotaxa noted. The team consisted of S. Arya, and V.S. Anil Kumar, Botany Department, University College, Thiruvananthapuram; V. Suresh, Botany Department, Government Victoria College, Palakkad; Vishnu Walsan K. of Regional Cancer Centre, and P. Biju, Botany Department, Government College, Kasaragod. Ludwigia venugopalanii has been named after Venugopalan Nair Balakrishna Pillai, an instrumental musician and father of Mr. Anil Kumar, an author of the study. Running waterbodies The species was found occurring in a submerged form in running waterbodies. The seeds are oblong in shape and flowering and fruiting happen from April to August. “Its population is limited, calling for its classification as critically endangered. Without proper conservation measures, it could go extinct,” Mr. Anil Kumar said.  The aquatic plant was spotted only in two locations in Kannur and Kasaragod, pointing to the need of conservation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rare-aquatic-plant-discovered/article33370071.ece
19 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Stance against communalism helped: CPI(M)||The public’s approval of the State government’s developmental measures and strong stand against communalism helped the Left Democratic Front secure a thumping victory in the district despite an unholy alliance of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] district secretary Anavoor Nagappan. Addressing a press conference on Friday, he said the people had rejected the lies spread by the Opposition parties and a section of the media. “The BJP made a public declaration that it will capture power in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. Union Minister V. Muraleedharan and BJP State president K. Surendran camped here and co-ordinated an expensive campaign. They had secret understandings with the UDF in many wards. Yet, the BJP could not move forward even an inch in this election. The LDF won despite the organised attacks against the government by the Centre, the investigative agencies, the State BJP, the UDF and some major media houses. No government has had to face so many false allegations. The LDF increased its tally in most local bodies despite this,” said Mr. Nagappan. ‘Pact in 25 wards’ He said the BJP and the UDF had a secret pact in at least 25 wards in the city Corporation. Citing the case of the Nedumcaud ward, where the LDF’s S. Pushpalatha lost to the BJP’s Ajithkumar, he said the UDF which had polled 1,069 votes here in 2015 secured only 74 votes this time. In many booths, it got fewer than 10 votes. In the PTP Nagar ward, former Deputy Mayor G. Happy Kumar lost by a narrow margin to the BJP’s Girikumar because the UDF’s votes fell from 1,192 in 2015 to 500 this year. He said similar was the case in many wards, including Thirumala and Punnakkamugal. To look into losses On the defeats in wards like Kunnukuzhy, where the Mayor hopeful A.G. Oleena was defeated, CPI (M) leader V. Sivankutty said the party would look into the reasons for the loss. The third place secured by the LDF councillor in Sasthamangalam is another case which will be enquired internally. Defeat in Kalady ward On the drastic fall in the LDF votes in the Kalady ward, he said the CPI(M) had initially declared another candidate, who even campaigned in the ward. However, it was decided to hand over the seat to Kerala Congress (Mani) group, which might have caused some disillusionment among the local cadre. On the defeat suffered by outgoing Mayor K. Sreekumar at Karikkakom, Mr. Nagappan said he was fielded in that ward with the intention of recapturing the ward from BJP. However, the plan did not succeed, partly due to the Congress’s alliance with the BJP. Mayoral candidate Both leaders remained tight-lipped on questions regarding the LDF’s choice for the Mayor post. Mr. Nagappan said the LDF had in its ranks several councillors capable of handling the post and a suitable candidate would be announced at the right time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stance-against-communalism-helped-cpim/article33370074.ece
19 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Plus Two exams in the morning||The SSLC examinations will be held in the afternoon and the Plus Two examinations in the morning hours. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) monitoring committee that was attended by General Education Secretary A. Shajahan, Director of General Education Jeevan Babu K., and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) Director J. Prasad here on Friday. The government had recently decided to hold the SSLC and Plus Two examinations from March 17 to 30 by adhering to the COVID-19 safety norms. More options likely The meeting on Friday entrusted the SCERT with ensuring that the examinations are not tough and the question papers are set in a student-friendly manner. It had earlier been decided that the syllabus would not be reduced. The entire syllabus would be taught to students so that they do not face difficulties in next academic year. However, for the examinations, questions from some portions could be avoided or students could be given more options to reduce exam pressure. Increasing the cool-off time ahead of examinations from the present 15 minutes also came in for consideration at the meeting. Parents’ opinion Guidelines would be issued on the health protocols to be followed by students when they come to school. Parents’ opinion would be sought before students of Classes 10 and 12 returned to schools. Their consent was a must for students. Though the State government had taken no decision on teachers other than those of Classes 10 and 12 coming to schools, they could do so voluntarily to take up academic activities for students, the meeting decided. Schools functioning as COVID first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) would be vacated by December 31 and disinfected. Guidelines for 50% attendance by teachers could be issued by schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plus-two-exams-in-the-morning/article33369562.ece

Shylaja has said. Congregation of people on account of elections elsewhere in the world during the pandemic has led to an increase in COVID-19 cases. Hence the public should be more vigilant about maintaining all protocols, including hand hygiene, physical distancing, and wearing of masks, she said in a statement on Friday.  People who have been in touch with those involved in poll-related activities should be on guard against respiratory symptoms that they may develop in the next week. Medical advice should be sought for even the mildest of fevers, cough or other symptoms of upper respiratory infection. They should also go on self-quarantine immediately to ensure that they do not pass on the infection to others. The public can seek medical consultation through e-Sanjeevani telemedicine services or raise queries relating to their symptoms with the helpline DISHA - 1056. They may also undergo testing if required, based on the advice of health workers. Other diseases too The public can depend on e-Sanjeevani for non-COVID as well as other speciality medical care. Specialist doctors from the Health Services are handling outpatient clinics in various departments, including psychiatry, gynaecology, paediatrics and cardiology. Outpatient services of the Malabar Cancer Centre, Regional Cancer Centre, Kochi Cancer Centre, IMHANS Kozhikode, and Indian Institute of Diabetes are also accessible through e-Sanjeevani. Most teleconsultations take close to seven minutes, while the waiting time has been brought down to 4.33 minutes. How to go about it The public can visit esanjeevaniopd.in or download the e-Sanjeevani app from Playstore on their cellphones. They can register using their active mobile number and enter the patient queue after logging in using the OTP number generated. One can interact with doctors over the video and after consultation, download the medicine prescription.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-strengthens-telemedicine-service/article33369476.ece

19 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Films on mental health centre||The Government Mental Health Centre (MHC) at Peroorkada is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. Despite its central role in preserving the mental health of the community, the hospital has been much neglected, much like those who flock here. The 83 buildings on the 36-acre campus are old, some barely holding together, while others have tarpaulin or asbestos sheets for roofs. The buildings are small and located far apart, posing a problem for staff and patients alike. The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, upholds the rights of the mentally ill such as access to mental health care and treatment, right to live with dignity and without discrimination, and to get details of treatment. However, the infrastructure in the centre has not kept pace with the changes in legislation. Some patients are put in cells similar to those in prisons, with the iron bars restricting freedom. The hospital caters to 60,000 outpatients, besides 5,000 inpatients each year. Modern amenities with quality treatment are needed here so that patients can return to their families and become part of the mainstream. Though much has changed — skills training is providing to aid patient rehabilitation and launch of a de-addiction centre a few years ago — more needs to be done. A master plan that has been developed hopes to address many of these issues. Humans, a non-governmental organisation, in association with the Kerala Legal Services Authority, has brought out a short film Chernnattam and a docu film Akam Puram (both directed by Jayasreekumar) to underscore society’s responsibility to the mentally ill and raise funds for the development of the Mental Health Centre from the public. Actors to release films Actors Dulquer Salman, Tovino Thomas, and Kani Kusruti and filmmaker Anjali Menon will release both the short film and the docu film through their official Facebook pages at 5 p.m. on Saturday.

Moideen has said. They stood with the development works of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and gave a fitting reply to those who spread canards. He was addressing the media persons here on Friday. The LIFE Mission controversy was started by Anil Akkara, MLA. The work was stopped as the court intervened in the issue. The government had decided to move forward with the project, the Minister said. The Minister alleged that Mr. Akkara concentrated more on controversies than development works in his constituency. His allegations were baseless. The United Democratic Front (UDF) failed even in Mr. Akkara’s panchayat and many places in his constituency, he said. No controversy, including those connected with the LIFE Mission project, would last long. The LDF had not supported anybody who was involved in the controversy, the Minister said. Double standards He asked the media to make an introspection about their stand. “Those who had stopped the LIFE Mission flat project are now asking to restart it. This is pure double standards.” People in Wadakkanchery should decide whether Mr. Akkara should continue as their MLA. Elected representatives should keep their dignity. Congress workers standing for secularism should support the LDF, he said. Clear majority The LDF won a clear majority in the Wadakkanchery municipality against the UDF amidst the LIFE Mission controversy. The UDF alleged that the LDF leaders had received kickbacks in the LIFE Mission Project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wadakkanchery-voters-chose-well-minister/article33370026.ece

It has received the Award of Distinction. UNESCO has introduced the special award to acknowledge the role and contribution of cultural heritage to sustainable development.  ‘Sensitively conserved’ The restoration work on the Koothambalam hall valorised the affinity between architectural heritage and associated living, spiritual and artistic tradition, says the UNESCO in its statement. “The project has sensitively conserved one of the few remaining structures in southern Indian designed for ritual performances of the Koodiyattom,” it says. The project team stripped away layers of incompatible enamel paints and obtrusive modern services and master carpenters reinstated the intricate woodwork and warm natural timber finishes of the original building. The new insertions enhance the quality of the performance space and are designed in a reversible manner, in keeping with international conservation norms. Votive offering “With all works governed by ancient architectural philosophy, vernacular building practices and Hindu rituals, the conservation project itself can be seen as a votive offering, which celebrates the renewal of the historic building as part of the safeguarding of a spectacular but vulnerable intangible heritage,” the UNESCO notes. The UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award for cultural heritage conservation, since 2000, has been recognising the efforts of private individuals and organisations that have successfully restored, conserved and transformed structures and buildings of heritage value. TVS Motor Company has sponsored the renovation programme of the Koothambalam. Renovation team Kanippayyur Krishnan Namboodirippad, architect M.M. Vinod Kumar and Elavally Sivadasan Achari led the works with the support of the public works wing of the Guruvayur Devaswom and Devaswom chairman K.B. Mohandas and former administrator S.V. Shishir. This is the second time UNESCO is recognising the heritage conservation works of temples in Thrissur district.

19 December 2020||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP demands probe in Gandikota compensation scam||The fact-finding team deployed by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Friday reached P. Ananthapuram village in Kondapuram mandal, the hotspot of activity in the area marked for submergence due to the expansion of Gandikota reservoir. The visit assumed importance in the wake of the murder of a whistle-blower, Gurunatha Reddy, a former CRPF constable who had filed a complaint with the District Collector about large-scale malpractices to get ineligible persons included in the list of beneficiaries and skewing figures to increase the quantum of compensation. The attack happened last month very much in the presence of officials who had visited the village for holding a ‘Grama Sabha’. When former Ministers Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, N. Amarnatha Reddy, MLCs ‘B.Tech’ Ravi and K.E. Prabhakar reached the village, the residents raised a hue and cry over the attack on Gurunatha Reddy for seeking justice. They also charged that the police had named unrelated persons as accused in the case in an apparent bid to safeguard a ruling party leader. Villagers complained that ‘fake’ residents had received compensation promptly, but genuine ones were made to run from pillar to post. Reportedly finding large-scale irregularities in the Gandikota compensation scam, Mr. Chandramohan Reddy demanded Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to order a probe into the issue with a sitting judge. TTD former Chairman Putta Sudhakar Yadav, TDP vice-president Putha Narasimha Reddy, Kadapa parliamentary in-charge M. Linga Reddy accompanied the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-demands-probe-in-gandikota-compensation-scam/article33370002.ece
19 December 2020||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Dalit residents cry foul in division bifurcation||With a slight tweak in the voters’ list to shift half of the Dalit residents into the neighbouring division, the marginalised community became shrunken in population and their collective bargaining power diluted. Though a majority in this locality, the community lost reservation status and as such, representation in both the wards. Mariapuram, Bhavani Nagar, Marathi Street, and Arundhati Nagar fall under the 40th division of Kadapa municipal corporation. Of the 5,100 votes, around 2,200 votes have allegedly been shifted ‘clandestinely’ to the adjoining 41st division by an upper caste leader belonging to the ruling party, who reportedly nurtures aspiration to jump into the fray in elections. According to the victims to whom The Hindu spoke, it all started in March this year, when electoral rolls were being readied ahead of the local body polls. “Our ward has traditionally been reserved to Scheduled Castes, but an upper caste leader wants to contest this time and has rendered this injustice. In the name of bifurcation, the Dalit votes have been shared between the two divisions, making our voice feeble in both places,” charges a resident, J. Jayaraj, who is an advocate by profession. Many Dalit residents of the 40th division are up in arms against the injustice, which they feel makes their votes ‘ineffective’. ‘Not properly done’ The process of bifurcating the division also raised eyebrows. While half of the residents have been moved to the adjoining 41st division, Ramarajupalle and Chavatapalle, nearly 2 km away, have been added to this 40th ward. “Also, there seems to be no clear-cut procedure followed in bifurcating the division. Some door numbers in the same street are randomly strewn across, which raises suspicion,” points out G.S.T. Lakshman Rao, secretary of BJP Kadapa city unit, who has taken cudgels in support of the victims. The residents, led by former MPTC V. Joseph, have submitted representations to the Collector and Joint Collector with a plea to undo the ‘injustice’. Also, the 2,000 and odd residents have filed individual applications to the Revenue Divisional Officer for restoration of their voting rights in their traditional division.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dalit-residents-cry-foul-in-division-bifurcation/article33369992.ece

The largest fresh water lake, which is brimming following the recent heavy rains, has become a new attraction for picnickers. “The lake dried up a few years ago and water was seen only in a few low-lying pockets till recently.

They were carrying wooden and iron mesh cages on boats into the lake. “Fishing is our livelihood. We catch fish by using fishing rods and hooks and by arranging nets and cages in the water. Women in the families sell the fish in the nearby towns,” explains a fisherman Ramu. Many visitors are also headed for Kolleti Kota village for a darshan of Kolleru Peddintlamma. “Peddintlamma is a powerful deity worshipped by many people from the surrounding villages.

19 December 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Boy gets his hand reattached after delicate surgery||Having almost lost his hand after suffering a deep cut in the palm caused by glass panes, a 17-year-old boy now nurtures hope of moving his hand again, thanks to a complicated microsurgery. Hailing from Bhakarapet in Chinnagottigallu mandal of Chittoor district, the diploma student, Jaya Krishna, recently tried to retrieve a ball from a broken window, when his palm was torn apart. The cut was deep enough to damage his arteries, nerves and tendons, due to which he lost sensation as well as the ability to move his fingers. “The surgery required precision as it involved fusing fine objects like arteries and nerves. We performed the complicated surgery under an operating microscope,” said D. Vasudeva Reddy, Hand and Micro Surgeon at the Orthopaedics Department of Amara Hospital in Tirupati. The team, led by Dr. Reddy, slogged it out for several hours to ensure blood flow into the arteries. Amara Hospital’s chief administrative officer D. Venugopal claimed that theirs was the only facility to offer the newly-emerging hand and microsurgery speciality in the entire Rayalaseema region. After recovery, the boy was discharged on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/boy-gets-his-hand-reattached-after-delicate-surgery/article33370022.ece

19 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Jana Bheri’ rattled YSRCP, claims Amaravati JAC||Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi JAC conveners A. Siva Reddy and G. Tirupati Reddy on Friday said the overwhelming response to the “'Jana Bheri” had rattled the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government. At a press conference at the Samithi office, they said the active participation of farmers of the 29 villages in the Amaravati region, representatives of all political parties, except the YSR Congress Party, and student, youth, women and trade and other organisations had demonstrated a clear show of strength in support of Amaravati as the permanent capital of the State. The JAC leaders said they would take the slogan of “One State One Capital” to the grassroot levels, explaining to the people the importance of retaining Amaravati as the capital and the harm that could befall on the State if Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s three-capital formula was implemented. They said the government had unleashed a misleading campaign. The schemes it had launched were replete with irregularities. They were not against distribution of land to the poor and the weaker sections, but they were opposed to misleading statements being issued by Ministers Kodali Nani and Perni Venkataramaiah. Police criticised Mr. Tirupati Reddy criticised the police behaviour at the “Jana Bheri” despite the fact that the public meeting was being organised with prior permission. He dared the ruling party MLAs to announce publicly that they did not want Amaravati as the capital, and said the fact that people were confined to indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic had come as a boon to the YSRCP leaders lest they would have rebelled against the government decision. He said the JAC would further intensify the agitation. United Farmers' Action Committee convener Puvvada Sudhakar pointed to the fact that the farmers’ agitation had the support of all political parties. He said remarks made against farmers by Minister Kodali Nani and Perni Venkataramaiah were “unfortunate.” JAC leaders Rayapati Sailaja, Rambabu, Guntur JAC leader Mallikarjun Rao were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jana-bheri-rattled-ysrcp-claims-amaravati-jac/article33370013.ece
19 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. promoting energy efficiency in mission mode, says Minister||Minister for Energy Balineni Srinivasa Reddy on Friday said the government was committed to taking energy efficiency movement to every doorstep in the State. Speaking after presenting energy conservation awards to government and private organisations at the valedictory function of the Energy Conservation Week, the Minister said the government was promoting energy efficiency in a mission mode with an objective to benefit every family in the State in the form of reducing electricity bills and other costs and promote industrial and economic development. The Simhadri Super Thermal Power Station (NTPC Simhadri, Visakhapatnam), Tirupati Municipal Corporation and Sree Jaya Jyothi Cements Pvt Ltd) won awards under gold category; Machilipatnam Municipal Corporation, Sri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station, Nellore, and Dalmia Cements, Kadapa, have been selected for awards under silver category; and the APEPDCL building in Visakhapatnam has been nominated for certificate of merit in the “'Building” sector. Talking about the objective of achieving cost-effective power, he said cost-effective energy efficiency was a strong base for achieving cheap power and it would boost economic activity. Expressing happiness over the fact that industries and thermal power plants, along with urban local bodies, were selected for energy conservation awards, the Minister appealed to the industry sector to come forward voluntarily and work with the government to enhance energy efficiency in the industries. The Minister lauded the APSECM and the Energy Department for introducing the awards under the energy efficiency category. “This will inspire both public and private organisations and also the number of participants will increase by next year,” he said. Secretary for Energy Srikant Nagulapalli said the State was one of the best performers in improving energy efficiency in industries under PAT compliance by saving 2,386 MU of electricity worth around more than Rs. 1,600 crore. As part of promoting cleaner technologies among different MSME sectors in the State, an innovative low cost energy efficiency demonstration project through IoT technology was being implemented with the support of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, he said, informing that energy efficiency activities were being implemented in various departments, including rural water supply (RWS), education, judiciary, panchayat raj, municipal administration, energy, agriculture and other departments. The State has set a target of achieving more than 15,000 MU of energy savings by implementing energy efficiency measures. “Setting up of Energy Conservation Cells in all government departments is a milestone which will be extended to the mandal level to penetrate energy efficiency to the gross root levels,” he said. The APSECM officials explained that the National Productivity Council (NPC), an autonomous organisation under Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, did the evaluation process for selecting winners of the awards under four categories — thermal power production, cement industry, building sector and urban local bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-promoting-energy-efficiency-in-mission-mode-says-minister/article33369299.ece
19 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Police notices a violation of fundamental rights’||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday termed the notices issued by the police barring the party leaders from taking part in the Amaravati agitation on Thursday as a violation of the fundamental rights. In a letter addressed to the Director General of Police, Mr. Naidu said the police should protect the right of the citizens and the Opposition leaders to express their dissent. The police notices were in violation of Article 19(1)(A), 19(1)(B) and 19 (1)(D) of the Constitution, which provided freedom of speech and peaceful assembly of people, Mr. Naidu said. “Even under the British rule, peaceful protests were permitted. Our freedom fighters used those rights to achieve Independence. Instead of using all energy to suppress the democratic protests of the people, the DGP should focus on maintenance of law and order in the State. Unlawful notices have been issued to over 600 TDP leaders and activists,” Mr. Naidu said in his letter. Ever since the YSRCP came to power in the State, fundamental rights were being denied, he alleged. Hallmarks of democracy “Law and order has deteriorated over the months. A few police personnel are solely focusing on suppression of rights rather than prevention of crimes and atrocities. They are forgetting the fact that protest and dissent are the hallmarks of a vibrant democracy,” the TDP president observed. Mr. Naidu further said that the government that had come to power through a democratic process of election was now attacking those democratic foundations. “Some police officials are colluding with the YSRCP leaders to stifle the voices of people,” he alleged. “It is the duty of the police to safeguard the rights in letter and spirit,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-notices-a-violation-of-fundamental-rights/article33370011.ece

Principal Secretary to Government (School Education Department) B. Rajsekhar has written a letter to Director General of Police D. Gautam Sawang seeking action against the principals of the institutions who are illegally keeping the original certificates of the students in their possession. Fee concession The BIE letter comes in the wake of a few students and parents alleging that the managements of a few junior colleges are not returning the original SSC, Intermediate and transfer certificates despite several pleas and demanding additional tuition fee. The government has directed that 30% concession in fee be given to the students in the wake of COVID-19 and has issued orders in this regard. The government has even directed the management of educational institutions not to mount pressure on the students and their parents for full payment of fee as many people have lost their livelihood during the lockdown period. However, it is alleged that a few college managements are insisting on payment of full tuition fee, fee for online classes, and some additional money, besides withholding the certificates. With the original certificates in the custody of the managements, students are unable to join degree courses, it is said. Taking the issue seriously, Mr. Rajsekhar has written a letter to the DGP, urging him to instruct his officers to initiate criminal action against the heads of colleges who are keeping the original certificates in their possession illegally. According to BIE Secretary V. Ramakrishna, about 3,000 colleges, which included 172 aided junior colleges, 120 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) and model colleges, are there in the State. The remaining are private junior colleges. “About 10.6 lakh Intermediate students, who included 5.3 lakh second year students, are studying in the junior colleges. The BIE has sent copies of the complaints filed by the students to the DGP,” says Mr. Ramakrishna.

19 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM:,ANDHRA PRADESH||Wagon repair workshop to become operational soon||The wagon repair workshop (WRS) at Vadlapudi, located in the limits of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), is set to become operational soon with tender being floated to award the contract for its operationalisation. The work on the WRS, taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 213.97 crore allocated in the 2015-16 Railway Budget, was completed in December last. The WRS, set up in an extent of 203 acres of land, is equipped to repair 200 wagons a month. It has a three-line interchange yard, a station building, and has about 20 km total length of railway track within the WRS. An administration building and staff quarters have been constructed on a 57-acre site adjacent to the WRS complex. The WRS will prevent the idle movement of empty rakes from Visakhapatnam, which is a wagon generation point, in view of the large number of industries and two ports. These wagons carry goods from ports to the hinterland and bring raw material from different places to the industries in the city and district. A large number of wagons had to be moved hundreds of km away for repairs and periodic overhaul. This can be avoided once the WRS starts functioning. Two-way movement “A modern Automatic Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), open gantry, turntables, paint booths and drying booths for quick drying, and an imported road-cum-rail shunter, which can move both on roads and on rails to shunt wagons, are some of the salient features of the workshop,” says Joint General Manager of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) G.N. Murthy. The 700-metre-long shed facilitates two-way movement of the wagons. On completion of the repairs to the wagon body or under carriage, the wagons would be taken to the paint booths and later to the drying ovens for quick drying. “A tender will be floated for awarding the contract for operation of WRS to a PSU which has the expertise to take up such work,” Divisional Railway Manager Chetan Kumar Shrivastava told The Hindu , when asked about the delay in commencement of the workshop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wagon-repair-workshop-to-become-operational-soon/article33370112.ece

19 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||State’s move on RAKIA’s arbitration notice comes under a cloud||Various rights groups, Left parties and citizens concerned express doubts over the way the State government is trying to handle the arbitration notice issued by Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA), the promoter of the alumina refinery, Anrak Aluminium Limited, in Visakhapatnam. The State government has constituted a six-member committee of senior officials to work out modalities for opposing the arbitration proceedings. But in the agenda for the meeting, they had discussed options for ‘out-of- court’ settlement, which puts the government on weaker ground, according to former bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma. In a letter to Cabinet Secretary, Government of India, Mr. Sarma pointed out that this has given rise to the impression that the AP government is considering an ‘out-of-court’ settlement with RAKIA in the arbitration matter, unmindful of the suggestion made by the Ministry of Mines that the legality of the arbitration notice be got examined in the first instance. There is a widespread public apprehension in the State that RAKIA, which enjoyed considerable political leverage during the tenure of the earlier Congress regime, may get undue benefit of a backdoor re-entry into an arrangement whereby AP Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) will be persuaded to get the bauxite deposits in Visakhapatnam tribal tracts mined as originally contemplated and supply the raw material to the joint venture ANRAK (between Penna Cements & RAKIA) Alumina Refinery there. According to Mr. Sarma, as per the MoU the mines are located in an extent of 1,162 hectares in Chintapalli mandal in Visakha Agency, which falls under the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. State CPI(M) secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao pointed out that the area earmarked for mining was also protected by the PESA Act, FRA and the 1/70 Act of Andhra Pradesh. The mining was stopped after a sustained agitation by the tribals and any attempt now would revive the agitation, which may prove counter productive for the State government, as this would instantly give impetus to the Maoist movement, and the agitation may turn violent, he said. Vedanta case Citing the Vedanta case in Odisha, V.S. Krishna of HRF said that any attempt to allow APMDC to mine and supply the ore to Anrak, would be legally wrong, as per the Supreme Court’s order. Mr. Sarma also pointed out that at no point of time, the State government had cared to seek prior approval by the gram sabhas in the Chintapalli mandal of Visakhapatnam for undertaking bauxite mining. As such, the very decision that APMDC should extract bauxite and deliver the same to ANRAK has no legal validity. This clearly indicates that there is no legal sanctity to the MoU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/states-move-on-rakias-arbitration-notice-comes-under-a-cloud/article33370025.ece

19 December 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Row over party office continues in Telugu Desam Party||The differences cropped up between between former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju and former MLA of Vizianagaram Meesala Geetha on party office still persist with no clarity on establishment of an exclusive office for the party. Ms. Geetha, who opened her own office and closed it a couple of days ago with the ‘suggestion’ from party high command, is insisting on an office for the party since she feels the bungalow of Mr. Ashok, which is being used as party office, is not convenient to hold meetings. For the last 37 years, the bungalow has been the office for the party. All the Ministers, MPs, and MLAs hold their meetings and press meets at the bungalow. Mostly, the press meets and meetings are being held under the shade of a tree and open space of the bungalow. Recently, TDP constructed the party office in a corporate style in Srikakulam which has exclusive chambers for important leaders and heads of frontal organisations such as Telugu Mahila and Telugu Yuvata. Ms. Geetha insists on such an office for the party in Vizianagaram too. Ms. Geetha, who was denied party ticket in 2019 elections, has stopped coming to Mr. Ashok’s bungalow saying that she was not being informed about the party meetings. She has recently opened her own office but closed within one week following intervention of TDP State president K. Atchennaidu. “The party high command assured me of setting up an exclusive office very soon. The bungalow cannot be an office since it does not have the required infrastructure. I brought the same issue to the notice of Mr.Atchennaidu,” she said while speaking to The Hindu . However, party’s Vizianagaram district president Kimidi Nagarjuna said that he had not yet received any communication from the party with regard to opening of district office in Vizianagaram. No action According to sources, the party high command is unable to convince both Mr. Ashok and Ms. Geetha since the former is the most respected leader in the party and latter belonged to a powerful Kapu community. In spite of pressure from the loyalists of Mr. Ashok, the party had not initiated any direct action against Ms. Geetha as opening of her own office is not a valid reason for disciplinary action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/row-over-party-office-continues-in-telugu-desam-party/article33370051.ece

19 December 2020||Bhongir (YADADRI-BHUVANAGIRI),TELANGANA||Focus on women’s safety in State||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao gives special importance to women’s safety in the State, said Secretary in the CMO Smita Sabharwal on Friday. “In addition to initiatives such as support centres Bharosa and Sakhi, and helplines 100 and 181, we are gathering ground information to formulate a report,” she said, leading the all-women Core Committee meeting on women’s safety at Bhongir. Flanked by top-ranking women bureaucrats from the State and District Collector Anita Ramachandran, Ms. Sabharwal took notes and sought suggestions on women’s issues and grievances from members – women employees and public representatives. She said stricter measures to check sexual harassment at workplace were being considered, and for now, District Collectors should personally look into such matters and redressals must start with immediate suspension and disciplinary proceedings against the perpetrators, she said. Ms. Sabharwal added that mass awareness on ‘emergency 100’ and ‘women helpline 181’ must be taken up. According to Government Whip and Alair legislator G. Sunitha, although the helplines serve the crises, preventive measures such as village committees, which conduct counselling and create an atmosphere for women to vent out, must be considered. Commissioner, Women Development and Child Welfare, D. Divya, Haritha Haram OSD Priyanka Varghese, Commissioner, Scheduled Castes Development, Yogita Rana, and Hyderabad District Collector Swetha Mohanty, said that wider awareness on women helplines, efficient use of resources and team work would resolve tough situations. Sharing a dose of inspiration with the members from her stint as Warangal Collector, Commissioner of Health & Family Welfare Vakati Karuna explained the power of women and how it made the district gudumba-free. Nalgonda Collector Prashant J. Patil opined that change in society would always begin with people, and the role of public representatives and inspiration of social reformers were crucial. He said women should organise for their economic empowerment. DCP (SHE) C. Anasuya, Asst.

19 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||More vehicles on roads, but skeletal attendance at offices||There are more vehicles on the road, more people are walking but not enough people are going to offices in Hyderabad since the outbreak of COVID pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Mobility data from Apple and Google reveals how citizens are spending time since social distancing norms have come into play. Public transport In Hyderabad, use of public transport is still below 14% of what it was before lockdown was imposed in March. But public transport usage has improved from September as both the Metro and Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s services have been restored in the city. In comparison, usage of public transport in Delhi and Mumbai is still just 60% of what it was before the pandemic. Behavioural change The data also shows how driving or private transport has shown an uptick with 36% more drivers on the road in Hyderabad as compared to the first few weeks of 2020. A comparison with other Indian metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai, shows how dramatic the behaviour change has been in Hyderabad. While the other metros are barely recovering, Hyderabad has seen more people driving and walking. Even in workplaces, Hyderabad has recovered faster compared to other metropolitan cities in India. The community mobility data based on anonymised phone usage is being shared publicly by the software companies to help policy planners help prioritise and understand citizen behaviour to fight the pandemic. While more vehicles are on the road in Hyderabad, the retail and recreation sector has still not recovered and is -35% of what it was in the early part of the year. Park usage Parks in the city have been allowed to open up under Lockdown 4 norms late in September, and the Nehru Zoological Park opened in October, but fewer people are venturing into open spaces. According to data, the usage of parks has remained below 52% of what it was earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/more-vehicles-on-roads-but-skeletal-attendance-at-offices/article33369888.ece
19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Technical glitches plague new registration process||Technical glitches continue to haunt the registration process for the fourth day in succession as complaints from the stakeholders over the incompatibility of the software in accepting a major chunk of forms continue to pour in. The government assured conduct of the registration process through the CARD project in line with the instructions of the High Court, but linking the software with Dharani has led to several problems at the ground level. The new system, according to users, is not accepting entry of details of the link documents pertaining to the property as also the details pertaining to the payments made like Cheque/DD numbers. Survey numbers of the properties were not being displayed in the documents in spite of their entry into the software while no option is provided for inclusion of the built-up area, number of floors and the type of construction. One of the biggest concern of the real estate dealers is problems related to properties that were hitherto classified under gram panchayats and were subsequently merged to create new municipalities. The problem is said to be more acute in respect of the group housing projects and apartments where the software is not allowing entry of multiple names of buyers. Insistence on the property tax index number is reportedly proving a major hurdle as there is no scope of the PTIN in case of houses under construction as the index will be generated for only properties which are completed. “Will it mean the builder has to keep the property on hold till the construction is completed?” builders reportedly asked the members of the Cabinet sub-committee during their recent meeting. The real estate dealers are said to have asked the government to take steps to incorporate provisions for making corrections related to cheque numbers, names and other details on the documents while steps should also be initiated to resolve the problems related to properties that were constructed in the villages which were subsequently merged to form new municipalities. There are complaints that the officials concerned are obtaining declaration from sellers as well as buyers against the traditional system of obtaining declaration from the seller that the property had clear title without any loans/mortgages and pending bills and that it was not in the prohibited properties list. Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy who convened a meeting of the stakeholders on Thursday assured them that the government was actively working on the issues raised by them and these technical problems would be resolved very soon. He reiterated that registrations of properties with property tax identification numbers were being allowed and steps were taken to generate PTIN in respect of G+2 and above buildings. Property sellers/buyers, real estate dealers and other stakeholders are hopeful that the high level meeting convened by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday to review the situation and decide about the future course of action would resolve at least some of the bottlenecks faced in the new system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/glitches-plague-new-registration-process/article33369923.ece

19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Flood victims make rounds of GHMC office||Controversy continues to haunt flood relief distribution in the city, with genuine victims of the October floods still making rounds of the GHMC office in the hope of getting the compensation of Rs. 10,000 announced by the government. Even while the government continues to send daily updates about how much relief has been distributed, there is no transparency about the beneficiaries and the basis for their selection. Though it was announced that GHMC officials would conduct door-to-door survey in flood-affected areas to ascertain the genuine beneficiaries so that flood relief amount could be transferred directly to their accounts, no such effort was being taken up so far. “We had applied for the relief through the Mee Seva Centre, standing in the queue for three hours, before the distribution was stopped. However, on the same day that we applied, we got a message saying the relief amount had been deposited into our accounts. We checked our accounts the next day, but found that no deposit was made. Since then, we are making rounds of the GHMC offices,” said S.Swarupa, a resident of Kavadiguda. She, along with four of her neighbours, came to the GHMC head office on Friday, along with all the supporting documents to prove her claim. Besides Aadhaar card, ration card, and the Mee Seva receipt, she also brought a print out of the message she had got on her mobile phone about relief deposit, and also a bank statement to prove that the remittance was not done. ‘Turned away’ “My application was accepted here yesterday, so I brought my neighbours along today so that they too can get the benefit. However, today they have told us to take our applications to the Mee Seva Centre in Banjara Hills Road No. 7. When we went there, we were turned away saying no applications were being accepted,” Ms.Swarupa said. Truth is that the distribution is not being done through GHMC at all. Zonal and circle level officials who are to conduct the field survey, are saying they haven’t got any instructions about the same, and are clueless about how the distribution was being done. As per the latest update sent by the government through GHMC on Wednesday, a total Rs. 65 crore has been deposited into the bank accounts of 65,031 beneficiaries during the preceding one week. The flood relief distribution, which was initially given in cash directly, became controversial as several genuine victims did not get it at all or got only part of the amount, while those who were not affected, got the relief. Later, the distribution shifted to Mee Seva Centres, before it was stopped upon orders by the State Election Commission, which termed it as violation of modal code of conduct during GHMC elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/flood-victims-make-rounds-of-ghmc-office/article33369904.ece
19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||DEET, Equifax join hands for job verification services||The Digital Employment Exchange of Telangana that through an AI-driven platform connects job-seekers and employers on Friday announced a partnership with Equifax for employment verification services. Terming it as a strategic collaboration, an official release said the introduction of new digital services on DEET app will “open gates for swift employment and ID verification for employees in a secure and confidential manner [thus] easing out the tedious process of hiring”. Further, job-seekers registered on DEET can leverage this collaboration in getting verified credit reports from Equifax, which is a multinational consumer credit reporting agency, to check eligibility and apply for loans and mortgages, it said. Minister for Labour and Employment C. Malla Reddy said, “We are very pleased to enable access to Equifax Workforce Solutions, Equifax Credit Score and identity and address verification services through DEET.” An initiative of Telangana government in collaboration with Workruit, DEET is an employment platform that provides ease and quick connect between employers and job-seekers. IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao said the collaboration of DEET and Equifax will enable seamless verification and appointment of right workers, facilitating efficiency and profits of the companies. While it took 8-10 days with the current system to complete employee verification, the partnership would make the process of recruitment and verification instant. IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said the partnership would go a long way in adding value for employers and job-seekers and authenticity to the platform. Country Leader, MD, Equifax India and MEA K.M. Nanaiah said the online digital verification of candidates would reduce paperwork and improve timelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/deet-equifax-join-hands-for-job-verification-services/article33369892.ece
19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Plans for passengers trains on demand by March 2024||Indian Railways is preparing an integrated plan to have passenger trains on demand and freight carrying capacity of 2024 metric tonnes by March 2024 by completing the scheduled infrastructure projects after sufficient funds of Rs. 2.9 lakh crore have been made available for high priority works, said Railway Board chief executive officer and chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav on Friday. “We have put a lot of focus on infrastructure development and business planning in the last two years to have the capacity beyond demand. The final draft of the national rail plan is ready and is being circulated to the industry associations and other departments. It will be in public domain soon indicating the road ahead,” he said in an online media interaction. While the freight movement has reached to 97% of last year’s capacity at 811.49 MTs as against 835.82 MTs at the same time last year, the CEO expects the freight capacity to cross last year’s mark though the loss at this time is around Rs. 9,000 crore. The dent, obviously, is going to be more in the passenger revenue side with Rs. 4,600 crore, which is 87% currently, and by the end of the financial year, the revenue could be about Rs. 15,000 crore. This is way behind Rs. 53,000 crore in revenues earned in passenger traffic last year, he disclosed. IR is currently running 1,089 special train services, including close to 4,000 suburban services, 131 short distance trains and 618 festival specials, which are expected to be run till March-end. Regular running of trains can be considered only when the COVID-19 pandemic situation eases as several trains are being run with 30-40% carrying capacities only. Clone trains are however running at 72-100% capacity and will be continued post COVID too with Artificial Intelligence modules continuously monitoring. As per Vision 2024, which is part of the National Rail Plan, 11,000 km of lines would be doubled and another 11,000 km of high density lines would be tripled or quadrupled with electrification. Infrastructure bottlenecks have been identified in congested sections, appropriate technology like AI is being used to track transit time and transit cost so as to rationalise the freight rates and ensure the average speeds of freight trains move up to 50 kmph from 22 kmph. Freight trains have attained speed of up to 45 kmph during lockdown, the CEO added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/plans-for-passengers-trains-on-demand-by-march-2024/article33370053.ece
19 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Complaints galore against loan companies||A series of complaints were received by police across the State against apps-based instant loan companies, which is being investigated to bring the culprits to the book. The investigators requested the general public not to avail loans from unauthorised apps which may use the sensitive information from mobile phones and as they are not reliable. In case someone is facing similar issues with any online loan apps, they can approach the nearby police station and lodge a complaint against culprits, police said. Police said that there are at least 60 such loan applications available in the Google Play Store and they run by certain names which are not registered or recognised by the Reserve Bank of India as non-bank financial institution. “Their operations are completely unlawful and hosting of these apps also violates certain conditions laid by the Google App store. Google can be asked to take down these apps,” top officials associated with the investigation of the case said. “All such apps have similar privacy policies which gather every bit of data on the phone of the user, and thus violates user’s privacy in every manner,” they said, adding that under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011, all the intermediaries are supposed to provide names of their Grievance Officer along with contact details. The companies calling up friends and relatives is violation of Rule 3 (2) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011 as well, the police said. “Such apps have uncanny commonality in methods. They appear to be built upon one SDK, suspected to be provided by a foreign country.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/complaints-galore-against-loan-companies/article33369913.ece
19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Winds of political change visible in TS, says BJP national general secy||The winds of political change are visible in Telangana and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will not rest till the “single undivided family rule” of “Raja Sahab” is thrown out in the next Assembly elections after which the party will ensure a common man, providing justice to the poor, will be sworn in as the Chief Minister, declared national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Friday. Addressing a press conference at the party office, he said the party will expose the “looting of TS people’s wealth by the father, son, daughter, nephew and other relatives” and bring them to justice. “There is a race to loot Telangana between the family members. I was also shocked to learn that the Maharaja of TS did not step out of his seven star farmhouse even once to inspect a dispensary, hospital or a poor man’s house during the heightened prevalence of COVID-19,” he said. While other Centre and other State governments like Karnataka had announced packages to help the distressed sections, nothing of that sort had happened here. “TS needs a servant of the people, someone who understands the pain and not a Rajababu who does not want to come out of his palace, go to secretariat or the chief minister’s office because he will then be forced to listen to the common man’s woes,” charged Mr. Chugh, recently appointed in charge of TS. The Modi government has been providing foodgrains and money directly into the bank accounts of the public during the lockdown to take care of the poor but here the ‘Rajababu’ does not does not think beyond his family, he claimed, not once taking any names. The BJP leader criticised the government for holding the GHMC elections in haste and questioned the delay in electing a Mayor. “Is it because your secret pact with Majlis Party will be in the open,” he asked.

19 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State govt. seeks 12 NHs||Planning Board Vice-Chairman B. Vinod Kumar has written a letter to Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari seeking sanction of twelve national highways which were left out of the twenty-five national highways proposed for construction in Telangana. The State government had proposed to the Centre to take up the twenty-five national highways as per an assurance to the State Reorganisation Act but only thirteen of them were cleared three years ago but works were still not grounded, Mr. Vinod Kumar said. On the eve of the Minister inaugurating on December 21 some national highways that were approved for Telangana in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, he hoped that Mr. Gadkari would announce on the occasion the balance twelve highways that are pending for want of NITI Aayog clearance. He said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had already offered that the State government will bear 50% of the cost of land acquisition for the thirteen highways which were approved in principle. In fact, the expenditure on land acquisition was higher than cost of civil works for the projects as land rates in State had gone up due to improved irrigation facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-govt-seeks-12-nhs/article33369914.ece

The ambitious Pharma City sprawling over thousands of acres about 25 km from Outer Ring Road in 18 villages and tandas is touted as an integrated industrial area for pharmaceutical firms. “I have sold plates made of lotus leaves to buy the land. It has the blood and sweat of my family. I will not give up the land for anything in the world,” said Panga Anusaya fighting back tears. Speaking at a press conference in the city, other farmers and poultry farm owners from the area expressed similar firm sentiments against giving up their land which they said was very fertile. “Once the project is completed it will turn Hyderabad’s ground water toxic. The pollution in Musi due to Jeedimetla has not been solved. How will they create a facility with zero pollution,” said Mallesh Yadav another farmer demanding the project be scrapped. “The MLA can stop the project but he is not siding with the people who voted for him,” said Mr. Yadav. “The public hearing for environmental clearance for the Pharma City project was a sham,” said Narasimha Reddy, a public policy expert at the press conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryots-not-to-give-up-land-for-pharma-city-project/article33369926.ece

19 December 2020||GURUGRAM,||Centre under pressure from capitalists: Selja||Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja on Friday said over 20 farmers have sacrificed their lives in the farmers’ movement so far due to the “dictatorial attitude” of the Centre and State governments. Farmers have been forced to protest on the borders of the national capital in the cold for the last three weeks for their legitimate demands, but the government is not ready to listen as it is under pressure from the capitalists, she added. Ms. Selja was speaking after a tribute meet at the Congress office in memory of Sant Baba Ram Singh and other farmers who have died during the movement. Instead of accepting their demands, the Central government is suppressing the voice of the farmers, the former Union Minister said, adding that Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were making humiliating comments about the protesters. The government did not hold discussions with any farmers’ organisation before enacting the three laws nor did they talk to the Opposition. This government has no faith in democracy, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-under-pressure-from-capitalists-selja/article33369588.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||Farmers erect stage to honour Bhagat Singh||Far from being consumed by monotony as their agitation enters its fourth week, thousands of farmers occupying several kilometres between the Tikri border in Delhi and Haryana’s Bahadurgarh continue to fortify their ranks in more ways than one. Rejoicing in Punjab and Haryana’s new-found cultural unity (personified by the pervasive influence of revolutionary Bhagat Singh around them) since coming together against the controversial farm laws, a second stage for performance of Haryanviraginis dedicated to the freedom fighter has been set upto keep morale up. The protest site, located on the Capital’s western flank, serves as a nodal office of sorts from where emissaries are being dispatched to villages in adjacent rural belt to urge more farmers to join the growing agitation. It is also the coordination point between numerous village panchayats — engaged in gathering resources such as boilers to provide hot bathing water and blankets — and protesting farmers. “Panchayats are being conducted in nearby villages, especially those located in Bahadurgarh where farmers are relatively well off, to mobilise more people for the agitation. Farmer leaders from here take part in many such meetings every day,” said Sumit, a student leader from Rohtak who is part of a farmers’ union. “Back home, panchayats are held every day to arrange resources for people here. We will be getting boilers for hot bathing water and, of course, blankets and quilts, from hundreds of villages in Haryana soon,” he said. Phool Singh from Jind, who was one of the first to set up camp at Tikri border a day after clashes between security personnel and agitating farmers seeking to march on New Delhi on November 26, said their actual plan wasn’t to blockade the city’s borders at all. “After two months of chalking the way forward among ourselves and with our colleagues in Punjab, the plan was to actually protest peacefully at the Ramlila Grounds in central Delhi. That was actually where we were headed,” he said. “But, when they [security personnel] asked us to stop where we were, that’s what we did. Everyone dug in their heels where they were and we will not move an inch back till the laws are repealed,” he added. As the main stage at the venue rang out with repetitions of the slogan ‘Tino kanoon chaknachur, aes to khat nahin manzoor(All three laws must be destroyed, nothing less is acceptable)’, Maninder Chinna from Punjab’s Sangrur sat at akhaatpanchayat around ahukkabut minus thekhaat(straw bed). ‘The way forward’ “This is the way forward,” he said pointing towards a poster of Bhagat Singh when asked how long the protest was likely to go on. “The only time Punjab and Haryana came together like this was under him when we were all one. Soon, there will be one stage here solely to sing his praises all day long,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/farmers-erect-stage-to-honour-bhagat-singh/article33369590.ece

An order signed by a Joint Commissioner of Police and sent to all DCPs noted that many persons arrested under IPC Section 411 (Dishonestly receiving stolen property) are innocent buyers, who have been duped into buying stolen phones. “Implicating them in a criminal case is not appropriate. Many people lose chance to receive government facilities or even private job owing to this involvement. All the SHOs are directed not to arrest such persons under IPC Section 411, just to increase figure of receivers arrested. Instead, focus should be on nabbing real receivers of stolen property, who actually buy them as a commercial interest. The SHOs should also discharge any person held under IPC section 411 in the recent past.”    “We request people not to but any electronic goods or other articles from random people. Before making any deal, verify the authenticity of the seller and demand bills and other relevant papers related to the article,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/shos-told-not-to-misuse-law-on-stolen-property/article33369596.ece

Now, by the government’s own admission, the intensity of the pandemic no longer requires a lockdown. Then, how does one justify the cancellation of the winter session? What was right then cannot be wrong now,” the Akali chief wrote. Mr. Badal said that it is “absurd and ironical” that the ruling party sees no danger to public health during gatherings of thousands of people in its election rallies in Bihar and now in West Bengal but wants the countrymen to believe that even a limited meeting of MPs embers of Parliament under strict SOPs would result in a pandemic flare-up. “There is no lockdown on BJP rallies but there is lockdown on Parliament comprising just a few hundred members and that too under controlled circumstances. The COVID excuse is patently fake and even ridiculous,” he stated. In his letter, copies of which have been marked to the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Vice President in his capacity as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Akali leader said Parliament must meet immediately as “a national priority” because the ongoing farmers’ movement affects nearly 100 crore people directly. “It would be insensitivity of the most shocking nature if the government just looks the other way while nearly two dozen innocent and patriotic annadatas (food producers) have already sacrificed their lives,” he wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/badal-seeks-presidents-intervention-on-winter-session/article33369604.ece
19 December 2020||Mumbai,||Why Karan Johar was not probed in 2019, Congress asks BJP||Alleging that investigating agencies have become puppets at the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Maharashtra Congress on Friday asked why Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar was not probed in 2019 over a party hosted by him when the BJP-led government was in power and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was also holding the portfolio of Home Department. “The viral video based on which Mr. Johar had been summoned was from 2019 when the Fadnavis government was in power. Why didn’t the State government or the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) act then? The agency which had summoned someone based on an old video did not dare to summon actor Kangana Ranaut who openly admitted consuming drugs,” State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said. The Congress also sought explanation from Mr. Fadnavis why ‘no action’ was taken when he was the Home Minister. Mr. Sawant said that the NCB was called in to probe the alleged ‘drug angle’ in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “It failed completely. The BJP used Central investigating agencies for its selfish political gains. The BJP defamed Maharashtra and Mumbai; it also defamed the film industry and the Mumbai Police,” he added. The NCB had summoned Mr. Johar regarding one of the videos that went viral last year from a party hosted by him. It was alleged that drugs were consumed at the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/why-karan-johar-was-not-probed-in-2019-congress-asks-bjp/article33369534.ece
19 December 2020||Mumbai,||6 years after being convicted for rape, 28-year-old man acquitted||Six years after a 28-year-old man was convicted for sexually assaulting and raping a six-year-old girl, the Bombay High Court recently acquitted him, and said, “It will be unsafe to rely on her sole testimony as the possibility of tutoring cannot be ruled out.” A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing a criminal appeal filed by Ali Mohammed Shaikh, who is lodged at Amravati Central Prison. He was convicted by the special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court in 2014. At 11 p.m. on August 20, 2014, the victim along with her family was sleeping on a platform at Kandivali (West). At 6 a.m. the next day, the mother realised that the girl was not in her bed, and later found her lying down in a nearby lane with marks on her body of being brutally physically and sexually assaulted. According to the victim’s mother, one person by name of Anand was eyeing the child. The police, however, nabbed Mr. Shaikh. After the call detail record and clothes of the accused were taken into custody, Mr. Shaikh was arrested. A medical examination revealed that the minor suffered forceful penetrative sexual assault, and the medical evidence on record disclosed the brutality of the assault. The trial court had relied upon  the testimony given by the victim, and said, “The testimony revealed that the child knew the appellant (Mr. Shaikh) well as he used to meet her father and she further knew him as a friend of her father.” The HC Bench also took into consideration the forensic report of the semen detected on the frock of the victim, which said that it did not match with the male haplotypes of blood samples of the appellant. Acquitting Mr. Shaikh, the HC said, “We find it unsafe to convict the accused only on the basis of the testimony of the victim without there being a further corroboration to her testimony showing the complicity of the accused. It is therefore not possible for us to uphold the conviction of the appellant rendered by the trial court.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/6-years-after-being-convicted-for-rape-28-year-old-man-acquitted/article33369538.ece
19 December 2020||Mumbai,||‘No drug consumed at party’||Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar, in his response to the notice issued by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), has claimed that no drug was consumed during a party at his house last year, an official said on Friday. The anti-drugs agency had issued the notice to Mr. Johar over a viral video allegedly showing drugs being consumed at a party hosted at his residence, the official said. “Mr. Johar was asked to give details of the party. Accordingly, the NCB on Friday received a reply from him to the notice,” he said. “In the reply, Mr. Johar said that no drug was consumed at the party,” the official added. The NCB had received a complaint regarding the video of a party, which was attended by top Bollywood stars last year, he said. The complaint was about movie stars apparently seen in a ‘drugged’ state in the video. Shiromani Akali Dal leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa had sent the video to the NCB and his complaint was marked to the agency’s Mumbai zonal unit, he said. Mr. Sirsa had claimed that he had registered a complaint about this video with the Mumbai Police in August last year, but no probe was conducted. After the video went viral, Mr. Johar had issued a public statement, saying reports of drug consumption at his party were slanderous and malicious.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-drug-consumed-at-party/article33369533.ece
19 December 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Neral couple arrested for killing friend, dumping body||A couple from Neral in Karjat were arrested on Thursday for allegedly murdering and dumping the chopped body of a 33-year-old man from Worli. The accused have been identified as Charles Nadar (41) and his wife Salomi (31). “On Wednesday, we received a call about someone finding a piece of human body near railway tracks in Neral. When our team reached the spot, we found two suitcases of chopped human body,” Anil Gherdikar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Karjat, said. The police later obtained CCTV footage and found a suspect who dumped the suitcases. “We traced the address of Mr. Nadar to Rajbag in Neral and arrested him. On interrogation, he revealed the details,” Mr. Gherdikar said. The deceased was identified as Sushil Kumar Sarnaik, a senior relationship manager at a private bank. He and the Nadar family were friends for 10 years. On some Saturdays, Sarnaik used to visit the couple for partying at their home. On December 12, he had gone again for the party and during the course, he spoke ill about Ms. Salomi’s character which irked Mr. Nadar. He attacked Sarnaik with a sickle on his neck. “After he was dead, the accused couple kept the body in the hall of their house and over the next two days chopped the body into 11 pieces using a stone cutter. They then wrapped the pieces with plastic and paper, and stored in two suitcases. Then they dumped the suitcases near Neral railway tracks behind the car shed on Tuesday,” Mr. Gherdikar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/neral-couple-arrested-for-killing-friend-dumping-body/article33369535.ece
19 December 2020||Pune,||Maharashtra farmers call for ‘Chalo Delhi’ on Dec. 21||Cranking up pressure on the Centre to repeal the contentious farm laws, the Left-affiliated All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) — one of the outfits spearheading the agitation in Maharashtra — on Friday said that thousands of farmers across the State would be travelling to Delhi to join the ongoing farmers’ protest. “Thousands of farmers from over 20 districts of Maharashtra will gather at Nashik on December 21 and start a ‘vehicle march’ to hit Delhi to strengthen the struggle and to show solidarity to lakhs of farmers camping around the national national for the last three weeks,” AIKS’s national president Ashok Dhawale said. He said that the farmers would be traversing a distance of 1,266 km to join their comrades at the Rajasthan-Haryana border at Shahjahanpur around December 24. “The vehicle rally will commence with a public meeting at Nashik on the afternoon of December 21. There will be a demonstration near the Reliance-owned petrol pump in Nashik,” AIKS’s State general secretary Ajit Nawale said, adding that the ‘protest convoy’ would then make its way to Madhya Pradesh. Mr. Nawale said the AIKS had three main demands: scrapping of the three ‘anti-farmer’ and ‘pro-corporate’ farm Acts; withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill; and ensuring that the Centre provides the minimum support price (MSP) at one-and-a-half times the cost of production besides the guarantee of procurement at fixed MSP rates. “Like farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and the surrounding States of Delhi, the farmers from Maharashtra are prepared to dig in their trenches indefinitely till the Centre accedes to our demands,” he said. Mr. Nawale further said that while the agitation had received overwhelming nationwide support till now, it was only farmers from States around Delhi who had been able to physically agitate. “In spite of nationwide protests on December 3 and the Bharat Bandh on December 8, farmers from far-flung States have not yet been able to go directly to Delhi and participate in the agitation in large numbers. The reason being railway transport was shut. Maharashtra’s farmers will be the first ones to overcome the obstacles hurled by the Centre to reach Delhi,” Mr. Nawale said, while hoping that this ‘militant action’ on part of Maharashtra’s farmers would spur farmers from other southern States to join in. Mr. Dhawale said that all like-minded organisations in Maharashtra would be supporting this ‘Chalo Delhi’ campaign. “When the convoy reaches Dhule on December 22 in the afternoon, a support meeting will be held there on behalf of other farm outfits, workers and labour unions across the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-farmers-call-for-chalo-delhi-on-dec-21/article33369537.ece
19 December 2020||Satara,||Three minor sisters die due to suspected food poisoning||Three sisters, aged three to nine years, died due to suspected food poisoning in Karad tehsil of Maharashtra’s Satara district, the police said on Friday. The minor siblings, who had started vomiting after having dinner with parents at home on Sunday, died in a local hospital over the past three days. Their parents, who were also hospitalised, are out of danger now. “On Sunday night, the members of the family that lives in Saidapur village in Karad tehsil, had a meal of eggplant curry and basundi (sweet thickened milk). They had bought basundi from a shop. But after going to sleep, all of them started vomiting,” B.R. Patil, senior inspector of Karad City police station, said. In the morning, they approached a local doctor. But as the three sisters fell ill, they were admitted to the hospital on Tuesday. “While one of the sisters died on Tuesday night, two others died on Wednesday and Thursday,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/three-minor-sisters-die-due-to-suspected-food-poisoning/article33369531.ece
19 December 2020||Katsina,||344 abducted Nigerian boys freed||More than 300 Nigerian schoolboys who were seized in a mass abduction claimed by Boko Haram experienced their first full day of freedom on Friday after a six-day ordeal. Looking worn-out and distraught, and most of them without shoes, the boys were brought to the Governor’s office in Katsina, the capital of Katsina State in northwestern Nigeria, after being released late on Thursday. The assault last Friday on a rural school in Kankara was initially blamed on criminal gangs who have terrorised the region for years. But on Tuesday, Boko Haram, the brutal jihadist group behind the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014, claimed responsibility for the raid. Local officials said late on Thursday that the boys had been released and would spend the night in the protection of security agents. A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had been left in the forest after negotiations between the authorities and the abductors, but gave no further details. State Governor Aminu Bello Masari said “344 are now with the security agencies” and were being taken to Katsina. They would be given medical care before being reunited with their families, he said. “This is a huge relief to the entire country & international community,” President Muhammadu Buhari said on Twitter. It remained unclear, however, if all the abducted schoolboys had been released, amid ongoing uncertainty over the number taken in the first place. In an interview with state channel NTA , the governor added: “I think we have recovered most of the boys, it's not all of them.” In a video released by Boko Haram on Thursday, a distressed teenager said he was among the 520 students kidnapped. The security source said late on Thursday that the exact number would only be known after a head count in Katsina.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/344-abducted-nigerian-boys-freed/article33369214.ece
19 December 2020||Beijing,||Economic recovery is ‘not yet solid’, says China||China said its economy had yet to fully bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic and pledged financial support for recovery efforts, at the end of a key annual policy meeting on Friday. China suffered its first contraction in decades this year in the wake of COVID-19 that prompted drastic lockdowns in Wuhan — the central industrial city where the virus first emerged last year — and sent factory activity into a nosedive. Its economy has since improved after authorities managed to largely contain the infection, and China may be the only major world power to record positive growth this year. But officials at this week’s Central Economic Work Conference, presided over by President Xi Jinping, said the global recovery would be “unstable and uneven”, and signalled a fiscal policy focused on maintaining economic stability. “We must be clearly aware that there are many uncertainties in the evolution of the pandemic and external environment, and the foundation for our country’s economic recovery is not yet solid,” said a statement from the three-day summit published by state broadcaster CCTV . Beijing will boost financial support to technological innovation, small business and green projects to keep the economy on an even keel, the meeting said. Officials also said they would prevent “the disorderly expansion of capital”, strengthening a new anti-monopoly push.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/economic-recovery-is-not-yet-solid-says-china/article33369211.ece
19 December 2020||Washington,||Pompeo speaks with Turkish Minister||Top U.S. diplomat Mike Pompeo has assured his Turkish counterpart that American sanctions imposed on Ankara for its acquisition of a Russian missile defense system were not intended to weaken the country’s military capabilities. Mr. Pompeo spoke this week with Mevlut Cavusoglu and stressed that the “goal of the sanctions is to prevent Russia from receiving substantial revenue, access, and influence”, State Department spokesperson Cale Brown said on Thursday. The sanctions imposed over the S-400 system “are not intended to undermine the military capabilities or combat readiness of Turkey or any other U.S. Ally or partner”, Mr. Brown said in a statement. Mr. Pompeo also “urged Turkey to resolve the S-400 issue in a manner consistent with our decades-long history of defense-sector cooperation and to re-commit itself to its NATO obligations to purchase NATO-interoperable weaponry”. Washington on Monday made good on threats to punish Turkey for buying the major Russian missile defense system, imposing rare sanctions against a NATO ally.  It specifically targeted Turkey’s military procurement agency, banning all U.S. export licenses and loan credits for the agency, and said it would not allow its president to travel or hold assets in the United States. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday denounced the U.S. move. "What kind of an alliance is this?” Mr. Erdogan asked during a televised speech in Ankara. “This decision is an open attack on our sovereignty,” he said.

19 December 2020||Washington,||Amid federal tax probe, Biden backs son Hunter||U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has expressed full confidence in his son Hunter, a frequent target of Republican attacks, after it was revealed last week that he was under a federal tax investigation. During his unsuccessful re-election campaign, President Donald Trump launched repeated accusations against Mr. Hunter and said the Bidens were a “corrupt” family and a “criminal enterprise”. “We have great confidence in our son,” Mr. Biden said, sitting next to his wife Jill, in an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , which aired on Thursday on CBS . “I am not concerned about any accusations that have been made against him. It used to get to me. I think it’s kind of foul play but... as long as he’s good, we’re good,” Mr. Biden said in his first full remarks on the issue since the tax investigation became public. Mr. Trump and his allies have regularly assailed Mr. Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine and China. From 2014 to 2019, while his father was Vice-President, Mr. Hunter, a lawyer and lobbyist, served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of seeking the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to protect Burisma, and his son, from a corruption investigation. Mr. Hunter, 50, now an artist based in Los Angeles, has admitted to displaying “poor judgment” in some of his business dealings, but denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-federal-tax-probe-biden-backs-son-hunter/article33369206.ece
19 December 2020||Washington,||U.S. cyberattack is widening: Microsoft||A devastating cyberattack on U.S. government agencies has also hit targets worldwide, with the list of victims still growing, according to researchers, heightening fears over computer security and espionage. Microsoft said on Thursday it had notified over 40 customers hit by the malware, which experts say came from hackers linked to the Russian government and which could allow attackers unfettered network access. “While roughly 80% of these customers are located in the United States, this work so far has also identified victims in seven additional countries,” Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a blog post. He said the victims were also in Belgium, Britain, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. “It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing,” Mr. Smith said, echoing concerns voiced by U.S. officials on the serious threat from the attack. “This is not ‘espionage as usual’, even in the digital age,” he added. “Instead, it represents an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world.” John Dickson of the security firm Denim Group said many private sector firms that could be vulnerable are scrambling to shore up security and considering rebuilding their servers and other equipment. “Everyone is in damage assessment now because it’s so big,” Mr. Dickson said.     The National Security Agency called for increased vigilance to prevent unauthorised access to key military and civilian systems.

19 December 2020||Washington,||Trump says Moderna vaccine ‘approved’||U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States has authorised a second COVID-19 vaccine, jumping the gun on regulators who are yet to give it the formal green light. “Moderna vaccine overwhelmingly approved. Distribution to start immediately,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. This follows a recommendation by an expert panel on Thursday to grant emergency use approval for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue a formal approval on Friday. This would make Moderna’s vaccine the second to be approved in a Western country, following the one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech. Mr. Trump’s announcement came as U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, his wife Karen, and the lead public health official in the country, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, received the COVID-19 vaccine live on television, in a public display designed to boost national confidence in the measure. Signalling the importance given to the event, top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield were also in the room. “Building confidence in the vaccine is what brings us here this morning,” Mr. Pence said after being injected at the White House, quipping: “I didn’t feel a thing.” Mr. Pence indicated that formal approval for Moderna would be a matter of hours. “We have one, perhaps within hours two, safe and effective coronavirus vaccines,” he said. The death toll from COVID-19 has crossed 310,000 in the U.S., with the country also at the top with the most number of cases. The U.S. this week began vaccinating healthcare workers and long-term care residents with the Pfizer vaccine. Both the frontrunner vaccines are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, which had never been approved prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and both are two-dose regimens. The U.S., which recorded more than 17 million cases of the virus, will probably become the first country to approve the Moderna vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-says-moderna-vaccine-approved/article33369220.ece
19 December 2020||Brussels,||Brexit negotiations enter final hours||British and EU negotiators plunged into the final hours of their scramble for a post-Brexit deal on Friday, divided on the highly-charged issue of fishing rights. The U.K. will leave the EU single market in less than two weeks and time has all but run out for any agreement to be approved in time to head off a severe economic shock. The European Parliament has demanded that it see the text of any accord by Sunday at the latest, and the U.K. government says it will not allow talks to go beyond December 31. EU member states do not recognise Parliament’s deadline, but Brussels’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the MEPs before heading to talks with his U.K. counterpart David Frost that Friday marked a “moment of truth”. “We have very little time remaining, just a few hours to work through these negotiations...” he said. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, visiting Bolton in northern England, said: “Our door is open. We will keep talking but I have to say that things are looking difficult...” No breakthrough On Thursday, Mr. Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen held talks that failed to break the logjam in the eight-month-old negotiation. After the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said the negotiations “were now in a serious situation” and that an “agreement would not be reached unless the EU position changed substantially”. Unlike previous talks, which resulted in a joint EU-U.K. statement, Ms. von der Leyen gave her own account of the call. “Big differences remain to be bridged, in particular on fisheries,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/brexit-negotiations-enter-final-hours/article33369207.ece
19 December 2020||Dubai,||Iran starts nuclear facility work amid U.S. tensions||Iran has begun construction on a site at its underground nuclear facility at Fordow amid tensions with the U.S. over its atomic programme, satellite photos obtained on Friday by the Associated Press show. Iran has not publicly acknowledged any new construction at Fordow, whose discovery by the West in 2009 came in an earlier round of brinkmanship before world powers struck the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. While the purpose of the building remains unclear, any work at Fordow likely will trigger new concern in the waning days of the Trump administration before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. Already, Iran is building at its Natanz nuclear facility after a mysterious explosion in July there that Tehran described as a sabotage attack.  Iran’s mission to the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency, whose inspectors are in Iran as part of the nuclear deal did not comment. The IAEA as of yet has not publicly disclosed if Iran informed it of any construction at Fordow. Construction on the Fordow site began in late September. Satellite images obtained from Maxar Technologies by AP show the construction taking place at a northwest corner of the site, near the holy Shiite city of Qom, some 90 km southwest of Tehran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-starts-nuclear-facility-work-amid-us-tensions/article33369216.ece

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||The mystery disease of Eluru||It has been 11 days since she suddenly collapsed and had a seizure, but Bantu Mallika’s woes are not over. The thirty-two-year-old homemaker from Temple Street in Eluru still gets shivers, headaches and dizziness. It was on December 6 that Mallika felt a piercing headache and giddiness at home. Feeling disoriented, she called the village health assistant, Durga, for help. It was a timely call, for minutes later she lost consciousness and had a seizure. She was rushed to the medical centre at the end of the street. “I don’t know what happened to me,” Mallika said. “When I opened my eyes, I found myself on a hospital bed in the Government General Hospital (GGH). I had followed my usual routine that day. I did the household chores and had more or less the same food and water that I have been having for years. And none of my family members had any problem.” Mallika was discharged on the same day after treatment. Health assistant Durga too was surprised by the sudden attack. “Mallika had a five-minute seizure and complained of nausea after she gained consciousness. For the past couple of days, we have been monitoring her along with four others on the street who experienced similar symptoms. They still feel weak and complain of a vomiting sensation,” she said. “Mallika and four others” quickly turned to scores of people and scores to hundreds. Confusion prevailed as there seemed to be no identifiable cause of this illness. For the people of Eluru, in West Godavari district, already living in fear of COVID-19, this was a bolt from the blue. Between December 5 and December 13, over 600 people had fallen ill and no one knew why. Only theories floated around. On December 10, the Andhra Pradesh government constituted a 21-member high level multi-disciplinary committee to investigate the disease that was affecting the people of Eluru, a city with a population of over four lakh and a hub of agriculture, commerce, aquaculture and export. The initial days Doctors at the GGH said the illness had in fact started impacting several people in mid-November. All the patients had the same symptoms: after experiencing giddiness, back pain, fits, vomiting, anxiety, loss of memory, and headache, they all collapsed. The patients were immediately tested for COVID-19, their reports showed ‘negative’. While the recovery rate was extremely high, people were shocked when one man died. The sudden outbreak grabbed global attention in the first week of December, with officials of the World Health Organization (WHO), the State and Central governments, and research organisations scrambling to find out the cause. According to government records, a majority of the cases have been traced to JP Road, Vangayagudem, Dakshina Veedhi, Turpu Veedhi, Arundhatipeta, Kothapeta, Kobbarithota and Sanivarapupeta in Eluru. The first cases were reported from JP Road and Vangayagudem, according to hospital authorities. On December 9, GGH was buzzing with activity. It was the second consecutive day that a decline in cases was reported, yet the hospital was still admitting patients with similar ailments — at least more than two every passing hour. GGH Superintendent A.V.R. Mohan was busy attending calls from State and Central officials, journalists and staff members. Speaking to The Hindu , he said that there was no pattern in the answers of patients when they were asked what they imagined was the reason for the illness. Some said the episode struck after they drove, some said it happened after they ate, others, after they drank. The authorities were at sea. Mohan said the illness broke out before December. Sporadic incidents were reported by some rural medical practitioners from the middle of November, he said, but no one suspected anything. Then the numbers began climbing from December 4, the hospitals began filling up with patients, and a 45-year-old man died on December 9. “However, that death cannot be directly attributed to the disease,” Mohan said. “The person fell in the bathroom and the cause of death was reported as a head injury. But of course, post-COVID-19, any such development is a matter of concern.” Some people even experienced seizures more than once, but they were treated and sent home, said Mohan. The response To handle the rapidly emerging crisis in Eluru, 150 additional people were brought from hospitals across the State, including doctors, paramedics and nurses. Expert teams from premier research and medical institutions in Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and other parts of Andhra Pradesh were also brought in. Speaking to The Hindu at GGH, Jamshed Nair, Associate Professor at the Department of Emergency Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, said their team has collected inputs from the patients at GGH and visited the discharged patients and their kin in the affected colonies in Eluru. “We have collected blood samples from them. Samples of water and milk have been collected from Eluru and neighbouring villages for testing,” he said. On its part, the government roped in administrative staff, police and medical personnel, and research institutions to handle the situation. Sixty-two village secretariats have been activated, and first aid centres have been set up in each locality. Each centre has a doctor and two paramedics and basic medication to help patients till the ambulance arrives. The Centre has maintained a log book of referred cases with details such as the name of the patient, ward, gender, symptoms noticed, the date of admission, the reference hospital, present condition, the mobile number of the patient, date of discharge and remarks. Such micro-level data has helped immensely in handling the situation, said the GGH Superintendent. According to the data on Temple Street, where the first incident was reported, there were 17 cases recorded from December 5 to 9. While 13 of these patients had fits, the remaining complained of dizziness, weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea. The patients were referred to GGH, Swaruparani Hospital and Vijaya Diagnostics. The government has established a round-the-clock control room and a call centre at the municipal office. According to officials, it initiated house-to-house surveys within municipal limits. So far, 42,012 households out of 43,897 have been scanned. To check the possible scarcity of beds, a speciality hospital was kept on standby in Vijayawada. Twenty ambulances were pressed into operation, and 300 beds and 150 doctors and nurses were kept ready for patients in GGH Eluru and Asram hospital. Food, milk and drinking water were supplied to all the patients. Specialist doctors from AIIMS were flown in to conduct a detailed investigation. Experts from the National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology were roped in to figure out the cause of the disease. Possible cause By December 10, potable water, cerebral spinal fluid, blood, and milk in the areas were tested and the CT scans of 42 patients were taken. Traces of heavy metals such as lead and nickel were found in the blood samples of patients, the AIIMS report said, but where they originated remains unclear. The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has concluded that the locals consumed a neurotoxic contaminant that has caused the outbreak. The Director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Rakesh Mishra, said, “The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology carried out extensive analysis using the next generation sequencing-based approach to explore the microbiomes of samples collected from affected individuals. The samples included blood, faeces and vomitus. Our analysis showed no link between any infectious organism and this mysterious disease. The microbiomes were of healthy individuals. It is, therefore, likely that this disease was caused by a one-time event in a localised context and is not linked to any infectious organism. Considering the information available, it looks like a point-source outbreak where a neurotoxic contaminant has been consumed by the local people.”  Pesticide residue The government constituted a multi-disciplinary high-power committee to investigate the source of the disease. The panel was also expected to suggest remedial measures to prevent any such event in the future. Headed by the Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh, the committee included doctors, scientists and senior officials from the Andhra Pradesh government. The Chief Minister, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, announced on December 16 the findings of the expert panel through a video conference call and wanted further investigation into the issue. According to the details shared by the government, the probability that pesticide residues triggered the illness is high. AIIMS and the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology also agreed that this probability was high, but wanted further investigation on how the pesticides entered human bodies. The two institutes have been entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out further investigation. The Chief Minister also instructed the officials concerned to set up public labs in each district and continue the tests on food, water and soil so that the Eluru incident is not repeated. He wanted the agriculture department to focus on natural farming without using pesticides and help farmers with inputs through the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Over 10,000 RBKs were set up in Andhra Pradesh with the objective of helping farmers to enhance productivity while ensuring better incomes. Various findings Commenting on its findings, AIIMS, New Delhi stated that the blood samples of patients contained lead and nickel. All the milk samples that were collected also contained nickel. Based on the observations of patients, it said the reason for the illness could be the presence of organochloride which might have entered bodies through pesticides in the food cycle. Lead was also found in the blood samples of the relatives of the patients. AIIMS suggested that the food samples, food and vegetables be tested for a few months to help determine the exact reason for the illness. It also suggested geotagging of the samples. The Indian Institute of Chemical Technology collected 21 water samples from different parts of Eluru along with blood samples from humans and animals. It found no traces of lead, arsenic or any other heavy metals and pesticides in the water samples. However, the blood samples contained endosulfan and dichlorodiphenyltrichloethane (DDT), which are hazardous. Blood samples also contained lead and there were no organophosphates present. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Hyderabad, which collected air, soil and ground water samples from the affected areas, said that the air quality is within acceptable limits. Except for mercury, all other metals and substances in surface and ground water are well within the limits. There were no traces of organochlorine or organophosphates in the samples. Compared to surface water, the ground water contained higher levels of mercury. The phenomenon was attributed to burning of solid waste in the region. The tests on soil are still underway. The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, did not find any substances beyond the permissible limits in the serum and urine samples. There were also no traces of bacteria or virus, according to their report. The National Institute of Virology, Pune, said there was no evidence to prove any kind of viral infection. The National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, found pesticide residues in the tomato and brinjal samples. These pesticides could have caused the mysterious illness, according to its report. AIIMS, Mangalagiri, suggested a detailed examination and study of samples in other regions of the State against the backdrop of the Eluru incident. While investigating the presence of pesticide residues in humans, it wanted the right inputs to be given to farmers on the use of pesticides and natural farming. It has also suggested a detailed medical protocol to be used in the event of such an occurrence in the future. The WHO representative wanted the expert panel to focus on how the pesticide residues entered human bodies. Poor hygiene Meanwhile, the public in Eluru feel that there should be a streamlining of pesticide and chemical usage and discharge of the same from agri and aqua processing sectors in and around the city. Though there were no formal complaints about the high and intensive usage of chemicals and pesticides, they expressed concern as Eluru is a major hub of aqua and agri exports. There are about 30 major aqua units which store, package, weigh and export aqua products such as shrimp and fish. These firms process, pack and export about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of processed product to different countries. In December, the general hygiene conditions and management of garbage in Eluru are alarming. Almost all the canals are filled with garbage, still water, and plastic materials, which are a potential threat to general health. Eluru generates approximately 82 metric tonnes of garbage per day. Several sources in and around Eluru leave effluents in irrigation and other canals which eventually seep into groundwater. The public spoke about industrial solid and liquid waste from aqua processing industries, effluents and pesticides mixing with water from aquaponds and agricultural patches. Eluru-based school teacher Sambasiva Rao said all the aqua industry certifications are upto the mark but there are violations. “The Marine Products Export Development Authority frequently conducts camps for aqua farmers on the excessive use of non-organic fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides and antibiotics. We know about the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture. All these are obviously sinking into soil and groundwater. It’s an open secret,” he said. Senior citizen and resident of Eluru, M. Satyanarayana, said, “Dumping garbage in open places and canals and water stagnation have become normal. There seems to be no tab on the use of pesticides and chemicals and discharge of different effluents here. This needs to change. The government should definitely focus on this aspect with commitment,” he said. Meanwhile, with this illness causing fear among the people, eating out has become uncommon and public movement has reduced in Eluru, people said. Residents also said people from other regions are now sceptical about visiting Eluru. B. Subbarao, a resident of Powerpet, said he noticed people being extra careful. “People are carrying their own water and eating out less. Fewer people are travelling to Eluru now. People have become suspicious of every small ailment. I had a headache a few days ago, and I was worried. But it turned out to be a normal headache. But the anxiety that something may happen to me is there all the time. I feel uneasy for no reason,” Subbarao said. Doctors at GGH said that such mild paranoia is natural. “It’s common for the general public to take smaller illnesses more seriously and become anxious. We have had many cases at the GGH over the past few days where people who came for a check-up displayed high anxiety levels. It could be addressed in a matter of hours,” said GGH Superintendent Mohan. The Andhra Pradesh State Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas announced on December 13 that there were no new cases reported and all the 600 odd patients admitted in hospitals with symptoms of the illness were successfully treated and discharged. But the mysterious disease with no name has taken hold of people’s lives in Eluru. As trains near the Eluru railway station, passengers down the shutters. The sale of water bottles has reportedly seen a dip on platforms. It is as if the very air of Eluru has turned toxic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-mystery-disease-of-eluru/article33369203.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||MSP — the factoids versus the facts||According to one definition, a factoid is “an item of unreliable information that is reported and repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact”. After the passage of the three controversial farm laws, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) — not mentioned in the laws — has gained a lot of attention. The predominance of factoids about MSP and procurement has meant that the debate has yielded more chaff than grain. The MSP is meant to set a floor below which prices do not fall, and is announced by the government for 23 commodities (https://bit.ly/2IZLCIC). It is the price at which the government ‘promises’ to buy from farmers if market prices fall below it. In fact, however, government procurement is heavily concentrated on wheat and rice, with other crops barely being procured. Over the years, factoids about the MSP and government procurement have gained so much traction that the retired gentleman in the local park cites them as facts. These pertain to how many have benefited from the MSP and who has benefited from it. According to these popular beliefs, few (6%) farmers benefit, only large farmers benefit, and only farmers of Punjab and Haryana (to some extent, western Uttar Pradesh) benefit. More States under MSP In a forthcoming paper, we use data on State-wise procurement from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and agricultural household data for 2012-13 from the National Sample Survey (NSS), after which these data are not available, to set the record straight on these three factoids. One, the 6% figure from the NSS data 2012-13 relates to paddy and wheat alone. Even here, however, among those who sold any paddy/wheat, the numbers are higher — 14% and 16%. Two, the Government of India has made a systematic effort to expand the reach of MSP to more States, via the Decentralized Procurement (DCP) Scheme. Introduced in 1997-98, it was not very popular in the initial years and began to be adopted by States in earnest only around 2005. Under the DCP scheme, the responsibility of procurement devolved to the State governments which were reimbursed pre-approved costs. FCI data suggest that by July 2015, as many as 15 States had taken up this programme, though not all were implementing it with equal enthusiasm. Largely on account of it, procurement began moving out of ‘traditional’ States (such as Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh). Until 2000, barely 10% of wheat and rice was procured outside the traditional States. By 2012-13, the share of the DCP States rose to 25-35%. In the case of paddy, Chhattisgarh and Odisha have been the star performers. These States today contribute about 10% each to the total paddy procurement in the country. For wheat, decentralised procurement has taken off in Madhya Pradesh in a big way, accounting for approximately 20% of wheat procurement. In 2020-21, wheat procurement from Madhya Pradesh surpassed that from even Punjab. Among agricultural households which sell paddy under the procurement system, while 9% and 7% come from Punjab and Haryana, 11% are in Odisha and 33% are in Chhattisgarh. An overwhelming majority of agricultural households selling wheat to the procurement agencies come from Madhya Pradesh (33%) compared to 22% from Punjab and 18% from Haryana. That only Punjab and Haryana farmers have benefited from the MSP is now truly a thing of the past. Which farmer benefits Three, as per the factoid, only large farmers have benefited. In fact, procurement has benefited the small and marginal farmers in much bigger numbers than medium and large farmers. At the all-India level, among those who sold paddy to the government, 1% were large farmers, owning over 10 hectares of land. Small and marginal farmers, with less than 2 hectares accounted for 70%. The rest (29%) were medium farmers (2-10 hectares). In the case of wheat, 3% of all wheat-selling farmers were large farmers. More than half (56%) were small and marginal farmers. In Punjab and Haryana, the share of small and marginal farmers is not insignificant (38% and 58%, respectively, among paddy sellers). In the non-traditional States that adopted the DCP scheme, the overwhelming majority of farmers who sell to State procurement agencies are small and marginal. In Chhattisgarh and Odisha, for example, small and marginal farmers comprise 70-80% of all sellers to government agencies. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh, nearly half (45%) of those who sell wheat to government agencies are small or marginal farmers. To recap, the facts are as follows: one, the proportion of farmers who benefit from (even flawed) government procurement policies is not insignificant. Two, the geography of procurement has changed in the past 15 years. It is less concentrated in traditional States such as Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, as DCP States such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have started participating more vigorously. Three, perhaps most importantly — it is predominantly the small and marginal farmers who have benefited from the MSP and procurement, even if the size of the benefits may be larger for larger farmers. This is true not just in the DCP States, but also in the traditional States. The true picture Getting the facts right is an important first step in resolving the issues facing the agricultural sector and farmers’ issues. We have picked three factoids of many as an illustration of how little we know about how the MSP works. The range of claims made regarding, for example, the consequences of the MSP on diversification need to be examined as well. Among Punjabis who cultivated any crop, 21-37% did not grow paddy and wheat. Among all agricultural households including those which did not cultivate a crop (indicating more diversified sources of agricultural income), a larger proportion (58 and 48%, respectively) stayed away from paddy and wheat, suggesting that procurement in Punjab may not have prevented diversification to the extent we imagine.  Similarly, confusion reigns about other areas of interest from the point of view of the new farm laws. It is widely believed that for the first time, the new laws allow farmers to sell outside the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). Even for commodities for which MSP is announced, the proportion of sales via the mandi range is only between 10-64%; the demand for the MSP originates because the prices paid outside the mandi tend to be much lower. Countrywide, sales to mandi or government procurement agencies fetched on average 13.3% higher prices for paddy and 5.8% for wheat. We are not unsympathetic to those who question the heavy concentration of wheat and rice in government procurement (millets are better suited to agro-climatic conditions prevailing in large parts of the country, more nutritious and also grown by small and marginal farmers), to the flaws in the current mandi system, or how the MSP is implemented. Yet, the debate — popular, academic or political — on these issues must take into account the changed geography of procurement and the profile of the seller.

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Chalking out the Congress’s enduring revival||Indian democracy is at an inflexion point. Not only has the Indian state been captured by a ruling party which is creating a religious hierarchy of citizenship but Indian democracy is also being systematically deinstitutionalised to dismantle the very constraints on state power which make it possible to contest it. The only way to stop this assault on the institutional edifice of our democracy is by capturing state power at the Centre. Still a force to reckon with The importance of the Indian National Congress Party at this point cannot be overstated. Even at its nadir, the Congress commands 20% of the electoral vote and is the only Opposition party with a national footprint. It is thus the only party which can provide a coherent national framework for a viable Opposition formation. Unfortunately, the Congress party is failing to do justice to this moment, and to its own deeply inspiring legacy. There is no dearth of advice for the Congress; however, much of it is motherhood generalities — “you must be among the people” — which does little to clarify the way forward. Critiques of the tactical choices which any political party must make in the electoral arena also have limited value. The policies which constitute the party’s political platform are contingent on the moment. What is important for the enduring revival of the Congress Party is its larger perception in the minds of the Indian people and how it builds organisation. Nation-building identity For this, three things need to be done. Give members a positive sense of identity: with the politicisation of every day life and consequent polarisation, political affiliation is increasingly a part of one’s identity. Association with the Congress Party must allow people to feel good about themselves and give them a sense of pride and virtue if not opportunity and power. Earlier being a Congress-person imbued an identity strongly co-related to our national identity. With the range of activities such as spinning the wheel, an ordinary person could feel like s/he was part of the nation-building effort. This identity has been lost. Consequently, we lack political programmes to give supporters an accessible and respectful sense of belonging. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the other hand does give its supporters an identity outside of partisan affiliation — of being a proud Hindu and/or ascendant subaltern who can dismiss the “corrupt elite” (the Congress and its affiliates in this narrative). The BJP’s supporters have ways of exercising this identity without necessarily having to engage with the BJP organisation. Merely exercising one’s Hindu identity through festivals is becoming enough to be a BJP supporter, whereas an instinctively liberal person on the street is a Congress voter, often by default in opposition to the BJP. With the politicisation of our national identity and its increasing association with the BJP, the Congress Party cannot come up with a counter through ad hoc economic promises alone, especially because citizens are sceptical of the state’s intent and capacity to deliver outsized new economic benefits. Instead, the Congress Party must articulate its own vision of India’s national identity, design political programmes which will allow members/supporters to exercise this identity, and find leadership at all levels and constituencies (students, the youth, farmers, Dalits, women, etc) to embody this identity. Politics of organisation Second, meld the organisation with the political process: mass communication and mass outreach are at the heart of electoral politics. A political party must thus have ‘organisation’ across the spread of its electoral footprint. While the Congress has always been a mass-based party, the need for organisation is especially acute right now to bypass media subservient to the ruling party and to tailor messages for different constituencies. In the absence of organisation, the Congress Party is too dependent on the media to get its message across and is constrained by blunt messaging instead of tailoring content by interest/constituency. While there is recognition in the Party on the need for organisation, there is an attempt to build organisation through procedure instead of politics. This approach can populate the organisation and help with data collection, but only a political process can create a chain of committed leadership, influence and accountability. At the grass-root level The Party may have data for some notional worker in a booth, but who will inspire, coax and cajole the worker into actually going out to canvas? This is an assiduously political process where ideology and commitment of leadership at each level cannot be supplanted by technology or surveillance. Part of the impetus for a technocratic approach is the somewhat unrealistic manner in which we define our immediate organisational task, such as identifying 10 workers for 10 lakh booths across the country wherein it is near impossible to deploy personalised discretion inherent in a political process. The Party may be better served if instead it were to focus first on establishing a committed block-level organisation across the country, giving importance and stature to the roughly 6,500 block presidents and 700 district presidents in the process. Issue of the leader Third, establish strong top-down leadership: None of the above can be done without a strong and interventionist Congress President. Political parties — the Congress in particular — are defined as much by internal conflicts as external. Politics is dynamic with constantly opening and closing pathways to power. Without a strong leader at the top to take and enforce decisions, the Party will continue to be pulled in different directions. Moreover, only the active facilitation of the Congress President can create space for substantive deliberation required right now — both as a political process to draw everyone together and to form a political platform expansive enough to accommodate the Congress’s historical big tent positioning. At present, this leadership can only be provided by Rahul Gandhi. This is not a sycophantic statement — if any other leader had to emerge in the Party, he would have done so over the last year. Instead, different factions prefer status quo rather than allowing one group to ascend and upset the balance of power for everyone. Organisational power thus continues to reside in Mr Gandhi. The way then to revive the Congress and consolidate this power is one and the same — its full and frontal exercise.

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Battle for Bengal||The appointment of three IPS officers of the West Bengal cadre to various posts by the Union Home Ministry on Thursday has escalated the confrontation between the State and the Centre. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has termed the deputation order despite the State’s objection “a colourable exercise of power and blatant misuse of emergency provision of IPS Cadre Rule 1954”. The constant hostility between the State and Central governments is now taking a turn for the worse ahead of the 2021 Assembly election. The tug of war began after a convoy of BJP President J.P. Nadda came under stone pelting in the State on December 10. The BJP apparently holds the IPS officers accountable for the incident. After an initial move to recall these officials was resisted by the State, the Centre has invoked Section 6(1) of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, which says that “in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the Central Government....” The tussle mirrors the high stakes political contest between the BJP and the ruling Trinamool Congress. The CM’s style of managing the police force has gained attention for the wrong reasons in the past. Senior officials are seen as allied with the TMC and the BJP’s determined drive to capture power in the State is multi-pronged. On Friday, the Supreme Court restrained West Bengal from taking any “coercive action” against several BJP leaders in criminal cases registered against them by the State Police. The BJP will continue to knock on the doors of the Court and the Election Commission of India to bring pressure on the State government. By enforcing its writ on IPS officers, the Centre is sending a signal to all officers that their conduct will now be under scrutiny. The script is familiar. Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the CBI issued notice to Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar and wanted to take him in custody, provoking Ms. Banerjee to sit on a dharna. During the polls, the ECI transferred senior police officers including Mr. Kumar. After the elections, the CM restored all officials to their previous posts. The central schemes, Ayushman Bharat and PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, are also a bone of contention. The TMC government has refused to implement them, demanding that the funds be routed through the State. The CM has also complained of insufficient central assistance to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and cyclone Amphan. The Centre’s earlier demand that the Chief Secretary and DGP attend a meeting in New Delhi on the State’s law-and-order situation increased tensions. All told, the partisan use of the personnel and instruments of the state by parties in power as is happening in this tussle is a disturbing signal for democracy and federalism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/battle-for-bengal/article33369191.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Friend and neighbour||The virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina, where they discussed issues ranging from the violent border incidents to the COVID-19 fight, demonstrates their desire to reboot India-Bangladesh ties that have faced challenges in recent months. Mr. Modi called Bangladesh a “major pillar” in India’s neighbourhood first policy, while Ms. Hasina invited him to visit Bangladesh in March for the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of its independence. It is a key opportunity for India, which had played a major role in Bangladesh’s liberation in 1971, to revive the bonhomie and address the issues adversely affecting the partnership. Despite the friendship remaining solid, the border has been sensitive — at least 25 Bangladeshis were killed in the first six months of this year along the border by Indian forces, according to a rights watchdog. The Teesta water dispute remains unresolved. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens, which Ms. Hasina called “unnecessary”, have created a negative impression about India. Above all, China is making deep inroads into Bangladesh by ramping up infrastructure investments and expanding economic cooperation. So, it is imperative for India to bolster ties with this all-weather friend, and there may not be a better time to do so than when Bangladesh is to celebrate the golden jubilee of its independence. Ms. Hasina has done relatively well in steering Bangladesh through crises. Under the Awami League government, Bangladesh, India’s largest trading partner in South Asia, has expanded its economy and improved social welfare. Despite the Awami League’s tight grip over the administration, Ms. Hasina has continued to face challenges from Islamist factions. War crimes and corruption trials have weakened the traditional opposition — the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its ally, the pro-Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami. But another Islamist group, Hifazat-e-Islam, made headlines recently when it organised mass protests against French President Emmanuel Macron and opposed the Hasina government’s plan to build a statue of the country’s founding father, Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, in Dhaka’s suburbs. The Hifazat has claimed that installing statues is prohibited in Islam and that they would be pulled down, but the government seems determined to go ahead with its plan. In a speech marking Victory Day (December 16), Ms. Hasina said she would not allow the country to be divided on religious lines, in an indirect reference to Hifazat. India should support her fight against the radical elements. India should also not allow the ideological inclinations of the ruling party to spoil the historic relationship between the two countries. New Delhi should take a broader view of the changing scenario and growing competition in South Asia, and reach out to Dhaka with an open mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/friend-and-neighbour/article33369192.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||Govt. to spell out production linked plan for autos soon: Goel||The Heavy Industries Ministry is engaged in close coordination with stakeholders on the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme which also covers the automobile sector, and hopefully it will be rolled out very soon, a top official said on Friday. “Government has come out with a huge outlay for production linked incentives in the manufacturing sector, a big factor of which is auto. So the size is going to be approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh crore,” Secretary in the Heavy Industries Ministry Arun Goel said at a CII event. “We are now in close coordination with the stakeholders to work out the details and hopefully it will be seeing the light of day in the final shape very soon.” The Department of Heavy Industries frames and implements policies for the auto sector. The Union Cabinet last month approved a Production Linked Incentive scheme worth Rs. 1.46 lakh crore for 10 sectors to boost domestic manufacturing, create jobs and reduce the dependence on imports. The scheme will be offered to white goods manufacturing, pharma, auto, telecom, textile, food products, solar photovoltaic and cell battery, among others, with a total outlay of Rs. 1,45,980 crore spread over five years. ‘Largest outlay for auto’ The largest share — Rs. 57,042 crore — goes to auto and auto components. This is followed by advance chemistry cell battery (Rs. 18,100 crore), drug makers (Rs. 15,000 crore), telecom products (Rs. 12,195 crore), food products (Rs. 10,900 crore) and textile manufacturers (Rs. 10,683 crore).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-to-spell-out-production-linked-plan-for-autos-soon-goel/article33369187.ece
19 December 2020||MUMBAI,||RIL, BP start gas output from ultra-deepwater R-Cluster||Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) and BP plc have announced the start of production from R-Cluster, the ultra-deepwater gas field in the KG basin’s D6 block. The two partners are developing three deepwater gas projects in KG-D6 — R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ — which together are expected to meet 15% of India’s gas demand by 2023, RIL said in a statement. “These projects will utilise the existing hub infrastructure in KG-D6 block,” the company added. RIL is the operator of KG-D6 with a 66.67% participating interest and BP holds the rest. R-Cluster is the first of the three projects to come on stream. The field is located about 60 km from the existing KG-D6 Control & Riser Platform (CRP) off the Kakinada coast and comprises a subsea production system tied back to CRP via a subsea pipeline, the company said. ‘Deepest in Asia’ “Located at a water depth of greater than 2,000 m, it is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia. The field is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2021,” RIL said. The next project, the Satellites Cluster, is expected to come on stream in 2021, followed by the MJ project in 2022, it added. “Peak gas production from the fields is expected to be around 30 mmscmd.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ril-bp-start-gas-output-from-ultra-deepwater-r-cluster/article33369174.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Budget to prioritise health investments||With the revival of the Indian economy being the primary focus, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday hinted that the Union Budget for 2021-22 would assign top billing to health sector concerns, while addressing the implications of the post-pandemic world for industry and the workforce. Stressing that India would play a significant role in reviving the global economy and was ready to manufacture vaccines for the world, she said, “we owe it to humanity to put our heads together and come up with a Budget that can play its role in reviving India”. Seeking ideas from industry leaders at the CII Partnership Summit, Ms. Sitharaman said: “Feel free to send me your inputs so that we can see a Budget like never before. In 100 years of India, we haven’t seen a Budget being made post-pandemic like this. And that is not going to be possible unless I get each one of your inputs and wish list. Without that, it is impossible for me to draft up something which is going to be that Budget like never before. “Considering the size of our population, and the potential India holds for good growth-related building of our economy, I wouldn’t hesitate to say that we shall be the engine of global growth, along with a few other countries, of course,” she added. Health as priority Emphasising that the government was taking all inputs received from health sector experts for the Budget seriously, the Minister said: “Health and investment in health takes top-notch priority, not just to keep us safer, but also to make health and health-related expenditure more predictable; for people not to do it out-of-pocket, some kind of provisions to be made for that.” The Budget will also try to leverage India’s strengths in areas such as vaccine production to encourage investments in research and development in biotech and pharmaceuticals, she said. “At a time [when] many economies are wondering where to procure their vaccines from, after they are formulated and certified… we in India are actually very fortunate to have such capacities that are now racing ahead of time… and we have the capacity to... produce as much as we need,” she pointed out. To a query as to where she sees India one year from now, the Minister said: “One thing’s for sure… India would have moved a lot more on digitisation... have its signature on anything to do with fintech, financial transactions and digital payments globally. “You will also find that India will show signs of being a leader in infrastructure building. Therefore, core sector revival will be speedier than anything else.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/budget-to-prioritise-health-investments/article33369179.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC stays criminal proceedings against Wipro’s Premji, wife||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed criminal proceedings initiated by a Karnataka court against former chairman and managing director of Wipro, Azim H. Premji, his wife and chartered accountant G.V. Rao on the basis of a “mischievous” private complaint alleging breach of trust and corruption in the merger of three companies with a Premji group firm. A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul stayed the trial court’s January order taking cognisance of the complaint and summoning Mr. Premji and the others after the Karnataka High Court refused in May to quash the lower court’s order. In separate petitions Mr. Premji, represented by senior advocates A.M. Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi, and Mr. Rao, represented by senior advocate S. Ganesh and advocate Vipin Nair, said the complaint was “mischievous” in nature. Mr. Premji, in his petition filed through advocate Mahesh Agarwal, said the three companies — Napean, Regal and Vidya — were private companies and had been promoted, owned and controlled by the Azim Premji Group from their inception in 1974. It submitted that Hasham, the company with which the three were amalgamated in 2015, was also part of the group. The “malafide” criminal complaint filed by India Awake for Transparency in 2017 claimed the three companies “belonged to nobody and therefore belonged to the government”. Mr. Rohatgi and Mr. Singhvi submitted that this accusation was plain mischievous. The court set next hearing for February 5, and issued notice to respondents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sc-stays-criminal-proceedings-against-wipros-premji-wife/article33369177.ece

The current permissible level of blending is 10% of ethanol though India reached only 5.6% of blending in 2019. “The notification facilitates the development of E20-compliant vehicles,” according to a statement. “It will also help in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, etc. It will help reduce the oil import bill, thereby saving foreign exchange and boosting energy security.”  Vehicle compatibility It added the compatibility of vehicles with the percentage of ethanol in the blend would be defined by the vehicle manufacturer, which would have to be displayed on the vehicle with a sticker. Ethanol is a biofuel and a common by-product of biomass left by agricultural feedstock such as corn, sugarcane, hemp, potato, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-mulls-e20-fuel-to-cut-vehicular-emissions/article33369175.ece

He also said the government has recapitalised public sector banks and continues to pump in capital as per requirements. “We are looking at various options, including the option you mentioned (of bad bank), and it is still in the works. The RBI has been asking us, and we ourselves also feel that we need to recapitalise. We have recapitalised to a large extent and this year too, we have kept some money for recapitalisation, so that commitment is there,” he said. Mr. Bajaj was responding to a query on whether the government would consider setting up of a bad bank for reducing the burden of non-performing assets (NPAs) of the public sector banks. There have been differences of opinion on setting up of a bad bank. In June, Chief Economic Adviser K. V. Subramanian said setting up of a bad bank may not be a potent option to address the NPA woes in the sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-mulls-bad-bank-to-boost-banking-sector/article33369183.ece

19 December 2020||London,||United maintains perfect away record||Manchester United mounted yet another rescue mission on Thursday, beating Sheffield United 3-2 to win its sixth consecutive Premier League away match of the season. The Blades took a shock lead through David McGoldrick after a horrendous error by returning goalkeeper Dean Henderson but two goals from Marcus Rashford and a Anthony Martial strike turned the tables. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Jekyll-and-Hyde team has won just a single match at Old Trafford this season but has taken all 18 points on the road to climb to sixth in the table. But that is only half the story for United, which has been forced to come from behind in all six of those away games. Aston Villa squandered multiple chances as it was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by battling Burnley on Thursday. Villa is in 11th place while the point lifted Sean Dyche’s men out of the bottom three. Anwar El Ghazi and Kortney Hause hit the woodwork while Matt Lowton cleared a deflected strike from Ahmed Elmohamady off the line. Burnley’s threat was limited but Sean Dyche’s side is now unbeaten in three games.  The results:   Premier League: Aston Villa 0 drew with Burnley 0; Sheffield United 2 (McGoldrick 5, 87) lost to Manchester United 3 (Rashford 26, 51, Martial 33).   Serie A: AS Roma 3 (Mkhitaryan 27, Veretout 43-pen, Pellegrini 68) bt Torino 1 (Belotti 73).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/united-maintains-perfect-away-record/article33369313.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Smith’s wicket an important one’||Seldom has R. Ashwin smiled of late during India’s post-match press interactions. Friday was expectedly an exception. Not only did the off-spinner return his personal best Down Under but also played a key role in India gaining an upper hand on the second day of the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. After setting Steve Smith up in his first over, Ashwin went on a celebratory lap that is usually synonymous with Imran Tahir. Ashwin was thrilled to play Test cricket again after a prolonged break enforced by the pandemic. “First things first, I’m so happy that we are playing Test cricket again and it has been a long time. Since I am extremely mad about the sport and doing other things even during the lockdown, it felt refreshing to go out and bowl again. I meant the feeling was great, bowling with the pink ball and I hadn’t taken wickets with that... it just felt amazing to go out and play again. I felt like making my debut again. I really enjoyed bowling,” Ashwin said. Context of the game “With regards to Steve Smith’s wicket, obviously it is a big wicket. With Steve, you know how much time he loves to bat and his appetite for runs is huge. So in terms of the context of the game and where it was placed, I felt it was an important wicket and I enjoyed it.” Ashwin stressed that despite getting bowled out for 244, India’s dressing room — based on the Test in Adelaide in 2018 — felt “we were right in the game”. “I think last time we made 250, here we were five to six runs shorter this time, so we knew we were in the contest. I thought we had a bowling performance that was one notch better than the last time,” he said.  Having bowled a long spell with the pink-ball for the first time in a match — he bowled just five overs during India’s maiden pink-ball Test last year — Ashwin felt it was too much to experiment with the new ball in day Tests, as suggested by Shane Warne. “The pink ball is at a nascent stage of where Test cricket should head forward. It is exciting for a lot of people watching the game. “Personally, the one where we played in Kolkata was a different because this is Kookaburra and that was played with SG balls,” he said. “To try too many things, pushing players to a certain brim, I’m not sure. But there is space for pink-ball Tests.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/smiths-wicket-an-important-one/article33369279.ece

19 December 2020||London,||Can the pretenders finally succeed?||Liverpool tops the Premier League table but the defending champion — like all of the traditional big guns — is finding it tough to pull away from an eager pack of contenders. The stumbles of the “Big Six” have allowed a clutch of unfashionable clubs to dream of overthrowing the established order as Leicester did so dramatically in the 2015/2016 season. Saints go marching on? Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, dubbed the “Alpine Klopp” after Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp, looked more suited to the foothills than the peaks when his side was embarrassed 9-0 by Leicester last year. But it is now third in the table, just four points off the top, ahead of Saturday’s match at home against a Manchester City side which is yet to find its rhythm this season. Southampton, playing with style and confidence, will feel it can get the better of City and keep itself on the shoulders of Liverpool after losing just one of its past 11 matches in the Premier League. Hasenhuttl’s side failed to capitalise against 10-man Arsenal on Wednesday, settling for a point in a 1-1 draw after taking the lead but he was sanguine about the result. “Unbeaten again, this is the most important thing and now we step up again,” said the Austrian. “We are still 10 points above Arsenal. This explains everything.” Toffees show stickability Everton fans have waited even longer than their city rivals Liverpool did to win the English top-flight — the last time they were champions was during their golden era under Howard Kendall in 1987. The Merseysiders started the season in style with four straight league wins before losing momentum. However, Wednesday’s impressive 2-0 win away at Leicester, which followed its victory over Chelsea, lifted it to within five points of Liverpool — and put it in good heart to host out-of-form Arsenal on Saturday. In the urbane and proven trophy-winner Carlo Ancelotti, Everton appears at last to have found a manager who has the nous to engineer a campaign for a Champions League spot. The last time it finished in the top four was in the 2004/05 season. However, some of the players believe they are capable of greater things than that. “Are we title challengers? Definitely,” said defender Mason Holgate. “It’s a season where lots of mad results are happening so with a couple of wins we’re right back up there. “You’re not going to come across two tougher teams than Chelsea and Leicester, so to beat them both with two clean sheets is great.” Foxes have title scent Leicester faces a daunting trip to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday but that will probably be a relief to manager Brendan Rodgers. The club’s away form — five wins in six league games — is what has kept it near the top. But it has lost four home games, as many as it did in the whole of last season. Rodgers says his side is young and on a learning curve, although it contains a few grizzled veterans including Jamie Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel and Christian Fuchs, while Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison also have plenty of experience. The Leicester boss concedes the Foxes have to be able to move up a gear. “The players have been very good up to this point but there’s going to be games where we need to show that bit more,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-the-pretenders-finally-succeed/article33369491.ece

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Aniket gives Jamshedpur FC full points||NorthEast United FC (NEUFC) experienced the bitter taste of defeat for the first time this Indian Super League season as it lost 1-0 to Jamshedpur FC (JFC) at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Vasco on Friday. Aniket Jadhav’s 53rd minute strike brought all three points to JFC as it climbed to the fifth spot with 10 points from seven games. NEUFC remains fourth. NEUFC looked the better side initially and Kwesi Appiah had half-a-chance in the 18th minute when Idrissa Sylla chested down Ashutosh Mehta’s long throw-in. Appiah did well to take on a couple of defenders and had a crack at goal but his shot whizzed wide. The Ghanaian had another chance in the 24th minute when he tried to bend a free-kick from the edge of the box, but his strike only went as far as the side-netting. Eze in action JFC’s Stephen Eze, the tallest player on the pitch at 6’6, was in the thick of things at both ends and had an opportunity around the 40th minute but his header looped over the crossbar. Nerijus Valskis, the current joint top scorer, had a subdued opening 45 as he barely received supply and did not manage a single shot. Owen Coyle’s JFC went ahead eight minutes after the restart through Jadhav. Jackichand Singh played a delightful incisive pass into the box for Jadhav to slot home and claim his career’s second ISL goal. Jadhav, who briefly trained with Blackburn Rovers, came within inches of a second goal minutes later but his shot — at the end of a 60-yard dash — narrowly missed the top corner. NEUFC was given a lease of life in the 65th minute when Benjamin Lambot won a penalty. Sylla stepped up to take it but T.P. Rehenesh produced a fantastic save to deny him. Jackichand nearly doubled his side’s lead, unwittingly, with 10 minutes left on the clock when his attempted cross struck the crossbar. JFC held on to its slender lead to claim its second win of the season.  The result: NEUFC 0 lost to JFC 1 (Aniket Jadhav 53).

The winger played a key role in Chennai City FC winning the crown in 2018-19. In the next season, Romario went on loan to Mohun Bagan from FC Goa, and bagged his second title. Currently playing in the ISL with FC Goa, the 24-year-old has been in top form, providing razor sharp passes from the wings. “I am extremely happy playing for FC Goa. Actually, I will say that Goa has some of the best Indian midfielders in the ISL. “Even in my position, there is tough competition as there are seven wingers fighting for a place in the playing XI. There is pressure, but it always pushes me to play better,” Romario told The Hindu on Friday. Romario was particularly pleased with his assist in the drawn (2-2) match against Bengaluru FC. Coming in the place of Seiminlen Doungel in the second half, Romario provided the perfect pass to striker Igor Angulo to equalise. “When I got a chance to play, I did my best. Everybody knows BFC is a big team. I was very happy that I helped in the draw,” he said.  A different coach Having played under a variety of coaches, Romario termed Goa coach Juan Ferrando as being different from others in the way he treats the players. “For him (Ferrando) all the 30 players are equal,” he said. Does he have any special feelings when Goa takes his former team Chennaiyin FC on Saturday? Romario is non-sentimental about it. “Whichever team I play [for], I will give my 100 percent. Goa is my second home,” he said.

19 December 2020||London,||I am sure bubble fatigue is going to kick in, says Ian Chappell||Former Australia captain Ian Chappell believes teams such as India will need increasingly large squads to help them combat “bubble fatigue” as they press ahead with extensive touring schedules amid the coronavirus pandemic. Leading Indian players have been in a series of bio-secure bubbles since September, initially while taking part in the IPL, moved to the United Arab Emirates on health grounds. Travelling to Australia, they again underwent quarantine ahead of the ongoing Test series. Bubble fatigue has already become an issue for a number of England players, with the likes of Tom Banton and Tom Curran citing it as a reason for their withdrawal from contracts in Australia’s Big Bash League. Health grounds The problems of playing cricket in the pandemic were highlighted when England, which pioneered international cricket’s return under the shadow of COVID-19, recently cut short its tour of South Africa on health grounds amid concerns that its hotel bubble had been breached. “I have never experienced anything like this, and I am not surprised some players have started to talk about bubble fatigue,” Chappell said. “We had a couple of England players who have already pulled out of the BBL for that reason.” Early in the New Year, India is set to host England in four Tests, five Twenty20 and three ODIs, with all of those matches set to be played in bio-secure conditions. “If you look at what India have got coming up, they are going to need a huge squad of players,” said Chappell. “I am sure the bubble fatigue is going to kick in so my sympathies with modern players having to do this,” added the 77-year-old. “You are going to have situations like you got in South Africa. I am not surprised that the England players have got very nervous and said we are out of here.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-am-sure-bubble-fatigue-is-going-to-kick-in-says-ian-chappell/article33369489.ece
19 December 2020||Berlin,||Bayern eager to stamp authority on Leverkusen||Second-placed Bayern Munich is eager to stamp its authority on the Bundesliga with a win at current leader Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Under its Dutch coach Peter Bosz, Leverkusen is the only club still unbeaten in the German league. It is a point ahead of Bayern after Wednesday’s 4-0 thumping of Cologne. In contrast, Bayern needed two Robert Lewandowski goals and Manuel Neuer’s saves to see off Wolfsburg 2-1 in midweek having drawn its two previous games. Mounting injuries and a dense fixture list have taken their toll on Bayern, which has looked jaded in recent weeks. Lewandowski says Saturday’s showdown gives Bayern the chance to shake off any fatigue in its final league game of 2020 before a two-week winter break. “A lot of it is in the head. We just have to step on the gas, no matter how good Leverkusen is — we have to win the last game,” said Lewandowski, who has scored 18 goals in 17 games this season. Having lifted the Champions League, German Cup, Bundesliga and UEFA Super Cup over the last 12 months, Bayern coach Hansi Flick wants to “finish a great 2020” with three away points. Top of the table clash This is the third top-of-the-table clash Bayern has had recently, including its 3-2 win at Dortmund, which was then second, in November and 3-3 draw at home to Leipzig a fortnight ago. Leverkusen was the last team to beat Bayern at home — in any competition — when Jamaica winger Leon Bailey scored twice in a 2-1 win at the Allianz Arena in late November 2019. “Everyone is beatable,” insisted Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri. “You have to have a lot of heart, show a lot of will, we definitely have the quality.” His side shone with goals by Mitchell Weiser, Moussa Diaby, Patrik Schick and 17-year-old Florian Wirtz at Cologne, whose head coach Markus Gisdol insisted Leverkusen is currently “on a different level”. Bosz says Leverkusen is “playing with confidence and a good feeling” but Bayern always provide a test for any rivals with title aspirations. Third-placed RB Leipzig, only a point behind Leverkusen, takes on Cologne which is just above the relegation zone. Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann says three points at home is “very, very important” in its final league match of 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bayern-eager-to-reel-in-leverkusen/article33369480.ece
19 December 2020||Milan,||Inter targets top spot||Inter Milan targets the top spot in Serie A on Sunday at home against promoted Spezia while league leader AC Milan faces a tricky trip to Sassuolo. Inter is just one point behind its city rival after picking up a fifth consecutive league win against Napoli midweek. Antonio Conte's side has gained four points on Milan in the last two league games with its focus now on a first league title since 2010 after its European exit. “It makes me smile when an obligation is talked about,” said Conte of the pressure to deliver the 'Scudetto' to save Inter's season. “There are many teams who want to be protagonists. They start with the aim of trying to win, but, in the end, only one does. “In the last nine years, the same side has always won, which is why I smile when I hear 'obligation'. We want to improve.” Stalemates Unbeaten Milan travels to sixth-placed Sassuolo as it tries to get back to winning after back-to-back stalemates. Star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has missed Milan's last four league games, but the 39-year-old Swede looks set to return from a leg injury. Despite his absence, AC Milan stretched its unbeaten run to 24 league games going back to last March, its longest run since 1993. After a flying start to the season, Sassuolo lost momentum after top scorer Francesco Caputo missed four games through injury but the Italian forward returned in a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina last time out. The side from Emilia Romagna is five points behind Milan, and needs a win to avoid losing further ground.  Champion Juventus, four points behind Milan and sitting third, heads to face 14th-placed Parma, looking for just its third win on the road this season. Andrea Pirlo's side has been held in six of 12 games played so far this campaign. Roma, equal on points with Juventus, travels to eighth-placed Atalanta, which has won just one of its last five matches amid uncertainly over the future of captain Papu Gomez. Napoli vs Lazio Napoli, in fifth, travels to ninth-placed Lazio, with both sides needing wins to keep in touch with the leaders. Gennaro Gattuso will be without forward Dries Mertens, out injured for three weeks with an ankle sprain, with Nigerian Victor Osimhen recovering from a shoulder injury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/inter-targets-top-spot-as-leader-ac-milan-faces-sassuolo-test/article33369486.ece

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||He controls and directs||When it was decided that a messenger should be sent by the Pandavas to Duryodhana as a last attempt to avert war, Lord Krishna volunteered to go, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. Yudhishthira at once brought a chariot for Krishna, but the Lord said with rishis following Him on foot, it would be improper and disrespectful for Him to ride in a chariot. So He decided to walk. Ilango Adigal, in his Silappadikaram, describes the scene — Krishna walked to the sound of Vedic recitation, as a messenger of the Pandavas. Ilango Adigal asks of what use a tongue is if it does not sing the praises of such a One. When news reached Hastinapura that Krishna was on His way to meet the Kauravas, discussions began on how to welcome the Lord. Duryodhana, however, was firm that Krishna should not be welcomed. In fact, Duryodhana wanted to insult Krishna. And he said that none should rise as Krishna entered. Bhishma had to go along with adamant Duryodhana, and Bhishma said that he would do whatever Duryodhana did. But when Krishna entered the court, Duryodhana was the first to rise from his seat to welcome Him. The others in the court followed suit. Later Duryodhana picked up an argument with Bhishma and others, and said they went against his wishes by honouring Krishna. Bhishma pointed out that they only followed Duryodhana. But why did Duryodhana get up from his seat? Because, the Lord who was inside him directed him to, and that is why one of the names of the Lord in the Vishnu Sahasranama is Vasat. It means He is the controller of everything. All things go according to His will. If an enemy confronts us, and we chant the name Vasat, then the Lord who is inside our opponent will make him friendly towards us||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/he-controls-and-directs/article33369267.ece

Both are unbeaten in the tournament and will give their best to maintain the impeccable record in the most important contest. Telegraph will depend on players like Tanmoy Ghosh and Stanley Eze, who have scored more than once. It has been a good outing for Kashmir ahead of its I-League campaign. The David Robertson-coached team, which has conceded only one goal in four matches, will be keen to finish with a confidence-boosting title-win. Players like Mason Robertson, Danish Farooq and Lukman Adefemi are expected to play important roles in Kashmir’s quest for the champion’s tag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/telegraph-takes-on-real-kashmir/article33369481.ece

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Dreaming of a desi Christmas||Rudolph’s red nose paled next to mine. Christmas brought on sneezing bouts of hay fever, till we realised it was exactly that. My dad carted home hay and goodwill from the local gaushala for our crib, and from the pong it threw up, probably cow dung. It had me sneezing and guests hurling accusatory glares at each other. Growing up in Jamshedpur, we boasted neither fireplace nor stockings to hang over it. Our school socks, hung up in hope, were ignored by Santa. Instead, he often let out a howl, more suited to werewolf than reindeer, when punctured by a stapler while swift-gift-wrapping in the pitch dark. A growly parent sported a bandaged thumb the next morning, blamed on the cat, baby or saucepan. We kids ranked each house our family visited by how sugary the kulkuls were, how crackly the murrukkus or how deep the hostess’ frown when we poked grimy fingers through the rose cookies. We ran to the first house, waddled to the fifth, often fell asleep at the sixth. We prayed and sang for peace on Earth and hoped a few white lies would pass under the heavenly radar. Like hanging out last year’s Christmas cards on a string across the drawing room, because the postman, disgruntled with his tip, hadn’t delivered enough this year. We stuck tinsel and Santa’s lobbed-off head across the walls, loaded gaudily-wrapped shoeboxes by the tree, till it toppled on to the nearest guest and his fifth glass of ginger wine. Home-made wine and cake recipes, of course, were secrets that not even the Secret Service could pry from the aunties who made them. When I was three, I debuted in a nativity skit, as a shepherd child squished into the choir, clutching an imposter lamb — my teddy bear taped over with cotton — that I kept chewing on in stage fright. One of the three kings had to carry me off, mid-song, with an acute tummy ache from eating all that cotton. Later, travelling and living across India offered many other memorable Yuletides. Bombay, where the grounds outside the church filled up hours earlier, chairs handcuffed by tightly-tied kerchiefs, provoking snarky murmurs of ‘How many chairs will your aunty sit on?’ Calcutta’s cathedral, where people crammed in, 14 to a pew-of-eight, irrespective of caste, creed or Kothai-boshbo – as unavoidably Calcuttan as Liquor- cha afterwards. In Tamil Nadu, gamely singing about white Christmases while fanning away the stifling heat with hymnals, where I witnessed an unholy fist-fight over whosekanjeevaramsari the Mother Mary statue should wear that night. Goan masses, where sermons weren’t long enough or successful enough unless someone fell asleep and snored loudly. Bangalore, where a street dog curled up near baby Jesus in the manger and no one chased it away. And then in a small town on a work trip, sitting through an entire midnight mass in a language I didn’t speak, where people kneeled through three hours, and I ended up praying that they’d get whatever they were praying for. Here’s raising a filter kaapi to a very merrydesiChristmas to you and those you love. Where Jane De Suza, author ofFlyaway Boy, pokes her nose into our perfect lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/dreaming-of-a-desi-christmas/article33369752.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Party on a||I recently realised that I have more plates than essential winter wear. I was rearranging my storage when I discovered eight handmade plates I’d got from a potter in Athens in 2018. Evi Louka had converted her guest bedroom into a studio setting, and she showed me her work, including these hand-painted black and white designs, over a hot cup of coffee. I cannot express how happy I was to see them, carefully wrapped in my sweaters, and I immediately knew what I’d be cooking next — a tapas board with charred leeks, salami, baked avocados, za’atar crusted feta, and fresh tomatoes with cream cheese. It was like a treasure hunt I hadn’t known I was on.  The toast upgrade  I am a trained chef who loves curating and setting tables. Every meal I cook at home is plated beautifully. Even a simple toast with jam, or rice with dal can be made to look special. The plates I collect are all handmade. Perfectly imperfect, they never match. One of the earliest pieces I bought was an eight-inch dessert plate, with bold Calla lilies, from an antique shop in Delhi. I recall the dealer being confused because I’d picked just the one! There is a certain joy in living with objects collected over the years from various parts of the world. In fact, I plan my itineraries around food, local pottery studios and flea markets where you can find amazing tableware. I remember being amazed when I first visited Ray Meeker’s iconic Golden Bridge Pottery (@goldenbridgepottery) in Puducherry. The kiln was majestic, the air filled with sweet smoke, and objects lined on the side in varying shades of brown to charred green. While browsing, I came upon several large, round discs hung from trees and half sunk in the grass, with a full ecosystem formed around them. These antique platters — almost Pollock-like, with their asymmetrical paint and glaze — were sublime, and I knew I had to own one. This treasure now functions as a side table and takes pride of place in my home.  Potters for the picking  It is amazing how there is so much awareness today about pottery. Gone are the days when people used their international holidays to shop for ceramics. Popular events such as the Ceramics Fest in Delhi, the annual Bhopal Potters Market, and the Indian Ceramic Triennale in Jaipur are further opening up this handmade world. The pandemic has also led to a boom in this sector. With many people, including me, using our tableware — of various shapes, colours, materials, glazes, textures, and patterns — to plate up our lockdown cooking, there’s been a spike in curiosity. Ceramists I’ve been in touch with have been busy with orders. Take, for instance, Mandala Pottery (@mandala.pottery) in Puducherry. Run by Adil Writer, one my favourite ceramists — who does art pieces, murals, objects and installations — they have been shipping full table sets to Toronto, Sri Lanka and across India. “We have been swamped and, interestingly, most of the orders have been for first-time clients,” says Writer, who also customises plates for some of India’s most popular restaurants, such as Olive Restaurant & Bar and La Folie Patisserie in Mumbai, and Haiku in Hyderabad. So at the end of a year where I’ve been inundated with questions on where I source my plates from, here is a list of potters and ceramists you must check out.  Plates from Rs. 300 to Rs. 30,000 per piece.   Eeshaan Kashyap is a chef and restaurateur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/party-on-a/article33369790.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Guidebook for party pleasers||These are difficult times, what with the pandemic and Pragya, ragi and Ragini, and what not. One doesn’t know how to behave, what to say, eat or think. Thankfully, those educated in Forwards University can and will tell us How to Behave. We need only listen and learn. And since ‘tis the season to be jolly, dear reader, I thought I should share some Useful Tips before you head for those Sangrias and Sanitiser Slings. 1. The UN has given us many, many awards. Anthem, flower, flag, why, even our lockdown is UN-certified. All this is good for party chit-chat, but if someone quotes the UN saying that “people have a right to demonstrate peacefully and must be allowed to do so,” brush it off. Because, really, that’s not a statement, it’s just a giant typo. 2. You can boast about POTUS following LOTUS. You can Namaste Trump. You can crow about the dosa Kamala made. But if Justin Trudeau says he is “concerned” about Indian farmers, the correct response is: ‘He is ill-informed’. Because Canada has no TV or Internet, and Trudeau can’t possibly know anything. 3. If the talk turns to loud and obnoxious TV anchors making inflammatory remarks or preposterous conspiracy claims, always accept it at face value. Don’t ask questions. These anchors spend fortunes on scriptwriting and throat lozenges, and it is unfair to also expect them to gather facts. Your right response? Sit back, absorb, forward. 4. For heaven’s sake, polish up on prison etiquette and hierarchy. Corporate and political offenders can get kitchenettes, AC and TV, special toilets and even Ganga jal , but all others — old, ill or dying — get nothing. Demanding sipper, slipper, glasses is to display your gaucherie. I strongly recommend online grooming classes. 5. If you want to be a social success, understand who can and cannot be sent to Pakistan. The Send List includes seculars, Muslims, students, non-biddable journalists, non-biddable anybody, meat-eaters, Valentine senders… the list is long. If, however, a cricketer, actor, singer, writer needs to go to Pakistan for a tournament, concert, film, seminar etc, instantly oppose it. Practise in front of the mirror. 6. These days Monopoly is as much a party game as Truth and Bare, and you’ll soon encounter the Get Out of Prison card. Who gets bail and who doesn’t? Journalists can be jailed but only the loudest get bail. Anyone can beat up anybody else, but only masked marauders escape the law’s sharp eyes. If you’re not up to speed on this, at least wave a carrot about because orange, dear reader, is quite the new black. 7. As we said at the start, only Forwards Uni students actually understand stuff, so it’s best you stick to discussing Bollywood Wives at the RWA bash this year. Farmers don’t understand the new Farm Bills, just as the Shaheen Baghers didn’t understand the CAA provisions. Economists haven’t yet understood the real value of demonetisation and environmentalists don’t know that mining helps forests grow. If only people would read their WhatsApp messages properly, we would be a developed nation by now. 8. If you want to up your cool quotient, learn which fan club to sign up for. The top ones today — and we’re not at all sure you’ll get admission — are Kangana Kalling, Vivek’s Villains, Akshay All Out, Amit’s Anti-Nationals and Priti Pestilent. It requires tonnes of butter, some intense name-calling, and a shovel to dig deep down low, but it’s worth it. You’ll be a hit at all online celebrations. 9. Also, brush up on Civics. What is democracy? When does it become Too Much Democracy? This is a trick question. The right answer, duh, is that democracy becomes too much as soon as it begins. The only way a democracy can be a democracy is when one does away with all democratic institutions while simultaneously building a bigger Parliament. Anything else is Way Too Much D-word. 10. Finally, let’s touch upon food. Don’t, for Christ’s sake, order pizza for your year-end party. Of course, no steaks or Bolognese either. Caviar, yes. And Taiwanese mushrooms. But definitely no pizza. Because that, dear reader, would be a vulgar display of wealth. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/guidebook-for-party-pleasers/article33369780.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||How 2020 changed our foodscape||If sharing food and drink has traditionally forged closer social ties, in 2020, the year of physically-distanced, active-on-social media lives, this communal partaking has mutated. TV anchor and actor Mini Mathur, for instance, recently told me (on Insta Live) about a wedding banquet (on Zoom) she and her husband, film director Kabir Khan, had attended, where individual sadyas had been delivered to each of the guests’ homes. As everyone polished off their thoran and olan, and the piece de resistance paal ada pradaman, while they sat decked up in formal wedding wear in homes in different cities and even countries, it was a simulation of togetherness that seemed to work. Eating and drinking have assumed unusual forms in this strange year and, as we have adapted, so has the formats of retail catering to our new lives. As many of our pandemic-induced social behaviours stick well into the new year and beyond, some dining trends will be more visible than ever before.   1. Dining in  It will become not just more innovative but also more luxe, as people rethink the need to have large parties and get togethers. “The thinking, at least in my social circle, has changed. People now feel is there really any need to have 300 people for a party. Something smaller and more intimate can be beautiful and, by implication, more exclusive,” points out hotelier Priya Paul, owner of The Park Hotels. Top restaurants, hotels and chefs have already jumped into the fray to cater to this emerging demand. “With smaller events happening in homes, we have had good business sending our chefs and bartenders to set up at-home dos, and this will continue to be a strong business vertical next year, as lifestyles have changed,” adds Paul.   2. P remium home delivery  Pricey deliveries are betting on quality rather than mass appeal. ITC Hotel’s extensive range of regional pulaos and biryanis launched just this week can be ordered via aggregator apps like Swiggy and Zomato. Priced between Rs. 625 and Rs. 825 for a meal for one, these are not exactly cheap (but more ‘affordable’ than the Rs. 1,800 price tag for a sharing portion at Dum Pukht) and seek to turn on its head the conventional delivery model that had hitherto relied on volume and cheaper pricing. As this niche delivery segment grows, it will be closely watched even by investors seeking newer options. Already, some substantial investments seem to have been made as the year draws to a close. Unconfirmed buzz tells us about a swanky new cloud kitchen to service 10 brands being prepped to launch early next year in Gurugram by the promoters of Tres Ind, the Dubai restaurant. Top chefs who had lost their jobs in the initial months of the pandemic are also responsible for this shift to top quality in deliveries. Forced to the wall, several of them invested their own savings into small delivery kitchens (more affordable to set up than restaurants). Chef Harangad Singh, who had earlier worked at the Taj and Prankster, a popular outlet in Gurugram, started Parat, a small delivery catering royal and street foods, such as Bhopali rezala and tandoor i lamb chops. He soon got a massive following even outside the conventional restaurant environ. “Soon after we launched, a family from Delhi drove 30 km to come pick up the nihari [the chef does it from a whole lamb shank]. But when their daughter saw my small kitchen, she started protesting about how the food could be of high quality in such a small place. So I told them to just stay in their car, while I fed them a meal with all my specials. They were so thrilled that they are my loyal customers today,” says Singh.   3. DIY kits  Dining at home means that people are more cognisant of quality. Prestige DIY kits have come into their own in London and other European cities, and small dinners for friends now sometimes involve cooking signature recipes of top international chefs such as Heston Blumenthal or Massimo Bottura from their kits. Priced at about £100 per head, these need considerable work (often with virtual instructions given live by a member of the chef’s team) before they can be plated. In fact, with restrictions in force in Europe now, publications have been running ‘Top 10]’lists of DIY kits, quite akin to restaurant rankings of the past. The idea of convenience has been overturned in favour of exclusivity, and this is a trend that we will see more of in India too. Already, a beginning has been made with makery.in, launched by siblings Rishiv and Tarika Khattar, children of restaurateur Rohit Khattar who owns Indian Accent. The new business built to leverage e-commerce uses recipes from top restaurants like Indian Accent and Olive, as well as by hand-picked home chefs.   4. Comfort food  Meanwhile, how will restaurants fare? With lockdowns lifted, restaurants in Goa, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi have been coming back to life. As the action picks up in 2021, get set for a spate of new openings as well as established restaurants tweaking their offerings to meet changed behavioural patterns. The shift to comfort food at top restaurants such as Masque in Mumbai and Indian Accent in Delhi is already visible, in keeping with international trends where even the World’s 50 Best are serving burgers. “I had never offered carbs at the end of a meal at Masque Lab, but this is what diners are seeking now. So I have introduced a traditional Kashmiri yakhni , done in my own way, with a miso rice pulao , as the last course,” says chef Prateek Sadhu, pointing out that even comfort food can be inventive, something that chef Manish Mehrotra agrees with — having recently launched a gentrified chaat tasting menu at Indian Accent. “The kind of customers we are getting has changed, and there are new learnings. People want comfort flavours, so I thought ofchaatsbut done in my own style,” says Mehrotra.   5. The chefprenuer  One of the biggest ways in which restaurants of the future may be different from circa 2019, is in that more chefs will take charge of both kitchens and boardrooms. The era of the chefprenuer is here. For years, there had been obvious tension between restaurateurs and chefs — the latter, whose celebrity status was on the make, felt at a disadvantage when it came to decision making, whereas the former feared that the chef may damage the brand by walking away and sought to clip his/her wings. A recent high-profile exit because of rising tensions ostensibly was Thomas Zacharias’ of The Bombay Canteen. Internationally, most luxury restaurants with the chef as the brand, have silent majority investors (and not two competing power centres). In India, a similar dynamic is in the making now, as more investors seek out chefs directly. “The responsibility of the chef had been widening for a while now, and the only thing missing was business acumen and backing from investors. With the pandemic teaching us that we need to take charge, we are learning to run businesses,” says chef Vikramjit Roy, who got into a partnership with shipping scion and beverages connoisseur, Vir Kotak, in the midst of the pandemic, to build a chain of food delivery brands as well as Asian restaurants with elevated bar experiences. “This means we are more responsible for profits but, in the long term, it will mean more stable restaurants than when products and strategies are developed by people sitting in offices.”   Continued on page 4||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/how-2020-changed-our-foodscape/article33369779.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Trix vs the Bangtan Boys||For a musician to get more popular than anything or anyone associated with BTS, the biggest K-Pop band in the world right now, is a feat. With his latest love song, 20-year-old Sanjog Bhushan, or Trix as his music avatar is known, has managed to consistently clock more streams than BTS member Jin. ‘Be With You’, which released on December 2, has approximately 13,000 more streams than ‘Abyss’, a solo track that Jin released late on December 3, a few winks before his birthday. The streams are on SoundCloud, a platform that has worked incredibly well for Trix. The rise of chill tropical Bhushan believes that creating music that is “fresh-sounding rather than something that has been done before” could have something to do with his rising popularity. This is also why his musical leanings are towards chill tropical house, a sub-genre that is less explored in India, compared to trap, drum n bass and of course, trance. That, and the fact that he explores themes of love and heartbreak, definitely adds to his universal appeal. ‘Now That You’re Gone,’ released and produced when Bhushan was only 17, sounds like a love-bruised anthem perfect for a sundowner set. His newfound love is at the centre of ‘Be With You’, a soaring track that you want to wake up to. “Love may very well be the most profound emotion we’ll ever experience,” adds Bhushan, sounding more a poet and less like the ruthless killer he can be on the mobile version of ‘Call of Duty’ (COD). Family ties It definitely helps that there’s music in the family. Bengaluru folk rock band Swarathma’s bassist Jishnu Dasgupta is Bhushan’s cousin — and sounding board. It was also another family member who reached out to an associate working with ace American talent manager Scooter Braun to get a nod for Bhushan to work on a remix for one of Braun’s A list artistes — popstar Ariana Grande. Bhushan was thrilled to hear that Braun was impressed with his remix of ‘One Last Time’, also slated to release sometime next year. Before the ARMY (short for Adorable Representative M.C for Youth), the group of BTS fans across the world, figures out what’s going on, Trix might just up his game.  Read the entire story on weekend.thehindu.com. Trix’s music can be found on SoundCloud.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/trix-vs-the-bangtan-boys/article33369792.ece

A majority of pavements are encroached by tea stalls, shops, parked vehicles and, in some cases, even taken over entirely by commercial establishments. With the pandemic giving a push to outdoor spaces — whether in parks, restaurants, or shopping districts — here’s hoping we see larger, pedestrian-only walkways. Several localities in cities like Bengaluru and Pune restrict the movement of cars and allow cyclists, pedestrians and children to move about freely. These regulations need to be mandatory across cities. It’s time we reclaimed our roads from vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/roads-without-footpaths/article33369806.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Realtors go the proptech way||The process of buying a home, at least in the traditional way, has several steps to it: scouting localities, picking the right configuration, multiple site visits with the family, and a whole lot of paperwork. While tech advancements in real estate entered the Indian market a few years ago, the scale at which they have been put to use has increased since the pandemic hit in March 2020. House visits went digital as did the paperwork and financial transactions. What proptech services have also eliminated is the need for brokers. “You can now access details about a property that a broker might be withholding. The use of AR and VR tools for remote house visits picked up when Covid struck. Although the final transactions occurred after physical visits, these digital tours were instrumental in shaping the customer thought process,” says Pankaj Singh, Founder and CEO, Multiliving Technologies, a realty platform backed by Lodha Ventures.  New tools With these digital tools, one can look at wall colours, decor, amenities, etc. The view is available in both daylight and night light. The offerings, says Singh, “focus on eliminating everyday hassles for a tenant through home management solutions via our app and smart devices. Our app automates maintenance, insurance, and payments, alerting relevant stakeholders as the due date nears. On-demand services, concierges, call-a-cab, etc. can also be availed,” he adds. Kagaay, a gamified sales enablement platform launched last year, has flash sales and e-auctions. Tushar Desai, Chief Technology Officer, says that during a sale, properties are made available at exclusive discount rates for a short period of 24 to 48 hours. “Buyers can grab the deal by paying a 4% to 5% Earnest Money Deposit. Realtors benefit because the inventory is not locked up for long periods and they can get a confirmed sale. At the virtual sales, any financial or non-financial institute can execute the auction.”  Commercial assets In the commercial sector, top players are optimistic about recovery. As per a September report by JLL, titled ‘Optimism in the Face of Crisis,’ nearly 70% of Indian leaders are likely to adopt proptech solutions to respond and adapt to new requirements. Sudarshan Lodha of Strata says the democratisation of newer platforms and newer investment avenues has brought massive shifts in investment preferences that will outlive the pandemic. “Data analytics and digital dashboards to track investments are changing the face of the industry,” says Lodha, who co-founded the Strata realty investment platform that allows investors to own and sell fractions of pre-leased commercial properties. “We aim to make commercial investments accessible to aspiring middle-class and retail investors through a fractional investment model. Our target group is anyone who earns above Rs. 25 lakh annually and most of our investors are in the 30+ age group,” says Lodha, who has currently closed properties in Chennai, Bengaluru, and is looking forward to investments in Mumbai and Hyderabad.  For the non-tech savvy These interventions are no doubt a welcome change, but with a considerable portion of buyers still sticking to traditional methods, how will these players engage them? Singh says that while they offer virtual tours, they are continuing physical visits too for those buyers who prefer it. “However, the dynamics have changed. One has to book a prior appointment, and we limit the number of engagements on a particular day. Having said that, 80% to 90% of our customers are now using digital tools for site visits.” What has also helped is access to data. Data-driven models are coming into the limelight as they help investors analyse, interpret and gain insight into properties and market conditions. This helps build customer trust, explains Lodha. “Now, instead of 50 investors attending a live event, we host webinars for 400-450 investors. During the pandemic, we were able to raise Rs. 140 crore from 18 countries without a single site visit.”  While tech advancements in real estate entered the Indian market a few years ago, the scale at which they have been put to use has increased since the pandemic hit in March 2020||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/realtors-go-the-proptech-way/article33369793.ece
19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||’Tis the season||The most magical time of the year will soon be upon us. If you haven’t set up your tree yet, here are a few ways to get your home festival ready in no time. Red and green are the most popular choices for Christmas décor, but there’s a lot more you can do to set up your home for the holidays than decking the halls with holly. Try these 12 steps for a warm, fuzzy festival. Create a warm welcome Set out a seasonal foot mat in bright colours and add interest to the entryway. Natural elements such as baskets and logs, seasonal décor and lighting fixtures create a festive vibe. Stencil your wreath Everybody hangs a wreath of some sort on their front door at Christmas time. If you want to stand out, try stencilling an unusual wreath on the front door or on a wall in the entryway. Decorate with ornaments You can never overdo the ornaments. So pop them into clear containers and cylinders, pile them in fruit bowls or string them into garlands. Create a holiday display Take over an empty table and book it for your holiday display. Colourful glass ornaments and bottles, candlesticks, pine cones and votives — there’s a lot to choose from. Show off family photos  Christmas is atime for family and friends. Display family photos and Christmas cards by fashioning them into a garland for your banister, mantel or pelmet. Wrap columns with garlands  Columnsin the home and outside lend themselves well to decorations. Loop garlands of all kinds — floral, fabric, traditional, gingerbread, ornaments or lighting — to create stand-out décor. Experiment with paper Who says you can’t decorate with paper? Paper medallions in silver, gold, and bronze add a shot of bling to any space. You can even craft pinwheels in red and green solid or printed paper to add a quirky touch. Go for plaid We all know that red and green are the colours of the season. Why not use the one fabric that brings these two colours together beautifully? Plaid. Try it as a tablecloth, runner or impromptu cushion covers. Try an illuminated centrepiece This centrepiece is sure to be the cynosure of all eyes. Tuck some evergreen branches and dried wood into a pot and festoon with string lights. A shot of glimmer Add a shot of sparkle to any table by showing off sparkly colour-dipped bulbs in a decorative glass bowl. People won’t be able to stop talking about this. Sweet kitchen display Try these easy decorations that you can put together in minutes. String tin cookie cutters of assorted shapes — angels, bells, bows and stars — on pretty ribbons and tack to the kitchen window casing. Make your own snow Dreaming of a white Christmas and don’t see any way to experience it? String up alternating clear glass balls and silver gift bows to create the illusion of falling snow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/tis-the-season/article33369797.ece

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Party on a||I recently realised that I have more plates than essential winter wear. I was rearranging my storage when I discovered eight handmade plates I’d got from a potter in Athens in 2018. Evi Louka had converted her guest bedroom into a studio setting, and she showed me her work, including these hand-painted black and white designs, over a hot cup of coffee. I cannot express how happy I was to see them, carefully wrapped in my sweaters, and I immediately knew what I’d be cooking next — a tapas board with charred leeks, salami, baked avocados, za’atar crusted feta, and fresh tomatoes with cream cheese. It was like a treasure hunt I hadn’t known I was on.  The toast upgrade  I am a trained chef who loves curating and setting tables. Every meal I cook at home is plated beautifully. Even a simple toast with jam, or rice with dal can be made to look special. The plates I collect are all handmade. Perfectly imperfect, they never match. One of the earliest pieces I bought was an eight-inch dessert plate, with bold Calla lilies, from an antique shop in Delhi. I recall the dealer being confused because I’d picked just the one! There is a certain joy in living with objects collected over the years from various parts of the world. In fact, I plan my itineraries around food, local pottery studios and flea markets where you can find amazing tableware. I remember being amazed when I first visited Ray Meeker’s iconic Golden Bridge Pottery (@goldenbridgepottery) in Puducherry. The kiln was majestic, the air filled with sweet smoke, and objects lined on the side in varying shades of brown to charred green. While browsing, I came upon several large, round discs hung from trees and half sunk in the grass, with a full ecosystem formed around them. These antique platters — almost Pollock-like, with their asymmetrical paint and glaze — were sublime, and I knew I had to own one. This treasure now functions as a side table and takes pride of place in my home.  Potters for the picking  It is amazing how there is so much awareness today about pottery. Gone are the days when people used their international holidays to shop for ceramics. Popular events such as the Ceramics Fest in Delhi, the annual Bhopal Potters Market, and the Indian Ceramic Triennale in Jaipur are further opening up this handmade world. The pandemic has also led to a boom in this sector. With many people, including me, using our tableware — of various shapes, colours, materials, glazes, textures, and patterns — to plate up our lockdown cooking, there’s been a spike in curiosity. Ceramists I’ve been in touch with have been busy with orders. Take, for instance, Mandala Pottery (@mandala.pottery) in Puducherry. Run by Adil Writer, one my favourite ceramists — who does art pieces, murals, objects and installations — they have been shipping full table sets to Toronto, Sri Lanka and across India. “We have been swamped and, interestingly, most of the orders have been for first-time clients,” says Writer, who also customises plates for some of India’s most popular restaurants, such as Olive Restaurant & Bar and La Folie Patisserie in Mumbai, and Haiku in Hyderabad.

19 December 2020||December 19 2020 00:00 IST,||Guidebook for party pleasers||These are difficult times, what with the pandemic and Pragya, ragi and Ragini, and what not. One doesn’t know how to behave, what to say, eat or think. Thankfully, those educated in Forwards University can and will tell us How to Behave. We need only listen and learn. And since ‘tis the season to be jolly, dear reader, I thought I should share some Useful Tips before you head for those Sangrias and Sanitiser Slings. 1. The UN has given us many, many awards. Anthem, flower, flag, why, even our lockdown is UN-certified. All this is good for party chit-chat, but if someone quotes the UN saying that “people have a right to demonstrate peacefully and must be allowed to do so,” brush it off. Because, really, that’s not a statement, it’s just a giant typo. 2. You can boast about POTUS following LOTUS. You can Namaste Trump. You can crow about the dosa Kamala made. But if Justin Trudeau says he is “concerned” about Indian farmers, the correct response is: ‘He is ill-informed’. Because Canada has no TV or Internet, and Trudeau can’t possibly know anything. 3. If the talk turns to loud and obnoxious TV anchors making inflammatory remarks or preposterous conspiracy claims, always accept it at face value. Don’t ask questions. These anchors spend fortunes on scriptwriting and throat lozenges, and it is unfair to also expect them to gather facts. Your right response? Sit back, absorb, forward. 4. For heaven’s sake, polish up on prison etiquette and hierarchy. Corporate and political offenders can get kitchenettes, AC and TV, special toilets and even Ganga jal , but all others — old, ill or dying — get nothing. Demanding sipper, slipper, glasses is to display your gaucherie. I strongly recommend online grooming classes. 5. If you want to be a social success, understand who can and cannot be sent to Pakistan. The Send List includes seculars, Muslims, students, non-biddable journalists, non-biddable anybody, meat-eaters, Valentine senders… the list is long. If, however, a cricketer, actor, singer, writer needs to go to Pakistan for a tournament, concert, film, seminar etc, instantly oppose it. Practise in front of the mirror. 6.These days Monopoly is as much a party game as Truth and Bare, and you’ll soon encounter the Get Out of Prison card. Who gets bail and who doesn’t? Journalists can be jailed but only the loudest get bail. Anyone can beat up anybody else, but only masked marauders escape the law’s sharp eyes. If you’re not up to speed on this, at least wave a carrot about because orange, dear reader, is quite the new black. 7. As we said at the start, only Forwards Uni students actually understand stuff, so it’s best you stick to discussing Bollywood Wives at the RWA bash this year. Farmers don’t understand the new Farm Bills, just as the Shaheen Baghers didn’t understand the CAA provisions. Economists haven’t yet understood the real value of demonetisation and environmentalists don’t know that mining helps forests grow. If only people would read their WhatsApp messages properly, we would be a developed nation by now. 8. If you want to up your cool quotient, learn which fan club to sign up for. The top ones today — and we’re not at all sure you’ll get admission — are Kangana Kalling, Vivek’s Villains, Akshay All Out, Amit’s Anti-Nationals and Priti Pestilent. It requires tonnes of butter, some intense name-calling, and a shovel to dig deep down low, but it’s worth it. You’ll be a hit at all online celebrations. 9. Also, brush up on Civics. What is democracy? When does it become Too Much Democracy? This is a trick question. The right answer, duh, is that democracy becomes too much as soon as it begins. The only way a democracy can be a democracy is when one does away with all democratic institutions while simultaneously building a bigger Parliament. Anything else is Way Too Much D-word. 10.Finally, let’s touch upon food. Don’t, for Christ’s sake, order pizza for your year-end party. Of course, no steaks or Bolognese either. Caviar, yes. And Taiwanese mushrooms. But definitely no pizza. Because that, dear reader, would be a vulgar display of wealth. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/guidebook-for-party-pleasers/article33369511.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi House seeks CBI probe into Rs. 2,500-crore ‘scam’ in civic bodies||The Delhi Assembly on Friday passed a resolution by voice vote demanding a CBI inquiry into an alleged Rs. 2,500-crore scam in the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations. Addressing a special session of the Assembly, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the civic bodies’ scam was bigger than the Commonwealth Games scam. He said the Rs. 2,500 crore could have been used to pay the salaries of sanitation workers, doctors and other employees as well as build infrastructure such as hospital or Mohalla Clinics. Mr. Kejriwal said: “People said the municipal corporations are corrupt and that no building is constructed without paying a bribe. The same people when asked about the Delhi government, said it is honest.” He added that the municipal corporation elections were due in one year and Delhiites will decide if they want an AAP model of governance or a BJP model, which has been on display for 15 years at the civic bodies. Addressing the allegation that the Delhi government was not releasing funds to the municipal corporations due to which they were unable to pay salaries, Mr. Kejriwal said the civic bodies have moved the courts over the release of funds and the courts have said all dues have been paid. The Assembly proceeding began with AAP MLAs marching into the well of the House and shouting slogans and holding placards and banners. The House had to be adjourned for 15 minutes after which the detailed discussion began. AAP MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said the BJP had itself admitted that its councillors were corrupt as in 2017. Ahead of the municipal polls, the BJP changed all its sitting councillors as people were unhappy with them, he said. “The new councilors, however, created even more scams than their predecessors,” Mr. Bhardwaj added. Giving an example, the MLA said: “The building department of the corporations is known for corruption and demanding bribes. A BJP councillor was caught red-handed by the CBI for taking Rs. 10 lakh for construction of a building.”   ‘Why opposing motion?’ Mr. Bhardwaj said the fact that the BJP MLAs opposed the motion for a CBI inquiry into the alleged scam in the civic bodies, exposes their lies. “If there is no corruption, then why are they opposing the investigation? Earlier they were claiming that a CBI investigation should take place but now when the Assembly moved the motion, they are opposing it. The BJP is scared that the people of Delhi will get to know the truth about the scam,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-house-seeks-cbi-probe-into-rs-2500-crore-scam-in-civic-bodies/article33369529.ece
19 December 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder hits out at SAD, AAP on farm laws||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said both the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) were a bunch of hypocrites whose double standards on the farm laws had exposed their lack of commitment to the farmers. “AAP and SAD MLAs never say what they mean, and vice versa,” said the Chief Minister in an informal interaction with journalists after the launch of second phase of Punjab Smart Connect Scheme in Mohali. The Chief Minister pointed out that while SAD was party to the introduction of the farm ordinances in the first place, the AAP government in Delhi had been quick to implement one of the farm laws. Hitting out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Capt. Amarinder said the AAP leader had given approval to the black farm laws by notifying one of them in the national capital last month and was now indulging in petty politics over the matter by tearing copies of the central laws. “This shows Kejriwal and AAP have a different face for the people, with totally opposite intentions hidden inside,” said the Chief Minister, slamming the party over its anti-farmer double-faced actions.  Briquetting plant Separately, Capt. Amarinder virtually inaugurated paddy straw-based briquetting plant of 100 tonnes per day capacity in Patiala. Calling it an overdue initiative, the Chief Minister said the new technology will not only help check environmental pollution through gainful utilisation of paddy straw in the State, but will also enable farmers, especially small farmers, earn extra income from the sale of paddy stubble. Expressing confidence that more such plants would come up in the future to ease Punjab’s stubble burning issue, he said the low calorific value of 3,500 for briquettes (as compared with 7,000 for coal) is amply balanced out economically since coal costs Rs. 10,000 per ton as against Rs. 4,500 per ton for briquette. Also, with oil becoming expensive, this is a more viable source of energy, he added. The plant has been set up at village Kulburchan in Patiala district, at a capital cost of Rs. 5.50 crore, by Punjab State Council for Science and Technology in collaboration with Private Partner M/s. Punjab Renewable Energy Systems Pvt. Ltd., with the support of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Govt. of India, under the Climate Change Action Programme.  AAP and SAD MLAs never say what they mean, and vice versa...

19 December 2020||GUWAHATI,||Some Assam Cong. MLAs eyeing BJP||The Congress in Assam, said to be rudderless after the death of former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, could lose a few of its MLAs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) soon. There are reports that at least three Congress legislators, one of them expelled for six years for “anti-party activities”, are likely to don saffron when Union Home Minister Amit Shah visits the State towards the end of December. The speculations were triggered by one of the troika of MLAs, former minister Ajanta Neog’s meeting with Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday. Another MLA, Roselina Tirkey, was seen at a BJP function in eastern Assam’s Golaghat district a few days ago. Ms. Neog represents the Golaghat Assembly constituency while Ms. Tirkey was elected from Sarupathar. The third MLA, Rajdeep Goala, represents southern Assam’s Lakhipur Assembly constituency and was expelled by the Congress in October. “Such theories are flying around. But this implies the BJP has no trust in its own leaders and try to poach from other parties to be in power,” Congress spokesperson Bobbeeta Sarma said. The name of a fourth legislator, Sushanta Borgohain, has been doing the rounds too. However, the Thowrah MLA released a video saying he would not be leaving the Congress. Soon after the 2016 Assembly elections, the Congress had lost its Baithalangso MLA Mansing Rongpi. He quit the Congress and won the seat again on a BJP ticket. The Congress MLAs in discussion are from the tea-growing belts of Assam. The BJP is believed to have weaned the plantation workers, a major vote bank, from the Congress.  Such theories are flying around. But this implies the BJP has no trust in its own leaders and try to poach from other parties to be in power Bobbeeta Sarma Congress spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/some-assam-cong-mlas-eyeing-bjp/article33369516.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||HC seeks replies on pleas to protest at Shah’s house||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought responses from the government and the police on AAP MLAs — Raghav Chadha and Atishi’s — pleas challenging the denial of their request for permission to hold protests outside the residences of Home Minister Amit Shah and L-G Anil Baijal. Justice Navin Chawla issued notices to the Delhi government and the police, and sought their stand on the petitions by the two AAP leaders by January 14. The Delhi Police, represented by Additional Standing Counsel Gautam Narayan, told the court that permissions were denied to the two AAP MLAs on the basis of orders passed by the DDMA, which prohibited large gatherings in view of the prevailing pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-seeks-replies-on-pleas-to-protest-at-shahs-house/article33369521.ece
19 December 2020||New Delhi,||‘If DDMA prohibits gatherings, evict protesters from outside CM’s house’||The High Court on Friday said if the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has prohibited political and other gatherings in the city till December 31 due to COVID-19, then the protesters outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence ought to be evicted. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said that the court expects the police to take appropriate steps to implement the direction of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and also the provisions of Section 144 IPC which has been imposed in the area where the Chief Minister’s residence is located. The court said that if no action is taken for violation of the DDMA direction, then it will send out an “incorrect signal”. “The issue is if the DDMA order prohibits such gathering, then you have to shift them. Rather you have to evict them. Else incorrect signal will go. The District Magistrates have to ensure compliance of the DDMA directions. Compliance with DDMA orders can be ensured only by issuing appropriate directions. Issue directions and if they do not comply, then take action,” the court said to the police during the hearing. The DDMA’s November 28 order prohibits till December 31 all social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, political functions, or other gatherings throughout the national capital to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The court was hearing a plea by the Civil Lines Residents Association, represented by advocate Rohit Bhagat, against the ongoing protest outside the CM’s residence there on grounds that it was blocking the road and causing inconvenience to residents there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/if-ddma-prohibits-gatherings-evict-protesters-from-outside-cms-house/article33369522.ece

He has termed the allegations baseless and devoid of facts Plea by Bidhuri Mr. Bidhuri also sought to urge Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to “rise above all political differences” in the interest of Delhi and talk to the Mayors of the three BJP-led municipal corporations who have been sitting on an indefinite hunger strike outside his house. He said the AAP government should release dues of Rs. 13,000 crore “with immediate effect”. “Till date, no government in Delhi has stopped the money due to the Municipal Corporations. When there was no financial transaction [between the Delhi government and the civic bodies], then where is the scandal? Is the Delhi government making allegations against its own decision to withhold funds to the civic bodies?” he demanded.  Release dues amounting to Rs. 13,000 crore with immediate effect.

19 December 2020||GUWAHATI,||Meghalaya groups issue warning on entry-exit points||Pressure groups in Meghalaya demanding the implementation of inner-line permit (ILP) in the State have threatened to set up entry-exit points for weeding out “unwanted people” on their own if the Conrad Sangma-led alliance government cannot do so, on December 21. The Meghalaya Residents Safety and Security Act (MRSSA), which prescribes a set of documents similar to the ILP, warrants such entry-exit points ostensibly to check influx and establish the identity of those who wish to visit the State. The ILP is a document mandated by the British-era Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 essentially to restrict travel to certain parts of the Northeast. ILP is currently applicable for Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. The Meghalaya government was scheduled to open an entry-exit point in the State’s Ri-Bhoi district on December 16, but the event was deferred to December 21. The delay irritated the influential tribal groups, such as Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) and Federation of Khasi Jaintia and Garo People (FKJGP). “If the government does not open the entry-exit point on December 21, we will do so ourselves to make it functional from that day itself,” KKJGP president Wellbirth Rani said. His KSU counterpart, Lambokstarwell Marngar, said the implementation of ILP was a people’s demand and could prevent the spread of the “Delhi virus”, called the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Meghalaya’s Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong assured there would be no further delay in opening the entry-exit gate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/meghalaya-groups-issue-warning-on-entry-exit-points/article33369517.ece
19 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Sisodia pulls up U.P. Minister for sharing ‘fake’ images of Delhi govt. schools||Instead of accepting a challenge for a debate between the Delhi government’s education model and that of the Uttar Pradesh government, U.P. Minister Sidharth Nath Singh shared edited images to “give a bad name to our schools”, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Friday. He said the U.P. government had nothing to show for development done in the education field and hence tweeted “fake posts that showed four old and edited news clips of Delhi government schools”. Mr. Sisodia, in a press conference, showed each of the images tweeted by Mr. Singh who alleged that the Delhi government schools were in a “poor state”. “When AAP announced it will be contesting the U.P. elections, the BJP Minister got hassled. But when he could not find any negative news about our schools, he started sharing fake news,” Mr. Sisodia said, adding: “There should be an open debate on the Yogi Model of Education vs. Kejriwal Model on December 22 in Lucknow. This debate will be very healthy and meaningful for our democracy. It will also benefit crores of children of Uttar Pradesh and the country.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sisodia-pulls-up-up-minister-for-sharing-fake-images-of-delhi-govt-schools/article33369530.ece
