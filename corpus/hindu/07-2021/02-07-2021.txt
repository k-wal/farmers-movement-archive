02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||9 European nations clear SII jab||Nine European countries have given recognition to the Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India, informed sources said. The confirmation came on Thursday when the European Union (EU) started the “Green Pass” facility, which will allow people vaccinated with an authorised set of vaccines to travel within its zone, covering 27 countries. The nine countries’ move is a “national” move by them and not by the EU, headquartered in Brussels. The EU member-states that have recognised Covishield include Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland and Spain. Estonia has confirmed that it would recognise all the vaccines authorised by the Government of India for travel of Indians, said an informed source. And Switzerland, not a EU member, allows Covishield as Schengen state. Germany’s stand German Ambassador Walter J. Lindner said, “Confirming that a double shot of Covishield is fully recognised by Germany as valid proof of anti-COVID vaccination.” Germany, however, has a travel ban in place for Indians as India has been recognised as a “virus variant country.” “This [confirmation] does nevertheless not modify existing travel or visa restrictions for travellers from areas of concern/virus variant areas,” said Mr. Lindner. The nine European countries’ clearance, however, is unlikely to translate into an automatic clearance of Covishield as an equivalent to the “Green Pass” that recognises Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty, Moderna’s Spikevax, Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which created the authorised list, is yet to include Covishield, which is based on AstraZeneca’s formula, as an acceptable vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covishield-gets-nod-from-nine-european-countries-for-travel/article35089451.ece
02 July 2021||HUBBALLI,||10,000 jobs in Hubballi-Dharwad||Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar has said that big companies, including Aequs and Rajesh Exports, and others will be investing Rs. 25,000 crore in Hubballi-Dharwad which will result in employment opportunities for 10,000 people. Speaking at a programme to distribute free tablets (hand-held computers) to students organised by the Department of Collegiate and Technical Education at Mahila Vidyapeetha in Hubballi on Wednesday, he said that with the creation of new opportunities, students of the region will not have to go to bigger cities looking for jobs “Hitherto, students who completed technical education course were forced to go cities, including Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai and Hyderabad, in search of employment opportunities. Now, with these big companies setting up their branches in Hubballi-Dharwad, students need not have to go outside for jobs,” he said. Mr. Shettar said that the BJP government is trying to get investments, which were hitherto restricted only to Bengaluru, to tier-2 and tier-3 cities in the State and it has achieved success to some extent. The focus is on getting more industries to North Karnataka and accordingly, efforts are being made, he said. The Minister said that the government’s scheme to distribute tablets to students of degree courses and technical courses is aimed at facilitating overall development of students in a competitive world. Students studying in government institutions should shun inferiority complex by upgrading their skills and compete with the rest to bag the available opportunities, he said. Responding to the plea by Principal of Mahila Vidyapeetha Geetha M., the Minister assured her of getting computers for students under the CSR Funds of corporate companies. A total of 440 students received tablets on the occasion. Hubballi-Dharwad Urban Development Authority chairman Nagesh Kalburgi and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/10000-jobs-in-hubballi-dharwad/article35089785.ece
02 July 2021||MANGALURU,||Miyar GP gets own ambulance||Miyar Gram Panchayat in Karkala taluk was given a dedicated ambulance thanks to the initiative of the Cardiology At Doorsteps (CAD) Foundation to mark the National Doctors Day on Thursday. Founder of CAD Foundation Trust Padmanabha Kamath said that the gram panchayat is the first in the entire country to have its own ECG machine, telemedicine unit and a dedicated ambulance. Each member of the panchayat too contributed Rs. 1,000 from salary for the initiative taken up by the foundation, he said. A ceremony to hand over the ambulance was attended among others by Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar and others. An ambulance at the disposal of a local body will go a long way in catering to the healthcare requirements of villagers, Dr. Kamath noted. On the occasion of Doctors Day, Dr. Kamath, an interventional cardiologist and head of the department, Cardiology at KMC Hospital, Mangaluru, said that telemedicine facility has been launched at Honnavalli village in Sringeri taluk and Sanur village in Karkala taluk. The Community Health Centre at Arehalli in Hassain district has been given an ECG machine too from the foundation. CAD Foundation came into being in February 2018 by forming a WhatsApp group comprising doctors to help patients in remote and rural areas of the country by providing ECG machines and telemedicine facility. So far, the foundation has provided more than 375 ECG machines to rural areas in 25 districts installed in primary health centres, community health centres, Janaushadhi Kendras, clinics and hospitals. The group has been able to save over 15,000 lives so far, said Dr. Kamath. Miyar Gram Panchayat president Girish Amin, who facilitated the donation programme, and members of the panchayat were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/miyar-gp-gets-own-ambulance/article35089967.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||In last academic year, only 22% schools had Internet||In the academic year that ended with school closures due to COVID-19, only 22% of schools in India had Internet facilities, according to Education Ministry data released on Thursday. Among government schools, less than 12% had Internet in 2019-20, while less than 30% had functional computer facilities. This affected the kind of digital education options available to schools during the pandemic, as well as plans for hybrid learning in the days ahead. The Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) report collates data from more than 15 lakh schools across the country. As the first wave of COVID-19 entered India in early 2020, schools were closed in mid-March, just weeks before the end of the 2019-20 academic year. The vast majority of the country’s 26 crore schoolchildren have not set foot in a school since then, depending instead on various forms of distance education. Infrastructure access The availability of digital education — whether via live, synchronous teaching on apps like Zoom, or through recorded lectures, emails, WhatsApp or educational apps — was largely dependent on whether schools, teachers and parents had access to the necessary infrastructure. In many States, teachers came to school and taught in their own empty classrooms, using their blackboards and lab facilities, while facing a computer screen that communicated the lessons to their students at home. However, the UDISE+ data makes clear the digital divide, which made this a viable option only in some States. In many Union Territories, as well as in the State of Kerala, more than 90% of schools, both government and private, had access to working computers. In States such as Chhattisgarh (83%) and Jharkhand (73%), installation of computer facilities in most government schools paid off, while in others such as Tamil Nadu (77%), Gujarat (74%) and Maharashtra (71%), private schools had higher levels of computer availability than government schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-last-academic-year-only-22-schools-had-internet/article35089455.ece
02 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Jagan writes to Modi on water row||The water war between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh took a new turn on Thursday with the Chief Minister of the latter State Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy shooting off letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister for Water Resources complaining about water utilisation by Telangana at Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala for power generation. The letter of Mr. Jagan was a sequel to another one written by the Engineer-in-Chief of irrigation of Andhra Pradesh Narayan Reddy to the Krishna River Management Board on Wednesday. In this context, Telangana government stepped up security at all the three reservoirs and also closed the road on the dam at Jurala for traffic near Telangana - Karnataka border. The Telangana government had operated eight units at Srisailam power station on left bank canal to generate 660 MW and releasing in the process 31,000 cusecs of water. The police maintained a strict vigil at the left gate to the project and allowed vehicles and power staff inside after a thorough check. The Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh traded charges against each other in the ongoing tussle between the two States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-writes-to-modi-on-water-row/article35089799.ece
02 July 2021||Vijayawada,||Jagan urges PM to stop Telangana from drawing water illegally from Krishna||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a direction to Telangana to stop illegal drawal of water from the Krishna river for power generation without water release orders from the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), and that Telangana’s unauthorised drawals be accounted for as utilisation by it against the agreed allocation of 299 tmcft. He sought an immediate notification of the jurisdiction of the KRMB and requested the takeover of all the offtakes of the common reservoirs with CISF protection and safeguarding of the interests of Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Jagan said in his letter that Krishna, Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar (NSP) projects were the major common reservoirs catering to the needs of A.P. on the right side and Telangana on the left. The Jurala project located on the upstream in Telangana catered to the needs of Telangana and the Pulichintala and Prakasam barrage on the downstream catered to needs of A.P. The water sharing agreement was concluded during a meeting held in June, 2015. A.P. and Telangana agreed to share 811 tmcft of water allocated to the erstwhile State of A.P. by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-1 at 75% dependability in 512:299 ratio respectively. The States were sharing water in 66:34 on an ad hoc basis by deducting minor irrigation utilisations, evaporation losses and the Godavari diversions. Protocol violation at NSP NSP already had 173.86 tmcft of water which could be used for early kharif . As on June 30, out of 17.36 tmcft of inflows 6.90 i.e., 40% had been used for power generation without authorisation, which prevented the building up of reservoir levels. Every day, 2 tmcft was being drawn by Telangana for power generation. Mr. Jagan said A.P. had brought the illegal drawal of water by Telangana twice to the notice of the KRMB . Telangana started hydel power generation by utilising 30,400 cusecs of NSP water without placing an indent before the KRMB and in violation of the protocol for water drawals. Power generation was incidental to the downstream irrigation requirements and there was no irrigation requirement downstream as on date.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-urges-pm-to-stop-ts-from-drawing-water-illegally-from-krishna/article35089437.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Over 31 lakh students in Karnataka had no access to any device: Survey||While the pandemic suddenly forced students to rely on online mode of learning, around a third of them in Karnataka — 31.27 lakh — did not have access to mobile phones, tablets, computers or any other device needed to attend classes in the 2020-21 academic year. This was one of the findings of a survey conducted by the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) of students from classes one to ten enrolled in both private and government schools. Of the total 1.05 crore students studying in these classes, the department was able to collect responses from 93.01 lakh students. While 33% out of 93.01 lakh did not have access to any device, 40% reported that they did not have access to the internet to attend their online classes. Data was collected towards the end of the 2020-21 academic year, and will be used to frame a strategy to help students get the education they need for the current 2021-22 academic year that began on Thursday. Television and radio remain the most popular media as they are easily accessible. Only 8.65 lakh students, 9.3% of those surveyed, did not have access to either television or radio. The largest number of students with no access to any gadgets were in Ballari district: 2.23 lakh out of the 5.27 lakh students surveyed, the study revealed. V. Anbu Kumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction said that the findings of the survey will be used to develop strategies for students this academic year. “All children who have access to gadgets and the internet will learn through online classes. For the remaining students however, we have decided to develop a comprehensive study methodology by roping in the assistance of their parents,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/over-31-lakh-students-in-karnataka-had-no-access-to-any-device-survey/article35089498.ece

In an hour-long speech to a crowd of thousands at Tiananmen Square, Mr. Xi hailed China’s “national rejuvenation” — a theme he has emphasised since taking over in 2012 and found mention 24 times in his speech — and the leadership of the party, upon which, he said, China’s “success hinges”. He also delivered a strong word of warning, saying China was “not intimidated by threats of force”. “We have never bullied, oppressed, or subjugated the people of any other country, and we never will. By the same token, we will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate us,” he said, adding that “anyone who would attempt to do so will find themselves on a collision course with a great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,” according to the official English translation of the speech. The original language was more vivid, using a Chinese idiom saying those who attempted to do so would collide into the wall and see “their heads broken and blood flowing”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/wont-allow-any-force-to-bully-china-says-xi/article35089453.ece
02 July 2021||GUNTUR,||A.P., TS step up security at Sagar, Srisailam||The water war between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana appears to be hotting up with the authorities of both the States stepping up security on their respective sides at the Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam dams. Tempers have been rising for the last one week over Telangana drawing water from the dams for generating power allegedly in violation of the guidelines in place. ‘Engineers turned away’ The Government of Andhra Pradesh had already flagged its concerns. The State Cabinet had on Wednesday resolved to take it up with the Prime Minister. The Water Resources Minister had even said that the government would not hesitate to retaliate to protect the interests of the State. A tense situation prevailed on Thursday when the engineers from Andhra Pradesh were allegedly turned away by their Telangana counterparts when they approached them to submit memorandums. Police personnel from Guntur were deployed in large numbers at the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam in view of the tense situation. A large posse of police personnel from Telangana was also deployed at the dam. Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Vishal Gunni, visited the dam site and monitored the situation. About 150 Civil, APSP, AR and ANS special forces were deployed at the dam. “The police personnel are present to avoid any untoward incident and we are monitoring the situation every hour. The situation is normal now, and we will continue to monitor it. The DSP and RDO of Gurazala will also be monitoring the situation,” said Mr. Gunni. Special Correspondent writes from Anantapur: The Kurnool district police deployed security personnel at the Srisailam dam to ensure the safety of the structure and were not allowing anybody to go near it. At Srisailam Srisailam Circle Inspector B. Venkata Ramana said that on the Andhra Pradesh side only 10 police personnel had been deployed, and the strength would be increased from Friday with the arrival of additional forces. Telangana too had deployed police personnel in large numbers on its side of the dam on Thursday. A political controversy had erupted with Telangana allegedly drawing water from 806-ft. At RDS right canal The police also deployed personnel at Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme right canal as people of Telangana had been demanding that the work at the site be stopped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-ts-step-up-security-at-sagar-and-srisailam/article35089447.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Only 13.6% of COVID-19 beds occupied in State||With no more than 13.6% of COVID-19 beds (including oxygen and ICU beds) allotted under government quota in hospitals across Karnataka being occupied, as of June 30, private hospitals want the beds they had ceded to the government during the peak of the second wave to be released. This is to ensure that they can treat patients with non-COVID-19 ailments. The beds can be re-alloted if the number of cases go up again in the coming days, according to doctors from private hospitals. However, the government has asked them to wait for some more time as several districts continue to have a high Test Positivity Rate (TPR). As of Wednesday, of the total 42,513 beds (including general, ICU and oxygen beds) allotted under government quota in hospitals (both government and private) in Karnataka, only 5,776 have been occupied. The occupancy is even less in hospitals under BBMP limits with a mere 796 of the total 6,442 beds occupied. In Bengaluru, the BBMP has not referred any patient to private hospitals for treatment under government quota for the last two weeks, doctors said. Karnataka’s seven-day average TPR has come down from 14.27% as of May 31 to 2.35% on June 30. The number of active cases has reduced from 3,13,730 on May 31 to 76,505 on June 30. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) has raised the issue with Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. “We had decided to write to the Health Department requesting them to release the government quota COVID-19 beds. Before that, I met the Minister last week and discussed the issue with him. He has told us to wait for some more time,” PHANA president H.M. Prasanna told The Hindu on Wednesday. “The department can issue an order on releasing the government quota beds only after the TPR falls below 5% in all districts. Currently Kodagu, Mysuru, Hassan and Dakshina Kannada have a TPR ranging from 5% to 7.5%. Hence, we plan to wait till July 5 before writing to the government,” Dr. Prasanna said. He said although demand for beds for non-COVID-19 ailments is under control, hospitals will suffer a loss if the government quota beds remain vacant for a long time. “Private hospitals have not got any referrals from the government for the last two weeks. With Karnataka being unlocked, we are now expecting a huge rush of patients who had postponed their hospital visits for elective procedures and other non-COVID-19 follow-ups.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/only-136-of-covid-19-beds-occupied-in-state/article35089492.ece
02 July 2021||MANGALURU,||Govt. provides further lockdown relaxations in Dakshina Kannada||The State government on Thursday placed Dakshina Kannada among Category I districts and provided further relaxations from COVID-19 lockdown norms and permitted additional activities till Monday morning. The Principal Secretary to Government (Revenue-disaster management) and Member Secretary to State Executive Committee has in his order said that the relaxation was given following consistent declining trend of the case positivity rate in the district after assessing the weekly moving average positivity rate as on June 30. Additional activities permitted for Category I districts, including extended relaxation hours between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m., will be available in Dakshina Kannada with immediate effect. However, weekend curfew, starting at 7 p.m. Friday till 6 a.m. Monday, will be enforced like in any other district. Weekend curfew Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V.

No other activity, including operation of buses, is allowed during weekend curfew, he clarified. Permitted activities As per the June 19 order of the State government, all kinds of activities, essential as well as non-essential, can be taken up in districts where positivity rate is less than 5% between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. Night curfew will be in place between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. Operation of buses with 50% capacity, consumption of food in non-AC eateries with 50% capacity, opening of parks, construction activities, taxis and autorickshaws with two passengers, etc., are some of the important activities permitted between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. All these relaxations, however, will be applicable only for Friday in Dakshina Kannada as the next two days fall under weekend curfew and the government will come out with fresh guidelines on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-provides-further-lockdown-relaxations-in-dakshina-kannada/article35089969.ece

02 July 2021||CHENNAI,||IIT professor resigns, alleges caste discrimination||A qualified faculty member of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras resigned alleging caste discrimination. His mail to other faculty members was widely circulated social media on Thursday. Vipin Pudiyath Veetil, an assistant professor in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, had sent out the mail, alleging that he had been discriminated against because of his caste ever since he joined the institute in 2019. “The discrimination came from individuals in positions of power irrespective of their claimed political affiliations and gender,” he wrote. He said he was leaving the IIT for another institution because of this, and he would “pursue appropriate actions to address the matter”. ‘Constitute committee’ In his mail, he suggested that the institute constitute a committee to study the experience of Scheduled Caste and Other Backward Class faculty members. He said those who were discriminated against might benefit by filing complaints with the committee at the institute and moving courts. He ended his mail with a rhetoric: “Societies progress one small step at a time, or do they?” According to the institute website, Mr. Veetil, a post-doctoral faculty member in the Department of Economics, completed his schooling in China and bachelor’s in economics at Hindu College, Delhi University. He has spent time in institutions in Europe and then earned his Ph.D. at George Mason University in the U.S. He has published several papers in peer-reviewed journals, and three are awaiting release. In 2020, he co-authored an analysis of the economic cost of the COVID-19 lockdown across the world. While the institute refrained from talking to the media, ChintaBAR, an organisation of students on the campus, has taken to social media alleging that the IITs have been in the news recently for caste discrimination against students and persistent violation of reservation norms in the admission to Ph. D. programmes. ChitaBAR said it had been demanding functional Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Class cells in the institute to expand the scope of the grievance redress mechanism to cover discrimination in the departments. It called for an inquiry into the resignation of Mr. Veetil. Neither Mr. Veetil nor the institute official in charge of the grievance redress mechanism responded to messages or calls. The head of the Department of Economics, Jyotirmaya Tripathy, said it would be improper on his part to comment on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/iit-professor-resigns-alleges-caste-discrimination/article35089588.ece

The activist-turned-politician, who represents the Sibsagar Assembly constituency, was discharged in the first case on June 25. He was in jail since December 2019. “The court has proven that the government’s charges against me were bogus. This is a historic day for the Indian judiciary,” Mr. Gogoi said. The cases against Mr. Gogoi were registered on the basis of two FIRs lodged with the Chabua police station in Dibrugarh district and the Chandmari police station in Guwahati. The Chandmari case had the additional charge that he had links with a Maoist organisation. The NIA had pursued the cases filed under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPA) for alleged criminal conspiracy, sedition, promoting enmity between groups on grounds such as religion, race and language, assertions against national integrity, and support to a “terrorist organisation”. “A case was filed against me for my links with CPI [Maoist].

Fifteen elephants had died at the time of the formation of the committee and five more died by the end of 2020. Sheker Kumar Niraj, then Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), was the chairperson of the committee, which had six other members, including elephant experts Ajay Desai and N. Sivaganesan. It was asked to submit an evaluation report in six months. A senior official of the Department, who was asked to facilitate the committee, told The Hindu that it did not submit the report. While Mr. Niraj was transferred from the post to Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Special Secretary (Forests), Environment and Forests Department, a key member — Mr. Desai — passed away in November. There was no replacement. The Department formed a second committee with 11 experts on July 4, 2020, to study the elephant population and its movement in Tamil Nadu from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2020. Mr. Niraj was tasked to head the committee, with S. Anand, District Forests Officer, Madurai, being the member-secretary. This committee had all the seven members of the first one, and Mr. Anand and three others as additional members. The Department had asked the committee to submit a report by December 31, 2020, after looking into the state of the habitats, estimation of the cost of restoring them, the human-wildlife conflict and the measures needed to minimise it and the pattern of births and deaths. COVID-19 a hindrance A senior official of the Forest Department said no data were provided by field officials for the study, and COVID-19 had become a hindrance to field visits. A member of both committees said no field work had been undertaken. S. Yuvaraj, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and head of the Forest Force, and Syed Muzammil Abbas, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, did not comment when contacted.

Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan passed the interim order on a petition filed by P.M. Mohammed Salih, a resident of Amini Island. According to him, the stamp duty for the transfer of an interest of the landed property had been drastically increased from 1% to 6% for females, 7% for a jointly owned property by male and female and 8% for others of the total valuation of the landed property. The stamp duty rate was 1% earlier and there was no division based on caste or gender.

02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Normal rainfall likely in July||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said the monsoon is unlikely to recover significantly until the second week of July. Currently, it is stalled and has not progressed into much of northwest India in spite of a very strong start in June. This hiatus could affect sowing in northwest India. In a monthly update, the IMD on Thursday forecast rainfall for July over the country as a whole to “most likely be normal” (defined as being 96 to 104% of the historical average). July and August are the rainiest monsoon months, contributing over two-thirds of the rainfall and, therefore, critical to kharif crop sowing in most of the country. Until June 19, monsoon rainfall was exceptionally high, with the average rainfall exceeding 40% of what is normal, and since then, rainfall has been declining. 6% more than normal In June, India normally gets 17.5 cm of rainfall, but this year, it has been 18.7 cm, or 6% more than normal. The IMD said the monsoon had covered most of the country except parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, and this was unlikely to happen until July second week. The key reasons for that were neutral El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions that were likely to continue over the equatorial Pacific Ocean and that there was a enhanced possibility of development of negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions over the Indian Ocean during July-September. Both of these related to sea surface temperatures and currently seemed unfavourable to abetting the monsoon progress. Last year, too, the monsoon had a strong start but faltered in July, leading to one of the driest in the last five years. However, this was followed by excessive rains in August and September. In June, the IMD said monsoon rains would be 101% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm. Note to agriculturists IMD Director-General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said, “Agriculturists carrying out rice transplanting in northwest India should be careful as no significant monsoon rain is expected this week. There are also no convective systems forming in the Bay of Bengal and this is unlikely until July second week”. Historically, the monsoon covered the entire country by July 8, and within that, there was a week’s buffer, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/normal-rainfall-likely-in-july/article35089167.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Army working to deal with drone threat’||Army chief Gen. Manoj Naravane on Thursday said that with the easy availability of drones, they would be increasingly used in all sorts of combat, both by state and non-state actors, and capabilities were being developed to deal with them. On the Ladakh stand-off, he said the situation on the ground had been normal since February and talks were on with China at different levels that had helped build trust between the two sides. His comments came after explosions last Sunday at the Jammu Air Force station, which were believed to have been carried out using drones, the first such attack in the country. “We are seized of this problem. We have put in place certain measures. All our troops on the ground have been sensitised for this evolving threat and we are developing capabilities to deal with that, whether by state-sponsored or by states themselves. We are developing capabilities to deal with the drone threat both in the kinetic and non-kinetic realm,” Gen. Naravane said at a webinar organised by Global Counter-Terrorism Council in association with the Department of Defence Production. He stated that they were catering to both the offensive use of drones and defensive measures or the counter-drone systems to prevent attacks on any critical installations whether by state or non-state actors. On the stand-off in Eastern Ladakh, he noted that the situation had been normal since the disengagement in February from the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso (lake) as well as the Kailash ranges. “Since then, both sides have strictly adhered in letter and spirit to the disengagement that was agreed upon,” he observed. LoC situation The two sides were engaged at different levels — political, diplomatic and military. “This has helped build trust between the two sides and going ahead we are sure we will be able to resolve all the remaining issues,” he said. On the situation along the Line of Control (LoC), he said that since the ceasefire understanding between the Directors-General of Military Operations of India and Pakistan in February, the situation in Jammu and Kashmir had seen improvement. There had been little to no infiltration, he said. Stressing the need to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related technologies, he stated that this would require simplified procedures. “Unfortunately, this has been one of our biggest stumbling blocks. The transition to the digital age is contrarian to Defence Procurement Procedure and Defence Procurement Manual mindsets.” In order to harness technologies like AI, exploit the depth in IT and realise the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, we need to shed old mindsets and make our procedures more flexible and adaptive, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-working-to-deal-with-drone-threat/article35089184.ece
02 July 2021||MUMBAI,||DCGI nod sought for ZyCoV-D||Zydus Cadila said it has applied to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for ZyCoV-D, its plasmid DNA vaccine to counter COVID-19. It will be the world’s first plasmid DNA vaccine for COVID-19, the company said. The company had conducted clinical trials at over 50 centres in India, it said. Phase III clinical trials had been conducted on over 28,000 volunteers. This was the first time that any COVID-19 vaccine had been tested in adolescent population in the age group of 12-18 years in India. “Around 1,000 subjects were enrolled in this age group and the vaccine was found to be safe and very well tolerated. The tolerability profile was similar to that seen in the adult population,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, at a briefing. “Our vaccine has attained primary efficacy of 66.6% for symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases in the interim analysis. No moderate case of COVID-19 disease was observed in the vaccine arm post administration of the third dose, which suggests 100% efficacy for moderate disease.” He said no severe cases or deaths had been reported after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. “ZyCoV-D had already exhibited a robust immunogenicity, tolerability and safety profile in the adaptive Phase I/II clinical trials carried out earlier. Both the Phase I/II and Phase III clinical trials have been monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),” Mr. Patel said. “The plug and play technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based is ideally suited for dealing with COVID-19, as it can easily be adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring,” he said. Delta variant The vaccine, he said, had the capability to prevent the Delta variant. “This breakthrough marks a key milestone in scientific innovation and advancement in technology. As the first ever plasmid DNA vaccine for human use, ZyCoV-D has proven its safety and efficacy profile in our fight against COVID-19. The vaccine, when approved, will help not only adults but also adolescents in the 12 to 18 years age group,” he said. The company said it had also evaluated a two-dose regimen for ZyCoV-D vaccine using a 3 mg dose per visit, and the immunogenicity results had been found to be equivalent to the current three-dose regimen. Needle-free applicator The vaccine will come with PharmaJet, a needle-free applicator that will ensure painless intradermal vaccine delivery. This would cost extra. The company has not revealed the price of the vaccine or the applicator. Mr. Patel said the company had made an investment of Rs. 500 crore for this project, including the manufacturing unit, and it planned to make 10-12 crore doses annually. By December, it targeted to produce 5 lakh doses, with a run rate of 1 crore doses per month from August. The gap between first and second dose is 28 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dcgi-nod-sought-for-zycov-d/article35089198.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Anshu Prakash case: SC rejects Delhi Police plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined a Delhi Police appeal against a High Court order, which directed it to share a witness’s statement with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and 11 other AAP MLAs in a case relating to the alleged assault on the then Delhi Chief Secretary, Anshu Prakash, at a February 2018 meeting. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah cut short the police’s line of argument that the statement cannot be shared with the accused. “You, as an investigating agency, cannot pick and choose. An investigating agency has to abide by the duty to be fair. If the statement [of the former adviser] has been recorded, why can’t you give a copy,” Justice Chandrachud asked Additional Solicitor-General Aman Lekhi, appearing for the police. V.K. Jain statement Mr. Lekhi said the statement of V.K. Jain, who claimed to have attended the 2018 meeting, was part of the case diary and need not be shared. “The statement was only reflected in the case diary,” Justice Shah said, stressing that Mr. Jain’s written statement had an existence independent of the case diary. Justice Chandrachud said the police were merely raising “technical” grounds and should rely on common sense to give the accused a copy of the statement in order to fulfil the objective of a fair trial. The High Court decision had upheld an accused’s right to fair trial. “For you, this may be a political hot potato, but it is nothing for us legally... This is not worth it,” he orally observed. Mr. Kejriwal, in his plea before the High Court, accused the prosecution of withholding the statement of Mr. Jain because it did not suit the prosecution case.  Mr. Jain, in the 2018 statement, stated that the meeting between the AAP leaders and Mr. Prakash was on the issue of the “doorstep delivery of ration, advertisement funds release and the slow processing of files”. During the meeting, Mr. Jain stated that he went to the washroom and upon returning, saw Mr. Prakash leaving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anshu-prakash-case-sc-rejects-delhi-police-plea/article35089172.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI condemns attacks on doctors||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Thursday condemned the brutal attacks on doctors who have stood like a rock between the COVID-19 virus and thousands of emotionally and physically vulnerable patients confined to isolation in hospital wards during the pandemic.  “Why is it that the medical professionals are at the receiving end for someone else’s failure? Issues such as insufficient number of medical professionals, infrastructure, medicines, outdated technologies, and government not giving priority to medical sector are issues of immediate concern,” Chief Justice Ramana said in his speech on Doctors’ Day at the launch of Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India’s ‘Defeat Diabetes Campaign’. The CJI highlighted the Indian Medical Association’s data that over 798 doctors died in the second wave. “This decade is defined by the healing touch and the sacrifices made by our doctors … When thousands of physically and emotionally vulnerable patients stood isolated in their hospital wards, it was the doctors who kept hope alive even in times of despair,” he said, adding that it was disheartening to find many qualified doctors struggling to earn a decent salary after years of hard work. Yet, doctors are blamed for the profiteering streak of corporates. “The medical bodies and agencies concerned in the government have to put their heads together to address these concerns. Only then can we sincerely greet the doctors on the first of July every year,” the CJI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cji-condemns-attacks-on-doctors/article35089186.ece
02 July 2021||Geneva,||All WHO-approved jabs must be recognised for travel: UN||The World Health Organization said Thursday that any COVID-19 vaccines it has authorised for emergency use should be recognised by countries as they open up their borders to inoculated travellers. The move could challenge Western countries to broaden their acceptance of two apparently less effective Chinese vaccines, which the UN health agency has licensed but most European and North American countries have not. In addition to vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Inc., AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, the WHO has also given the green light to the two Chinese jabs, made by Sinovac and Sinopharm. In its aim to restore travel across Europe, the European Union said in May that it would only recognise people as vaccinated if they had received shots licensed by the European Medicines Agency — although it is up to individual countries if they wish to let in travellers who have received other vaccines, including Russia’s Sputnik V. The EU drug regulator is currently considering licensing China’s Sinovac vaccine, but there is no timeline on a decision. “Any measure that only allows people protected by a subset of WHO-approved vaccines to benefit from the reopening of travel ... would effectively create a two-tier system, further widening the global vaccine divide and exacerbating the inequities we have already seen in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines,” a WHO statement said on Thursday. “It would negatively impact the growth of economies that are already suffering the most.” Reduces risk The WHO said such moves are “undermining confidence in life-saving vaccines that have already been shown to be safe and effective.” In its reviews of the two Chinese vaccines, the UN health agency said both were found to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalisations and deaths. The two Chinese shots are “inactivated” vaccines, made with killed coronavirus, whereas the Western-made shots are made with newer technologies that instead target the “spike” protein that coats the surface of the coronavirus. Though Western countries have largely relied on vaccines made in the U.S. and Europe, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, many developing countries have used the Chinese-made shots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-who-approved-jabs-must-be-recognised-for-travel-un/article35089200.ece
02 July 2021||New Delhi,||Defence service workers barred from strike||The Union Law Ministry late on Wednesday notified an Ordinance that prohibited employees engaged in essential defence services from taking part in any agitation or strike. The Essential Defence Services Ordinance, 2021, comes in the backdrop of major federations affiliated with the 76,000 employees of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) making an announcement that they would go on indefinite strike from July 26 in protest against the government’s decision to corporatise the OFB. The notification stated that President Ram Nath Kovind “is satisfied that circumstance exists for the Ordinance as Parliament is not in session”. “Any person, who commences a strike which is illegal under this Ordinance or goes or remains on, or otherwise takes part in, any such strike, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to one year, or with fine, which may extend to Rs. 10,000, or both,” the Law Ministry notification said. The notification added that anyone instigating or inciting others to take part in a strike declared illegal under the Ordinance shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term that may extend up to two years, apart from having to pay fines. The gazette notification said employees involved in the production of defence equipment, services and operation, or maintenance of any industrial establishment connected with the military, as well as those employed in the repair and maintenance of defence products, would come under the purview of the Ordinance. Following the Cabinet decision, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said there would be no change in the service conditions of employees of the OFB, and the decision was aimed at boosting India’s defence manufacturing sector. On June 16, the Union Cabinet approved a long-pending proposal to restructure the nearly 200-year-old Ordnance Factory Board — operating 41 ammunition and military equipment production facilities — into seven State-owned corporations to improve its accountability, efficiency and competitiveness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/defence-service-workers-barred-from-strike/article35089174.ece
02 July 2021||Srinagar,||Won’t link J&K polls with statehood: Lone||People’s Conference (PC) chairman Sajad Lone said that he would not link elections with the restoration of statehood, reflecting a willingness to follow the Centre’s timeline of holding elections after the delimitation process in Jammu and Kashmir and restoring statehood later. “I would say that the statehood should be restored now. Not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of right. I wouldn’t link elections with statehood,” Mr. Lone said. Unlike National Conference’s Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party’s Mehbooba Mufti, who have decided not to contest elections in the Union Territory but only in the State of J&K, Mr. Lone said, “I will not say that I will myself boycott the elections and the party will contest. We all are equal.” On the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24, Mr. Lone said: “There are no winners and losers. It is a long process.”  Mr. Lone’s party has come under criticism from Gupkar Alliance leaders for failing to raise the issue of Article 370 with the PM and describing it as sub judice . Mr. Lone, who quit the Gupkar Alliance earlier this year, said he was ready to be part of the delimitation process if invited.  ‘Increasing void’ At a separate meeting, Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari also demanded early elections without any rider of statehood. “The void between the people and government institutions is increasing exponentially in the absence of an elected government ... People are being pushed from pillar to post, while their pressing issues go unnoticed. The only panacea to end their sufferings at the grassroots level is to give them a representative form of government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wont-link-jk-polls-with-statehood-lone/article35089189.ece
02 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC gives a pat on the back for stray dogs||The Delhi High Court has directed that every Resident Welfare Association (RWA) should form “Guard and Dog partnerships” in consultation with the Delhi Police Dog Squad, so that dogs can be trained to work as guard dogs and yet be friendly to residents of a colony. Justice J.R. Midha issued a slew of directions on the contentious issue of feeding stray dogs. The High Court said stray or street dogs have the right to food and citizens have the right to feed them, but in exercising this right, care and caution should be taken to ensure that it does not impinge upon the rights of others. ‘Duty to feed’ The High Court also ruled that it should be “the duty and obligation of every RWA or municipal corporation (in case RWA is not available) to ensure that every community dog in every area has access to food and water in the absence of caregivers or community dog feeders”. Feeding of community dogs has to be done in areas designated by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) in consultation with RWA or municipal corporation. While determining the “designated area”, it has to be kept in mind that “every dog is a territorial being, and therefore, the street dogs have to be fed and tended to at places within their territory which are not frequented, or less frequented, and sparingly used by the general public and residents”, it said. Stray dogs are protected under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and rules enacted under Section 38 of the Act, particularly the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, which makes it illegal for an individual, RWA or estate management to remove or relocate dogs. A 2006 Office Memorandum of the Central government carried specific rules against government servants who indulge in acts of cruelty to animals. The rules make the government servant liable for action under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. “Such acts of defiance be noted down in the ACR (annual confidential report) files of government employees. If any such complaint is received by AWBI, the same be sent to the office concerned for being placed in the ACR file of the government employee for necessary action as per CCS rules,” the High Court ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-gives-a-pat-on-the-back-for-stray-dogs/article35089202.ece
02 July 2021||New Delhi,||Left parties greet CPC; BJP, Congress silent||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress avoided sending any congratulatory message to the Communist Party of China (CPC) that marked its centennial foundation day on Thursday, but the Left parties sent their greetings. Following last year’s violent clashes between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley, political relations between the two national parties and the CPC have taken a hit. While the BJP had sent its greetings to the Vietnamese Communist Party on its 13th party Congress this February, it did not do so for the centenary celebrations of the Communist Party of China. Senior Congress leaders, too, maintained that the “current political atmosphere does not allow political pleasantries between the two parties”. However, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote to Xi Jinping, the Chinese Premier and general secretary of the CPC, in which he said that the history of the last century holds testimony to the manner in which China has evolved its policies, often identifying and correcting its mistakes. “The CPI(M) continues to underline that Marxism-Leninism is a creative science. It is supremely anti-dogmatic. It can never be reduced to a set of formulae,” Mr. Yechury wrote. He also applauded China for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, the CPI(M) leader said, came at a time when the global economy was already slowing down and moving towards recession. “International finance capital-led imperialist neoliberal globalisation is showing its total bankruptcy in providing any solution,” Mr. Yechury wrote. CPI general secretary D. Raja also commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for leading China to become a major economic power, to intervene and cooperate on any international development. He also applauded China for its handling of the pandemic and extending help to other countries. While appreciating the all-round development of China, Mr. Raja, however, sounded a word of caution on the current strained Indo-China relationship. The border dispute that had been going on since India’s Independence needed to be solved, Mr. Raja said. “We do believe we have to solve this problem now through peaceful means so that our both countries can play a meaningful role to realise the peace and stability in the region and work together for the establishment of an equitable global order in international relations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/left-parties-greet-cpc-bjp-congress-silent/article35089193.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||ED attaches sugar plant linked to Ajit Pawar||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth Rs. 65.75 crore in a money laundering case related to the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB). The properties, which include land, building, plant and machinery of Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana in Satara, are currently held in the name of Guru Commodity Services Private Limited and leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills. “Sparkling Soil Private Limited is holding majority shares of Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Private Limited. Investigation revealed that Sparkling Soil Private Limited is a company related to Ajit Pawar, Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and Sunetra Ajit Pawar,” said the ED in a statement on Thursday. The probe is based on a FIR registered on August 26, 2019, by the Economic Offence Wing of Mumbai Police. It was alleged that the Sahkari Sugar Karkhanas (SSKs) were fraudulently sold by the then officials and directors of the MSCB at throwaway prices to their relatives and private persons without following the due procedure prescribed under the SARFAESI Act. “Investigation conducted under the PMLA [Prevention of Money Laundering Act] revealed that the MSCB conducted auction of Jarandeshwar SSK in year 2010 at undervalued price and without following due procedure. Ajit Pawar was one of the prominent and influential members of board of directors of MSCB at the relevant time,” said the ED. The SSK was bought by Guru Commodity Services Private Limited and immediately leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills, which is currently operating the Jarandeshwar SSK. The major part of the funds used towards purchase of the said SSK was received from Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Private Limited, which received the same from Sparkling Soil, a company related to Ajit Pawar and his wife, the ED alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-sugar-plant-linked-to-ajit-pawar/article35089929.ece
02 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Tidal wave washes away portion of Odisha village||Panic gripped the fisherfolk of Ramayapalli village in Odisha’s Ganjam district after portions of houses were washed away by a tidal wave. Ramayapalli has been facing the threat of tidal surge for the last 14 years, with the Bay of Bengal menacingly marching towards the mainland. “This week, a tidal surge washed away one concrete house, while the road was damaged beyond repair. We are spending sleepless nights,” said K. Dilesh of Ramayapalli. In the past one decade, the sea surge has resulted in submergence of the beach and is a few feet away from erasing the village from the map. A few years ago, the Ganjam district administration facilitated the rehabilitation of villagers about 500 metre into the mainland. While a majority of them opted to move away, some continued to stay back for fishing. Mr. Dilesh alleged that though the government had promised to come up with a guard wall to prevent erosion of Ramayapalli, it was yet to see the light of day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tidal-wave-washes-away-portion-of-odisha-village/article35089685.ece

The amount, equivalent to about Rs. 17.25 crore, was parked in a London bank account opened in her name at the instance of her brother. Full disclosure In January this year, Ms. Modi and her husband, Maiank Mehta, were allowed by a special court to become approvers in the case on the condition that they would make a full and true disclosure. The agency had earlier filed a chargesheet each in the case in May 2018 and February 2019, in which Ms. Modi and her husband were listed as accused. On June 24, she informed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that she had come to know about the London account opened in her name and that the funds did not belong to her. “As Purvi Modi was allowed tender of pardon on conditions of making full and true disclosure, Ms. Modi remitted an amount of $23,16,889.03 from her U.K. bank account to the bank account of the Government of India, Enforcement Directorate,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/niravs-sister-transfers-rs-1725-cr-to-govt-account/article35089163.ece

Sanjeev Kumar Sharma assumed office as the Deputy Chief of the Army Staff (Strategy). Air Marshal Chaudhari was commissioned into the fighter stream of the Air Force on December 29, 1982, and has a flying experience of more than 3,800 hours on a wide variety of fighter and trainer aircraft, an IAF statement said.

A Bench led by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana prima facie said the court cannot legislate. “It is the prerogative of the House... We cannot fix time limits,” the Bench said. The Bench, however, gave the lawyer for the petitioner, Ranajit Mukherjee, time to study a judgment of the Supreme Court in the Karnataka MLAs’ case on the point. The Karnataka judgment of 2019 had said Speakers who cannot veer away from their constitutional duty to remain neutral do not deserve the chair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cannot-fix-time-limit-in-defection-pleas-says-sc/article35089170.ece

The party, in a statement here, said the government claimed that only four public sector units must remain in the strategic sector. The 41 Indian ordnance factories were being converted into seven corporations. The Ordinance had been brought to crush strikes, the last available option for the unions. “This is draconian and against the legal right of the employees,” CPI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/withdraw-draconian-ordinance-says-cpi/article35089175.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Nine European nations clear SII jab||The nine European countries’ clearance, however, is unlikely to translate into an automatic clearance of Covishield as an equivalent to the “Green Pass” that recognises Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty, Moderna’s Spikevax, Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which created the authorised list, is yet to include Covishield, which is based on AstraZeneca’s formula, as an acceptable vaccine. The nine countries’ move showed that some EU member-states are making individual policies that are suitable to their health and international requirements. Air France has declared that Indian passengers who have taken doses cleared by the EMA are required to undergo seven days of “mandatory quarantine”. “These passengers must present a COVID-19 vaccination certificate demonstrating that at least four weeks have elapsed since the first dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine, or two weeks have elapsed since the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccine, or since the first dose of these vaccines if the passenger holds proof that they previously have been infected with COVID-19,” said Air France, laying down the domestic requirement, which places additional conditions on even those Indian passengers who have taken doses of the vaccines meant for the “Green Pass”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covishield-gets-nod-from-nine-european-countries/article35089178.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||In last academic year, 22% schools had Internet||The vast majority of the country’s 26 crore schoolchildren have not set foot in a school since then, depending instead on various forms of distance education. The availability of digital education — whether via live, synchronous teaching on apps like Zoom, or through recorded lectures, emails, WhatsApp or educational apps — was largely dependent on whether schools, teachers and parents had access to the necessary infrastructure. In many States, teachers came to school and taught in their own empty classrooms, using their blackboards and lab facilities, while facing a computer screen that communicated the lessons to their students at home. However, the UDISE+ data makes clear the digital divide, which made this a viable option only in some States. In many Union Territories, as well as in the State of Kerala, more than 90% of schools, both government and private, had access to working computers. In States such as Chhattisgarh (83%) and Jharkhand (73%), installation of computer facilities in most government schools paid off, while in others such as Tamil Nadu (77%), Gujarat (74%) and Maharashtra (71%), private schools had higher levels of computer availability than government schools. However, in States such as Assam (13%), Madhya Pradesh (13%), Bihar (14%), West Bengal (14%), Tripura (15%) and Uttar Pradesh (18%), less than one in five schools had working computers. The situation is worse in government schools, with less than 5% of Uttar Pradesh’s government schools having the facility. The connectivity divide is even starker. Only three States — Kerala (88%), Delhi (86%) and Gujarat (71%) — have Internet facilities in more than half their schools. This will make it hard for most schools to implement the options for hybrid learning as schools try to re-open with staggered attendance post the pandemic. More encouragingly, 90% of schools across the country have facilities for handwashing, which will gain added importance as they implement COVID-19 safety protocols while reopening. More than 80% of schools conducted medical check-ups during the year before the pandemic. Temperature testing and monitoring of symptoms need to become a daily activity, according to the Centre’s heath protocol for schools wishing to reopen. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) improved in 2019-20, with 98% of students in Classes 1-8 attending school, though the GER for secondary and senior secondary students stood at 78% and 51% respectively. The dropout rate at secondary level was 17% in 2019-20, with experts warning that dropouts are likely to surge due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-last-academic-year-22-schools-had-internet/article35089180.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Akhil Gogoi freed in CAA violence case||The cases against Mr. Gogoi were registered on the basis of two FIRs lodged with the Chabua police station in Dibrugarh district and the Chandmari police station in Guwahati. The Chandmari case had the additional charge that he had links with a Maoist organisation. The NIA had pursued the cases filed under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPA) for alleged criminal conspiracy, sedition, promoting enmity between groups on grounds such as religion, race and language, assertions against national integrity, and support to a “terrorist organisation”. “A case was filed against me for my links with CPI [Maoist]. In another case, I was charged with inciting violence during the anti-CAA agitation. The court proved these were fake charges that kept me in jail for more than a year and a half,” Mr. Gogoi said. He had spent the last few months in the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to ailments. He slammed the BJP-led State government for “misusing” the UAPA and the NIA. The court’s judgment would influence future cases, he stated. Soon after his release, Mr. Gogoi visited the house of Sam Stafford, a school student who was among the five persons killed in the anti-CAA violence in Guwahati. He expressed solidarity with the parents of the boy who died in police firing. Mr. Gogoi’s advocate Shantanu Borthakur said three others – Dharjya Konwar, Manas Konwar and Bittu Sonowal – who were arrested with him were also discharged on Thursday. The three, members of various wings of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti that Mr. Gogoi had founded, had been out on bail. “The court’s ruling has exposed the State government’s attempts to target our party president,” Bhasco de Saikia, Raijor Dal working president, said. The NIA court last week granted two days’ parole to Mr. Gogoi to meet members of his family in Guwahati and eastern Assam’s Jorhat. His 84-year-old mother Priyada Gogoi is ailing. She had campaigned for her son in the May 27 Assembly elections. “My focus will be on working for the development of my constituency besides opposing any anti-people policy the government tries to impose,” Mr. Gogoi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/akhil-gogoi-freed-in-caa-violence-case/article35089181.ece

A Vacation Bench of Justice C. Hari Shankar said, “It is made clear that this Vacation Bench is not expressing any opinion one way or the other regarding the correctness of the averments [made in the petition by the woman]”. “However, given the fact that the petitioner is a young girl who has expressed her apprehension regarding her security, the limited directions to the Respondents 1 and 2 (Delhi Police) to take adequate steps to protect the life and safety of the petitioner, till the matter is taken up the regular Bench on July 5,” Justice Shankar said.  In her petition, Renu Gangwar said on May 27 this year, she converted from Hinduism to Islam with her “own free will”. Following this, the 29-year-old changed her name to Ayesha Alvi, which was published in some newspapers. Ms. Alvi, a resident of Tilhar and working in Delhi, alleged that mediapersons came to her place and took photographs and videos without her permission. One mediaperson allegedly demanded money while threatening to publish the news about her conversion.  “On June 26, 2021, the petitioner has been informed that her father has been taken away by officials of the Uttar Pradesh police and they are coming to Delhi and would take her back to Uttar Pradesh where she would be forced to file false complaint/FIR,” the plea said. The petition further stated that Ms. Alvi was “under immediate threat of being taken away by force or coercion to the State of Uttar Pradesh by the agencies of the State or any other person”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/woman-who-converted-to-islam-granted-protection/article35089191.ece

In its COVID-19 weekly epidemiological update, the WHO said as of June 29, 2021, “96 countries have reported cases of the Delta variant, though this is likely an underestimate as sequencing capacities needed to identify variants are limited. A number of these countries are attributing surges in infections and hospitalisations to this variant.” Given the increase in transmissibility, the WHO warned that the Delta variant is “expected to rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant variant over the coming months.” For the first time in several weeks, the highest numbers of new COVID-19 cases were not reported from India. The update noted that at 5,21,298, the highest numbers of new cases were reported from Brazil during the June 21-27 week, followed by India (3,51,218 new cases, a 12% increase over the previous week), Colombia (2,04,132 new cases, 5% increase) and Russia (1,34,465 new cases, 24% increase).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delta-variant-to-become-dominant-strain-who/article35089201.ece

The panel said there was no need for a separate Phase III trial of Sputnik Light in India since the safety and immunogenicity data has been generated during the two-dose Sputnik V trial in India. Sputnik Light is the first component of Sputnik V and its efficacy is said to be 79.4%. “The firm should present the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik Light that is being carried out in Russia for considering the proposal for grant of MA in the country,” the SEC meeting on Wednesday recommended to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. The pharma major had presented the Phase III clinical trial protocol as well as the interim safety and efficacy data generated from Phase I/II clinical trial in Russia while seeking the MA. “Sputnik Light is same as component-I of Sputnik V.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Kooratazhvan’s devotion||Kooratazhvan, disciple of Ramanujacharya, composed Varadaraja Stava in praise of Lord Varadaraja of Kanchipuram. Kooratazhvan could not see, but was blessed with divine eyesight by the Lord so that he could see Him. In Varadaraja Stava, Kooratazhvan describes the Lord’s dark hue, which resembles rain bearing clouds. Such a description is befitting, for Lord Varadaraja, as His very name implies, is One who gives abundantly, said P.B. Rajahamsam in a discourse. Kooratazhvan’s eyes then alight on the Lord’s hair, whose darkness reminds him of collyrium. He describes the Lord’s soft lotus-like hands and feet. As for His eyes, they are like lotuses too. Although the Lord blessed Kooratazhvan with eyesight, the latter had no desire to see anything but the Lord Himself and his Acharya Ramanuja. Kooratazhvan’s humility was such that he spoke poorly of himself. He says in Varadaraja Stava that he is suffering from the three heats — tapatraya. The three heats that burn us are Adhyatmika, Adhibhautika and Adhidaivika. That which causes trouble to the body and mind is Adhyatmika. Problems caused by animals, insects and by humans fall under Adhibhautika. Difficulties that arise due to storms, and other natural disasters come under Adhidaivika. In the end, Kooratazhvan reminds the Lord of his connection with Ramanuja, which alone is enough to guarantee the Lord’s mercy. Ramanuja was blessed by Alavandar, who was from the lineage of Nathamuni, who in turn had the blessings of Nammazhvar. The long line of preceptors can be ultimately traced to the Lord Himself. Kooratazhvan was so devoted to his Acharya, that he wanted to depart from the world before his Acharya did. He wanted to be in Sri Vaikuntha, to welcome Ramanuja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kooratazhvans-devotion/article35089196.ece

02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||No review of Maratha quota judgment||The Supreme Court has refused to review its judgment holding the Maratha reservation law unconstitutional. The court had also held, in a majority view, that the Centre alone is empowered to identify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) to include them in the Central List for claiming reservation benefits. “The grounds taken in the review petition do not fall within the limited ground on which review petition can be considered. The various grounds taken in the review petition have already been dealt with in the main judgment. We do not find any sufficient ground to entertain this review petition. The review petition is dismissed,” a five-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan recorded in a short order published late on Thursday. In May, the Bench had unanimously declared the Maharashtra State law which provides reservation benefits to the Maratha community, taking the quota limit in the State in excess of 50%, as unconstitutional. The court had also refused to revisit its 1992 Indra Sawhney verdict which fixed the ceiling limit for reservation at 50%. However, the majority view authored by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat had held a ‘different’ opinion about the validity of the 102nd Constitutional Amendment. Justice Bhat had held that the Centre alone was empowered to identify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) for the Central List. The opinion had led to the review pleas. “The President [that is the Central government] alone, to the exclusion of all other authorities, is empowered to identify SEBCs and include them in a list to be published under Article 342A (1), which shall be deemed to include SEBCs in relation to each State and Union Territory for the purposes of the Constitution,” Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, whose opinion was concurred by Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta on the five-judge Bench, had held. Justice Bhat had observed that the States could only make suggestions to the President or the statutory commission concerned for inclusion, exclusion or modification of castes and communities to be included in the List.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-review-of-maratha-quota-judgment/article35089423.ece

02 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||Scribes must not dramatise incidents: HC||A journalist is not expected to dramatise a sensational and horrifying incident and make news by putting the subject in a pitiable condition and in danger of death, the Allahabad High Court has said. The court made the observation while rejecting a bail plea of a journalist in Lucknow, who is co-accused of abetting a person’s suicide and filming it outside the U.P. Vidhan Sabha last year. “The journalist keeps an eye on anticipated or sudden events happening in society and brings them to the information of all the people through various news media without any tampering, this is his business,” the court said on June 21. Journalists Shamim Ahmad and Naushad Ahmad allegedly contacted a man who was facing eviction from his house and induced him to set himself ablaze in front of the Assembly so that they may film the incident and telecast it. The journalists allegedly surmised that if the tenant did as they suggested, no one would be able to evict him from the house. The person died in a hospital on October 24, 2020.

02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||11.5 crore vaccine doses given in June||Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said “State leaders” should focus on planning COVID-19 vaccination drives, rather than “creating panic”. In a series of tweets, he said he had seen “irresponsible statements from various leaders regarding the largest vaccine drive”. He said after the Centre started providing 75% of vaccines for free, vaccination picked up pace and 11.5 crore doses were given in June. States had been informed in advance about the supplies for July, said the Minister. He said 12 crore doses would be supplied in July, not including private hospitals’ supply. “If there are issues in States, it shows that they need to better plan their vaccination drives. Intra-State planning & logistics are the responsibility of the States. I request these leaders to desist from their shameless urge to play politics even in the midst of a pandemic.” In another tweet, he said: “If these leaders are aware of these facts and are still giving such statements, I consider it most unfortunate. If they don’t know, they need to focus on governance...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/115-crore-vaccine-doses-given-in-june/article35089208.ece

It upheld the acquittal of film producer Ramesh Taurani in the case. A Division Bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and N.R. Borkar overturned the acquittal of Abdul Rashid Dawood Merchant in the case and convicted him. The Bench upheld Rauf’s conviction and sentence under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). It, however, acquitted him under Sections 392 (punishment for robbery) and 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. The Bench said, “The appellant [Abdul Rauf] has criminal antecedents and is not entitled to remission as he absconded right after his arrest. Hence in the interest of justice at large, appellant does not deserve any leniency.” Abdul Rashid was acquitted by the trial court but convicted for murder and criminal conspiracy by the High Court, which had ordered him to surrender either before the sessions court or the DN Nagar police station, failing which a non-bailable warrant would be issued against him. According to the prosecution, a conspiracy to kill Kumar was hatched at Anees Ibrahim’s office in May 1997 after the music baron refused to pay Rs. 10 crore to gangster Abu Salem as protection money. Abdul Rauf was present at the meeting along with Salem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-upholds-life-term-for-assailant-in-gulshan-kumar-murder-case/article35089176.ece
02 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||System set up to send automatic e-challans for traffic violations||The police have introduced a new system to send e-challans automatically to the mobile phones of motorists, whose traffic violations are caught on advanced surveillance cameras. The system was introduced in Anna Nagar and Thirumangalam on a pilot basis, and would later be extended to other parts of the city for effective enforcement, Police Commissioner Shankar Jiwal said. In 2019, Hyundai Motor India Foundation (HMIF), an arm of Hyundai Motor India Limited, installed 63 highly sophisticated cameras and a fully-equipped monitoring room to support authorities in strengthening road discipline and help reduce traffic violations in the locality. The cameras were installed at Anna Nagar roundtana, Anna Nagar police station roundtana, Shanthi Colony junction, Estate Road junction and West Depot X 18th Main Road junction. The cameras would be monitored through a separate control room at Anna Nagar roundtana. The traffic police used to send notices or challans manually, asking the vehicle owners to pay a penalty for any violation. Now, the system has been upgraded so that e-challans will be sent automatically to the violators’ mobile phones. After inaugurating the upgraded Automated Regulation Observation Zone Control Room, Mr. Jiwal said the traffic regulation observation zone, integrated with the National Informatics Centre, which was also linked with Vahan, an integrated nation-wide portal for vehicle registration, would track traffic violations in real time. The system can currently generate automatic e-challans for speeding, signal, stop line and wrong side violations. The person will first get a notice, following which a challan would be sent directly to their mobile phone. “In the manual system, personnel used to book 200-250 cases per day in police station limits. The trial run of the new system may lead to the booking of 90,000 to 1 lakh cases. The enforcement level may increase by 300 times. This is a pilot project. We are planning to extend it across the city,” Mr. Jiwal said, adding that they were planning to upgrade the system to detect helmet rule violations and triple riding as well. He said corporate companies were welcome to sponsor the installation of CCTVs or any other surveillance cameras. He added that when A.K. Viswanathan was the Police Commissioner, more than 1.5 lakh CCTV cameras were installed under the ‘Third Eye Project’. “Now, we are going to map the GPS locations of all cameras in the city. We will set up a SIM card module, which will send an SMS to the central system in case of any problems,” Mr. Jiwal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/system-set-up-to-send-automatic-e-challans-for-traffic-violations/article35089556.ece

A maths teacher from Government Higher Secondary School Mangudi in Sivaganga district, Mr. Senthil Selvan said the recognition would go a long way for other teachers and hoped to share the benefits of ICT. Having used digital tools for teaching students from 2016, Mr. Elavarasan, a teacher at Panchayat Union Middle School, Vedapatti, Salem, said he had facilitated his students to connect with teachers and students from other countries through video calls. “Such interactions improved the confidence of students and improved their knowledge of the different countries and their culture.

Thunderstorms with heavy rain are set to roll through nine districts, including Salem, Dharmapuri, Theni, Madurai and Villupuram on Friday and a few more places in other parts of the State. Puducherry may experience light to moderate rain. Officials of the Meteorological Department said the same weather pattern of scattered rain that may be heavy in one or two places of a few districts may continue till July 5. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai said whenever the southwest monsoon is weak in other parts of the country, thunderstorms pick up pace in the southern region. Westerly winds continue to prevail and trigger convective activity. On Thursday, places like Tirupattur (4 cm), Kodaikanal (2 cm) and Kancheepuram (1 cm) were among some of the weather stations that received rain till 5.30 p.m. During the weekend, heavy rain may cover parts of north Tamil Nadu. Officials of the Meteorological Department noted that a trough line from interior Karnataka to the Comorin sea across Tamil Nadu persists at 0.9 km above the mean sea level. This, too, influenced thunderstorms over the State. Though the maximum temperature in Chennai was 34.4 degree Celsius, which is two degree Celsius below normal on Thursday, the high humidity level kept the coastal city warm. Chennai, which has been missing rain for two days now, too has chances of thunderstorms lashing some areas till Saturday. The maximum temperature would be around 36 degree Celsius for two days. The Meteorological Department has now started posting monthly weather summary on its website in both English and Tamil. N.

02 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||80% of borrowings in Q1 are through long-tenure bonds||Long-tenure bonds with a maturity profile of 20-35 years accounted for about Rs. 19,200 crore, or 80%, of Tamil Nadu’s total borrowings of Rs. 24,000 crore in the first quarter of fiscal 2021-22. On Tuesday, the State raised Rs. 2,000 crore through bonds known as State development loans. It reissued bonds of Rs. 1,000 each, of a tenure of 30-35 years, with yields of 7.23%. “There is little difference between the yields on short-tenure bonds and long-tenure bonds. So we are ensuring that we take advantage of lower yields for the long-tenure bonds and stretch our repayment profile,” said a senior official. During April-June 2021, the State raised Rs. 4,800 crore through short-tenure bonds of 5-10 years, with yields of 6.83%. “The States that have been issuing longer-tenure bonds would be doing so with the aim of spacing out their debt repayment obligations over a longer period of time,” said Kavita Chacko, senior economist, CARE Ratings. Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA Ltd., said that when the rates of long-tenure bonds were quite low, it would be better to lock them in for the longest tenures possible. Tamil Nadu has indicated that it will borrow Rs. 15,500 crore in the second quarter (July-September) of 2021-22, according to the Reserve Bank of India.

02 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Denmark looks to set up centre for offshore wind in T.N.||Denmark is keen on setting up a Centre of Excellence for Offshore Wind and believes that Tamil Nadu is the best place for it as wind patterns are consistent here. A location has also been identified, Danish Ambassador to India Freddy Svane has said. Mr. Svane met Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Finance Minister P.T.R. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu on Thursday and discussed Denmark’s relationship with the State, dating back to 400 years. In an interview with The Hindu after the meeting, Mr. Svane said the Centre of Excellence would develop the best technology to cater to offshore wind. “There is no offshore wind facility in India for the time being, and of course you need to develop a technology that will cater to the specific conditions in India and along its coastline. Tamil Nadu can become the hub for offshore wind [energy] manufacturing,” he said. Mr. Svane said a location had been identified and formal approval was being awaited before an announcement could be made. He said the Centre could help develop common research, optimise the design of the blades [of the wind mills] and the height of the towers and secure the transmission of electricity from an offshore wind farm with substation cables, among other things. Terming the new Tamil Nadu Cabinet “dynamic”, Mr. Svane said there were 13 Danish companies in the State, employing around 7,200 people. Seven firms were in the process of establishment, while four more were considering setting up their units here — most of them being in the wind energy sector — he added. Simon Apelblat Thomsen, counsellor, environment, Danish Embassy, also met the Water Resources Secretary and expressed their interest in a potential collaboration with the State to help fight water wastage, monitor groundwater quality and depletion, and rejuvenate groundwater in Tamil Nadu, among a number of other potential initiatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/denmark-looks-to-set-up-centre-for-offshore-wind-in-tn/article35089562.ece

02 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIIMS: State is looking at alternatives||The Union government’s three suggestions on temporary arrangements to accommodate 150 MBBS students for the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Madurai, were not feasible, said Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian. In a letter dated June 4 to the State government, the Union government had said 150 students could be admitted to the upcoming AIIMS, and had suggested three temporary places for them, until construction is completed — the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry; the government medical college or arts college in Madurai; or any private medical college in Madurai — the Minister told reporters on Thursday. “We have been looking into the suggestions. Will it be appropriate to admit students to a neighbouring Union Territory or a private medical college? There are already 250 students at the Madurai Medical College, and admitting 150 more will take the total number of students to 400. Basic infrastructure at the college will not be adequate for the students. It will not be appropriate to admit medical students in art colleges,” he said. Stating that all three suggestions of the Union government were not feasible, Mr. Subramanian said the State government was looking at alternatives. “Instead, the State is exploring the possibility of admitting 50 students each to the government medical colleges in Madurai, Theni and Sivaganga, or 30 each to the government medical colleges in Madurai, Theni, Sivaganga, Thoothukudi and Tiruchi. We will consult with the Chief Minister and submit a report soon,” he said. At the HC This issue surfaced after the Centre informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday that it was willing to start AIIMS from a temporary campus till the construction of the main one is completed, and a proposal for a temporary site must come from the State. Referring to this, the Medical Minister said it was projected as if there was delay on the part of the State government, whereas the project had been delayed for six years since its announcement in 2015. He noted that the Chief Minister had written to the Prime Minister on June 5 to expedite construction, and had later emphasised this during his meeting with him on June 14. The Minister said the project cost in 2018 was Rs. 1,264 crore; it needed to be revised now. He said the previous AIADMK government should have put pressure on the Centre to expedite works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiims-state-is-looking-at-alternatives/article35089566.ece

It was also identified thattnpds.gov.inwas a victim of a cyber attack and was hacked by a cyber criminal group that goes by the name 1945VN. The data breach was reported to the computer emergency response team (CERT) by Technisanct. “Our team is further assessing the depth of the breach with special emphasis on the number of Aadhaar records publicly exposed as it is crucial to protect data belonging to citizens. We also assume that the vendor will be having more data from the same breach,” Mr. Harikumar said. Such data can be used for phishing or to create fake identity cards, he added. However, Food and Consumer Affairs Department officials said the Chennai-based company that manages their website had denied the hacking. In an explanatory letter, the company informed the Department that the application was designed in multiple layers and only the user interface, particularly index.html-home page, had been impacted, and there had been no data breach in the system. The company also said it did not store beneficiaries’ fingerprints in the application, and authentication happened on the UIDAI website. Food Department officials said they would undertake a security audit shortly.

After many decades, the heritage monuments, including the bronze statue of Lord Ripon, are expected to be restored to their original condition. The Greater Chennai Corporation and Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) have set a deadline of July 10 for shifting the heritage monuments. The reinstallation of the five statues and landscape development in 75% of the area will be completed in two weeks. The Metro station construction started 12 years ago, after the Corporation handed over 4,507 sq m of land to CMRL. R. Ravindran Sthapathy, a national awardeee, who was working at Ripon Buildings on Thursday, said the target was to restore the monuments without diminishing their heritage value. “We are documenting all minute details. We will ensure that the monuments remain strong, and endure the test of time,” he said. The monument of Lord Ripon was installed over a century ago. Work on shifting and restoring the statue of Pitti Thyagaraya, who was the first non-official president of the Madras Municipal Corporation, will also be completed this week. The landscape around the Ripon Buildings will be handed over to the Corporation after July 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-under-way-to-shift-restore-heritage-monuments-in-ripon-buildings-by-july-10/article35089554.ece
02 July 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Drones used to prevent breeding of mosquitoes||The Greater Chennai Corporation is employing drones to destroy Culex mosquitoes, also known as menace mosquitoes, that breed in the sewage-mixed waterways. The civic body launched the spraying of anti-larval chemicals in the waterways using drones from Thursday. A trial run on the modalities of employing the drones was held on June 26. Three drones, hired from Anna University, were deployed for spraying on Cooum River, Otteri Nullah and Buckingham Canal. A senior civic official said the drones had been deployed at a cost of over Rs. 10 lakh. Based on the findings by the civic officials about the density before and after the spraying of the chemicals, a decision would be taken on the regular use of these machines in other places. Inaccessible to workers The waterways remained inaccessible for vector control workers as they sprayed mainly on the beds of the canals. The Corporation planned to find an effective solution to kill mosquitoes, and this resulted in a tie-up with Anna University. Anti-larval chemicals would be sprayed in 30 minor and four major canals. The official further said that during the 15-day campaign, these three drones would be covering 60 km daily to complete the spraying of chemicals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drones-used-to-prevent-breeding-of-mosquitoes/article35089574.ece
02 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC: menace of online, offline games must be addressed by govt. first||There is no doubt that children and young adults are glued to their smartphones all the time these days. However, it is for the elected executive and not the courts to address the psychological issues faced by them due to addiction to online & offline games, the Madras High Court said on Thursday. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote, “It is only upon the failure of the executive to act and thereupon, the court, perceiving the matter to be a danger to society, ought to step in.” The observations were made while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate E. Martin Jayakumar seeking a direction to the Centre and the State government to ban all online and offline games. He insisted upon a mechanism to track devices used for attending online classes and playing games. The petitioner complained of online business enterprises preying on children and young adults by offering diverse games that were addictive. He perceived the addiction to be devastating and life threatening too in the sense that it destroys the career building phase of young adults and might even lead to suicidal tendencies and extreme anger against parents and elders seeking to check the habit. Agreeing with the concern expressed by the petitioner, the judges wrote, “Oftentimes, a family could be together and sitting at a table but each member would be using the phone even to describe the dish that he may be having or the quality of the food at the moment.” Nevertheless, “even constitutional courts should be slow in entering into such matters on the personal sense of morality of the individual complainant or of the judge or judges concerned”, the Bench said. It went on to state, “There is no doubt that when there is some illegal action or something which is detrimental to larger public interest, constitutional courts intervene; but in matters of the present kind, especially when elected governments are in place, such matters of policy must be left to the wisdom of those representing the people and having their mandate, instead of the court issuing a diktat.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/menace-of-online-offline-games-must-be-addressed/article35089580.ece

Addressing the media on Wednesday, C. Lakshmanan, a faculty at the Madras Institute of Development Studies and convener of the collective, said many government-run institutions, particularly the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare schools and hostels, lacked basic infrastructure, including toilets and water. Highlighting that the post-matric scholarship amount given to students had not been revised for 10 years, the collective said it must be doubled and periodically revised in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price Index. Mr. Lakshmanan said while one of the key recommendations of the Thorat Committee, formed years ago to study discrimination in educational campuses, was to strengthen students’ unions, almost all State-run universities and colleges did not have strong student bodies. Suggestions of the collective included the constitution of Pandithar Iyothee Thaasar and Periyar Chairs in higher education institutions for interdisciplinary studies on social transformation. The collective highlighted that although the overall Gross Enrolment Ratio in Tamil Nadu was high, it was relatively low for Scheduled Caste and Schedule Tribe students. Other suggestions included extending breakfast and mid-day meal to higher education institutions and fellowship programmes for students to do research abroad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/improve-facilities-in-govt-schools-dalit-body/article35090056.ece

Sameeran said on Thursday. Inaugurating the weekly meetings organised by the DIC, he said the district was strong in entrepreneurship, industrial activity, and investment. It had the eco system for the growth of entrepreneurship and industries. Some of the flagship programmes of the government, such as the NEEDs, UYEGP, and PMEGP, were to help new entrepreneurs. The district had achieved its targets last financial year for these schemes. However, the administration would strive to facilitate more entrepreneurs, depending on the demand. There were some thrust sectors, including technical textiles and automobiles, that could get more investments and the district administration would focus on these areas too. At a meeting held last week, seven applications pending for single window clearance were discussed. More applicants should make use of the single window system to get approvals from multiple government departments. The DIC was always ready to help the MSMEs with regulatory clearances through the single window system. “The government is ready to facilitate industries in any sector that want to invest and will handhold them whenever needed,” he said. DIC General Manager B. Karthigaivasan, said aspiring entrepreneurs could participate in the meeting to be held on Thursdays to track the status of their application or know more about government schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-will-facilitate-growth-of-industries-says-collector/article35089594.ece
02 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Goldsmiths face low turnout of workers||Goldsmiths in Coimbatore city, who are permitted to open their units, face low turnout of workers as public transport services are yet to resume in the district. S.M. Kamal Hasan, president of the Coimbatore Goldsmiths Association, said of the 40,000 micro units that made jewellery here, just about 2,000 were functioning. Workers from other districts, who used to work in Coimbatore, need buses to return to the district. Similarly, workers who used to come to the smithies from different parts of the district need buses to commute to the workplace. Hence, not many units had resumed operations. “We have orders for the Aavani month, which is a wedding season. We hope bus services will restart next week,” he said. Further, the goldsmiths were unable to travel to other districts to sell the jewellery they made or had in hand, he added. B. Muthuvenkatraman, president of Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers Association, said the jewellery retail showrooms in the city remained shut and hence, the local demand was low. Since other districts and States were reopening gradually, orders were trickling in. But, the local market should pick up. Some manufacturers were travelling to other districts by train to sell the jewellery as bus services were not available. The jewellery making factories and goldsmithies remained shut for nearly 55 days. So the units were just finishing the work on hand. It was difficult to forecast the market now as people who had postponed purchases would want to shop when the shops reopened. The demand for jewellery as an investment option was expected to continue, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/goldsmiths-face-low-turnout-of-workers/article35089614.ece

02 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Test Positivity Rate drops below 5 % in Coimbatore district||The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of Coimbatore district has dropped below 5 %, an initial target set by the Health Department. On Thursday, the TPR stood at 4.42 % when 498  persons tested positive for COVID-19 out of the 11,250 swab samples subjected to tests. Tamil Nadu Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan told The Hindu Coimbatore made a significant achievement in reducing the number of cases, registering a steady decline. “The TPR and new cases consistently coming down is a very good sign. Now, the TPR is well below the initial target. However, the effort [of the state machinery] is to bring it to 1 % or below in the next level,” he said. According to him, the CTE region, comprising Coimbatore, Tiruppur and Erode districts, was registering a promising decline. The three districts had registered a sudden increase of cases in May that began to decline in June. According to Dr. Radhakrishnan, a few districts were showing erratic trends in the number of new cases, registering an increase after a decrease, which the Health Department was closely analysing. As of Thursday, 49.57 % of COVID-19 cases reported in the district in a seven day period were from the Corporation limits. Sulur (7.29%), Thudiyalur (6.88 %), Karamadai (6.73 %) and Madukkarai (5.45 %) blocks were the ones that had more number of cases in the rural areas of the district. Increased activities following the relaxation of lockdown norms were a cause of worry for the Health and Revenue Departments as formation of new clusters will have an adverse impact on the improvement achieved by the district. As of Thursday, Coimbatore reported 2,20,005 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far. A total of 2,14,149 persons recovered from the disease while 2,051 persons died of it as per official records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/test-positivity-rate-drops-below-5-in-coimbatore-district/article35089610.ece

M.V. Ramesh Babu, president of the Association, said in a release that the MSMEs in the district were closed seven weeks ago because of the lockdown announced by the State government to control the spread of the pandemic. “The MSMEs have been in acute shortage of funds due to nil business....While business activity has come to a halt, entrepreneurs are still weighed down by loans, taxes, bills, employees’ salaries, rent, and other daily operating expenses. Unless the industries are going to be running in full capacity, the survival will become a question mark,” he said. Partial lockdowns affected livelihood of people and the economy. Hence, the Chief Minister should lift all restrictions for the industries. The government should also ensure that all eligible people were vaccinated at the earliest so that the workers could attend work without fear, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/codissia-seeks-removal-of-lockdown-restrictions/article35089590.ece

02 July 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Bhuvanagiri teacher rides sound waves with his lessons||With a lack of smart phones and poor internet connectivity causing disruption in online learning for students, especially tothose from rural areas, a teacher of a panchayat union middle school in Cuddalore district has developed an ‘Online KalviRadio’ to ensure that students with basic phones do not miss classes. A. Karthick Raja, 33, secondary grade teacher at the Panchayat Union Middle School in Kathazhai in Bhuvanagiri block, has developed the websitewww.kalviradio.comthat works on any basic phone with a browser facility. Seventy-five teachers of government schools from 20 districts across Tamil Nadu are connected on ‘Online KalviRadio’ and are imparting lessons from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. ‘Online KalviRadio’ is a technology that can be used in teaching and learning activities and for self-learning. It can be accessed by students with a basic mobile phone equipped with a browser, Mr. Raja said. The Tamil Nadu government has been imparting online classes through a comprehensive schedule of classes telecast through Kalvi TV. ‘Online KalviRadio’ is modelled on a similar platform to make the audio content more widely accessible for students from the rural areas. Bridging digital divide KalviRadio does not require any radio frequency and helps in bridging the digital divide and keeps students connected with teachers, said Mr. Raja. An initial assessment by authorities in the school at Kathazhai showed that out of 136 students, only a few had access to smart phones. This prompted Mr. Raja, who has been teaching 27 students of Classes 3 and 4, to come up with KalviRadio. He developed the website and set up a virtual studio on his own. The lessons prepared by teachers as voice recordings are forwarded through an app to Mr. Raja to be uploaded on the website. “The students are made aware of the schedule of lessons being aired at the respective time slots,” he said. “The website has a playlist option and students who have been unable to attend classes on a particular day can listen to the lectures again and complete the assignments and then follow-up with the teachers,” he said. Lessons on subjects aired for the week from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. are uploaded on the website on the weekends. This will benefit students and they can simultaneously read the books while listening to the teachers. Students can participate in the sessions and present programmes on the subjects at 6 p.m. every day. This ensures that they enjoy self-paced learning, Mr. Raja said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bhuvanagiri-teacher-rides-sound-waves-with-his-lessons/article35089631.ece

02 July 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||HC stays stamp duty hike in Lakshadweep||The Kerala High Court on Thursday stayed for three weeks the order of the Lakshadweep administration revising the stamp duty for transfer and registration of land on the islands. Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan passed the interim order on a petition filed by P.M. Mohammed Salih, a resident of Amini island. According to him, the stamp duty for the transfer of an interest of the landed property had been drastically increased from 1% to 6% for females, 7% for a jointly owned property by male and female and 8% for others of the total valuation of the landed property. Earlier the stamp duty rate was 1% and there was no division based on caste or gender. The fixation at a varying range was not based on an intelligible differentia. The petitioner contended that the administration was depriving the islanders of their ability to either purchase or transfer their property amongst the same community. The rate was revised with an ulterior motive of depriving the inhabitants of their land. The revision of stamp duty by the District Collector of Lakshadweep was unconstitutional, he contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-stays-stamp-duty-hike-in-lakshadweep/article35089393.ece

02 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Do not shift Tasmac shop, say villagers||While petitions seeking the closure or shifting of Tasmac shops are regularly filed before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the court on Thursday came across an unusual petition that sought a direction to the authorities not to shift a Tasmac shop. The court was hearing the petition filed by K. Karunanithi of Melur in Madurai district. He said that the people of Vellalur village in Melur were against the decision of the authorities to shift the Tasmac shop from the village to Thaniyamangalam village. The petitioner said that 90 % of the men from Vellalur were working in the Gulf countries due to lack of employment opportunities in the region and they visited the village once in a while. The local liquor mafia had taken advantage of this. He said that people were getting affected by consuming illicit liquor. In order to curb the menace of illicit liquor, a liquor shop was opened in the village and it was later run by Tasmac. People who were working abroad whenever they visited the village felt comfortable buying liquor at the shop, he said. Under these circumstances, the authorities decided to shift the shop. Aggrieved by this, the villagers objected to this. The objection prompted authorities to conduct a peace meeting. It was decided to shift the shop. The petitioner sought a direction to restrain the authorities from shifting the Tasmac shop from the village. A Division Bench of Justices T. S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi observed that the location of a liquor shop was to be decided by the authorities in accordance with the relevant guidelines and rules. The relief sought by the petitioner cannot be granted, the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-shift-tasmac-shop-say-villagers/article35089957.ece
02 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea against use of ‘Union’ dismissed||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition that sought a direction to the Centre to educate the people of Tamil Nadu to respect “our” country India/Bharat by referring to its name as it is in official writings and speeches, in adherence to patriotism, sovereignty and respect. The petitioner had also sought a direction to restrain the State government from using the term “Union” while referring to India/Bharat in its communications. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi said though the relief sought was to educate the people of Tamil Nadu, the submission made before the court was more directed towards the Chief Minister and the Ministers, in the manner in which they address the Centre while speaking in the Assembly. The court said in its view, the prayer was thoroughly misconceived and no such direction could be issued by the court directing the Chief Minister or the Ministers to speak in a particular fashion. Further, the judges said the petition was absolutely vague as to what sort of education the petitioner wanted the people of Tamil Nadu to be given.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-against-use-of-union-dismissed/article35089559.ece
02 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Six persons held, two on the run in illegal adoption case||Madurai City Police on Thursday arrested six of the eight accused, including two couples, in connection with two children given for illegal adoption by two persons running a home for the elderly and abandoned women. Special teams of police were on the lookout for the director of Idayam Trust, Sivakumar, and his associate, Madarsha . The case came to light after Azharuddin of Sekkipatti, came to know that the youngest son of S. Aishwarya of his village, who was admitted to the home with her three children, went missing from the home recently. When Azharuddin enquired about the child, Sivakumar and Madarsha, had told him that the one-year-old boy Manickam, was admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital for COVID treatment and subsequently, he died. They also produced fake documents to show that the boy was “referred” from an urban primary health centre in Narimedu to GRH. Subsequently, Madarsha told him that the boy had died and he was buried in Corporation burial ground. He also sent a photograph showing Aishwarya performing last rights of the boy at the burial site. However, subsequently, Sivakumar had called Azharuddin and told that the boy was safe with someone else. Based on his complaint, Tallakulam police and a team of police officials from Crime against Women and Children Wing, led by its Additional Deputy Commissioner, K. Krishnamoorthi, investigated the case. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the child was neither admitted to the UPHC nor buried at the Thathaneri burial ground. Meanwhile, Sivakumar and Madarsha went absconding. The police traced the boy from Ismailpuram and arrested one Kannan (50) and his wife, Bhavani (45). Meanwhile, the officials during verifying the attendance register of the home, found that another child, Dhanam (2) daughter of another inmate, Sridevi, was also missing from the home. The police tracked the child at Sakkimangalam and arrested M. Sagupar Sadiq (38) and his wife, Anisrani (35). Two others identified as R. Kalaivani (32) of K. Pudur and Raja, were arrested for arranging the illegal adoption. Tallakulam police that had registered children missing case have altered it as a cheating case. The eight accused have been booked for forgery and under the provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/six-persons-held-in-illegal-adoption-case-in-madurai/article35089753.ece
02 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Activists condemn attack on animals||The instances of cruelty and attack against animals by the public has come to light in recent times. Sensitisation of animal rights among the public and stricter enforcement of laws is essential to prevent the occurrence of such crimes, say animal rights activists. Recently, a cow from Alwarpuram was found with burn injuries and was later treated at the veterinary clinic at Tallakulam. Animal rights activists point out that there were several instances of cruelty against cow, dogs, and cats that were reported in the last few months in Madurai district. P. R. Vishwanath, who runs a private shelter for dogs and an organisation called Oorvanam, said that many people hurt the animals as they feel that the animals destroy their properties. “But people don't understand that the animals are part of the ecology and play an important role in maintaining the ecological balance,” Mr. Vishwanath added. There are also specific legislations that guarantee several rights to the animals, said Mayur Hasija, an animal rights activist. “There is a need to sensitise the public about legislations like the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960; and Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001. Most importantly, there is a need to bring a attitudinal change among the public regarding protection of animal rights,” he added. A press release from District Collector S. Aneesh Sekar warned those who attack animals and said that strict action would be taken against the offenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/activists-condemn-cruelty-and-attack-on-animals/article35089757.ece

A Division Bench of Justices T. S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi observed that the High Court had already issued several directions in this regard. But, in spite of this, the authorities had remained mute spectators to the violation. Taking note of the fact that no action was initiated against people who were using cone speakers, the court directed the authorities to issue notice to those who have installed cone speakers asking them to remove it. If they failed to remove the cone speakers, then the authorities could remove the speakers and recover the cost from them. If they were repeated offenders then the electricity board shall disconnect electricity supply to their premises, till they followed orders, the court said. Further, the court took note of the fact that people hired cone speakers from vendors. In such cases, the court directed the authorities to give opportunities to the vendors to change over to box speakers. If they failed to do so, then the cone speakers would be seized. The Division Bench was hearing a petition filed by Minoo Erach Avari who sought a direction to the authorities to take steps to remove the cone speakers in establishments in Kodaikanal. The case was adjourned by six weeks for filing the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-collector-to-remove-cone-speakers-in-kodaikanal/article35089759.ece

02 July 2021||NALGONDA,TAMIL NADU||Telugu States spar over water sharing||Simmering tension over power generation by Telangana at Nagarjunasagar continued on the third day on Thursday, even as senior officials from Andhra Pradesh who crossed the border with a letter of protest returned ‘unacknowledged’ and disappointed. In addition to the Nagarjunasagar project, Telangana is generating power at the upstream Srisailam project and the downstream K.L. Rao Sagar Pulichintala project, joint multi-purpose projects between the Telugu States, amid maximum protection by security and police forces. In response to Telangana’s firm stand, the Andhra Pradesh government marked its visible protest on Thursday by fortifying its side of the projects with police forces, also expressing readiness for any future action. An official attempt, however, to protest Telangana’s stand on water usage to generate power was made by Andhra Pradesh irrigation and revenue officials late on Thursday . According to Superintending Engineer of NSP (Right Canal) Purushottama Ganga Raju, who entered Nagarjunasagar to register the protest with the NSP Chief Engineer, Telangana was setting aside irrigation responsibilities for power production and letting the water go waste. “The dams are not even filled to capacities, and setting aside irrigation duty for power generation is not proper. We will be answerable to farmers,” he said. Mr. Raju, speaking to the media, also observed that the NSP CE “showed lack of responsibility” by not acknowledging his “mere protest letter.” However, at the K.L. Rao Sagar Pulichintala project in Suryapet district limits, Andhra Pradesh officials were successful in submitting their representation amid police security. Police personnel from Guntur were deployed in large numbers at the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam in view of the tense situation. A large posse of police personnel from Telangana was also deployed at the dam. Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Vishal Gunni, visited the dam site and monitored the situation. At the Srisailam dam, the Kurnool district police deployed security personnel to ensure the safety of the structure and were not allowing anybody to go near it. Srisailam Circle Inspector B. Venkata Ramana said that on the Andhra Pradesh side only 10 police personnel had been deployed, and the strength would be increased from Friday with the arrival of additional forces. Telangana too had deployed police personnel in large numbers on its side of the dam. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are mandated to draw water from the dam for power generation after the level reaches 834 feet. A political controversy had erupted with Telangana allegedly drawing water from 806 ft.

02 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Immunisation is the best option: L-G||Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Thursday urged the private healthcare sector to upgrade facilities to be better prepared for potential future waves of the pandemic. Chairing the 18th COVID-19 Task Force weekly review meeting at the Raj Nivas, Dr. Soundararjan said although immunising the population was the best available safeguard against COVID-19, strengthening infrastructure in the private healthcare sector would help prepare and counter a third wave as and when it emerges. Complimenting the relentless efforts by doctors and health and frontline personnel in bringing the second wave of COVID-19 under control, the Lt. Governor pointed out that activities had returned to near-normal with the gradual easing of lockdown relaxations, except for the night curfew (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.). Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said the investments that the private sector had to make on increasing bed strength was not much compared to the challenge at hand. He flagged the supply of sufficient vaccines as an area of concern. Though the Union Territory had managed to be on track so far, it would require more stocks to attain the goal of 100% vaccination coverage by August 15. Pointing out that the Union Territory was able to be in this improved position without resorting to a full lockdown of the economy, he stressed on the need to adhere to COVID-appropriate behaviour even if cases were on the decline. One of the proposals to emerge at the meeting was to resume regular classes in medical colleges after getting the faculty and students vaccinated. JIPMER Director Rakesh Aggarwal pointed to the critical value of hands-on practical training. Director-General of Police Ranveer Singh Krishnia said the department maintained stringent enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour. Health Secretary T. Arun and other officials participated in the weekly review. Earlier, the Lt. Governor planted saplings and felicitated physicians at the Indira Gandhi Medical College to mark National Doctors’ Day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immunisation-is-the-best-option-l-g/article35090050.ece

02 July 2021||RAMESWARAM,TAMIL NADU||Rameswaram fishermen return to shore with poor catch||Fishermen who ventured into the sea after the end of annual ban on fishing returned to the shore on Thursday. Though the markets were flooded with the catch and crowds thronged to buy them, fishermen leader Jesu Raja said the catch was not encouraging. The 61-day annual ban ended on June 14, but fishermen from Rameswaram, Mandapam and Thangachimadam did not set off into the sea the following day. For almost a fortnight, they took time to repair boats and fishnets. They also had to take Covid-19 vaccine. Hence, they ventured into the Palk Bay for fishing only on the night of June 29, he said. On the reasons for the poor catch, Mr. Jesu Raja said the annual ban period, which was meant to encourage fish breeding, was misused by some country boat fishermen who ventured into the sea. Officials of the Fisheries Department should have been more vigilant. On mechanised boats venturing into the sea without obtaining tokens from the department, he said it was unfortunate. “Our association in five districts, including Pudukottai, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, passed resolutions urging fishermen to follow regulations but they ventured into the sea on June 29 night.” However, a mechanised boat owner, Anthony Jesu, from Thangachimadam said fishermen set off only on the first day after the end of ban in a bid to get the best catch from the seas. CITU fishermen wing district secretary M. Karunamoorthy said Fisheries officials should take stern action against the violators and seize mechanised boats that did not get tokens. Venturing into the sea without tokens was high risk, especially when the Sri Lankan Navy was rude to fishermen. The State government should determine the price for the fish on the lines of fixation for paddy and other produce. Export varieties were being procured by firms for a paltry Rs. 350 per kg, while it was being sold at Rs. 800 and above by them, Mr. Jesu Raja said. The government should also enhance subsidies for diesel as the price per litre was Rs. 100. Moreover, the cost of fishnet, repairs and ice had gone up due to several factors, while export firms procured prawns for a paltry price. The fishermen too had to part with the catch immediately as they did not have storage facility, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-return-to-shore-with-poor-catch/article35089764.ece

However, many healthcare professionals and institutions continued to lack access to suitable medical infrastructure. Recognising their unparalleled contributions to the overall wellbeing of society, Sterlite Copper honoured medical professionals on Doctors’ Day by contributing medical equipment worth Rs. 28.50 lakh to four government hospitals at Vilathikulam, Kovilpatti, Srivaikundam and Ottapidaram in Thoothukudi district. The medical equipment included 12 jumbo oxygen cylinders with a capacity of 7,000 litres each, ventilator systems, Bipap machines (a type of ventilator used to treat chronic conditions that affect breathing), syringe pumps, volumetric pumps and suction machines. Sterlite Copper had so far generated and dispatched over 1,418.94 tonnes of liquid oxygen to over 32 districts in Tamil Nadu, in addition to 953 oxygen cylinders containing 6671Nm³ of gaseous oxygen. Moreover, under the Vedanta Cares initiative, 142 beds were donated to Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital, the press statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/medical-equipment-donated/article35090144.ece
02 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Pre-audit carried out at three temples for BHOG certification||Officials of Food Safety Department and a third party agency carried out pre-audits at three major temples in the city on Wednesday as part of an initiative to issue BHOG (Blissful Hygienic Offering to God) certification of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to ensure hygiene and safety of ‘prasadam’ and other food items distributed to devotees. As part of the pre-audit, inspections were carried out at kitchens, prasadam stalls and annadhanam halls at Srirangam Ranganathaswamy Temple, Thiruvanaikovil Jambukeswarar Akilandeswari Temple and the Rockfort Thayumanaswamy Temple. The team also inspected the cooking process, storage and quality of food products. The Department of Food Safety and Drug Administration had also identified the Samayapuram Mariamman Temple and Woraiyur Vekkaliamman Temple in the city to be covered under the initiative in the first phase. The BHOG certification and star ratings would be issued by the FSSAI based on the pre and post audits. Cleanliness of the kitchens and vessels, standard of food products and water used for cooking were among the important aspects studied during the audit. The temples were required to maintain the storage rooms clean and free from rodents and cobwebs to obtain the certification. Treated water should be used and the prasadam/food products should not be kept in the open but always stored in containers with lids. The prasadam packets should carry the packing and expiry dates. All handlers were required to be medically certified that they were free from communicable diseases. There should also be proper vessel cleaning, waste and sewage disposal systems. According to R. Ramesh Babu, District Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration, the facilities and processes adopted at the three temples were found to be good by and large and about 10 to 15 points have been raised in the pre-audit which would have to be rectified by the respective temple administration. Once the corrective measures are in place, a post-audit will be conducted. All temples where prasaam and annadhanams are distributed are planned to be covered in a phased manner under the BHOG initiative, Dr. Ramesh Babu said and added that the Department of HR & CE was extending its full cooperation in the exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pre-audit-carried-out-at-three-temples-for-bhog-certification/article35089743.ece
02 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Now, painting recreated in powder||R. Lavanya, who excels in Thanjavur painting, has taken to recreating the heritage art through rangoli floor decoration using coloured powder. She recently showcased the art with samples of Yashodha-Krishna and Krishnan Vennai Thaali drawn and filled in with glittering rangoli powder on the floor of her Sri Ranga Tanjore Art Gallery on Amma Mandapam Road at Srirangam. “Most people are familiar with costly framed Thanjavur paintings that are usually displayed on walls. Recreating them as rangoli pictures will make it more accessible to the public. And they will also provide a talking point to social gatherings,” Ms. Lavanya told The Hindu . Measuring 30 inches by 24 inches, each of the rangoli designs took Ms. Lavanya and her seven assistants around five hours to create. “We have tried to stay as true to the painting methodology as possible. For larger areas, we used regular kolam powders. Around seven glitter powders were used for the special focus spots on the paintings. We got through at least 20 quarter kg powder packets,” she said. Ms. Lavanya, who is also a certified teacher of Thanjavur painting, said she copied the original design from the collection of drawings handed down to her by her father, L. Ramanujam. “The designs were enlarged digitally and photocopied according to our requirement, but were printed in sections. I glued all the different parts into one huge poster, and then using carbon paper, traced out the design on the floor. We filled in the outlines with the powders. Getting the skin tones and the play of light and shadow right are crucial to Thanjavur painting.” . For public floor displays, she added movable wooden strips embellished with metallic foil paper to ‘frame’ the paintings. “This will keep the artwork safe from inadvertent damage, besides making it look authentic.” The rangoli renditions may also be a more affordable way to enjoy Thanjavur art. “Due to the labour involved, Thanjavur paintings of this size have a market value of at least Rs. 20,000, while a rangoli painting will cost Rs. 10,000,” Ms. Lavanya said. However, regular paintings definitely score in longevity. “Once the function is over, the rangoli will have to be swept off the floor, unlike paintings that can last for several centuries,” she pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-painting-recreated-in-powder/article35090213.ece
02 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Srirangam temple gets fire hydrant system||A fire hydrant system has been put in place at the Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple to deal with fire. The system has been installed following a fire audit. Water for the operation of the new system would be drawn from the ‘Chandrapushkarani’ using a motor and would pass through pipelines to the hose reel from where it would be sprayed on the fire. Temple authorities said the new fire fighting system has been installed at three places within the huge temple complex - near Karthigai Gopuram; near Keezhapadi in the ‘moolasthana praharam’; and near the ‘chandrapushkarani.’ It has been installed at a cost of Rs. 3.5 lakh using temple funds, said the authorities. A 5HP motor has been installed to draw water. Trials were conducted on Thursday. Water could be sprayed up to 80 feet through the hose reel. The temple authorities have planned to invite the Fire and Rescue Services Department officials for inspecting the new system and offer suggestions. The new system was in addition to the fire extinguishers installed at vantage points in the temple complex - 43 fire extinguishers are in place apart from buckets containing sand and water to douse fire, said an official. Small fires could be doused using fire extinguishers and buckets filled with sand and water. The fire hydrant system would be required to combat a major fire. The need for the fire hydrant system arose following the outbreak of a major fire at Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai in February 2018. The Srirangam temple witnessed a fire accident in March last year in a ‘prasadam’ stall close to Arya Padaal Vaasal, destroying the stall completely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srirangam-temple-gets-fire-hydrant-system/article35089738.ece
02 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||A remarkable turnaround for a corporation school||A Corporation middle school, which was on the verge of closure due to poor student strength, has made a remarkable turnaround in enrolment. With one more month left for admissions to close, the Corporation Middle School at Bheema Nagar has so far enrolled as many as 356 students, thereby taking its strength to 1,172. The total strength of the 96-year-old school has more than doubled when compared to its maximum strength in the early 90’s. According to the records available, the school was started in 1925. In its formative stage, it received good patronage from the people of Bheema Nagar and its surrounding areas. It had a maximum strength of 450 in the 90’s. With the emergence of government aided and self-financing schools, the Corporation Middle School began loosing its sheen from the later part of 90’s. There were just 44 students in 2014-15 and 56 in 2015-16. Now, it has enrolled 121 students in the kindergarten and 150 students in Class I alone. To the surprise of many, several students who studied in private schools under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian Council of Secondary Education (ICSE) have got admissions in the school now. The transformation can be attributed to the “teaching and learning” atmosphere, under its Headmistress D. Raja Rajeswari. A visit to the school reveals that it is not inferior to any private school in terms of infrastructure and ambience. It has everything, right from smart classrooms to audio-visual learning, manual library to digital library, colourful classrooms to modern furniture. Besides serving morning food to the children, the school has its own YouTube channel and blog. It has become one of the best schools in terms of infrastructure with the individual contribution made by the teachers. As the image of the school spread, many welfare organisations also pitched in with infrastructural development. “Gone are the days when we visited homes to convince the parents to send their wards to our school. Now, parents with children come in droves, seeking admission. Selfless contribution and teamwork have made the dream a reality,’ says Ms. Raja Rajeswari. She added that chances were bright for the enrolment reaching 1,400 which would warrant the expansion of the campus.  Gone are the days when we visited homes to convince the parents to send their wards to our school D.

02 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Auction held for gingelly||In an effort to help gingelly farmers get remunerative price for their produce, the Lalgudi Regulated Market conducted an indirect auction of gingelly for the first time on Wednesday. The auctions would be conducted every week on Wednesdays until the end of the harvest season, R. Sukumar, secretary, Tiruchi District Marketing Committee, told The Hindu . Gingelly is raised on a substantial area as a summer crop in Lalgudi belt, Mr. Sukumar said. Although gingelly auction has been conducted at a few other regulated marktets such as Manachanallur earlier, this is the first time that it was being held at the Lalgudi regulated market. “We have made a good beginning and there was a good response and price. About 7,400 kg was traded for a total price of Rs. 7.40 lakh at the auction. The maximum price at the auction was Rs. 10,316 a quintal and the average price was Rs. 9,400 a quintal,” Mr. Sukumar said. The price at the auction was higher than the open market price, he added. Farmers from Koogur, Nagar and Mayilrangam villages brought in about 100 bags for the auction in which five traders participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/auction-held-for-gingelly/article35089745.ece

The initiative has been taken in the wake of the civic body receiving several complaints regarding dumping of meat waste in waterbodies, on the roadsides, and empty plots by residents. The civic body has roped in a Dindigul-based firm that processes the meat waste and turns it into feed. Speaking to The Hindu , a sanitary supervisor of the civic body said that the firm had offered to take the waste free of cost. “They have given us about 150 bins where the waste can be collected across the 65 wards of the civic body. We have placed them at the 31 micro-composting yards and have instructed vendors at the fish market and meat stalls to bring the waste and dispose of it in these bins,” they said. The city generates about six to eight tonnes of meat and chicken waste in a week, with Sundays, Mondays, and Wednesdays being the days with high output. The waste is collected at a single point in the city, from where the Dindigul-based company collects it every evening. Vendors have been informed that they must dump the waste in the demarcated bins at the nearest micro-composting yard. The Corporation Commissioner has issued a warning stating that vendors who are caught dumping the meat and fish waste in the open and waterbodies would be penalised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dindigul-firm-to-collect-meat-and-fish-waste-from-tiruchi/article35089736.ece

Both were part of Tiruchi Astro Club. Bala Bharathi alias K. Balakrishnan, Principal, Bharathi Matriculation Higher Secondary School, and G. Aazhimukilan, a first-year B.Sc. Physics student of St. Joseph’s Colleg, took part in the International Asteroid Search Campaign. Mr. Bharathi said that the four-member team which took part in the campaign was the only team from Tamil Nadu. They were put through a period of rigorous training to understand the software used and the method of studying asteroids beforehand. “Many people think that one requires a telescope to view and identify asteroids. Although that would help, we used a software called Astronomica, prescribed by NASA,” he said. NASA had a special telescope installed in Hawaii, which takes pictures of the sky at regular intervals. As part of this programme, these photographs are sent to the participants, he said. “We process these photos on the software and are able to view parts of the outer space which have been photographed. Studying it helps us identify moving objects,” he said. Once a moving object is identified, some tests need to be conducted to identify it. “A detailed report is sent to NASA through the campaign, and after they conduct preliminary studies, we receive preliminary approval,” he said. The three asteroids identified by them have been temporarily named BBM2101, BBM2102, and BBM2103. “NASA will study them in detail, determining orbit, size, speed, following which they would be given an official name, for which we would be consulted too,’ he said. A total of 167 asteroids were discovered by the participants. “We are looking to train more students interested in taking part in similar programmes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teacher-student-duo-discovers-3-asteroids/article35089727.ece
02 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Cement unit reaches a milestone||The Reddipalayam Cement Works, UltraTech Cement’s integrated unit located in Ariyalur district, has rreached a milestone of meeting one-fourth of its fuel (heat) requirement through utilisation of waste materials sourced from local municipal corporations and industries. The unit has also successfully reduced carbon dioxide emission by 2,250 tonnes per annum. The unit sources municipal waste from 11 local municipal corporations, including Ariyalur, Erode, Kumbakonam, Thanjavur, Perambalur and Karur and also from cities such as Chennai and Kozikhode. This waste is co-processed in its cement kilns as alternative fuel. The alternative fuels initiative has cut down the burden on the landfills and helped reduce air and soil pollution in towns and cities. Reddipalayam Cement Works also co-processes plastic waste sourced from the paper industries located in multiple cities in Tamil Nadu, including Karur, Tiruchi and Coimbatore. Refuse derived fuel (RDF) from professional organisations and industrial wastes from Tamil Nadu based industries also contribute as alternative fuel for the unit. The unit was one of the early adopters of the Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials (AFR) technology in the Indian cement industry, starting in 2003. As a result of the investments made to improve usage of alternative fuels, the Reddipalayam Cement Works has achieved a consistent thermal substitution rate (TSR) of more than 25% for the current calendar on a year to date (YTD) basis. The company is working to reduce the consumption of primary materials in its manufacturing process through various innovations and recycling waste and by-products from other industries for use as alternative resources. This helps the company to lower its dependence on fossil fuels and natural raw materials in cement manufacturing as part of its long-term objective to decarbonise its operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cement-unit-reaches-a-milestone/article35089726.ece

Sheker Kumar Niraj, then Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), was the chairperson of the committee, which had six other members, including elephant experts Ajay Desai and N. Sivaganesan. It was asked to submit an evaluation report in six months. A senior official of the Department, who was asked to facilitate the committee, told The Hindu that it did not submit the report. While Mr. Niraj was transferred from the post to Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Special Secretary (Forests), Environment and Forests Department, a key member — Mr. Desai — passed away in November. The Department formed a second committee with 11 experts on July 4, 2020, to study the elephant population and its movement in Tamil Nadu from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2020. Mr. Niraj was tasked with heading the committee, with S. Anand, District Forests Officer, Madurai, being the member-secretary. This committee had all the seven members of the first one, and Mr. Anand and three others as additional members. The Department had asked the committee to submit a report by December 31, 2020, after looking into the state of the habitats, estimation of the cost of restoring them, the human-wildlife conflict and the measures needed to minimise it, and the pattern of births and deaths. A senior official of the Department said no data were provided by field officials for the study, and COVID-19 posed a hindrance to field visits. A member of both committees said no field work had been undertaken. S.

02 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BMRCL looks for land on city outskirts for afforestation||The lack of openspace in the city is forcing Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) to look for land on the outskirts to take up compensatory afforestation. Recently, the BMRCL received permission to fell 604 trees for building the Kothanur depot. While awarding permission, the Deputy Conservator of Forests of Bengaluru Urban Division (tree officer) ordered the BMRCL to come up with an action plan to plant 6,040 saplings as compensation for the loss. However, finding land is proving to be a challenge. The BMRCL has now identified 96 acres within the Defence and Aerospace Park to plant the saplings. Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) had acquired land for the park, which is located near Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). More than 152 acres of land is available to plant saplings. The corporation has identified one more location — the BSF campus at Karahalli — to plant another 3,150 saplings. This initiative has been taken to compensate the removal of trees to build the Langford underground station and carry out tunnel work. The Forest Department had permitted the axing of 276 trees, while 39 trees will be relocated. The trees identified for felling include jackfruit, sandalwood, rosewood, neem, gulmohar, and eucalyptus. Within the city limits, defence land is proving to be an ideal choice to take up afforestation work. The BMRCL has received permission from defence authorities to plant over 3,000 saplings on their land at Domlur, Neelasandra, Iblur, and other areas. This is compensation for the felling of trees at Kadugodi plantation and Benniganahalli tank bund areas, and to build an underground network from South Ramp (Jayanagar metro) to North Ramp (Nagawara). ‘Use encroached land’ Environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy said that over the years, provisions of the Karnataka Preservation of Tree Act have been diluted so that trees can be felled for infrastructure projects. When asked about compensatory afforestation work, he said, “Taking up afforestation works on army land in Bengaluru is a good initiative. Around 8,000 acres of army land is available within city limits. Even if 2,000 acres are available for afforestation, it is good enough. Likewise, taking up afforestation on the outskirts has its benefits. Though it is a scattered approach, cumulatively it has benefits.” He added that there was a need to take up afforestation work on land that was cleared of encroachers by the Bengaluru Urban district administration. “I have written to the BMRCL and they have given a positive reply,” he said. Asper the terms, BMRCL has to take up compensatory afforestation through an agency having expertise in the work and maintain the saplings for three years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-looks-for-land-on-city-outskirts-for-afforestation/article35089508.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mentor system for those who do not have gadgets, internet facility||The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has devised an ambitious plan for students who do not have access to either gadgets or internet connectivity and cannot attend online classes, one that will involve both parents and teachers. The goal is to ensure that children who are at a disadvantage are mentored constantly by their teachers. Parents will have to meet with their children’s teachers at least once every fortnight to discuss learning outcomes. A survey conducted towards the end of the 2020-21 academic year revealed that over 31 lakh students in Karnataka from classes one to 10 in private and public schools did not have access to gadgets needed for online learning. V. Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, told The Hindu that the department had collected and mapped out data of students who have gadgets and internet connectivity. “Those who don’t have access will have to take the assistance of their parents and teachers for the 2021–22 academic year,” he said. He added that students would be given workbooks and self-learning material in order to develop competencies in different areas. Mr. Anbukumar pointed out that a few students who do not have access to mobile, tablet computer, computers or any other devices, may get access to mobiles from their relatives or neighbours for a few hours every day. “We have asked teachers to identify such children and ensure that they are at least able to download some of the online content and watch them,” he said. He said that one teacher would mentor 15 students who do not have access to gadgets. These teachers would meet the parents of the children once a fortnight and analyse what these students have learned and what concepts they have not been able to grasp. However, the plan has come under criticism from some quarters, with experts pointing out that thegovernment was putting the onus on parents. Many parents from lower socio-economic sections of society may not be able to help their children. H.K. Manjunath, president, High School Assistant Masters’ Association, said there was a need for the State government to conduct an outreach programme and provide gadgets to at least all class 10 government school students who do not have access to any of them. “Students belonging to government schools come from extremely poor socio-economic backgrounds and they need to attend online classes so that their learning is not disrupted,” he said. Urban-rural divide The largest chunk of students who fall under this category are from government schools. Private school managements point out that the majority of their students have access to at least a smart phone if not computers and laptops. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said the percentage of students who did not have access to gadgets in urban areas in private schools could be estimated to be less than 10. He, however, conceded that in rural areas, the percentage of students who did not have access to gadgets was nearly 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mentor-system-for-those-who-do-not-have-gadgets-internet-facility/article35089529.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Stringent action taken on demand for ‘commission’ to upload applications: Govt.||The State government on Thursday told the High Court of Karnataka that it has taken stringent action to stop illegal demand for Rs. 100-Rs. 250 as ‘commission’ by Seva Sindhu and other e-service centres for uploading applications of worker from unorganised sectors for availing Rs. 2,000 financial package announced by the government in view of the COVID-19 second wave lockdown. The government clarified to the court that beneficiaries are required to pay only Rs. 25 as fee at BangaloreOne, Karnataka One, Seva Sindhu Centres, Grama One, Common Service Centres, and District Service Centres to upload application forms. The government said that a person, working in the outsourced agency manning State’s Seva Sindhu helpline, has been removed from the job for saying beneficiaries have to pay Rs. 100-Rs. 250 as ‘commission’. These statements were made before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj that had asked the government’s response to a racket unearthed during discreet enquiries made in disguise by officers of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority in eight districts. Modify process G. Kalpana, Additional Chief Secretary, Labour Department, who appeared before the Bench through videoconference, said the department has taken up the issue of collection of ‘commission’ with other departments like e-governance Department, which controls e-service centres. She also said that the Labour Department had issued an advertisement in several newspapers stating that only a fee of Rs. 25 is required to be paid at the centres. To a query by the Bench on why domestic workers are required to get certificate of employment from a gazetted officer, Ms. Kalpana said the government would modify the process to make payment of Rs. 2,000. Hearing adjourned While directing the government to ensure that the process to avail relief be made hassle free and the entitled should get the amount without difficulty, the Bench adjourned further hearing to July 5 asking the government to submit the modified process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stringent-action-taken-on-demand-for-commission-to-upload-applications-govt/article35089538.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru has far fewer public toilets: Survey||The number of public and community toilets in Bengaluru is very low when compared with the number of toilets in cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad in proportion to the population, pointed out a survey of toilets in the city submitted to the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday. The survey report states that operation and maintenance of community toilets by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is poor but those community toilets maintained by private agencies are comparatively better. However, the maintenance of public toilets appears to be quite good when compared with community toilets, the report states. Chennai, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad have better community and public toilet ratio per 1,000 population, per square kilometre, per ward, and per 100 km road length, the report stated. For example, Chennai and Ahmedabad have 25 and 15 toilets, respectively, per 100 km road length but Bengaluru as only five.  However, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindar, which took note of the survey report submitted by the BBMP, found that the survey had not conducted the exercise of requirement of ward-wise public toilets for the city. The Bench was hearing a PIL petition, filed by city-based Letzkit Foundation, complaining about failure of the BBMP to provide sufficient number of public privies as per mandate of the law. The survey, conducted by the All India Institute of Local Self Government, a private institute, also pointed out that available data is still not sufficient to capture the correct number of existing public and community toilets, and the BBMP needs to update and reconcile the records to generate a comprehensive database on toilets for future planning. Among the total 555 public toilets, the BBMP has built 462 toilets and 93 toilets are built by private agencies under different schemes catering to floating population, the report stated while pointing out that of the 462 public toilets built by the BBMP, 32 are not functional, and 22 of them can be functional by repairing. Floating population These public toilets offer 3,528 seats, catering to a population of 2 lakh to 8 lakh and this number is on a much lower side when compared with the estimated floating population for Bengaluru city, which is estimated to be about 21 lakh in 2021 as per Swachh City Plan prepared for the city. Stating that there are 95 community toilet complexes in eight zones of the BBMP, the report said total toilet seats provided in these complexes are 760, catering to a population of about 26,000. Of these 95 toilet complexes 23 are non-functional, and 18 of them can be repaired to make them operational, and five are not repairable. The Bench adjourned further hearing till August, asking the BBMP to take remedial measures based on input given in the report and take steps to estimate the number of public toilets required for the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-has-far-fewer-public-toilets-survey/article35089504.ece

This comes in the wake of a court direction to the State government to take up a complete survey following recommendations of the CSIR- National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). In a letter to N. Manjunath Prasad, Principal Secretary, Revenue Department, Rakesh Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department, stated that the survey should include complete details of encroachments and mark the boundaries of the lakes coming under the valley, storm-water drains, survey number of villages, and agricultural run-off, etc. Buffer zones have to be marked at 30 metres for lakes and 15 metres for drains. Mr. Prasad told The Hindu that the survey work had already been taken up. The department has taken satellite images and maps have been prepared. While within the BBMP limits, the marking of buffer zones and fencing will be taken up by the civic body, the Minor Irrigation Department would take up a similar exercise outside the city corporation limits. A meeting was held with officials of various departments and civic agencies, including the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) on June 21. The priority, he said, was to first ensure no sewage or any other pollutant enters the river that has been reduced to a drain. “This exercise will be similar to the one taken up for the development of the K-100 drain by the BBMP. Those polluting the river are being identified,” said Mr. Prasad, and added that the BBMP and the BWSSB had been directed to take immediate steps. According to the minutes of the meeting, the BDA and the BBMP have been directed to deploy personnel or marshals to patrol the periphery of the 30-odd lakes coming under the valley to check for unauthorised developments. The KSPCB has been directed to monitor the quality of wastewater coming into drains and lakes, while the BDA and the BBMP have been instructed to clear the accumulated silt from the drains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/survey-on-vrishabhavati-valley-system-begins/article35089513.ece

The memorial is said to be the first of its kind in the country. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who made the announcement on the occasion of Doctors’ Day at Arogya Soudha on Thursday, said the memorial would come up on the premises of the Soudha. ‘Martyrdom’ Terming the loss of lives during the pandemic as “martyrdom”, Dr. Sudhakar said over 700 doctors have died during COVID-19 duty. “As doctors and health warriors who died during the war against COVID-19 are also martyrs, the government has decided to build a memorial in Arogya Soudha to commemorate their sacrifice. A model will be designed soon, and will be inaugurated by the Chief Minister. The families can come and pay their respects on a particular day,” he said. Attackers warned The minister also condemned attacks on health professionals and medical staff by relatives of patients. “Doctors try to save the lives of patients till the last breath. No one lets them die. People should not take law into their hands. Strict legal action will be initiated against the defaulters. It is an offence punishable up to seven years of imprisonment,” warned Dr. Sudhakar. Later, speaking at a similar function by the IMA, he urged all doctors to register themselves in the association. “The issue of stipend has been pending for several years.

Shivakumar claimed, the State government had been under-reporting deaths. The party will provide a list of COVID-19 deaths in Karnataka to the government after completing the survey, he told mediapersons in Bengaluru on Thursday. “COVID warriors will visit each house and collect the data,” he said. Senior leaders of the party too will visit villages as observers, said Mr. Shivakumar, who visited Chamarajanagar on June 29 and met families of the deceased. The party will pay compensation to families who had lost their members owing to COVID-19, he said. Blaming the government for the deaths of 26 patients owing to shortage of oxygen in Chamarajanagar district hospital during the second wave, the KPCC chief accused the district in-charge Minister (S. Suresh Kumar) of misleading the public. Mr. Shivakumar alleged that hospital staff removed jewellery, such as ear and nose rings from bodies. Moreover, the government has not paid adequate compensation to families impacted by the pandemic, he said. The Congress welcomed the Supreme Court directive to the Centre on framing guidelines within six weeks for ex-gratia to family members of those who lost their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre alleged that there were glaring differences in actual COVID-19 deaths and the figures given by the BJP government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-to-audit-covid-19-deaths-in-karnataka/article35089532.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Garment industry seeks permission to function at full capacity||As more lockdown restrictions are expected to ease by Monday, the labour-intensive garment industry has asked the State government for permission to function at full capacity. While the government has allowed factories to work at 50% capacity, the garment industry has been allowed to function with 30% workforce. The Karnataka Employers’ Association on Thursday appealed to the government to enhance workforce strength to 100% or at least 75% in the interest of the industry as vaccination of employees had commenced. Garment units here have received good national and international orders with strict deadlines, and units could face penalty if they are not adhered to. It said over 1,000 export oriented units in Karnataka had been severely hit by the lockdown, and estimated the losses to be Rs. 5,250 crore. The garment industry in the State has about 10 lakh employees, mostly women. ‘Diversion possible’ The association, in a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, said that due to the severe restrictions in Karnataka, customers were looking at States such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala where such curbs were not enforced on the garment industry. Another significant development, the association pointed out, was that though Bangladesh was under strict lockdown, it had allowed export-oriented industries, including garments, to function with 100% manpower. The association said that garment manufacturing requires all employees in the assembly line and reduction in workforce affects production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/garment-industry-seeks-permission-to-function-at-full-capacity/article35089543.ece

Following news about distribution of food kits to workers, hundreds of them started lining up in front of Lamington School here hoping to receive food kits from the Labour Department. According to people who gathered in front of the school, they received information about food kit distribution taking place at the school on Thursday and they arrived early to collect it. As people lined up early in the morning, the police too rushed to the spot to control the crowd and made efforts to ensure adherence to COVID-19 guidelines which, however, did not succeed. To add to the confusion, there were no officials from the Labour Department. Even staff of the department were not present there to give proper information. The police also had no clue about what was happening. And, ultimately, after news about people’s congregation at the school spread, the police received information that the distribution would not take place. Consequently, the disappointed workers dispersed after having waited for around three hours. Meanwhile, an official of the department on the condition of anonymity said that because of misinformation a large number of people had gathered at the school. Arrangements will be made to distribute food kits to workers at different localities. Surprisingly, later in the day, a food kit distribution programme was held in the city with limited beneficiaries being allowed to participate in it. Some of the media persons who had gone to cover the event were not allowed inside the premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/workers-wait-in-vain-for-food-kits-from-labour-department/article35089790.ece

Passengers used to witness the beauty of the ghats either through the windows or by standing at the doors of coaches when trains passed through the ghat section between Sakleshpur and Subrahmanya Road stations. Vistadome coaches with their transparent ceiling, wide window panes and 180-degree rotatable recliner seats, however, will offer greater outside view for passengers. A release here said that Train No 06211/06212 Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur tri-weekly express special will get the Vistadome coaches from July 7 from Yeshwantpur and from July 8 from Mangaluru Junction.

These and 37 other cyber crimes where women are targeted are included in the fourth version of Cyber Safe Girl, which was virtually released by Chairperson of National Commission for Women Rekha Sharma and commission member Shyamala Kunder on Thursday. Cyber expert and Professor in Mangaluru-based Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management Ananth G. Prabhu has brought out this book in association with Mumbai-based advocate Prashanth Jhala and Deputy Superintendent of Police, Karnataka Criminal Investigation Department K.N. Yashavantha Kumar. The e-version of this book can be downloaded from the website,www.cybersafegirl.com. Mr. Prabhu said that the uniqueness of the book series is the use of “infotoons” (cartoons to explain the information) to make it simple for people to understand the different cyber crimes. In addition, information is given about sections under Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act under which offenders can be booked for such crimes. Tips are also given to prevent one from falling a victim. Mr. Prabhu said that the first version was brought out in 2017 and it contained information on 15 cyber crimes. The second version had information on 25, while the third version has information on 30 cyber crimes. “To make it more interesting, we have brought out an animation version of the series,” he said and added that the animation version of the fourth in the series will be out in a fortnight. Launching the book’s fourth version, Ms. Sharma said that because of lockdown many are hooked to computers and hence, there is an increase in cyber crime, especially targeting women. Women are not only being targeted on the social media but they are also becoming victims of financial fraud. The National Commission for Women is actively involved in initiatives that make women aware of these crimes. It is creating safe environment for women to report crime.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Party will decide CM face: Siddaramaiah||Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah said here on Thursday that there was no discussion within the party on projecting a Chief Ministerial face during the next Assembly elections. He told reporters here the elections are almost 2 years away and based on the outcome of the polls the party high command will take a decision. The issue gained traction when a few party workers began airing their views and projected individuals or their leaders as the “next CM’’ of Karnataka. This was frowned upon by the party leadership which issued a directive calling upon the party members to desist from making such statements. When MLAs supportive of Mr. Siddaramaiah openly stated that the latter would be the next Chief Minister, it led to heartburn among others including the supporters of KPCC President D.K. Shivakumar, another strong contender waiting in the wings. Mr. Siddaramaiah also made light of the “natives or party loyalists vs migrant’’ debate and said he joined Congress after quitting Janata Dal (Secular) and not only went on to become the Chief Minister, but also completed 5 years in office. Responding to speculations that the party top brass in the State was squabbling over the post of Karnataka Pradesh Youth Congress president, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that he had nothing to do with it as it was an independent body and the national Youth Congress president would resolve it. SSLC exam Mr. Siddaramaiah questioned the government’s decision to go ahead with the SSLC examination despite the pandemic. He told media persons that while the PUC examination has been cancelled there was no reason to go ahead with SSLC examination the timetable for which has been announced. “I had spoken to the Education Minister on this issue and had expressed my opposition to the conduct of the SSLC” examination. But there seem to be a lack of coordination within the government and among different Ministers on various subjects.’. It is also evident in the handling of the pandemic and has now affected the vaccination drive in the State." He wondered why there would be such rush and confusion to get vaccinated in case there was adequate stock of vaccines. The government also lied on the number of deaths due to oxygen shortage in Chamarajanagar and almost 2 months after the tragedy nobody has been held responsible or action initiated against them, Mr. Siddaramaiah added. He flayed Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for not visiting the district despite the tragedy and attributed it to the fear of losing his post; a fear rooted in the superstitious belief that any Chief Minister who visits Chamarajanagarloses the post. “It is evident that Mr. Yediyurappa’s desire for power and fear of losing it, has not diminished. When I was the Chief Minister I visited Chamarajanagar 5 times and also completed by tenure’’, he added. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the government was hesitant to convene the monsoon session of the Assembly as it lacked “moral courage” to face the Opposition on its handling of the pandemic and other issues. Calls on Suttur seer Earlier, Mr. Siddaramaiah called on Suttur seer Sri Shivaratri Deshikendra Swamiji. This was Mr. Siddaramaiah’s first visit to Mysuru after nearly 2 months and hence a large number of Congress workers and his loyalists made a beeline to his house.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/party-will-decide-cm-face-siddaramaiah/article35089992.ece

The houseboat sector came to a grinding halt two months ago after the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic started sweeping the State, which forced the government to declare a Statewide lockdown. ‘Nothing in package’ The pandemic-stricken sector, which finds nothing to cheer for in the Centre’s stimulus package announced earlier this week, sees reopening as the first step towards a long road to normalisation. “The credit guarantee schemes announced by the Union Finance Minister are in no way beneficial to small tourism business owners like houseboats. It is purely for Ministry of Tourism-certified travel agents and licensed guides. That too is a very late and small help to the sinking ship. The governments should allow us to do business by opening up or at least announce the dates for opening up rather than announcing more loans,” said Jobin J. Akkarakalam, vice-president, Kerala Houseboat Owners’ Federation. Direct cash benefit Mr. Akkarakalam said direct cash benefits to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), looking at the average Goods and Services Tax remitted in the last three years, would be a great support to SMEs. It would help pay off creditors, which would also help bring in more money circulation in the market. Kevin Rozario, general secretary, All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Samiti, said they were awaiting a nod from the government to resume operations. “Houseboats remained anchored for six months in 2020. After the sector reopened in October, the business never returned to pre-COVID-19 times due to poor tourist footfall. The second wave of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have spelled disaster for the sector. It is important that houseboat operations resume at the earliest. Most of the employees and owners in Alappuzha have already received at least one jab of the COVID-19 vaccine and are awaiting the government decision on reopening,” said Mr. Rozario. Several owners have taken bank loans and the crisis has pushed a number of them into a debt trap. Apart from the owners, a large number of people allied with the sector have found the going tough. ‘Vaccinate all in sector’ The State government is planning to open tourism destinations in a phased manner. “To reopen, all workers in the sector need to be vaccinated. Several people in Alappuzha have already received the shots and steps are being taken to vaccinate the rest,” said a State Tourism Department official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/houseboat-sector-seeks-early-reopening/article35089939.ece

He was inaugurating ‘Thiruvathira Njattuvela with Agricultural University,’ a programme of Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) at Muhamma here on Thursday. “To ensure that farmers lead a dignified life, their income should be increased. Farmers should be at the forefront of society. The government has launched several projects to increase their income,” Mr. Prasad said. Through the programme, the KAU aims to bring high-yielding seeds, planting materials, organic fertilizers, and value-added products developed by the university to the doorstep of farmers. Compensation for loss The Minister said the government would compensate farmers who suffered losses in climate change-induced natural calamities through schemes like crop insurance. He said agriculture should become a part of life and urged people to engage in agriculture for at least 30 minutes every day. Muhamma grama panchayat vice president N.T. Reji presided.

The decision to close down the centre was taken on the basis of a fall in the number of patients seeking treatment in hospitals. About 4,200 patients from Thrissur and Ernakulam districts had received treatment at the centre after the convention centre was converted into a first-line treatment centre in July last. The centre was spread over about 30,000 sq.ft. It was made a second-line treatment centre in November last, according to an official release. The centre had facilities to provide treatment to 250 patients as per the pandemic protocol. It also had a plant that could provide oxygen support to nearly 150 persons. About 500 medical staff, including 30 doctors, had offered their services at the centre. District Collector S. Suhas said the rush at the Government Medical College Hospital and other hospitals was managed after the treatment centre started functioning. CIAL had provided water and electricity as part of its corporate social responsibility programme. Mr. Suhas, who holds charge of Managing Director of the airport, had asked the airport officials to take over the convention centre as the functioning of the treatment centre had ended. After two weeks of disinfection and cleaning, the centre will be opened for weddings and other functions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-treatment-centre-at-nedumbassery-closes-down/article35089877.ece

While extending their wholehearted support for the successful completion of projects, CLAF sought the completion of all road and other projects as per schedule, since several works suffered delay owing to many reasons including the pandemic. CLAF members appreciated CSML developing Abraham Madamakal Road into a smart road and called upon the agency to elevate all roads to that level. They said taking up the sewerage project (STP plant in West Kochi) at the envisaged location might not be practical, considering the situation (opposition from the locality) and proposed that a joint meeting be planned to decide the way forward. It was also suggested that the funds with CSML under the canal rejuvenation scheme could be transferred to Operation Breakthrough, to dredge and clean Mullassery Canal and Rameswaram Calvathy Canal. CSML could explore replacing non-starter projects with new ones for the improvement of city infrastructure and to provide smart solutions to citizens. After a detailed study, such initiatives must be discussed before being finalised, they said, according to an official press release. The team was unanimous in stating that conducting regular interactions with people’s representatives will help the speedy resolution of local issues. The meeting was aimed at discussing the progress of various projects and the issues faced during their implementation. The project progress report on the activities of CSML was released at the meeting. Infrastructure support District Collector S. Suhas thanked CSML for the infrastructure support in the form of the Integrated Command Control and Communication Centre and the oxygen war room for COVID-containment measures. CSML chief executive officer Jafar Malik said major road works in Kochi would be completed by September, and the renovation of the Marine Drive walkway would be completed in a fortnight. Smart road projects in Fort Kochi were affected by the poor performance of the contracting firm, following which its services were terminated. Ongoing works at the Mattancherry hospital will be completed by December 2021, while foundation works for Syed Mohammed Bridge and Calvathy School are in progress. The Ernakulam Market rehabilitation project is expected to be completed by July 2021, and the tender for the new market building will be awarded this month, he added. Mayor M.

02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Transport authority gasping for breath||The Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA), commissioned in November 2020 as an autonomous agency, for revolutionising commuting in the Greater Kochi area is gasping for breath. The agency, readied on the lines of the Transport for London (TFL) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) of Singapore, is the sole MTA in India with full-fledged legislative backing. “Over eight months since its inception, the State government has not appointed technically qualified personnel to conceive projects to decongest the city, streamline modes of commute and to execute them. This is because the Finance Department has not responded to repeated requests seeking its permission to appoint a dozen personnel. Subsequently, the office space at Revenue Tower in the city is idling,” said sources. It does not even have a full-time CEO, with the result that Jafar Malik, the CEO of the Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) and the Managing Director of the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK), is holding additional charge of the body. It has as Special Officer Shaji Madhavan, who was recently promoted as Deputy Transport Commissioner. Devoid of dedicated personnel, the KMTA is unable to ready plans and to implement them, although a sum of Rs. 2.5 crore was allotted in the State Budget. “Adequate number of technical hands like traffic planners and urban designers are crucial for the KMTA to overcome its birth pangs. Only then can the body, which wields tremendous powers to integrate and streamline multiple modes of commute, function effectively. The immediate tasks at hand include revising Kochi’s Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP), which will study rerouting of buses through corridors where there is demand, readying of a parking policy which would enable identification of parking lots through a digital platform, and streamlining the entry of buses from the Goshree islands into the city, for which NATPAC is expected to submit a study report in three months,” the sources said. On its part, the government must ready a notification to bring areas under the Greater Cochin Development Authority and Goshree Islands Development Authority too under the KMTA, so that reforms benefit commuters in suburban towns as well. Minister’s assurance Responding to the issue, Minister for Transport Antony Raju (who chaired a KMTA meeting in June) said that a framework would be shortly readied so that decisions taken at the two KMTA meetings held so far could be implemented, in keeping with the body’s vision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/teething-troubles-for-kochi-transport-authority/article35089863.ece
02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A hand of help for special children||The pandemic has been unsparing for people from all walks of life and more so for special children. Considering the nightmarish life of special children forced inside their homes away from their peers and teachers they love, Mission Better Tomorrow, an NGO, has come up with an initiative, God’s Own Children, for their well-being. “The project will operate closely in association with organisations and agencies, including the government, already working for the welfare of special children. We will hold consultations with the existing stakeholders to identify gaps and implement specific projects to plug them,” said Saif Muhammad, CEO, Mission Better Tomorrow. The project will be announced on Friday by noted singer K.S. Chithra and P. Vijayan, Director, Social Policing, marking the 50th episode of the NGO’s popular interactive talk show Pos Poss. Special children selected from different schools in Kerala will also interact with the singer. “The idea is to make the project a platform to bring together the audience and organisers of the talk show for the cause of special children,” said Mr. Muhammed. Pos Poss, the abbreviated form of positivity and possibilities, was originally launched by Mission Better Tomorrow during the lockdown last year as a short-term relief for people from the pandemic blues. “We noted a lot of negativity and desperation around during our societal interactions at that time. We realised that there are two ways for people to emerge from that dump, looking at the positive side and the possibilities that the situation presents,” said Mr. Muhammed. Spreading positivity Thus was born Pos Poss, roping in people who have spread positivity and emerged successful in various walks of life. What was originally conceived as a short-term programme has now survived two lockdowns and two waves of the pandemic to celebrate the 50th episode, which is being dedicated to special children. The show now boasts average viewership of around 3 lakh people. More than 125 eminent personalities, including national award winning actor Mohanlal, former director of Infosys S.D. Shibulal, Olympian Anju Bobby George, poet and present Chief Secretary V.P. Joy, and many other civil servants interacted with the audience through the show. The show is streamed live every Friday between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. over Zoom and Facebook and YouTube channel of Mission Better Tomorrow. The show is usually anchored by members of the NGO. But the 50th episode will be anchored by actor and celebrity anchor Jayaraj Warrier.

The major short-term impact of the pandemic is reported as difficulty in payment of rents and draining away of savings while the long-term impact includes job and financial insecurity, said B.S. Sumalatha (Department of Economics), Lekha D. Bhat (Department of Epidemiology and Public Health), and K.P. Chitra (Department of Social Work) in their paper titled ‘Impact of COVID-19 on the Informal Sector: A Study of Women Domestic Workers in India’ published in the Indian Economic Journal on June 25. Nearly 260 domestic workers in Delhi, Mumbai, and Kochi were interviewed as part of the study held between August and November last. “Debts increased for 10% of the families and more than 11% families were forced to sell their personal assets for survival. About 57% domestic workers reported stigma and discrimination at workplace, and 40% worked without any safety measures,” the paper said. It was found that 35% of the respondents managed the household expenses with the reduced income whereas 24.2% families made use of the existing savings to meet their needs. About 44 families (17%) are taking help in cash/kind from immediate relatives, while 49 families (18.8%) are managing the household expenses with funds borrowed from moneylenders About 50.4% experienced reduced salary, increased workload or both together. They felt that employers consciously tried to exploit their vulnerability. The respondents reported an increase in domestic violence (25%), increase in household workload (42.3%), increase of stress in marital relationship (12.7%) and loss of self-respect due to job loss (8.5%). More than 90% of the domestic workers reported anxiety as a mental health condition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-hit-domestic-workers-hard/article35089893.ece

High School first in district to have a geography lab||Government High School, Vennala, has become the first school in Ernakulam district to have a geography lab. Most of the items in the dedicated room, which has 35 exhibits, were assembled by a team of geography teachers from scratch, using plywood and metal pieces, plastic balls (to feature planets) and other materials. The lab has almost everything that school students learn in their geography lessons — from the solar system to innumerable spatial objects and other phenomena. Many of the displays are motorised and work to precision, showing among other aspects the different phases of a moon and the Milky Way. “The lab is open to students from other schools as well, including unaided ones and those that follow CBSE and ICSE curriculum,” said Jolly Sebastian, Headmistress, who teaches social science. “Here, children get a better idea of how climate change occurs and aspects like the functioning of polar and GEO satellites. We have planned an exhibition of these items at our auditorium to reach out to a wider audience,” she said. Social science teachers Biji K.S. and Farzana A.A. said the geography lab at the school was distinctive since almost all schools had only science and language labs. Recently, a total of 42 social science teachers were trained here under the aegis of the Urban Resource Centre (URC), which spearheaded the project. It would help establish more such labs in their schools, they said. Such labs help students have a better idea of the basis of astrophysics and usher in confidence among them to pursue such streams. It must be included in the curriculum, they added. SSK initiative The lab was an initiative under the Samagra Shiksha Kerala project, wherein a geography lab was planned in each district, said Abdul Shukkur, a trainer with Ernakulam URC. “A national achievement survey shed light on how most school students from Kerala were not performing well in geography. Our contribution to the venture at Vennala school was Rs. 30,000, while the rest was teamwork,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vennala-govt-high-school-first-in-district-to-have-a-geography-lab/article35089868.ece
02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Bereavement aid may become part of cop training||Bereavement support may shortly become part of police training. Talking to The Hindu , P. Vijayan, Director of Social Policing, said such a proposal would be taken up at the level of the State Police Chief shortly. Nearly 4,000 accident deaths and thousands of suicides are reported in the State annually. “The victims are mostly in the 18-50 age group and are central to their families. Their sudden death leave a traumatic and irreparable void in the lives of their dear ones. Scientifically equipping the police, the first responders in any emergency or disaster, to deal with the emotional trauma of the victims' families will turn them into a compassionate professional force,” said Mr. Vijayan. What inspired the proposal is the Bereavement Companionship Programme being run jointly by the Mission Better Tomorrow, an NGO, the Institute of Palliative Medicine, and the Sydney-based Death Literacy Institute. “The programme is aimed at creating a pool of trained bereavement support volunteers at the community level,” said Suresh Kumar, founder director, Institute of Palliative Medicines, a collaborating centre of the World Health Organisation. The interactive programme is designed based on the feedback from people who have gone through bereavement in the last five years. The 15-hour programme is split into online sessions spread over three days. The sessions are now conducted by Kerrie Noonan, director of the Death Literacy Institute and a globally reputed bereavement therapist. The sessions in English are translated into Malayalam in real time basis. Army of volunteers “Gradually our trained volunteers will take over the sessions. The idea is to run the programme for at least five years so that a critical mass of volunteers are created, including people’s representatives and religious figures who closely associate with bereavement,” said Dr. Kumar. The first batch of 20 volunteers has completed the training and the second batch will commence in the second week of this month. Anyone aged 21 years and above can attend the programme and there is no other eligibility criteria except to ensure regional and gender balance. “Complex issues like guilt associated with grieving often go unaddressed. Volunteers undergoing the programme for bereavement support need to do it in a self-reflective way realising their own strengths and weaknesses,” said Saif Mohammed, CEO, Mission Better Tomorrow. Meanwhile, the programme seems to have inspired an offshoot with the Kozhikode-based Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences announcing a foundational bereavement course for psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers and clinical psychologists for handling those found vulnerable in managing grief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bereavement-aid-may-become-part-of-cop-training/article35089914.ece
02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||State trying to impede probe, ED tells HC||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday submitted before the Kerala High Court that the State government had constituted a judicial commission headed by former High Court Judge V.K. Mohanan with a view to impeding the investigations being carried out by the ED and National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the diplomatic gold smuggling and money laundering cases. The submission was made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the ED when a petition challenging the constitution of the commission came up before Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar for hearing. The commission has been constituted to inquire into the allegations that Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, prime accused in the gold smuggling and money laundering cases, were compelled to give statements implicating Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other officials in the gold smuggling case. Forced statements He submitted that the judicial commission had been constituted for circumventing the High Court verdict quashing the two First Information Reports (FIRs) filed by the State police against some unnamed officials of the ED, Kochi, for allegedly forcing the accused to give false statements against the Chief Minister and other government officials. The Solicitor General submitted that, in fact, it was the Special Court constituted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which could deal with the allegations of such nature and the government could not conduct a parallel inquiry by way of appointing a judicial commission. Criminal investigation Moreover, a judicial commission could not be constituted to inquire into a matter in which a criminal investigation was being conducted under the monitoring of a court. He further contended that the State government lacked inherent jurisdiction to appoint a judicial commission. The Central government alone could constitute a commission to deal with matters under List I of the Constitution. Advocate General K. Gopalakrishna Kurup contended that the ED's petition was not maintainable as a department under the Central government could not file a petition against a State government. A department was not a body corporate that could sue or be sued. Since the matter involved a dispute between the State and Centre, the ED should have approached the Supreme Court under Article 131. Besides, the ED was not trying to enforce any fundamental or statuary right by filing the writ petition under Article 226.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-impeding-probe-hc-told/article35089894.ece

The sales had reached around 3.65 lakh litres per day. The quantity that could not be sold was being converted into value-added products, he said. The farmers have been told that the milk cooperative would procure the entire quantity of milk available with them after ensuring the quality of the produce. The cooperative had suffered some financial losses in procuring the entire quantity of milk from farmers in the wake of the second COVID-19 wave, added Mr. Theruvath. The regional cooperative approved a budget outlay of Rs. 739.04 crore for the current financial year. The incentives being offered to the farmers included disbursal of Rs. 18 lakh for ensuring quality of the milk being procured, said Mr. Theruvath. He said the cooperative wanted to encourage NRIs, who had returned in the wake of the pandemic. The Ernakulam region comprises the districts of Ernakulam, Kottayam, Idukki and Thrissur. The cooperative had set aside money in the budget for expanding its online presence and reaching milk and milk products to all the families in the region, he added. More value-added products as well as better reach in the rural areas are part of the plan by the milk cooperative. The cooperative budget has also set aside Rs. 4.47 crore for contribution to the dairy farmers’ welfare fund and Rs. 1.06 crore for cattle feed stabilisation fund. A total of Rs. 34.23 crore has been earmarked for infrastructure expansion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ercmpu-budget-focuses-on-procurement/article35089871.ece

02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Husband, kin charged with assaulting woman||The Aluva West police have registered a case invoking non-bailable charges against five persons in connection with an incident in which a young, pregnant woman was allegedly beaten up in a suspected dowry-related atrocity on Wednesday evening. The police have arraigned as accused the woman’s husband Mohammad Ali Jouhar, 28, his mother Subaida, 55, his sisters Shabeena and Shareena, and his friend Muhudas. The accused are yet to be arrested. Nehalath, 22, a resident of Thuruth in Aluva, who is four-and-half-a-months pregnant, was allegedly beaten up in the presence of her father Salim after she declined to oblige her husband’s demand to leave him. The incident took place at the couple’s house at Alangad. Jouhar’s mother was also reportedly present at the time. His sisters were charged for allegedly harassing the victim over phone, repeating their brother’s demand. His friend has been accused of assaulting Mr. Salim who intervened when his daughter was allegedly beaten. The case assumes significance in the wake of many alleged dowry-related atrocities and deaths in recent times. Though police went to Jouhar’s house, it was found locked, and he and his mother could not be traced. The couple got married nine months ago and the husband was allegedly paid Rs. 8 lakh and gold worth Rs. 2 lakh. Mr. Salim alleged that his son-in-law kept demanding more money.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/husband-kin-charged-with-assaulting-woman/article35089885.ece
02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Demand of readmission fee violates RTE Act’||Demanding readmission fee and interest on pending school fee amounts to violation of the provisions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, according to the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The commission made this clear on complaints by parents that a section of the unaided school managements was resorting to this practice. They had asked the parents to remit the re-admission fee for students, who had incurred fee arrears in the new academic year. Some of the managements were charging Rs. 1,000 and above as readmission fee. Several parents were not able to remit the fee as per the deadline fixed by the managements as they continued to reel under the financial crisis induced by the pandemic. “Collecting re-admission fee and interest on pending fee amounted to violations of the provisions under the Right to Education Act. As per section 16 of the Act, no child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of the elementary education,” said K. Nazeer, member of the commission. The school managements cannot prevent students from appearing for examinations at the end of the academic year for non-payment of fee. They should not block the examination results and hold back the promotion of the students during primary school as it amounted to violation of the Right to Education Act, according to the commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-of-readmission-fee-violates-rte-act/article35089891.ece
02 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Ill treatment of animals: HC registers case||The Kerala High Court has registered a suo motu case against the backdrop of a series of incidents in which animals are being treated cruelly. The case was registered based on a letter written by Justice A.K Jayasankaran Nambiar to the Chief Justice bringing to his attention the news reports on the cruel and inhuman killing of a dog by three minors on the Adimalathura beach in Thiruvananthapuram. The video of the incident had gone viral on social media. Matter of concern The letter pointed out that it was a matter of concern that many such incidents were reported in the media in the past couple of years. The sheer number of such cases and the frequency of their occurrence led one to suspect that such cruelty was now turning habitual. As a people, our approach towards animal rights had been far from desirable. Animals rights The letter pointed out that the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 were founded on the basic premise of superiority of the human species over all others and of restrictions/control of human action as the basis for protection of animal rights. This approach virtually makes animal rights a byproduct of human compassion or benevolence. The enviable position of the human species enabled them to concede certain rights to other species on the planet and take affirmative action to protect the rights of other species. The case will come up for hearing on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-registers-case-over-ill-treatment-of-animals/article35089936.ece

Organisations and volunteers working in the field of road safety and trauma care say that faulty road construction and ineffective surveillance measures are contributing to accidents besides speed violations. “Rumble strips and other reflective markers on the highway are emerging as the biggest hurdles for the safe movement of vehicles in many locations. Rain-soaked roads with these slippery markings are the biggest safety risk now,” said Sivadasan, a taxi driver who has seen many unsuspecting two-wheeler riders skidding off the road after hitting such surfaces. Such roads could be safe for regular drivers, but unfamiliar riders would suffer, he said. A trauma care volunteer from Ramanattukara said there was huge difference in the thickness of rumble strips, zebra lines and the raised profile markings in various spots which could easily hinder the smooth movement of vehicles. On the Kozhikode-Palakkad route, one would be able to notice such numerous risky spots without any nearby signboards for caution, he claimed. Members of a local drivers’ collective in Ramanattukara pointed out that it was difficult for autorickshaws, motorbikes and emergency service vehicles to move across such uneven marks. It caused damage to mechanical components of vehicles and gave a harrowing time for commuters. Various residents’ associations and political parties have sought the intervention of the authorities to clear potholes on the highway and replace the damaged street lights with new ones along the road. Ramanattukara municipality area residents’ association members, who recently staged a standing protest with candles, said they were yet to get any feedback from the authorities on filling potholes, which were found threatening the safety of two-wheeler riders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-action-as-highway-stretch-turns-accident-prone/article35089858.ece
02 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Fund shortage keeps thalassaemia patients out of aid scheme||Shortage of funds is reported to be the reason behind keeping thalassaemia patients out of the ambit of the Kerala Social Security Mission’s ‘Samashwasam’ scheme to provide financial help to poor people. Eligible patients are given Rs. 2,000 a month under the scheme. According to sources, only sickle cell anaemia and haemophilia have been included in the category of common blood disorders though thalassaemia, a condition when the body doesn’t make the protein called haemoglobin, an important component of red blood cells, is considered a fatal disease as well. This condition leads to weak functioning and shorter life span of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all cells of the body. Kareem Karassery, functionary of the Blood Patients Protection Council, Kerala, claimed that the fatal nature of the disorder leads to frequent hospitalisation of the patients and high cost of treatment. He claimed that they were forced to depend on hospitals at least every two weeks. He said that the Union government had included thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia, and haemophilia in the disability category according to the Right of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016. When the Left Democratic Front government led by V.S. Achuthanandan launched the “Thalolam” scheme for the free treatment of kids suffering from severe diseases, all the above three were included on the list of common blood disorders. Mission officials have reportedly told council functionaries that they are facing shortage of funds. Mr. Karassery claimed that even the financial help for sickle cell anaemia and haemophilia patients were delayed quite often. The council functionaries have sent representations to Thawar Chand Gehlot, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, and R. Bindu, State Minister for Social Justice, seeking their intervention in the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fund-shortage-keeps-thalassaemia-patients-out-of-aid-scheme/article35089847.ece

Officials said 40 containers were delivered at the port. The ship, which was flagged off from Kochi on Wednesday by Union Minister of State for Ports, Shipping and Waterways Mansukh Mandaviya, reached the Kozhikode coast by 6 a.m. on Thursday. It was later towed to the port using a tug. The containers mostly carried plywood, tiles, sanitary ware, and textile items. The short-sea container shipping service, which was suspended nearly three years ago, was resumed following persistent demand from leading importers and exporters forums. According to them, the cost of container shipping by road is too high and time-consuming. Officials of the Department of Ports said the cargo vessel would be able to operate uninterrupted weekly services. The Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) facility now available at Kannur and Beypore for cargo clearance will attract more stakeholders to minor ports, they said. Meanwhile, stakeholders have appealed to the State government to consider opening a ship repairing unit near Beypore. According to them, a floating dry dock and ship repair facility under Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) will fetch more revenue for the port. Local investors said the transportation of petroleum and petroleum products to the north Malabar region could be possible through short-sea service. They pointed out that the government could lease small cargo vessels for the purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/container-vessel-chowgule-8-arrives-at-beypore/article35089861.ece

The relatives of the victim alleged that they were prevented from conducting the cremation at the land which was earlier donated to her family by a charitable trust. Following the dispute, the body of the woman had been moved to a private medical college mortuary. Though a team of police officers and Revenue officials reached the spot settle the issue, it was of little avail. The main argument raised by the trust functionaries was that the five cents donated to the family for residential purposes could not be used for cremation. They had also suggested using a public crematorium. On Thursday, the dispute was settled following an online meeting initiated by District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao. The family members of the victim said they had been granted permission by the local panchayat authorities for the cremation, but it was later revoked. The Collector finally issued an order in favour of the bereaved family which was allowed to conduct the cremation in their own land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dispute-over-land-delays-cremation-of-covid-victim/article35089842.ece

But doctors say some patients with lung complications due to the infection could benefit from surgery as evident from the case of a 52-year-old native of Beypore in Kozhikode who had developed post-COVID complications. According to Nasser Yusuf, thoracic surgeon with PVS Hospital, Kozhikode, the patient never really recovered from COVID-19 though he had tested negative for the virus. He was always visibly tired. CT scan revealed pneumonia in the left lung with a fluid-like thing causing complete lung collapse. He was living on his right lung which was partially damaged. “Operating on a COVID-19 affected lung was a challenge. The main fear was that a surgery or an invasive ventilation could further compromise the function of an already damaged lung,” Dr. Yusuf said. The family consented after they were explained about the gravity of the situation. Fleshy and hardened pus weighing a kg and forming a thick layer around the lung was removed through the surgery on June 6. The trapped lung was freed by stripping the thickened layer around the whole lung in a manner similar to peeling off a wall paper from a wall, which led to laceration injuries and bleeding. The procedure lasted six hours. The lung function improved after the surgery and oxygen saturation level returned to normal. The patient was discharged in a week. “Post-COVID syndrome usually affects mainly the lung, heart, and brain. Lung fibrosis may occur and last up to six months. Some patients with complications may benefit from surgery,” Dr. Yusuf claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/surgery-helps-patient-recover-from-post-covid-issues/article35089845.ece
02 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Record number of foreign students seek admission to NIT-C||With its stellar placements and impressive ranking at the national- level, the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, (NIT-C) has attracted more foreign students for admission to undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes this year. In fact, the number of applicants has made a quantum jump - over 10 times the total number of aspirants when compared to the previous year. As many as 283 foreign students have applied for B.Tech and B.Arch courses, 108 for M.Tech and M.Plan and 18 for PhD programmes. Last year , the total applicants were 40 including 30 for undergraduate programmes. Prof. Lity Alen Varghese , chairperson, UG Admissions and Dr. G. Sreelekha, chairperson, Post Graduate Admissions said that most of the applicants were from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries, Ghana, Vietnam, Syria and a few from European Union. The foreign students had applied online for the courses via the Indian Council for Cultural Relations ( ICCR) an autonomous body under the Ministry of External External Affairs (MEA), they said. The quota for undergraduate programmes was 16 while the seats allotted in the post graduate in the Ph.D caterorgies were 36 and 15 respectively. “We have shortlisted candidates and the list has been submitted to the ICCR. The majority of the B.Tech aspirants have opted for computer science and electronics disciplines,” Prof. Varghese said. However the case was different for M.Tech courses where the candidates chose conventional streams including civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. “The shortlisted candidates for both postgraduate and Ph.D programmes will be submitted to the ICCR shortly,” Dr. Sreelekha said. Last year only nine students including one from Botswana were admitted to the B.Tech course in the ICCR scheme and two candidates were sponsored under the welfare scheme of the MEA. Incidentally , out of the four short-listed candidates for the M.Tech course only two joined last year. Dr. P. S. Sathidevi, Director-in-charge, NITC attributed the spurt in number of foreign candidates seeking admission to multiple reasons including the ranking of the institute that stood at 23rd in the engineering and 3rd in the architecture category at the national level. Possibly the increase in scholarships and facilities at the institute had also attracted a large number of students, she said. However, from this year onwards admission to B.Tech courses for category under Direct Admission of Students (DASA) for NRI, PIO (Person of Indian Origin) and OCI ( Overseas Citizen of India) should qualify JEE Main and not through Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), Dr. Sathidevi said.

While one person was arrested soon after, a man-hunt is on for another assailant. The alleged incidents have come as a blow to the government as it geared up to reopen tourist destinations after months. It also highlighted the lack of lighting facilities and surveillance systems in such places. The foreigners, who hail from France and the United Kingdom, claimed one person misbehaved with them while they were on their way from the Thiruvambady beach to their homestay at Kurakkani around 8 p.m. on Monday. The offender flashed at the tourists and began to chase them. “We began to run as he chased us. We were scared as there were no one in the area. He finally ran away after seeing two other men some distance away,” one of the victims said. Another incident The incident was not an isolated one. A Mumbai native, who stayed with them, faced a similar incident on Wednesday when a motorcyclist groped her. In both cases, the victims could not see the faces of the perpetrators as they were wearing masks. Soon after receiving the complaints, the Varkala police arrested Mahesh, 27, of Mukkalakkal in Edava in connection with the first case. Varkala Inspector Dwijesh S. said efforts were on to nab the accused in the other incident. Appeal to police The tourists flagged the absence of streetlights and CCTV cameras in many parts of the destination. “Such incidents have happened to many girls, both locals and foreigners. We have requested the police to install more lights and CCTV cameras to make the place safer,” they said. Despite ranking among the best tourist spots in the country, Varkala and Kovalam have often come under the scanner for atrocities against tourists. The alleged sexual assault and murder of a Latvian tourist near Kovalam three years ago had raised questions regarding the safety of tourists.

02 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Now, State may have to recheck its pandemic death data||The Supreme Court’s rap on Wednesday for the Centre’s failure to recommend ex gratia to all families who lost their loved ones to COVID-19 is likely to open a Pandora’s box as all States, including Kerala, may now have to take a relook at their declared COVID death data and come clean on the actual number of deaths so that no family is denied this financial assistance. A COVID death data reconciliation exercise is thus definitely in order in Kerala, where the Health Department stands accused of data manipulation or undercounting of COVID deaths. The excess death mortality analysis of the State done by The Hindu had revealed that the State had an overall excess death count of 13,868 between April 2020 and May 31, 2021. This was 1.6 times the official COVID count of 8,816 during the period. The undercount factor for 2021 alone, though much lower than other States, was 2.7. Simplifying process The court has asked the Centre to make the death certification process as simple as possible and issue certificates with cause of death as “death due to COVID-19” in all cases where a person has died within two to three months after he/she tested COVID -positive. (as the patient might have died due to the complications precipitated by COVID). Following much criticism, the State has now put in place a decentralised online system for reporting COVID deaths wherein death data are uploaded directly from hospitals. The new system has done away with the time lag in death declaration, ensuring currency and completeness of data. But COVID-related deaths that occur at home after discharge might be captured only much later. However, Kerala still needs to account for some 3,000-5,000 “missing” deaths in its COVID death list, public health experts reckon. Even if the State had included all these deaths, Kerala’s case fatality rate would still be below 1%. “Kerala will have to set up an expert committee to go over the backlog of undeclared COVID deaths. It will also need to set up a grievances redressal mechanism so that families who lost kin to COVID can put up their claim for verification. If compensation is on offer, there could be a multitude of claims which will all have to be scrutinised,” says a senior public health expert. He says that the easiest way to do a data reconciliation exercise will be by using the Lab Data Management System portal, which has the records of all persons who tested COVID-positive in the State. The outcome of all positive cases can be cross-checked and in the case of deaths, the cause of death can be verified from the death certificate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-state-may-have-to-recheck-its-pandemic-death-data/article35089912.ece
02 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Book former Revenue, Forest Ministers: Oppn.||Leader of the Opposition V. D. Satheesan on Thursday demanded that former Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan and former Forest Minister K. Raju be brought under the ambit of the ongoing investigation into the illegal felling of valuable timber from assigned land in the State. He said the previous Left Democratic Front (LDF) government could not absolve itself of the crime of allowing the forest mafia to loot the State’s timber wealth. It had passed an order on October 24 providing legal cover for the mafia to log trees on land assigned to farmers. The government issued the order under the pretext of allowing farmers to harvest trees they had grown on their land. The mafia used the ruling to convince farmers, many of them scheduled tribes, to sell them centuries-old rosewood and teak for a pittance, he said. Helping mafia The Forest and Revenue Department had enabled environmental crime at multiple levels. In South Muttil village in Wayanad, the mafia felled 120 rosewood trees, Mr. Satheesan alleged. Their overwhelming influence in the previous LDF government prevented local forest and revenue officers from stopping the loot. However, several raised red flags and sent cautionary reports to the government, he said. The government initially refused to rescind the order and finally revoked it on February 2. The same day, an Additional Private Secretary to the Forest Minister spoke to one of the kingpins of the racket. It revealed their nexus, Mr. Satheesan said. The incumbent Revenue and Forest Ministers had said October 24 order was legal. By pronouncing a judgment on the case, the Ministers had prejudiced the ongoing probe and rendered it a farce. Mr. Satheesan said the UDF would launch a major campaign against the political malfeasance that resulted in the timber loot. The Opposition had lost faith in the Crime Branch and Vigilance probes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/book-former-revenue-forest-ministers/article35089855.ece

Television channels celebrated the resumption of Kochi Metro Rail services as a sign of better days ahead. However, tight restrictions on civic life remained in force in at least 80 local bodies. The average test positivity rate (TPR) remained unyieldingly high at more than 18% in those regions which are under triple lockdown. Law enforcement has quarantined entire neighbourhoods and allowed only essential services there. A less severe lockdown continued in 316 local bodies where the TPR is between 12% and 18%. Semi-lockdown situation prevailed in 473 local bodies, which reported an average TPR between 6% and 12%. The government has partially eased travel, retail and commerce restrictions in 165 local bodies where the average TPR is below 6%. Third wave Even as the spectre of a third wave looms large, public health experts have warned that highly transmissible Delta variants of the virus are in circulation in the State. They can trigger another surge in infections. Hence, the police continued to enforce the mask and physical distance mandate. They have placed severe restrictions on inter-State travel. Vigilance is high in neighbourhoods bordering Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The State has closed liquor shops near inter-State borders to prevent the to-and-fro movement of people. The administration has warned that disease transmission was on the rise in households and remained a cause of worry. Hence, families should not lull themselves into a false sense of security and not take COVID-19 precautions at home. Households having infected persons should quarantine in their entirety. The weekend lockdown would continue. A committee chaired by the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary V. P. Joy will review the restrictions on July 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-protocol-kicks-in/article35089916.ece

The incident had raised questions on the safety of citizens during late hours in the State capital. The investigation team arrested Rakesh, alias Koch Rakesh, 28, of Vanchiyoor; Praveen, alias Kari Praveen, 25, of Kannammoola; Abhijith Nair J., alias Unni, 25, of Kollamkavu in Nedumangad; and Shiju R., 28, of Pattom. The arrests were made following a complaint submitted by two employees of the office of the Accountant General here who were attacked with a machete after they thwarted attempts to molest their wives. The alleged incident occurred around 8.30 p.m. on June 27 close to their house at Ambalathumukku, near Pettah, when the families had gone for a walk. Rakesh and Praveen were directly involved in the case, while the others have been accused of abetting their escape. On the basis of CCTV visuals and information provided by others with similar criminal antecedents, the police apprehended the gang members from separate hideouts at Manvila, Nedumangad and Kottiyam in Kollam. The scooter used by the first two accused has also been confiscated. Zero tolerance Terming the incident unfortunate, City Police Commissioner and Inspector General Balram Kumar Upadhyay said a zero-tolerance policy had been adopted to check such incidents. The charge sheet in the case will be submitted within 30 days to ensure that the case went to trial without any delay. The accused persons have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 354 (outraging the modesty of woman), 324, 323 (both pertaining to voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide). They have been involved in several criminal cases registered by the Vanchiyoor, Medical College, Pettah, Nedumangad and Neyyattinkara police. Rakesh had last completed a two-year jail term in 2019 in a theft case. More people are suspected to be involved in aiding the prime accused and efforts are on to nab them, according to the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/attack-on-families-four-arrested/article35090100.ece

Eight years since the mass plantation of the species known commonly as Kattadi trees across 17 hectares in the Purakkad grama panchayat in the district, the region has found them to be effective in saving shores from high tides, especially during the monsoon season. “At a time when several coastal areas are ravaged by sea erosion, the belt in Alappuzha has been less affected by such vagaries of the weather. The species has also been found to improve soil quality. Yet another advantage is they act as a barrier that lessens the intensity of wind and protects properties near the coastline,” E. Pradeep Kumar, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry), points out. As part of the Van Mahotsav in the first week of July, the department will develop yet another bioshield using 1.5 lakh Casuarina seedlings on 15 acres from Arthunkal to Mararikulam in Alappuzha. Another belt, albeit a smaller one, will come up along the coastal area of Malipuram in Vypeen, Ernakulam where 20,000 seedlings will be planted. O ther areas that have been identified for the coastal protection scheme include Kannur and Kasaragod. According to K. Saji, Assistant Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry), Alappuzha, the seedlings are planted 50 metres away from the coastline to ensure the seashore ecosystem in which marine species such as turtles and crabs thrived remained unscathed. While several casuarina trees had been planted along the belt from Purakkad to Punnapra, around 500 matured trees were felled by the district authorities at Purakkad last year to remove sand from the Thottappally estuary.  Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran will formally inaugurate the project at Arthunkal on July 7. Similar planting drives and new infrastructural projects will be launched in Kozhikode, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts during the Van Mahotsav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/casuarina-bio-shields-at-more-sites/article35090129.ece

Addressing a meet-the-press programme organised by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists here, Mr. Rajeeve said no MoU had been signed in connection with the proposed investment.

02 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||A puzzle over definition||One of the main issues in determining whether a person died due to COVID-19 is the definition of COVID death itself. A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case. Cases where there is a clear, unrelated alternative cause of death (e.g. trauma, suicide) are not COVID deaths. However, COVID sets off a cascade of potentially fatal afflictions and while pneumonia and respiratory distress are the commonest outcomes, many patients die later at home of acute myocardial infarction or stroke. These deaths are actually a continuum of COVID and cannot be seen as unrelated incidents. The State claims to classify COVID deaths based on World Health Organisation’s and the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) guidelines. The ICMR is clear that even if a COVID-positive person has comorbidities, “that should not be listed as the underlying cause of death; the cause of death remains COVID-19”.   “Belgium has one of the highest COVID death rates in Europe, because their list includes all probable and suspected COVID deaths. U.K. is capturing data of people who are COVID-positive and who die within 28 and 60 days separately. Ideally, Kerala should be doing the same because that is the most scientific way to capture the impact of a pandemic,” a public health expert said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-puzzle-over-definition/article35089909.ece

Satheesan on Thursday said under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths could deny future compensation to families that lost their breadwinners to the pandemic. Mr. Satheesan flagged the issue after the Supreme Court ordered the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to frame guidelines for fixing ex gratia assistance to the kin of the COVID-19 victim. He demanded a complete audit of hospital deaths since the pandemic hit Kerala’s shores in 2020. The government should publish the actual death toll so that no bereaved family would be deprived of the pandemic assistance. “The government could rectify the anomaly in 10 days. If not, the Opposition will take up the task.” Till recently, a State-level expert committee in the State capital remotely determined whether a death in far away Wayanad was due to COVID-19 or not. Later, the government delegated the authority to district-level committees. Against the grain Both decisions ran against the grain of WHO’s COVID-19 death certification guidelines. The WHO mandated that only the doctor who treated the patient for more than 24 hours could certify whether the person’s death was due to COVID-19 or not. In Kerala, deaths that occurred after the patient turned COVID-19 negative were accounted as non-pandemic demise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/satheesan-flags-death-under-reporting/article35089902.ece

02 July 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Students’ solar machine to help ryots fight pests||A group of engineering students from Manalur in Thrissur are setting a model by doing their bit to society. Manalur is predominantly a farming area with vast stretches of kole fields. Pest attack is one of the burning issues faced by kole farmers. Students of the Electrical and Electronics Engineering branch at Vidya Engineering College, Kechery, Thrissur, have developed a solar machine – Solar farming Vikas – that destroys crop pests and converts them into organic manure. The eco-friendly machine has been developed by Ushas Andrews from Kanjani, Kevin George from Palazhi, Swathi K. Sunil from Kandassamkadavu, and Jincy Jose from Anthikad — all under Manalur — as part of their BTech final-year project. The fully solar-powered machine functions day and night. It runs at night with the solar battery charged during the day. As dim light is used at night, it uses less power. “Hormones are used to attract insects to the machine. It works with ultrasonic technology and uses yellow and blue light at night to attract insects. Pests are destroyed using high voltage. Ordinary people can use it easily because of the low current flow,” say the students. Safety feature The machine also has a facility to combine these dying pests with organic matter to convert it into organic manure. It helps to avoid other animals that enter the farm to consume the pests. The machine has compartments for storing belongings of farm workers. It has a mobile phone charging point too. Professors Vishnu Rach, Sankaran Namboothiri and Ashwin T. Surendran coordinated the project led by Mary Varghese, Head of the Electrical Engineering Department at the college. The project was selected as the best project in a competition held by the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) club of the college. The students are now working with the Department of Agriculture to bring the machine to the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/students-solar-machine-to-help-ryots-fight-pests/article35090128.ece

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Horror thriller squanders a promising premise||A popular internet meme of our times is the ‘expectations vs reality’ one, pointing at how the reality of some things falls way behind our expectations. The makers of Cold Case probably expected a novel horror experience for the audience when they built some of these scary sequences around a refrigerator, but might not have imagined how it could turn out unintentionally funny in some key sequences. Not to forget that awkward literal connection that the refrigerator has to the movie’s title. Parallel tracks But, the horror elements are just one part of the movie, the debut directorial of cinematographer Tanu Balak. It attempts to weave together an investigation which runs on two parallel tracks — one which follows the traditional police method of following the forensic clues and circumstantial evidence, while the other which follows the clues gleaned from paranormal activities. It all begins from the recovery of a skull of an unidentified person from a lake. ACP Sathyajith (Prithviraj) begins piecing together the few leads to first identify the victim, and from there the culprit. Parallelly, Medha (Aditi Balan), a single mother and a journalist who does a show on paranormal occurrences, is experiencing some mysterious ‘presence’ in her home. She begins investigating it. Balancing act The script, written by Sreenath V. Nath, is thus a balancing act between these two threads, which do not meet almost until the end. Though the narrative shifts seamlessly between the two, they really do not come together, with one wishing for more of the police investigation, than the below par paranormal-horror elements. The film is reluctant to reject paranormal activities, while making Sathyajith mouth a few lines to satisfy the rational-minded. Intriguing at first Sathyajith’s investigation throws up some intriguing bits in the initial parts built around the forensic clues. But, when it progresses beyond that, to the circumstantial evidence, the script banks on too many convenient coincidences, rather than intelligent deduction by the investigator. All of the careful build-up of the initial parts leads to a let-down when the identity and the intentions of the criminal are revealed. The script is rather weak not just in using the thriller elements, but in the dialogues department too. Quite a few sequences have the characters, especially the police officers, stating the obvious to each other. This is compounded by the not-so-great dubbing for some characters.  Cold Case is an underwhelming horror-thriller that squanders the promising premise it had. The hint of a sequel in the closing sequence almost seems like a warning to the audience. S.R.

Dharmavaram MLA Kethireddy Venkatarami Reddy appealed to the construction material dealers and middlemen to cooperate with the beneficiaries and not resort to hoarding. Sand supply While getting sand for construction of 31,200 houses in Anantapur district and 46,000 houses in Kurnool district in the first phase of the scheme will be a major challenge, the district administration has been doing its best to ensure there is no scarcity of material in the rainy season. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no work for the daily wagers. With the launch of the scheme, there is a handful of work for many now. The progress of work should not be derailed by hoarding of construction material or sudden increase in the wages,” Mr. Venkataramireddy said. Anantapur Collector Nagalakshmi Selvarajan participated in the grounding programme at Pothula Nagepalli Layout on the outskirts of Dharmavaram town, while her Kurnool counterpart G. Veerapandian launched the programme at Pyalakurthy village layout in Kodumur Mandal. Ms. Nagalakshmi said 90 mandays of work would be attached to the construction activity undertaken as part of the the housing scheme and steps had been been to ensure it. “Every beneficiary must take interest to get their houses completed as early as possible and monitor the progress daily, while the officials will keep an eye on them. More houses will be grounded on July 3 and 4 in the district,” the Collector said, adding that cement, water, sand, and power would be provided by the administration at the construction site. Kodumur MLA J. Sudhakar said that the progress of the work would be uploaded to the government website and each house would be tagged for everyone to check and ensure early completion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mla-urges-dealers-not-to-hoard-construction-material/article35090065.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ramesh Jarkiholi lobbies to return as Minister||Former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who had to resign over a CD scandal in March earlier this year, has intensified political lobbying to get back into the Cabinet over the last one week. However, his future hangs in a balance as the party top brass has ruled out his re-induction without a clean chit in the case. With the Karnataka High Court monitoring the probe closely, a reprieve is unlikely soon, sources said. A Division Bench of the High Court, hearing multiple petitions pertaining to the case, on June 25, issued oral directions to the State Advocate-General to ensure the Special Investigation Team (SIT) does not file a closure report into the probe. SIT chief Soumendu Mukherjee, who has been on medical leave for nearly two months now, has extended leave by another month. The SIT, on June 18, sought more time to complete the probe. It is likely to submit a status report to the High Court on Monday. The SIT is likely place on record all the evidence they have gathered in the case before the High Court. The future of the case will depend on the directions by the High Court over the matter, sources in the SIT said, adding that this essentially means no immediate relief for the former Minister. However, Mr. Jarkiholi seems to have only intensified political lobbying for his re-induction. He seems to have left no stone unturned – from threatening to quit as a legislator to lobbying with the central leadership to take him back. He was in New Delhi again on Tuesday trying to meet a host of central leaders of the party. He is known to have met senior party leaders in Mumbai recently. Over the last two days, there has been a growing chorus from among defectors and other leaders seeking assurance of his reinduction. While Ministers Umesh Katti and K.C. Narayana Gowda assured Mr. Jarkiholi would soon be made a Minister again, his brother Balachandra Jarkiholi has demanded the same. “When he resigned as Minister over an allegation, he cannot be reinducted into the Cabinet without being cleared of that allegation. But he must concentrate on the legal fight and get his name cleared at the earliest, rather than lobby politically,” said a senior party leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jarkiholi-lobbies-to-return-as-minister/article35089213.ece

02 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala zoo worker dies of snakebite||A 45-year-old animal keeper at the Thiruvananthapuram zoo died on Thursday afternoon following a snakebite. The deceased, A. Harshad, is reported to have been bitten by a king cobra while cleaning a shift cage in the reptile house. Harshad was engaged in cleaning the king cobra enclosure. He cleaned the main enclosure after shifting the snake to the shift cage by opening a sliding shutter. The reptile is supposed to be let back to the main closure before cleaning the shift cage. But it is thought that Harshad tried to clean it with the snake inside, said zoo Director S. Abu. In the CCTV camera visuals, Harshad is seen stepping out of the enclosure at 12.17 p.m. The break for keepers begin at 12 noon and apparently he continued to work even during the break. Though the main enclosures are covered by CCTV, there are no cameras at the keepers’ gallery. Another keeper found Harshad prostrate on the ground around 1.30 p.m. Though he was conscious, he could not speak. But he pointed to the shift cage. Though he was rushed to the Medical College Hospital, he was declared brought dead, the zoo authorities said. Locked the cage A lock found on the shift cage hinted that he had tried to free his arm from the snake and managed to slide a lock in on the door to ensure that the snake remained inside, they said. Though reptile keepers are assigned protective equipment such as snake tongs and gloves, they actually do not come into contact with the snakes, since the animals are let into the shift cages and back through the shutters before the keepers enter the main enclosure or clean the small shift cages that are located in the spacious keepers’ gallery, they said. The king cobra was among the three brought from the Pilikula zoo in March this year. The zoo has limited staff on duty owing to COVID-19, the officials said. Dedicated keeper Harshad was one of the best keepers at the zoo, dedicated, efficient and knowledgeable, with lots of experience. He had even attended a Central Zoo Authority training for keepers recently, officials said. Harshad had been taking care of the reptiles at the zoo, including anacondas, for long. He had been in the news a few years ago when he entered a snake enclosure in protest against the delay in making employees permanent. Harshad, who hailed from Kattakada, is survived by his wife and child. Another keeper at the zoo was gored to death by a rhino over a decade and a half ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-zoo-worker-dies-of-snakebite/article35089397.ece

Thulasi Reddy on Thursday ridiculed Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s remark that he was exercising restraint against the Telangana government which went ahead with illegal hydel project on Krishna keeping welfare of the Andhra people living in that State. He said it only reflected Mr. Jagan’s “inefficiency and cowardice”. In a statement, the senior Congress leader recalled that as an Opposition leader in 2016, Mr. Jagan had staged a “Jala Deeksha” in Kurnool for three days in protest against the construction of illegal projects by Telangana, and reminded him that even then, people of Andhra origin lived in Telangana. Mr. Reddy recounted how Mr. Jagan had warned Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that he would not remain silent if he tried to develop his State at the cost of the welfare of Andhra Pradesh people. “But he has now suddenly become so concerned about people of Andhra region in Telangana,” he said. He accused the former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu also of neglecting the issue. Mr. Naidu remained silent for fear of the “Vote-for-note” scam. “The reason for Mr. Jagan's silence is to protect his illegal assets in Telangana,” alleged the Congress leader,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-flays-jagans-stand-on-row-with-telangana/article35090226.ece

02 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police devise novel way to store seized evidence||A scientific way of storing seized property and evidences from a crime scene was inaugurated under the name of ‘E-Malkhana’ at Narsipatnam police station on Thursday. Earlier, seized properties were stored in a storeroom and it was difficult to find them, especially for an incoming Station House Officer. To tackle this issue, ASP Narsipatnam Tuhin Sinha with the help of Receptum E-logic Software Solutions designed a scientific way of storing them. Pilot project Inaugurating the E-Malkhana, Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao said that it was a pilot project and in coming days, it will be rolled out across all police stations in the district. Under this system, the property seized and evidences collected from the crime scene will now be stored in standard sized cardboard boxes, which will be numbered with other details. A dynamic QR code will be generated and pasted on the box. This apart, a dedicated website would be hosted and all details pertaining to the case and property will be uploaded. All one has to do is to scan the code to get the details, said Mr. Sinha. Moreover, one need not search for the boxes, as one can visit the website and obtain the case number and pull out the boxes for further references. The boxes will be kept until final disposal of the case as per court orders. ‘Effective supervision’ Using specific login credentials, the data can be accessed and analysed by all superior officers using their own login credentials, thus allowing for effective supervision, said Mr. Sinha. A three-part data entry is done for each property and comprehensive data fields are provided in all three parts, such as property details, chain of custody and disposal of property. These details are filled by the SHO at the ground-level. Thus, it allows the entire information regarding the seized property to be accessed by all senior officers in a single location. Moreover, it will also be easy to find out the property pending for disposal and property already disposed. Whenever new information is added with respect to any property, even that information gets reflected when the QR code is scanned without the necessity of generating a new QR code and pasting it on the box again, said Mr. Sinha. To enable easy searching, each rack and boxes will be numbered and the website will also offer a dashboard for easy reference and search, Mr. Sinha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-devise-novel-way-to-store-seized-evidence/article35090062.ece

CPI(M) city secretary B. Ganga Rao, who is the corporator from Ward 78, in the GVMC, said that the draft notification on property tax, for calculation of tax based on capital value, was issued on June 3. Though citizens were asked to submit their objections against the proposed tax, they were not given an e-mail or online facility for registering their objections, despite the pandemic threat. There was no provision to hand over the ‘objection letter’ at the ward secretariats. The non-provision of an opportunity to citizens to submit their grievances on the proposed property tax at the field level is against the law, he said. He sought that information on the objection letters, receiving on each day, should be displayed at the office. In the absence of such information, citizens were wondering whether the letters would be considered at all. He demanded that acknowledgements should be given to the citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/acknowledge-objection-letters-on-tax-hike-cpim/article35090228.ece

02 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Rayalaseema projects have KCR’s blessings: Revanth||Newly appointed Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president, A. Revanth Reddy has alleged that the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation project of Andhra Pradesh had all the blessings of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. AP Chief Minister Y.S Jaganmohan Reddy was given a grand welcome into Pragathi Bhavan after he made a statement in the AP Assembly on how he had plans to divert Krishna waters, he said and asked why did KCR didn’t object to it then. In fact, the Telangana government was forced to implead after a farmer filed a case against the diversion of waters by the AP government, he observed. “In fact, Congress leader Nagam Janardhan Reddy had raised this issue several times with all the details but KCR did not respond,” he said. Mr. Reddy, who was speaking to reporters after the meeting of TPCC frontal organisations, alleged that KCR was using water issue as an ATM to draw political mileage raking up the sentiment. TRS Ministers are abusing late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and it seems to serve Mr. Jagan fine as well politically and he is silent despite his father getting abused for no fault of his. YSR was no way involved in the Rayalaseema irrigation project but Y.S. Jagan is involved but the TRS Ministers are targeting YSR. “YSR followers in Telangana are returning to Congress and this is KCR’s plan to divert them to Sharmila’s proposed political party,” he claimed. He said it is ridiculous to drag YSR and N.T. Rama Rao into the present controversy, and asked whether was it not KCR who had said there were no issues with river basins for Telugu States when he visited Nagarai MLA Roja’s house? The new PCC chief challenged the Chief Minister to send his MPs with him to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sort out of the issue. “KCR did not visit the PM to settle the issue though he visits him for settling his personal issues,” he claimed. He said Mr. Jagan is planning to divert 11 TMC of water daily while all the projects in Telangana cannot use more than 1 TMC per day. ‘Audit COVID deaths’ Meanwhile, AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan demanded the government to conduct an audit of COVID-19 deaths in Telangana, including those who died with co-morbidities, to ensure that the families of the deceased receive Rs. 4 lakh compensation as directed by Supreme Court. Raising serious concerns over gross under-reporting of COVID deaths, he stressed that more than 1.5 lakh died of COVID-19 but the government has reported just 3,651 deaths, eventually preventing the families of the victims from receiving the compensation. Mr. Sravan said that at least after the Supreme Court's direction, the State government should conduct a detailed audit of deaths that occurred from March 14, 2020 to June 30, 2021 and come up with true figure of actual deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rayalaseema-projects-have-kcrs-blessings-revanth/article35089828.ece

02 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Anti-diabetic drug promises therapeutic solution to COVID||An anti-diabetic drug ‘Ertugliflozin’ might provide a therapeutic solution to the COVID-19 infection as a repurposed drug. This is following ‘in-vitro’ and ‘in-silico’ studies done by the ASPIRE-BioNEST, a life sciences incubator jointly funded by Department of Biotechnology and University of Hyderabad (UoH), ReaGene Innovations and INDRAS Private Limited. The findings announced here on Thursday indicate that this repurposed drug not only binds effectively to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of COVID-19 but also displays significant anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties in a 3D human vascular lung model, both of which are fundamentals in COVID-19 infection, said an official press release. “This offers a safe, ready-to-use, cost-effective solution to humans who contract COVID-19 and immense potential to treat the infection. Our research proves its efficacy in the test-tube assays,” said CEO of ReaGene Innovations Uday Saxena. This start-up is co-founded by Dr. Subramanyam Vangala, and Dr. Sreedhara Voleti, MD of INDRAS. Ertugliflozin is an FDA approved drug for Type-2 diabetes, works as an inhibitor by removing excessive glucose through urine. INDRAS focus is on consulting, contracting, and collaborative solutions to in-silico drug design, has prioritised about 8,000 FDA approved drugs to top-10 from their computational studies, which were further experimented by ReaGene Innovations for various in-vitro assays on cytokine storm, antithrombotic properties, and inflammatory marker reduction through various in vitro assays. The path to find such a repurposed drug was critically planned and completed within a year of funding from the IT giant Tech Mahindra led by global practice head of life sciences Ratnakar Palakodeti and global head of makers lab Nikhil Malhotra, together with the scientific partnership of INDRAS and ReaGene. The outcomes of the results of this research were recently published in a journal (BioRxIV) and a patent was filed. “We have found a molecule that can potentially attack coronavirus. We have applied for a joint patent,” said Mr. Malhotra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/anti-diabetic-drug-promises-therapeutic-solution-to-covid/article35089814.ece

02 July 2021||Ghaziabad,||Ghazipur clash: FIR filed against 200 BKU workers||A day after the clash between farmers and BJP workers at the Ghazipur border, the Ghaziabad police registered an FIR against 200 unidentified workers of the Bhartiya Kisan Union. Police sources said those who damaged the vehicles and created ruckus were being identified through video footage. The FIR was registered under Sections 147, 148, 223, 352, 427 and 506 of IPC on the complaint of Amit Valmiki, newly appointed general secretary of the State BJP. Mr. Valmiki said the protesters not only damaged the party vehicles but also used casteist slurs against him. It was during his welcome at the Ghazipur border that the clash broke out on Wednesday. Dharmendra Malik, media in-charge of the BKU, said it was unfortunate no action was taken against those who attacked the farmers at the spot which has been their home for the last seven months. Mr. Malik said the BJP was trying to make it a caste issue but the Valmiki community had shown solidarity with farmers by reaching Sisauli in large numbers. He reiterated that farmers responded only after the BJP workers tried to seize control of the stage built on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway on Wednesday. Late in the evening, a counter FIR was registered against identified persons under Sections 147, 303, 504 and 506 of the IPC on the complaint of Bijendera Singh, president of the Ghaziabad unit of the BKU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ghazipur-clash-fir-filed-against-200-bku-workers/article35089720.ece
02 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||Industry body writes to PM, seeks de-sealing of Tikri border||In Bahadurgarh, an industry body representing around 9,000 industrial units has sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to de-seal the Delhi-Haryana border at Tikri — the protest site of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. It cited huge financial losses to businesses and inconvenience to employees. In a two-page letter, Narinder Chhikara, vice-president of Bahadurgarh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has urged the Prime Minister to direct the Delhi Police to open at least one carriage of the road connecting Delhi and Bahadurgarh for traffic to provide respite to the industry. “This border sealing is done by Delhi Police and they have not opened the Tikri border yet. For the benefit of the industry, which is stressed and adversely affected first by Covid-19 and then by the protest, we humbly request you to kindly intervene in this matter,” reads the letter. Bahadurgarh, a major industrial town of Haryana, has around 9,000 MSMEs, including footwear, automobile, spare parts, and industrial manufacturing units employing around 7.5 lakh people directly and indirectly. Mr. Chhikara, in the letter, said around 2,000 units falling in Part-B of Modern Industrial Estate in Bahadurgarh was either closed or on the verge of closure with the transportation of the raw material and finished products to and from Delhi hit due to farmers’ agitation for the past 7 months. He claimed that the sealing of the border due to the agitation had caused a turnover loss of around Rs. 20,000 crores to the industry, besides causing difficulty to the factory owners and their employees in commuting between their homes and workplace. He said that most of the employees and factory owners stayed in Delhi and had to take roads through nearby villages to reach Bahadurgarh. He said de-sealing would also bring cheers to lakhs of people of the town and make their life convenient.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/industry-body-writes-to-pm-seeks-de-sealing-of-tikri-border/article35089703.ece
02 July 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra will safeguard farmers’ interests, says CM||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said irrespective of the Centre’s farm laws, the State government will not take any decision to harm farmers’ interests. “The Centre can bring in laws as it may like. But we will ensure that the interests of the State farmers are not harmed,” said Mr. Thackeray. He was speaking on the occasion of ‘Krishi Din’ celebrated by the Agriculture Department on the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Vasantrao Naik. Mr. Thackeray said the farmers are the pride of Maharashtra and the State government is working on preserving that pride. “We understand the uncertainty in agriculture. There are natural calamities that strike and then there are issues of price. We as a government stand firmly with farmers.” Three days ago, a delegation of farmer leaders led by former Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti, Medha Patkar and Subhash Lomte had met Mr. Thackeray, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar demanding to pass a resolution opposing the three farm laws in the monsoon session of the state legislature. Earlier in the day, Mr. Pawar at a different programme said agriculture is the backbone of the economy. “If the agricultural growth and progress is evident, the situation of economy will automatically improve. Demand from consumers boosts an economy. With more than half of the population being part of agriculture in India, ensuring that their situation is improved would eventually boost demand and subsequently lead to improvement of economy,” he said, while virtually inaugurating the D Y Patil Agriculture and Technical University at Talsande in Kolhapur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-will-safeguard-farmers-interests-says-cm/article35089722.ece

Thane Guardian Minister Eknath Shinde on Thursday inaugurated the city’s first pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plant at Vashi General Hospital, and a HRCT scanning facility at CIDCO exhibition centre. Officials say the civic body is the first to have got a HRCT facility installed at a COVID-19 centre. Municipal Commissioner Abhijit Bangar said during the second wave of the pandemic, around 1,100 patients were treated at the CIDCO centre and every time they needed a scan, they had to be taken to private hospitals. “Hence, the corporation decided to have its own HRCT machine by collecting Rs. 1.85 crore through CSR activities of corporates,” he said. The PSA plant, which is first of the five planned by the civic body, has a capacity to generate 1.84 metric tonnes of oxygen per day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/navi-mumbai-gets-first-psa-plant-at-civic-run-hospital/article35089719.ece
02 July 2021||New Delhi,||Capital to soon get colour-coded response system to fight COVID||Delhi will soon get a colour-coded response system to control and fight COVID-19 with each colour representing a pre-defined degree of action that needs to be taken, including lockdowns, a Delhi government source said. The response system has been divided into four types of alerts — yellow, amber, orange, and red — each of which is based on test positivity rate, new cases, and bed occupancy. The government will take actions, including lockdowns of different intensity and ramping up of medical infrastructure, based on the alert level. “Yellow is the lowest level of alert and red is the highest. So, if the alert is yellow, the measures are taken by the government, including restrictions or lockdowns, will be less severe compared to red, which will see more stringent measures,” the source said. Plan awaits L-G nod The plan is yet to be approved by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) but it is expected to get his nod in a week’s time, said officials. “As per the current plan, the yellow alert will kick in if the TPR [test positivity rate] is over 0.5% for two days in a row or average oxygen beds occupied is over 500 in a week or the cumulative new cases are 1,500 or more in a week,” the source said. Similarly, the red category will kick in if the TPR is more than 5% for two days in a row or if there are over 16,000 new cases in a week or if the oxygen beds occupied are over a particular level. The plan was prepared by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government on May 27 to prepare for a possible third wave. During the second wave, there was a shortage of beds and medical oxygen in the city. On many days, less than 20 ICU beds were available in the whole city and many people admitted to hospitals died as the hospitals ran out of medical oxygen. Even as the second wave hit the city, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health Minister Satyendar Jain were not in favour of imposing lockdowns. On March 27, even as cases were rising, Mr. Jain said there is “no possibility of another lockdown”. “For me, lockdown is no solution to COVID-19,” Mr. Jain had said. But the government had to impose a lockdown from the end of April to control the situation. The order issued on May 27 on the formation of the expert committee, specifically asked it to prepare “clear guidelines on when to announce lockdown and to what degree”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/capital-to-soon-get-colour-coded-response-system-to-fight-covid/article35089715.ece
02 July 2021||New Delhi,||Any private person can arrest proclaimed offender, says HC||Any private person can arrest a “proclaimed offender” and hand him over without unnecessary delay to a police officer or nearest police station, the Delhi High Court has ruled. Justice J.R. Midha laid down the guidelines to be followed by the courts before declaring a person as a “proclaimed offender” and the follow-up action needed to be taken by the law enforcement agencies. The High Court also directed the Delhi Police and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to create a Special Cell for tracing out the “proclaimed offenders” for attaching their movable or immovable properties and for their prosecution. This Special Cell be created within a period of four weeks, the court ordered. While the law with respect to the declaration of a person as a “proclaimed offender” is well settled, the court noted: “There appears to be the tendency of the Court as well as the Police to close the matter after the person is declared as a Proclaimed Person/Offender and the file is consigned to Record Room”. “This is a serious lapse considering that the criminal law, which sets into motion with the filing of an FIR, comes to an abrupt end which is against the most basic tenets of justice and causes an irreparable injury to the entire society including victims,” it said. As per latest status report submitted by the Delhi Police, there are 26,532 ‘proclaimed offenders’ as on September 31, 2019, of which 3,826 have been arrested, the prosecution has been launched against 1,601 and properties of 28 have been attached. The High Court said all the courts are directed not to close the matter after declaring a person as a “proclaimed offender”. “Rather, the courts shall direct the police to file the status report with respect to the efforts made to trace the Proclaimed Persons/Offenders; efforts made to trace or attach their movable/ immovable assets/properties and their prosecution in accordance with law,” it said. The High Court added that the courts concerned have to monitor the action taken by the police. “Whoever knowingly harbours a Proclaimed Offender to prevent his apprehension is liable to be punished under Section 216 IPC with imprisonment up to 7 years in certain cases,” the HC cautioned. Justice Midha said the names, addresses and pictures of the “proclaimed offenders” be made public on different government websites such as Delhi Police, NCRB, CBI and other States Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/any-private-person-can-arrest-proclaimed-offender-says-hc/article35089701.ece

02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Need to adopt novel approaches in teaching’||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said there was a need to urgently adopt novel approaches in teaching and learning to reduce the gap created by COVID. Mr. Sisodia, also the Education Minister, was speaking at an event to inaugurate the construction of a new placement centre, open theater and auditorium at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. “The education sector has incurred maximum loss due to the pandemic. Reducing the learning gap is a very difficult mission to undertake, but an important one. We have to come together and take the responsibility of adopting newer and better approaches to teaching and learning in order to reduce this learning gap,” Mr. Sisodia said. Speaking on approaches to use in our online or semi-online modules, he said it would be incredibly unfair to students if we insist on teaching in traditional ways. “We need to adopt a massive change in our teaching methods so that we can do justice to our present and future generation of children. I appeal to the teachers to adopt new and innovative methods of teaching and share them with other colleagues so that we can collectively reduce the learning gap of the students caused due to COVID19,” the Minister said. Mr. Sisodia also laid the foundation stone for the construction of a new school in Nasirpur Village in south-west Delhi. The Minister said the land was given to DDA by Gram Sabha and then DDA handed over the land to Education Department to construct a school, but it was unlawfully captured by the land mafia. But, the Delhi government had recently reclaimed the land. “The Delhi government will complete the construction of this school within nine months and establish a state-of-the-art schooling facility. Along with providing excellent education, the school will also set up outstanding sports-related facilities including a swimming pool,” Mr. Sisodia said. He added that at present, the nearest school in the area hosts 6,000 students and with the construction of this school, the pressure on the other school will also decrease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/need-to-adopt-novel-approaches-in-teaching/article35089709.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. enforces HC order on 15% fee deduction in city private schools||The Delhi government on Thursday enforced a High Court order that would lead to a 15% deduction in overall fees charged by private schools in the city for the academic year 2021-22. The deduction is in lieu of unutilised facilities. “In order to clear the confusion and give much-needed relief to parents, Delhi government has issued an order to private schools to charge fees on monthly basis, under approved heads only but with a 15% deduction in the fees for the academic year 2020-21,” the Delhi government said. It added that the school management shall not prevent the child from any ongoing activities or strike off the name of the student if the parents are unable to pay the fee due to the current hardship arising due to COVID-19. “The order to deduct the fees by 15% as directed by the Delhi High Court has been carried out to prevent profiteering and commercialisation in times of COVID. This order directed by the Delhi government is applicable to all the 460 schools that petitioned the HC. The reduction of fees will be a respite for all the students and parents during the time of COVID,” the government said. The government said if the monthly fee of the school in FY 2020-21 is Rs. 3,000, the schools are entitled to collect the fee at Rs. 2,550/month after a deduction of 15%. If the school has collected the fee in excess of the direction referred above, the same shall be refunded to the parents or adjusted in the subsequent month of a fee to the parents, the govt. said. An order by the Directorate of Education reiterated that no earmarked levies such as transportation charges will be charged during the period when the school remains closes. It added that in no case shall the school demand and collect fees from the parent/students on a quarterly basis. Schools have also been directed to not stop the payment of monthly salary nor reduce the existing total emolument to the teaching and non-teaching staff in the name of non-availability of funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/govt-enforces-hc-order-on-15-fee-deduction-in-city-private-schools/article35089711.ece

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Xi hails ‘national rejuvenation’ on centenary||China’s leader Xi Jinping on Thursday said the country’s rejuvenation was “a historical inevitability” and it could no longer be “bullied and abused by others”, delivering a strong message on the ruling Communist Party’s centenary. Mr. Xi, who is the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) general secretary, the country’s President, and head of the military, delivered an hour-long speech to a crowd of thousands on Tiananmen Square, accompanied by the Politburo and past senior leaders, including former President Hu Jintao, on the rostrum from where former leader Mao Zedong would address mass rallies. The Mao parallels did not stop there. The celebration began, as it often did in the Mao era, with a choir of some 3,000 students singing in praise of the party. Mr. Xi, who has since taking over in 2012 elevated his standing in the party on a par with Mao, was the only one among the suited leadership dressed in a dark green Mao-suit. Thursday’s ceremony began with helicopters flying over Tiananmen carrying the red Communist Party flag with hammer and sickle, followed by 15 J-20 stealth fighters, all tailored for a show of strength. Mr. Xi’s speech focused on themes he has stressed since taking over in 2012 — the “national rejuvenation” of China as well as greater political centralisation, with his term seeing a move away from a collective leadership model with term limits to rule by one “core” leader. “China’s success hinges on the party,” he said. “We must be deeply conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central party leadership. We must uphold the core position of the General Secretary on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and uphold the Central Committee’s authority and its centralised, unified leadership.” He praised the party’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics” model for “enabling China to transform itself from a highly centralised planned economy to a socialist market economy brimming with vitality, and from a country that was largely isolated to one that is open to the outside world across the board” and is now the second-largest economy. He said the party had, since its congress in 2012 when he came to power, “fulfilled the first centenary goal” which was eliminating absolute poverty, a landmark the government said was achieved this year. The second centenary goal, referring to the People’s Republic of China’s centenary in 2049, would be to build China “into a great modern socialist country in all respects”. Mr. Xi also had a strong message for the world, reflecting on China’s past history of “humiliation”. “After the Opium War of 1840, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before. The country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilisation was plunged into darkness,” he said. Sense of pride Now, Chinese people “are not intimidated by threats of force” and had “a strong sense of pride and confidence”. While China was “eager to learn what lessons we can from the achievements of other cultures and welcome[s] helpful suggestions and constructive criticism”, it “will not accept sanctimonious preaching from those who feel they have the right to lecture us.” Mr. Xi called for “accelerating the modernisation of national defence and the armed forces” and said “a strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation”. China would “elevate our people’s armed forces to world-class standards so that we are equipped with greater capacity and more reliable means for safeguarding our national sovereignty, security, and development interests”, he said, with the party earlier announcing a target to complete military modernisation by 2050. He said China would oppose “zero-sum games” as well as “hegemony and power politics”. On Hong Kong, which has since last year’s controversial national security law come under the most direct control of Beijing so far since the 1997 handover, he said China would “ensure that the central government exercises overall jurisdiction”. He said “resolving the Taiwan question and realising China’s complete reunification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment” for the party. China would “advance peaceful national reunification” but would “take resolute action to utterly defeat any attempt toward ‘Taiwan independence’,” he said. “No one,” he added, “should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, a statement that elicited the loudest cheers on Thursday from the crowd at Tiananmen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-hails-national-rejuvenation-on-centenary/article35089158.ece
02 July 2021||Washington,||Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld passes away||Donald Rumsfeld, former U.S. Defense Secretary and one of the architects of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq in 2003, has died at the age of 88 at his home in Taos, New Mexico, according to his family. Mr. Rumsfeld was Defense Secretary during 1975-1977, during the Gerald Ford administration, and then in the George W. Bush administration, during 2001 – 2006. “It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of Donald Rumsfeld, an American statesman and devoted husband, grandfather and great grandfather,” read a notice from the Rumsfeld family, posted on Twitter.  The New York Times reported that a family spokesperson had said that the cause of death was multiple myeloma. In 2001, as Defense Secretary, Mr. Rumsfeld oversaw the U.S. strikes in Afghanistan, following the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. The U.S. sought to overthrow the Taliban regime which was providing safe haven to terror group al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the September 11 attacks. In 2003, Mr. Rumsfeld was a key player in the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq, ostensibly to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing and deploying weapons of mass destruction (these were never found).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/former-us-defense-secretary-donald-rumsfeld-passes-away/article35089148.ece
02 July 2021||COLOMBO,||India seeks Maldivian govt. action on ‘repeated attacks’ in media||India has sought Maldivian government action on persons behind media reports and social media posts “attacking the dignity” of its resident diplomats, while seeking greater security for the officials. In a letter that has raised eyebrows within the Maldives, the High Commission of India said the “repeated attacks” were “motivated, malicious and increasingly personal”. Urging the Foreign Ministry to take steps to “ensure enhanced protection” of the Mission and its officials, the letter from the Indian High Commission, dated June 24, urged authorities to “ensure action, in accordance with International Law and Maldivian Law” against the perpetrators for “these gross violations” of the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations. Official sources in Male confirmed the authenticity of the letter, which was leaked and has since been shared on social media. However, neither the Foreign Ministry nor the High Commission of India responded on the development, when The Hindu sought comment. While India-Maldives ties came under considerable strain during former President Abdulla Yameen’s term, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s government is seen to be a close ally of India, with enhanced development and defence cooperation since 2018. However, some government critics are wary of greater military ties with India that they see as paving way for “boots on the ground”. In May, an apparently premature announcement made in New Delhi, on the Cabinet clearing a proposal to set up a second mission in the Maldives, sparked concern among sections, prompting a renewed “#Indiaout” campaign on Maldivian social media. In its recent letter, the High Commission of India said the “repeated attacks” were undertaken to “create enmity and hatred between the people and Government of Maldives, and the people and Government of India”. While Male is yet to comment, sources said the Parliament has asked the country’s Media Council, a self-regulatory body, to look into the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-seeks-maldivian-govt-action-on-repeated-attacks-in-media/article35089149.ece
02 July 2021||Paris,||Macron worries about ‘racialised’ French society||French society is becoming increasingly “racialised”, French President Emmanuel Macron has warned in comments that blamed imported U.S. social science ideas that focus on race. “I see that our society is becoming progressively racialised,” Mr. Macron told Elle magazine in an interview. He took aim in particular at the idea of “intersectionality” — popular among left-leaning U.S. academics — that seeks to explain discrimination and poverty by examining the role played by race and gender in affecting an individual’s life chances. “The logic of intersectionality fractures everything,” Mr. Macron said. “I stand for universalism. I don’t agree with a fight that reduces everyone to their identity or their particularity,” he continued. “Social difficulties are not only explained by gender and the colour of your skin, but also by social inequalities.” He added that he could think of young white men in his hometown of Amiens or nearby Saint-Quentin in northern France “who also have immense difficulties, for different reasons, in finding a job”. Movements against racism over the last year such as Black Lives Matter, which resonated in France after arriving from the U.S., have led to fears among some critics that the country is importing American racial and identity politics sometimes labelled as “woke culture.” A new generation of younger French activists are increasingly vocal in denouncing the problem of racism in France and the legacy of the country’s colonial past in Africa and the West Asia. Their opponents see the focus on race and the past as opening up unnecessary divisions and encouraging a culture in which minorities and women see themselves as constantly oppressed and discriminated against. Mr. Macron also promised to do more to combat domestic violence and women’s health problems such as endometriosis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/macron-worries-about-racialised-french-society/article35089155.ece

The village of Lytton, 250 km northeast of Vancouver, was evacuated on Wednesday night because of a fire that spread quickly. The heat wave has stretched emergency services, with at least 134 people dying suddenly since Friday in the Vancouver area and hundreds more across British Columbia, which recorded 49.6 degrees Celsius, according to Canadian police. In the U.S., Washington recorded at least 16 deaths related to the heat wave, county health officials said.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||What lies ahead for IBC and stressed assets resolution?||The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), notified in 2016, has been the key mechanism for addressing corporate distress and the accumulation of bad loans in the financial sector since its implementation. Recent National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) rulings have also put the spotlight on the IBC. In a conversation moderated by Suresh Seshadri , Aparna Ravi and R.K. Bansal discuss questions about the effectiveness of the process and the road ahead. Edited excerpts: It has been five years since the IBC came into force. How has it fared and what are its biggest challenges? R.K. Bansal:One basic difference between us and other countries is that our companies are mainly promoter-owned and owners run the companies. In most of the developed countries, companies are run by professionals and the ownership is widely spread. Here, because it is owned and controlled as well as managed by mostly the same people, that creates a problem in taking over the asset. I think, overall, over the last five years, it has done quite well. And Section 29A [of the IBC], which was introduced by the government later, also helped in resolving some of these problems. I would say the recoveries and resolutions have been quite good, quite fast, compared to other measures available to the lenders. Today, on average, one can see maybe about three years [for recoveries and resolutions] as compared to an earlier timeline of five years, six years or more. But there are infrastructure issues. We need more NCLTs and we need more members. There are a lot of vacancies, a lot of delays in appointments, NCLAT [National Company Law Appellate Tribunal] benches are few. So, that is one area perhaps that we need to strengthen. The second issue is that a lot of these are very old cases — what we call stock of NPAs [Non-Performing Assets]. So, once this round is over, in future, perhaps, there will be fewer cases and we should be able to take care. The Act will do better actually, if not many cases go to the NCLT. Because the fear of losing the company under Section 49A will push the promoters to find a resolution. Aparna Ravi:The initial version of the IBC that came into effect in December 2016 is quite different from what we have today. But around this whole issue about the NCLT’s functioning itself — I think there have been a lot of delays in implementation, whether it’s in terms of approvals, having an application admitted itself. In some situations, an application is filed for admission and it takes almost a year to actually be admitted. And even things like the approval of a resolution plan... The resolution plan that was approved for Jet Airways recently was actually approved by the Creditors’ Committee in October 2020. The NCLT has a very limited role: it just needs to approve the resolution plan based on whether the plan complies with applicable law. But it [resolution plan for Jet Airways] was only approved in June 2021. These kinds of delays are a significant issue with the implementation of the code, coupled with the fact that even though the Supreme Court has clarified a number of legal positions in the last few years around the IBC, it doesn’t seem like in some situations the tribunals have laid to rest these positions. They still allow these same issues to be litigated again. This seems to me the biggest implementation challenge with the code itself. There are concerns about the extent of haircuts that banks and financial creditors are having to take in order to achieve resolution. Are these concerns valid or misplaced? RKB:I would not say they are misplaced, but I would say we need to understand the context. The haircut figure looks large in some cases because of many reasons. I remember the first case approved by the NCLT was Synergies-Dooray, where the haircut was 94%. But at that time this was not prominent as this was a smaller case. Now, why does it happen? The claims filed are of three types: secured lenders, operational creditors, unsecured lenders, and then you have a lot of guarantee obligations of that company. Now, that guarantee obligation sometimes makes the dues multiple times that of a normal case. I have seen some cases where the total dues may be Rs. 500 crore, but because of the guarantee, the total dues claimed are from Rs. 6,000 crore to Rs. 7,000 crore. So, when the Rs. 500 crore company goes for resolution and you get a plan for Rs. 200 crore, it is 40%, so the haircut is 60%. But then if you compare this Rs. 200 crore figure with Rs. 7,000 crore-Rs. 8,000 crore including guarantees, the haircut will look very large. And this happens typically in holding companies, which are the main companies and which have given the guarantees — whether it was OMML, Lanco Infra, or even recently Videocon, I mean those type of cases where there are a lot of assets, a lot of companies in the group, and guarantee has been given for many of these companies by this company. So, now, the question is haircut is relevant in the context of what is the asset, what are the debts, what are the guarantees, what are the other group assets. Now, out of the first 12 cases filed by the banks in 2017, even today, five got the resolution, which were steel cases because steel is a commodity sector and the assets are good. So, you got very good value in those. Out of five also their percentages are different, of course: Essar Steel or Bhushan Steel got quite a good value, then Bhushan Power and Steel somewhat lower, and Monnet was the least in those five cases. Then, you had a company called Binani Cement which was not out of the 12 but you got almost more than 100% because the asset was good. Then you had two, three cases which are going into liquidation, so banks may not get much — the haircut could be as high as 99% or 95%. Like Lanco Infra, which was a holding company again, or an EPC [engineering procurement and construction] company like Era Infra or Jyothi Structures. Finally, it depends on the company and its asset. You will get value if the asset is good. Some businesses would have failed, like many of the EPC companies, where haircuts are very high. Because basically in an EPC company there are hardly any assets, except some equipment. And some of them have diverted funds. Some of them lost money in contracts, government dues are there, government departments or entities actually withheld dues, levied a lot of penalties because of the delays. I think you need to understand that. AR:I don’t think the size of the haircut itself is really a measure of the success of IBC. If the process itself is to improve, what we need to think about is how to attract more buyers or a more diverse range of strategic buyers to be willing to bid for assets, and submit resolution plans under the code. And I think a big part of that is improving the process in terms of minimising the delays, increasing the predictability. Those are issues that do need to be ironed out.  Is there something, especially from the legal side, that can be done to improve the process? AR:One thing is, of course, adherence to the timelines by all the stakeholders. The other area, from a legal point of view, is around who can submit a resolution plan itself. And I think on that Mr. Bansal too had a number of views on Section 29A that prevents promoters, in a lot of cases, from submitting resolution plans. I understand the rationale behind this, and there are some restrictions under Section 29A that make a lot of sense — for example, a wilful defaulter probably should not be allowed to submit a resolution plan under the IBC. But some of the other restrictions such as one on [a promoter] who has had NPAs for over a year, or who’s had a personal guarantee that has been invoked... in those cases I think that would result in a lot of the promoters of most companies not being able to submit resolution plans. There has been a relaxation which allows MSMEs to have greater flexibility in terms of promoters being able to submit resolution plans for these companies. This is something that can be considered just to lay the floor open to a larger number of resolution plans. Of course, nobody is required to accept a resolution plan. There needs to be a fair process where many of the processes are open to a number of people. Allowing certain relaxations to Section 29A could be helpful.  Do you see a larger role for the proposed national ARC in stressed assets resolution? RKB:The national ARC (Asset Reconstruction Company), or so called ‘bad bank’, should help. It’s a good thing because it’s a one-time exercise, a good clean-up exercise. Because a lot of these cases don’t have a great resolution plan or they don’t have great value left. So, many of these cases perhaps need to be warehoused for some time. If I try to sell a power plant today in thermal power, we may get a value of only Rs. 2 crore per megawatt, while the country will still need power and a power plant requires Rs. 5 crore-Rs. 6 crore per megawatt just to build up because there is excess capacity, because there is a problem in the thermal power sector. The other point is that there are not many strategic investors. An asset will have interest or value only if there are more people who are ready to buy, like say the steel cases, where there were a number of suitors. But today in power, there’s hardly one or two people in India who will be interested in buying power assets, and typically foreign players don’t buy thermal power because of the coal issue and social issues. So, what happens is, today you need to wait for some time for some of these assets. You have to work along, then your recovery will be far, far better. A national ARC will give the time to the banks to resolve these cases over a period of time. Besides strengthening the IBC infrastructure, how else could resolution be expedited? AR:What we do see is that sometimes there isn’t an appointment made for these benches for some time... there’s one judicial member who is in charge of two benches. Some of those NCLT benches only function on certain days of the week because that’s when the judicial member or the technical member are both available, so definitely there needs to be capacity building in terms of NCLT. It’s also worth considering that the IBC cases are not the only mandate of the NCLT. They also consider various cases under the Companies Act such as mergers or oppression and mismanagement cases. A different point is also to remember that the IBC is not the only solution for resolving stress. It’s important to look at a range of different options both within and outside the IBC for resolving distress, and especially through these pre-IBC mechanisms, one-time settlements, restructuring packages. It’s important to look at them all as part of the spectrum. Especially in cases where there is some consensus with the debtor and the debtor and the creditors, these pre-IBC resolutions may work very well as well.  If the process itself is to improve, what we need to think about is how to attract more buyers or a more diverse range of strategic buyers to be willing to bid for assets, and submit resolution plans under the code.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Envisioning the post-pandemic smart city||Six years ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government started a journey of urban development based on the belief that a select set of cities across the country could be ‘transformed’ and made smart, after they were chosen through a competition among the States. The Centre would support the chosen projects and others would learn from them. The idea of a transformation is indicated in BJP’s manifesto for the 2014 election (https://bit.ly/3waHAQ0 and https://bit.ly/3h8Omll), where, in a reference to the squalor that has traditionally marked cities and towns, the party declared that they should “no longer remain a reflection of poverty and bottlenecks. Rather they should become symbols of efficiency, speed and scale”. This racy vision laid the foundation for a programme to create 100 smart cities. The general concept Globally, there is no uniform definition of smart cities, and the most common features of such urban spaces are derived from concepts in the global north. They generally have a technocentric vision, with sensors everywhere, smart homes, high levels of connectivity, massive and ubiquitous data collection by various agencies, and a continuous flow of useful information to citizens. All this, the reasoning goes, can help governments allocate resources optimally and take timely decisions to raise efficiency and improve standards of living. India’s cities have well-known infrastructure deficits, inadequate water supply, waste management, sewerage and transport arrangements, high levels of pollution and, with climate change, frequent extremes of floods and drought. The answer to these, the Smart Cities Mission (https://smartcities.gov.in/), has been fashioned as an amalgam of upgraded civic services and expensive showpiece projects in the chosen cities, with the investments heavily influenced by the Centre. Now, a health focus Before a complete critique of the expensive programme could emerge, COVID-19 interrupted the lives of cities, confining people indoors for long periods, disrupting economic processes and paralysing vibrant urban life. As the pandemic peaked, thousands had to desperately look for emergency medical care in scarce health facilities, while the flashy smart developments built for leisure and shopping remained shuttered. Unsurprisingly, when the Smart City Awards 2020 were declared recently, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs gave one component of the scheme, the Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs), a health focus. These centres, of which 70 are operational, functioned as “war rooms” for COVID-19, and, combined with “other smart infrastructure developed under the mission, helped cities in fighting the pandemic through information dissemination, improving communication, predictive analysis and supporting effective management” (https://bit.ly/3hmZZE0), it said. This is a remarkable image of efficiency, but it would seem incongruous with the lived reality in several States and the national capital during the second wave of the pandemic, as people struggled for information and access to medical care. Yet, one of the States that suffered severely, Uttar Pradesh, shot to the top for implementation metrics of the smart cities projects (https://bit.ly/3yaBbFX), apparently because it achieved more than what was envisaged in the centrally-supported schemes. It added its own set of ‘State smart cities’. The fact that U.P., a crucial BJP-ruled State scarred by the pandemic, is bound for elections next year must, of course, be treated as a coincidence. Indore and Surat jointly won top city-level awards, while Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu also won State awards. Infrastructural convergence Over the years, Smart Cities Mission projects converged with other infrastructure programmes such as AMRUT, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, the PMAY (Urban), the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, for housing. Some also get support from international agencies to adopt best practices on mobility and transport, energy and reducing carbon emissions. The latest official count shows that 5,924 Mission projects worth Rs. 1,78,500 crore have been tendered, indicating the scale of investments. This is in tune with some estimates that globally, 90% of urban development by mid-century will take place in developing countries. A focus on basic urban infrastructure prioritised by elected representatives was part of national policy since the Third Plan period (1961-66), although the focus shifted to smaller towns away from Bombay and Calcutta in the Fourth Plan (1969-74). After decades of slow experiments, the post-COVID-19 era will sharpen the question of how cities must evolve. The Danish urban design expert, Jan Gehl, who is averse to the idea of smart cities and “silly gimmicks”, speaks of the universal values of a city as one that is a meeting place of people, inviting them to spend time, walk, bike, and roam around public, semi-public or private gardens. Pedestrianisation over motorisation is also a marker of a good city. Although they try to accommodate some of these elements, India’s smart city plans cannot really aspire for a structural shift, in which the movement of people gets priority over vehicles. In fact, extending the green logic would imply a freeze on all diversion of wetlands and commons for any other development, creating new urban gardens and water bodies, and doing a climate change audit for every piece of infrastructure planned. A green and blue city would mean less destructive flooding, more water to harvest and lower peak temperatures — all of it at very little expense. Use for the commons Cities could be elegant, healthy and smart after the pandemic if they apportion the available road space for bicycles, which exemplify safe travel and can complement expanded public transport when commuters return in big numbers to bus and urban rail. This is consistent with the pan-city goals of the Smart City Mission, but requires State governments to take resolute action. Bicycles represent the ideal urban travel bubble and must be moved from the margins to the centre of policy. Pedestrianisation, biking and harmonious opportunities for street vending created by allocating more of the commons would also be fully democratic and address the criticism that smart city planning ignores the informality that marks India’s urban spaces. This is valid for both cities being retrofitted with facilities and those being developed as greenfield sites. Can more of the commons be turned into farmers’ markets, vending grounds and craft centres? None of this detracts from essential modernisation, such as deployment of multiple sensors to gauge air, noise and water pollution, provision of electronic delivery of citizen services, whether online or in a government office, intelligent public transport, expansion of renewable energy. Recovery of valuable materials from waste remains a lost opportunity even in the biggest cities. It would, however, mean a shift away from flyovers, underpasses and cheap parking lots that serve far fewer citizens. For citizens, real time control rooms can be meaningful only if they can have a good public dashboard of information. In COVID-19 times, this means access to health alerts, vaccinations, hospital beds and topical advice, rounded off with data on pollution, rainfall, congestion and so on. Democratising smart cities planning has to ensure every section of society has a voice in the process, and not merely those who have digital access. Pressure to frame projects, however, often cuts out many, and even elected representatives get short shrift. The Housing Ministry said last year that it had no plan to issue a report card for the 100 chosen smart cities, but was using the Ease of Living Index measured through a public perception survey. Such measurements can be heavily biased if they are not broad based. Quite tellingly, out of 32.2 lakh citizens in 111 cities who participated in a survey, the online channel which could be accessed through a QR code or website attracted 31,05,481 items of feedback (https://bit.ly/3xmSlQE and https://bit.ly/3hlVkSR). The pandemic has come as a remarkable opportunity to review the paradigm of smart cities, and to steer the course of hundreds of other towns that are not on the map. They should be helped to frame their plans around people and nature, to learn from mistakes and to avoid expensive technological solutionism. ananthakrishnan.g@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/envisioning-the-post-pandemic-smart-city/article35089138.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A bubble burst is no figment of the imagination||‘Your investment would have doubled by now, had you invested in the stock market in March 2020.’ An assertion like this triggers an urgent rush to invest in the market and is akin to being under the influence of a “feel-good” hormone. This makes the expectation of ‘winning big’ feel better than ‘just winning’ leading to impulsive, even detrimental decisions, attributable to behaviour biases, to use the terminology of behavioural economists. Perception versus reality Investors may not necessarily be always sensible or even capable of perceiving the larger picture. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman argues that humans usually use the ‘first system’ of ‘fast thinking’ to hurriedly act and perceive their environment. Consequently, they are susceptible to the ‘priming effect’, ‘framing bias’, ‘anchoring effect’, ‘overconfidence bias’ and ‘availability heuristic’. These phenomena, thus, play their part in pervading optimistic market conditions. As a result, investors often end up ignoring or overlooking uncertainties and risks involved in their decision. They get so enamoured with the idea of making a killing that they forget that in the month of March last year itself, the market had tanked a fourth of its capitalisation causing mayhem. At the same time, investors’ decision choices could be significantly influenced by ‘nudging’, a deliberate tactics and method of behaviour modification by which it is the ‘choice architect’ that decides who does what and who does so, as argued by the Nobel laureate, Richard H. Thaler. The present surge in the Indian stock market is indeed nudging individual investors to trade more. But who is playing the role of the choice architect and what their intentions are, remain the moot questions. Focus on individual investor National Stock Exchange data indicate that the share of the non-institutional individual investors in equity trading volume has risen to one half of the total turnover in 2021 as compared to around a third in 2016. In contrast, the share of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in the total trading volume has shrunk to just about a tenth making it half of what it used to be in 2016. Trading in the stock market, the sudden rise, the intraday moves, etc., are, thus, attributable largely to individual traders now. Their large trading volumes notwithstanding, individual investors have actually contracted their holding of the market capitalisation. Going by the floating stocks of the market collectively, the FIIs currently own around half of the free float of all Indian companies. Apparently, the retail investors have constantly sold their stake to end up holding less than 20% shares now. Trading, thus, seems to be the mainstay of retail investors and this is what makes them more vulnerable to the vagaries of the market. The market today During the period under discussion, the fundamental, economic and environmental parameters look confused. GDP has shrunk by at least 7.5%, unemployment rate has been on the rise, and an overwhelming number of people are said to be sliding back into poverty or becoming poorer than a year before. At the same time, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. data of the listed companies reveal a rise in their profit, due to rationalisation and cost-cutting. Investors might be tempted to ignore macroeconomic factors and invest in such stock believing that it is the profit that impels the stock prices. In reality, however, share price is expected to ascend if a company declares to cut its wage bill. This probably explains why stock markets around the world have been on the rise amidst the novel coronavirus pandemic; demand may have declined but profits have been least impacted. At the larger economic level, however, real wages have plunged. Clearly, the market has not entirely decoupled itself from the economic indicators. Stimulus or profit or euphoria caused by happy hormones, whatever the reason apart, the stock market has been drawing available excess liquidity. Simultaneously, frequent trading has been propelling the stock market further up. But how long can this last? Established wisdom suggests that corporates cannot sustain contraction in the economy for long. Sustained decline in demand caused by waning disposable household income would catch them soon A grey cloud Consequently, corporates would be saddled with unsold goods or services, leading to a drop in their prices, with a consequential effect on their revenue which would exert downward pressure on their stock prices. This is, however, not to deny that stock markets are always futuristic and stock prices imitate investors expectations. But how long can expectation drive the market if the economy does not revive soon? Robert J. Shiller, another Nobel laureate, attributes this phenomenon of creating a possible bubble to irrational exuberance. And bubbles are seldom long lasting and burst sooner rather than later. When bubbles burst, they cause a kind of financial earthquake, in turn destabilising public trust in the integrity of the financial system. Critically, as the past portrays, individual investors, with all their vulnerabilities, suffer the most devastating consequences. Retail investors are as well susceptible to overreaction when negative news hits the market. For example, a week of turbulence eroded market capitalisation of over Rs. 1-lakh crore in the case of just six listed companies of the Adani group (https://bit.ly/2UW0JbM). For an individual investor, who had purchased these shares during the last month, this means that he lost his entire investment. These companies are closely held, with promoters holding around 75% stake, but imagine the mayhem if this happens to a widely held company. A bubble burst is in the realm of recurrent reality and cannot be ignored as a figment of the imagination.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Delhi’s lame duck Assembly||The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD)(Amendment) Act, 2021 has been extensively criticised as a retrograde law that turns the clock back on representative democracy. The bulk of criticism has been focused on the reduced autonomy of the elected government and the consequent vesting of several crucial powers in the unelected Lieutenant Governor, who is the representative of the Union government. This is largely attributable to public consciousness of the regular skirmishes between the elected government and the Lieutenant Governor. However, what deserves equal condemnation is the Act’s assault on the functioning of Delhi’s Legislative Assembly, which has been sought to be reduced to a lame duck. A delicate balance When the GNCTD Act was enacted in 1992, the Legislative Assembly was given the power to regulate its own procedure, as well as the conduct of its business. This was subject to very limited exceptions concerning financial matters and scrutiny over the Lieutenant Governor’s discretionary role. This sought to realise a delicate balance reflecting Delhi’s unique constitutional position: neither full state nor a centrally governed Union Territory. However, the Amendment Act drives a coach and horses through this scheme. Now, Delhi’s Assembly has no more functional independence worth its name. Its standards of procedure and conduct of business have been firmly tethered to that of the Lok Sabha, depriving Delhi’s elected MLAs of an effective say in how their Assembly should be run. Even more insidiously, the Amending Act prohibits the Assembly from making any rule enabling either itself or its committees to consider any issue concerned with “the day-to-day administration of the capital” or “conduct inquiries in relation to administrative decisions”. This is rounded off by providing that any rule made before the Amendment Act came into effect that runs counter to this formulation shall be void. The most insidious impact of this shall be to the exercise of free speech in the Assembly and its committees. A situation where an elected Assembly is prohibited by law from discussing matters concerning the day-to-day administration of its own territory is one where it is dead on arrival. How can the Assembly be expected to perform its most basic legislative function — that of holding the executive to account — if it cannot guarantee itself the ability to freely discuss the goings on in the capital? What is the use of electing MLAs and endowing them with legislative privilege if they are unable to discuss the governance of the very constituents who elected them? Impact on committees A note of alarm must also be sounded for the effect on the functioning of the Assembly’s committees. These committees are usually inured from the sound and fury of political theatre that pervade sittings of the whole Assembly. Away from the glare of cameras, cooler heads usually prevail and important work gets done. Inquiries are conducted, witnesses and documents are examined, and reports on relevant issues are written. The deliberations and inputs of committees often pave the way for intelligent legislative action. In a way, they act as the eyes and ears for the whole House, which has neither the time nor the expertise to scrutinise issues in depth. It would be impossible for committees to perform this function without the power to conduct inquiries. It is true that many of these inquiries are bound to be broad-based and roving in nature, and may even lead to legislative dead ends. But to pre-emptively injunct a committee from conducting an inquiry “in relation to the administrative decisions” (an extremely broad exception) completely negates the ability of committees to function effectively as the Assembly’s advisors and agents. The quality of legislative work emanating from the Assembly is thus ultimately bound to suffer. This clinical purge of its critical legislative functions has rendered the Delhi Assembly a ‘legislature’ in name only, unable both to articulate the concerns of the electorate and hold the political executive to account. Surely, Delhi’s voters deserve better than that. Shourya Dasgupta is an advocate practising in Delhi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/delhis-lame-duck-assembly/article35089141.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Relief and recompense||It is a matter of relief and satisfaction that the Supreme Court has prodded the Union government to perform its statutory duty of fixing a compensation for the families of those who lost their kin to the COVID-19 pandemic. The order comes close on the heels of a slew of directions on registering the country’s vast unorganised workforce and its army of inter-State labourers on a national database and ensuring that none of them went hungry. On the issue of making an ex gratia payment to those affected by the pandemic, a notified disaster under the Disaster Management Act, the Centre initially took the untenable stand that it lacked the financial resources to compensate for every COVID-19 death. However, it later admitted that it was not the adequacy of resources that made it avoid any compensation, but rather its decision to prioritise expenditure in response to the pandemic. It is indeed true that unlike more frequent disasters such as cyclones, earthquakes and floods, a pandemic that has hit every country is not a one-time calamity, but an ongoing and prolonged phenomenon. However, the Court has rightly found that this was not reason enough for the Government to evade its duty to include ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life in its guidelines for “minimum standards of relief” to those hit by the disaster. The Court correctly did not fix a compensation amount for each death, leaving it to a policy decision by the National Disaster Management Authority and the Centre. In an earlier order, the Court dealt with the need for comprehensive registration of all inter-State and unorganised workers in the country. It is unfortunate that it needed a pandemic, and the resulting humanitarian, social and economic crisis for millions of workers, to give an impetus to the process. The Supreme Court, while disposing of suo motu proceedings on the miseries of migrant labourers, has now fixed a deadline of December 31 this year for all States and Union Territories to complete the process. The Centre has been given a deadline of July 31 to make available a portal for its National Database for Unorganised Workers (NDUW) project so that it may be used for registering unorganised workers across the country. However, the Union government, which was directed to make such a common module available to the States as far back as in August 2018, claimed the work on developing the portal was affected due to the fallout of the pandemic. The Court has pulled up the Union Labour Ministry for its “apathy and lackadaisical attitude” and directed that the process of registration should begin by July 31. The verdicts open up the possibility that the inter-State and unorganised workers will at last be able to reap the benefits of welfare laws enacted for them. These interventions signify the rejuvenation and assertion of a court seen as somewhat reticent until recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/relief-and-recompense/article35089129.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Later than ever||The Union Territory of Puducherry has finally got a Council of Ministers. It has taken almost two months after the Assembly election results, and 50 days since the assumption of office by N. Rangasamy as Chief Minister, for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to get five nominees sworn in as Ministers, three from his party, the All India N.R. Congress (AINRC), and two from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). What makes Puducherry’s first NDA Ministry stand out from the earlier coalition ministries is the inordinate delay in its formation despite there being a pre-poll alliance. The impact of the deadly second wave of the pandemic did not add any sense of urgency to the parties to thrash out their differences. But there could be more trouble to come. Portfolios have not been allocated to the five Ministers who were sworn in on Sunday. The Chief Minister’s illness was not the only obvious reason for the delay in cabinet formation; there were also differences between the partners and within the BJP local unit. The central government too appeared to have supported the Chief Minister’s not-so-enthusiastic response to the local BJP unit’s demand for the post of Deputy Chief Minister as it did not create any such post. However, the BJP, which has nine MLAs in the Assembly, including three nominated legislators, is tasting power for the first time in the Union Territory; the party has also got the post of Assembly Speaker. For all the delay, those involved in the Cabinet formation, including Mr. Rangasamy, deserve credit for the social balance in the Council of Ministers, which has three former Ministers, two representatives of Scheduled Castes and a woman. There is a strong possibility that the two parties would continue to have differences over the implementation of their manifestos, the key one being the AINRC’s emphasis on Statehood which the national party is silent on. The territorial administration is not in the pink of health as far as its finances are concerned. According to the Budget for 2020-21, debt servicing accounts for about 18% of the revenue expenditure of the administration annually, in addition to salaries and pensions constituting around 35% and power purchase, 17%. Under such circumstances, it is not hard to guess how many of the goodies promised by the two parties would translate into reality. Instead of committing itself to many new measures, the Council of Ministers should ensure that existing welfare schemes, including social security pension to age group-wise beneficiaries, are well implemented. The Centre should also be empathetic and provide a package by waiving “legacy loans”, those taken about 15 years ago. Mr. Rangasamy and Ministers should ensure corruption-free and quality administration, instead of engaging in political bickering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/later-than-ever/article35089130.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Tracking down meetings behind the scenes||News is a chase, I remember thinking, as we sped down that long, dimly lit road in Sharm El Sheikh, trying to keep up with the Pakistani Foreign Secretary’s car. We had spied him leaving the hotel where the Indian delegation was staying and went in pursuit of the car, hoping to doorstep him into telling us where India-Pakistan negotiations, on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement meet being held at the Egyptian resort town in 2009, were headed. Much of diplomatic coverage means tracking down such meetings behind the scenes and back-channel contacts between governments of countries that aren’t otherwise willing to speak about their bilateral dialogue. Eventually, the Pakistani diplomat rewarded our persistence with an interview, but that was a rare moment of luck. Journalists trying to cover such awkward tête-à-têtes normally find themselves dealing with aggressive security guards, hostile officials, and official denials for their stories. In 2002, I was accosted by an irate posse of Indian officials in Kathmandu for reporting that a meeting had been planned between then Foreign Ministers Jaswant Singh and Sartaj Aziz, on the sidelines of the SAARC summit in progress. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had just exchanged an unexpected but frosty handshake with Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf who had walked up to him on stage and practically forced him into the gesture. The event came a month after the Parliament attack, and Indian and Pakistani troops had begun their massive build-up (Op Parakram) at the Line of Control. The officials who met me angrily denied our story and wanted us to retract it. Fortunately we were saved from the dire consequences they threatened us with, when an intrepid Nepali photographer released a photo of the two Foreign Ministers engaged in talks inside the conference hall and even exchanging what appeared to be handwritten notes. The truth is that such contacts are discovered or reported only a fraction of the time they occur: given security restrictions and shrinking access to official events, journalists have to be very lucky or well sourced to even know that these meetings are taking place. A few years ago, some of the most senior Indian and Pakistani journalists were at a conference in Bangkok, and had no idea that just a few hotels away, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and senior Indian officials were meeting with Pakistani NSA Nasir Janjua and their counterparts. At other times, the chase has been made impossible by logistics: at the SAARC summit in the Maldives, the organisers ensured total privacy by housing all official delegations on a completely different island from the journalists. No boats were made available for us to travel across. Travel restrictions that have followed the COVID-19 pandemic are making the situation more difficult, as reporters covering the recent back-channel contacts between India and Pakistan and India and the Taliban have found out, as despite various officials confirming the meetings, there are no eyewitness accounts of them. Perhaps the most legendary dodge by interlocutors came about 50 years ago, when U.S. presidential adviser Henry Kissinger went on his secret visit to Beijing to negotiate the opening of U.S.-China diplomatic relations. He went first to Islamabad, just so that he could shake all journalists off his trail, with help from the Pakistani government. During a dinner hosted by President Yahya Khan, Kissinger feigned an illness “due to the heat” and was “invited” to spend a few days in the hill station at Nathia Gali outside Islamabad. Once he was away from the prying eyes of the media, and even his own State Department officials, Kissinger was driven to the tarmac where a Pakistani plane was waiting to fly him to his secret meeting. Operation Marco Polo had just begun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tracking-down-meetings-behind-the-scenes/article35089140.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Nixon aide to visit India, Islamabad||Washington, July 1: President Nixon’s foreign policy advisor, Mr. Henry Kissinger, who will be visiting Delhi and Islamabad shortly, in the course of a much broader and separate assignment dealing with Vietnam, is understood to have undertaken this side-trip to gauge the reaction of the two countries to the stance the U.S. has taken on East Bengal so far. The visit was arranged on the U.S.’s initiative and sources here said that Mr. Kissinger rather than Secretary of State Rogers was chosen for the purpose because President Nixon wanted to give the mission a White House rather than a State Department stamp. Sources here cautioned against reading too much into Mr. Kissinger’s trip to India — they suggested that his mission was primarily connected with the Vietnam war and discussions in that regard in Saigon. The sources added that while in Delhi, Mr. Kissinger will in all probability try to cool the tempers there — tempers which have been frayed considerably by the continued supply of American war material to the Pakistan army. Mr. Kissinger would in this connection urge India to continue to follow a policy of “restraint”. In Islamabad, Mr. Kissinger, the sources said, would once again try to nudge Yahya Khan to move a “little more rapidly” towards a restoration of normalcy in East Bengal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/nixon-aide-to-visit-india-islamabad/article35089139.ece
02 July 2021||MUMBAI,||‘GNPA ratio may rise up to 11.2% in FY22’||The gross non-performing asset ratio (GNPA) of India’s scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) may climb by the end of the current fiscal year to as much as 11.2% under a severe stress scenario, from 7.48% in March 2021, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its Financial Stability Report on Thursday. “Macro stress tests indicate that the GNPA ratio of SCBs may increase... to 9.8% by March 2022 under the baseline scenario; and to 11.22% under a severe stress scenario, although SCBs have sufficient capital, both at the aggregate and individual level, even under stress,” the RBI said. “The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of SCBs increased to 16.03% and the provisioning coverage ratio stood at 68.86% in March 2021,” the central bank said. Going forward, as banks respond to credit demand in a recovering economy, “they will need to reinforce their capital and liquidity positions to fortify themselves against potential balance sheet stress,” it added. Sustained policy support, benign financial conditions and the gathering momentum of vaccinations were nurturing an uneven global recovery, the RBI noted. “Policy support has helped in shoring up financial positions of banks, containing non-performing loans and maintaining solvency and liquidity globally,” the central bank said. “On the domestic front, the ferocity of the second wave of COVID-19 has dented economic activity, but monetary, regulatory and fiscal policy measures have helped curtail the solvency risk of financial entities, stabilise markets, and maintain financial stability,” it added. Less-than-expected dent “The dent on balance sheets and performance of financial institutions in India has been much less than what was projected earlier, although a clearer picture will emerge as the effects of regulatory reliefs fully work their way through,” Governor Shaktikanta Das wrote in his foreword to the report. “Yet, capital and liquidity buffers are reasonably resilient to withstand future shocks, as the stress tests presented in this report demonstrate,” he added. Mr. Das observed that even as the recovery was underway, new risks had emerged including “the still nascent and mending state of the upturn, vulnerable as it is to shocks and future waves of the pandemic; international commodity prices and inflationary pressures; global spillovers amid high uncertainty; and rising incidence of data breaches and cyberattacks”. Sustained policy support and simultaneous increased fortification of capital and liquidity buffers by financial entities was therefore vital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gnpa-ratio-may-rise-up-to-112-in-fy22/article35089116.ece
02 July 2021||New Delhi,||Auto dispatches jump on easing curbs||Auto manufacturers registered a significant increase in vehicle dispatches to dealers in June, following the gradual easing of COVID-19 related restrictions, and helped by last year’s low base. Vehicle makers said they were seeing some early signs of positive consumer sentiment; however, issues such as the global semiconductor shortage and rising commodity prices continued to impact production. India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki posted domestic passenger vehicle (PV) wholesales of more than 1.24 lakh units in June compared with 51,274 units a year earlier. “Sales in Quarter 1 of both FY21 and FY22 have been far from normal owing to COVID-19 related lockdowns and disruptions and hence any comparison would not be very meaningful,” the company said. Rival Hyundai Motor India said domestic sales stood at 40,496 units (21, 320). Tata Motors’ reported domestic sales of 43,704 units (19,387). The company’s domestic commercial vehicle (CV) sales were 19,594 units and PVs clocked 24,110 units. Semiconductor shortage Mahindra and Mahindra too dispatched more than double the number of PVs in the domestic market at 16,913 units, while CV sales stood at 13,444 units (10,430). “With the opening up of the market in a phased manner, we are seeing a boost in demand in both urban and rural, and expect the upward trend to continue across all segments and markets,” said Veejay Nakra, CEO, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd. He added that M&M’s supply chain had stabilised except for the semiconductor issue, which continued to be a challenge. Hero MotoCorp delivered more than 4.38 lakh two-wheelers, in the domestic market (4.3 lakh). “The expected surge in personal mobility, forecast of a normal monsoon in several parts of the country and the improving rural sentiment are expected to lead to a swift revival in sales,” the company said in a statement. TVS Motor saw domestic two-wheeler wholesales exceed 1.45 lakh units in June. Ashok Leyland said it dispatched 5,851 CVs in the domestic market (2,132). “CV sales continue to face challenges due to slow economic recovery,” said Mitul Shah, head of research, Reliance Securities. “We expect sales volume for July ’21 would be much superior with healthy MoM and YoY improvement,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/auto-dispatches-jump-on-easing-curbs/article35089120.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Need to formalise ‘large underbelly’ of economy: FM||India needs to formalise ‘a large underbelly’ of businesses operating outside the system to widen the tax base and make its finances more resilient, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday. Stating that she was not concerned about India’s debt burden at this point, the Minister said a turnaround in the economy driven by public infrastructure investments will be able to bolster revenue collections. “In India, we have to be a lot smarter in the way in which (tax) evasion can be contained. Tax avoidance will also have to be carefully studied and action needs to be taken on that without obviously making it difficult for honest taxpayers,” she said, adding that technology would be a critical tool to plug loopholes as was being done under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. “There is still a large underbelly which is yet to be formalised into the mainstream of the economy. We have to get them on board and make compliance, tax assessments all easy, otherwise small businesses will never be encouraged to join the system,” she said in an interaction at the India Global Forum. She exuded confidence about completing the privatisation of Air India and BPCL this year, indicating that earlier attempts were marred by poor timing. Citing the eight consecutive months of GST collections of more than Rs. 1 lakh crore each, Ms. Sitharaman said she hoped it would be sustained as there was no national lockdown this year and economic activity was picking up pace. “Revenue generation will give us a bit more leeway... for taking up any challenge that arises,” she said, to a query about India’s preparedness for a possible third wave of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/need-to-formalise-large-underbelly-of-economy-fm/article35089118.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Govt. must act to relieve telecom stress’||Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal on Thursday said the telecom industry was under severe stress and added that the onus was on the government to ensure that at least three operators survived. Mr. Mittal’s remarks assume significance amid reports that cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, which posted a loss of about Rs. 7,000 crore in the March quarter, has sought a moratorium on the payment of its dues to the telecom department. “To say the telecom industry is in a bit of trouble is actually an understatement,” Mr. Mittal said. “It is in tremendous amount of stress. I hope the Government, the authorities and the telecom department, all focus on this issue and ensure India's digital dream remains intact through the provision of at least three operators.” Bharti Airtel would not hesitate to increase tariffs, provided it acted in concert with others, he signalled. “We have to be mindful of the market,” he stressed. Mr. Mittal was addressing reporters following the successful launch of another 36 satellites by OneWeb, which aims to deliver connectivity across the United Kingdom, Canada, Alaska, Northern Europe, Greenland, and the Arctic Region. Pointing out that Bharti Airtel had raised about $12 billion in the last 24 months, Mr. Mittal said the company was now on a firmer footing financially. “We are a very strong company, many times we are underestimated in our resolve. Yes, the company needed more funds given the market situation. And we were timely in approaching the market,” he added. “I won’t say we were ever worried about the company's future but yes health did suffer. These five, six years have been brutal, and the result of that is for all to see...10 operators have gone out of business, two merged together... gasping for breath right now.” “I think the government is aware, and in my assessment they would like to see a vibrant telecom sector,” Mr. Mittal said when asked about the steps the government needed to take to help the sector. “How they do it, what balm they apply to the sector, is best left to the government and the experts... I am very hopeful something should happen.” Pitching for higher tariffs, Mr. Mittal said, “How long can you keep on killing each other. The point is, when you have a return on capital, even by the best operator, at low single-digit and most of them are struggling... at least come back to old tariffs”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-must-act-to-relieve-telecom-stress/article35089122.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||PMI survey shows manufacturing shrank in June||India’s manufacturing output shrank in June with the survey-based IHS Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) sliding to 48.1, from 50.8 in May, marking the industry’s first contraction since July 2020. Companies were at their least optimistic for almost a year and jobs continued to be shed for the 15th month in a row, IHS Markit said in a statement. Buying levels fell at a pace that was among the fastest seen since PMI data collection started in March 2005, as weak demand and a reduction in production requirements led firms to restrict input purchases last month. COVID-19 restrictions also curtailed international demand for Indian goods, and new export orders decreased for the first time in 10 months, albeit modestly, the firm said. The strict containment measures to cope with the second wave of COVID-19 negatively impacted demand and led to renewed contractions in factory orders, production, exports and quantities of purchases. Capital goods worst hit “Companies became increasingly worried about when the pandemic will end, which resulted in downward revisions to output growth projections,” said Polyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. “As a result of subdued optimism, jobs were shed again in June. “Out of the three broad areas of the manufacturing sector monitored by the survey, capital goods was the worst-affected area in June. Output here declined at a steep rate due to a sharp fall in sales. The sector also saw the fastest contraction in buying levels,” she added. While pre-production as well as post-production inventories declined at manufacturing units, pre-production stocks contracted for the first time in 10 months. “Falling new orders, business closures and the COVID-19 crisis triggered a reduction in output among Indian manufacturers. The decline was moderate relative to those seen in the first half of 2020, but ended a ten-month sequence of growth,” IHS Markit said. “The intensification of the COVID-19 crisis... had a detrimental impact on the manufacturing economy. Growth of new orders, production, exports and input purchasing was interrupted in June as containment measures aimed at bringing the pandemic under control restrained demand. In all cases, however, rates of contraction were softer than during the first lockdown,” Ms. De Lima said. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said the June PMI, however, was at odds with available high frequency data including GST e-way bills and electricity demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pmi-survey-shows-manufacturing-shrank-in-june/article35089124.ece

Australia's Ken Rosewall was 40 when he made the third round at the All-England Club in 1975. After a tight first set, it was one-way traffic as Federer, 39, beat Gasquet for the 19th time in 21 meetings. “I'm happy with my performance,” Federer said. “A tough first set, I was happy with the second and I was better in the third.” The Centre Court crowd may have split loyalties when he next faces 25-year-old Cameron Norrie of Britain. “Cam is a good guy and is having a wonderful year. He has done well here but it's time for him to go out!”, Federer said with a laugh. Seventh seed Matteo Berrettini was equally impressive in his 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(4) victory over Botic Van de Zandschulp. The Italian, winner at Queen’s Club last month, fired 20 aces and advanced in two hours and 17 minutes to extend his record on grass to 7-0 this year. Russian second seed Daniil Medvedev reached the Wimbledon last 32 for the third time with a straight-sets win over Spanish wildcard Carlos Alcaraz. Medvedev, fresh from his first grass-court title in Mallorca last weekend, eased to a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 win over 18-year-old Alcaraz, the youngest player in the draw. Fourth seed Alexander Zverev hit 13 aces, lost only 12 points on his serve and advanced to the third round by beating Tennys Sandgren 7-5, 6-2, 6-3.

Eight of the top 11 WTA players are now out of the tournament due to defeat, withdrawal or injury. Barty avoided an exit by overcoming an uncharacteristically unreliable serve. She committed nine double-faults, including three in the first game, and was broken three times. But she also hit 33 winners to 12 for Blinkova. Svitolina lost to Magda Linette of Poland 6-3, 6-4, while Sorana Cirstea of Romania outlasted Azarenka 7-6(5), 3-6, 6-4. Linette, ranked 44th, had 28 winners to just eight for Svitolina, a semifinalist at Wimbledon two years ago.

02 July 2021||TOKYO,||Japan still unsure about spectators||Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is still uncertain whether fans can be allowed at the Tokyo Olympics because of growing concern about rising COVID-19 cases on Thursday, only three weeks before the Games. Cases here have been steadily on the rise, triggering fears the Games would accelerate the spread of the virus. Resurgence Experts warned that the highly contagious delta strain could trigger rapid resurgence of the infections that may require another state of emergency, even during the Games starting on July 23. “I have made it clear that having no spectators is a possibility,” Suga said as he noted Tokyo’s rising caseloads. “We will take steps as we prioritise safety and security of the people.” On Wednesday, the city confirmed 673 new cases, the 12th straight day of a week-on-week increase. Dr. Mitsuo Kaku, a medical advisor for the Tokyo metropolitan government, told a weekly meeting on Thursday that the city was turning into a “critical situation” as the upsurge was triggered by the delta variant. A two-month-long state of emergency here and other metro areas was downgraded by Suga on June 21. Decision next week He said he will decide what to do with the measures next week, a decision that will affect Games spectators. Organisers last week decided to allow up to 10,000 spectators or 50% of venue capacity if emergency measures are lifted before the Games. Following criticisms and concerns raised by experts and the public, government officials later said they were open to having no fans if the infections worsen. Experts said lifting the measures was unthinkable given the virus situation, and daily cases could exceed 1,000 before the Olympics and quickly multiply during the Games if measures were delayed. Options Natsuo Yamaguchi, head of Komeito, a smaller coalition partner of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, on Thursday called on the government “to consider a no-spectator option and promptly inform the public”.

02 July 2021||St. Petersburg,||Giant-killer Switzerland looks to spring a surprise on Spain||Switzerland will try to follow up its shock elimination of world champion France against Spain on Friday, after reaching the quarterfinals of a major tournament for the first time in 67 years. Vladimir Petkovic’s side recovered from two goals down to force extra time against much-fancied France and prevailed on penalties as 2018 World Cup hero Kylian Mbappe missed the decisive spot-kick. Now the Swiss hope to spring another surprise against a Spain team that has scored 10 times in two games after a slow start to the group stage. Alvaro Morata’s redemptive strike helped secure a 5-3 extra-time win over Croatia, but Spain will need to cut out the errors if it is to contend for a record fourth European Championship. History is on Spain’s side against Switzerland, having lost just once in 22 meetings, a 1-0 defeat in South Africa that sparked its run to the 2010 World Cup title. Spain captain Sergio Busquets is the lone survivor from that team, while the Barcelona midfielder and Jordi Alba are the only two players in the squad left from its Euro 2012 triumph. Switzerland celebrated what striker Haris Seferovic called “the most beautiful of nights” as it dumped out France to win its first European Championship knockout tie.The last time the Swiss reached a major quarterfinal it lost 7-5 to Austria as hosts of the 1954 World Cup. Belgium’s leading scorer at the European Championship is no stranger to Italy’s veteran defenders. They all play in Serie A. Romelu Lukaku will likely be the main attacking threat when Belgium takes on Italy in Munich in the other quarterfinal. The Inter Milan forward has scored three goals in his team’s four victories so far. And with Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard both doubtful for the game, Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini and teammate Leonardo Bonucci — both defenders at Juventus — will know just who to focus on. “It’s a quarterfinal. It will be decided on small details,” Belgium midfielder Youri Tielemans said. Belgium, which is trying to win its first major football tournament three years after a third-place finish at the World Cup, hasn’t lost in 13 games and is the top-ranked team in the world. The Italians haven’t been beaten in a national team record 31 matches, though they were taken to extra time by Austria in the round of 16. Belgium has only beaten Italy once before in a competitive game — in the 1972 Euro quarterfinals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/switzerland-looks-to-spring-a-surprise-on-spain/article35089411.ece
02 July 2021||Taunton,||England eases to five-wkt. win, seals series||England beat India by five wickets in the second women's One-Day International to take a 2-0 series-clinching lead here on Wednesday. Sophia Dunkley (73 not out) and Katherine Brunt (33 not out) shared 92 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket to chase down the target of 222 with 15 balls to spare. Opener Lauren Winfield-Hill (42) was the other notable contributor. For India, leg-spinner Poonam Yadav took two wickets for 63 runs while veteran Jhulan Goswami, Shikha Pandey and Sneh Rana got one wicket each. Poonam, who spoke at the post-match virtual press conference, said she had gained by working with Narendra Hirwani and India coach Ramesh Powar. “I learnt variations from Hirwani sir and field placements from Ramesh sir,” she said. Looking forward to the final ODI, to be played at Worcester on Saturday, she expressed confidence that the team would bounce back. “We batted and bowled better (in the second ODI),” she said. “We also fielded very well. We will win the third match.” England pacer Kate Cross, who finished with five for 34, was named player-of-the-match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-eases-to-a-five-wicket-win-seals-odi-series/article35089408.ece
02 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Mirza to ride Dajara 4 at Tokyo||Equestrian Fouaad Mirza has chosen Dajara 4 as his equine partner for the Tokyo Olympics. Mirza, sponsored by Embassy Group, had to choose either Dajara 4 or Seigneur Medicott. Difficult decision “It was a difficult decision to make as both horses are really good. However, at the Olympics, we have two rounds of show jumping after cross-country, which is Medicott’s weak link. That was the main reason why we chose Dajara,” Mirza said at a media interaction. The relationship between the rider and his horse forms a key part of the sport, with a bond developed over years of being together. “I saw and rode Dajara for the first time in 2019. I knew right away that she was a top horse. After a conversation with Jitu (Virwani, Chairman and Managing Director at Embassy Group) and Silva Storai (Embassy International Riding School Director), we were able to procure her,” Mirza said. A veterinary doctor, an equine physiotherapist and a groom will accompany Dajara to Tokyo. “We have seen him as a young lad in our riding stables. He’s been an extremely disciplined cadet, which makes me more convinced that an Olympic medal is right around the corner. “That will make the country proud and boost the sport overall,” Virwani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mirza-to-ride-dajara-4-at-tokyo/article35089473.ece
02 July 2021||Rio de Janeiro,||Neymar, Sanchez back for knockouts||Defending champion Brazil and Chile will have their star players back in action when they meet in the Copa America quarterfinals on Friday. Neymar will return for Brazil and Alexis Sanchez has recovered from a calf-muscle injury ahead of the encounter at the Nilton Santos Stadium here. The Selecao spared a group of regular starters in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador on Sunday, resting Neymar, defender Thiago Silva and striker Gabriel Jesus. Others, including Casemiro, entered as substitutes in that game. Brazil, with three wins in four matches, is the clear favourite to win. Chile lacks form Chile’s only win in the group stage was against Bolivia and it is lacking the kind of form that inspired its back-to-back championship wins in 2015 and ’16. Sanchez missed Chile’s group-stage matches and his absence affected the team’s production.  Coach Martín Lasarte will decide whether 32-year-old Sanchez will start against Brazil or come off the bench. “To play against the host is always difficult, but Brazil is also the team that is possibly in best shape,” Lasarte said. “We have to play our best match so far. That is always possible. We will try to annul their virtues and explore their flaws.” Also on Friday, 2019 runner-up Peru will take on Paraguay at the Olimpico Stadium in Goiania. The winner will face Brazil or Chile in the semifinals in Rio.

02 July 2021||LONDON,||Djokovic, Federer in Olympics list||Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, Switzerland’s Roger Federer, Japan’s Naomi Osaka and Australia’s Ashleigh Barty are on the entry lists for the Tokyo Olympics that were announced Thursday by the International Tennis Federation. As the ITF noted, though: “The entry lists are still subject to change.” Federer, for one, said last weekend he would wait until after Wimbledon ends on July 11 to decide whether he will head to Japan. Golden Slam beckons Djokovic has made clear he’d like to pursue a Golden Slam, something only Steffi Graf has done, in 1988: winning all the four Majors and an Olympic singles gold medal in the same year. Eligibility Eligibility is based on the rankings of June 14, the day after the French Open ended. Seven of the Top 10 players in both the WTA and ATP rankings currently are on Thursday’s lists. For the women, that’s No. 1 Barty, No. 2 Osaka, No. 4 Aryna Sabalenka (Belarus), No. 5 Elina Svitolina (Ukraine), No. 7 Bianca Andreescu (Canada), No. 9 Iga Swiatek (Poland) and No. 10 Petra Kvitova (Czech Republic). Stars who are missing are Romania’s Simona Halep and Americans Serena Williams and Sofia Kenin. For the men, apart from No. 1 Djokovic and No. 8 Federer, the others in the list are No. 2 Daniil Medvedev (Russia), No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas (Greece), No. 6 Alexander Zverev (Germany), No. 7 Andrey Rublev (Russia) and No. 9 Matteo Berrettini (Italy). Spain’s Rafael Nadal, Roberto Bautista Agut and Austria’s Dominic Thiem do not figure in the list. Two-time defending singles champion Andy Murray of Britain has been granted a special exemption because he has the most Olympic and Grand Slam titles of the players whose ranking is not good enough to earn direct entry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-federer-in-olympics-list/article35089416.ece
02 July 2021||Barcelona,||Barcelona’s finances holding up new Messi contract||Barcelona’s poor finances have become the stumbling block to getting Lionel Messi to sign another contract, according to club president Joan Laporta. Messi was officially no longer a Barcelona player on Thursday, following the expiry of his contract. That came 16 years after the forward signed his first profession contract with the club that he joined at age 13. Cautiously optimistic Laporta has continued to mark a cautiously optimistic tone when asked if he was close to convincing Messi to stay put. Laporta was club president when a teenage Messi had his breakout. He returned to run the club in March after winning an election with the promise he would use his good relationship with Messi to get him to stay. Late on Wednesday, Laporta told a popular sports talk radio show that the deal was being held up only because of the Spanish league’s strict financial fair play rules. “We want him to stay and Leo wants to stay, it is all going well,” Laporta told Onda Cero radio. “We still have to deal with the issue of financial fair play. We are in the process of finding the best solution for both parties.” Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer is in Brazil leading Argentina at the Copa America, far from the hubbub at Camp Nou. Huge blow Barcelona’s finances suffered a huge blow last season, when the questionable management by the prior club board was exacerbated by a drop in revenues provoked by the pandemic. When Laporta returned to power, he inherited a club saddled with debt of 1.2 billion euros (USD 1.4 billion) and massive contracts that former club president Josep Bartomeu gave players, including Messi. Messi’s previous contract, signed in 2017, earned him an eye-popping138 million euros (USD 164 million) per season. Laporta has said that Messi is willing to take a significant pay cut, but even so, the club is apparently struggling to make the numbers work. Laporta recently said Barcelona’s finances “were worse than I had imagined.” He said the payroll plus other payments tallied 650 million euros (USD 771 million). The Spanish league slashed the salary cap for Barcelona down from a league-high 671 million euros (USD 796 million) for the 2019-20 season to just 383 million euros (USD 454 million) for last campaign. A new salary cap is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, but with Barcelona’s finances still a mess it is expected to be much more generous. The salary cap is proportional to 70% of a club’s revenue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelonas-finances-holding-up-new-messi-contract/article35089645.ece
02 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Hakim recounts the 1960 Olympics||The Indian football team last participated in an Olympics in the 1960 edition in Rome. S.S. Hakim, son of coach Syed Rahim of Hyderabad, was a member of the squad which, however, failed to make it to the knockout phase. Missed chances For Hakim, now 81, it stands out as one of the memorable experiences though he insists it was a story of missed chances for the Indian team. “The team was led by the great P.K. (Banerjee) with my father as the coach. Tulsidas Balaram scored two goals — one each against Hungary and Peru. But unfortunately we lost both the matches,” Hakim told The Hindu . “We had the satisfaction of holding France with P.K. equalising in the 71st minute. But we failed to make the knock-out phase. “The atmosphere was unthinkable. Being just there and basking in the aura of an Olympics is something which every athlete dreams of. I was fortunate to be part of that squad,” said Hakim, who did not get a chance to figure in the starting line-up of the star-studded team. Golden era “The fact that India failed to make it to the Olympics after the Rome Games can also put in perspective the quality of that team. That was the golden era of Indian football and Hyderabad produced 15 Olympians. “The bench strength was so good that a stand-by XI was always waiting to grab the chance. Yet, Rahim Saab had an unfulfilled dream of India winning an Olympic medal,” Hakim added. “Top football officials from the United Kingdom were so impressed with Rahim Saab’s coaching that they invited him to be a visiting lecturer to enlighten them about the art of scoring. Unfortunately, I couldn’t make the trip because of foreign exchange issues. “I am not sure whether I will be able to see an Indian team in the Olympics in the near future. I may be wrong, but I find fault with the fancy for these foreign coaches, forgetting the artistry and natural skills which the Indians possessed for decades now,” Hakim concluded.  I am not sure whether I will be able to see an Indian team in the Olympics in the near future||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/veteran-footballer-hakim-recounts-rome-olympics/article35089640.ece
02 July 2021||London,||Stunning start for Sania & Mattek-Sands||Sania Mirza and her American partner Bethanie Mattek-Sands knocked out sixth seeds Desirae Krawczyk and Alexa Guarachi to move into the second round on Thursday. Sania and Mattek-Sands were a bit rusty at the start but once they got their rhythm, they dominated the match and won 7-5, 6-3 against the American-Chilean combination in one hour and 27 minutes. The third game had seven deuce points before Mattek-Sands held serve. Sania and Mattek-Sands too had two opportunities to break their rivals, but the American fluffed a volley before Desirae produced a good serve. Guarachi hit a forehand wide at 15-30 to hand two set points in the 12th game. The Indo-American combination did not squander it this time, Sania sealing the set with an overhead smash. In the second, Sania and Mattek-Sands opened up a 3-1 lead and went on to win 6-3. However, Ankita Raina and Lauren Davis of USA crashed out in the opening round, losing 3-6, 2-6 to 14th seeds Asia Muhammad and Jessica Pegula in a one hour 10 minute contest.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Gained from working with Hirwani, Powar’||India may have lost the second ODI to England at Taunton by five wickets on Wednesday, but the Women in Blue put up a much better fight than they did in the first game of the series. Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav was one of the reasons for that. England captain Heather Knight’s wicket was Poonam’s first in ODIs since November 6, 2019. She had gone wicket-less in her four previous matches, all against South Africa at Lucknow in March. “To take wickets and to contribute to the team’s cause matter a lot to a bowler, so it felt nice when I got wickets after a long time,” Poonam said at a virtual press conference. “I hope to carry this form forward, but will try to concede fewer runs.” She said she had gained by working with Narendra Hirwani and India coach Ramesh Powar. “I learnt variations from Hirwani sir and field placements from Ramesh sir,” she said.  “We batted and bowled better (in the second ODI),” she said. “We also fielded very well.

02 July 2021||New Delhi,||ICC to award same points for each WTC match won||The International Cricket Council (ICC) will award standardised 12 points for every match won during the second World Test Championships cycle which kicks off with the five-match series between India and England in August. Teams will get six points in case of a tie and four points if the match ends in a draw. That there would be changes to the points system was first declared by ICC interim CEO Geoff Allardice during a media interaction earlier this month. “Instead of each series being worth the same number of points, 120, irrespective of whether the series is played over two Tests or five Tests, the next cycle will see each match being worth the same number of points — a maximum of 12 per match,” an ICC board member said. “Teams will be ranked on the percentage of available points they won from the matches they have played.” The changes in the points system will have to be ratified by the ICC chief executives committee in the coming weeks. “The aim was to try and simplify the points system and to allow teams to be meaningfully compared on the table at any point, though they may have played differing numbers of matches and series,” the Board member added. Apart from the India-England series, the Ashes later this year will be the only other five-match affair in the second cycle which will end in June 2023. Australia’s tour of India next year is the only four-Test series.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/icc-to-award-same-points-for-each-match-won/article35089421.ece

The Suns — who squandered the opportunity to wrap up the Western Conference Finals at home on Monday — rebounded with an emphatic away win, taking the best-of-seven series 4-2. It is only the third NBA Finals appearance for the Suns, and the first since 1993. The Suns failed to even reach the playoffs for 10 consecutive seasons before the 2020-2021 campaign. Paul, the 36-year-old, 11-time NBA All-Star, drew on all his experience to get the Suns over the line. Wednesday’s win finally gives Paul the chance to shed his tag as one of the greatest players in NBA history to never win a championship. Paul’s 41-point effort was backed by double-digit contributions from Devin Booker (22), Jae Crowder (19) and Deandre Ayton (16). Marcus Morris Sr. led the Clippers with 26 points while Paul George added 21.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A voice of hope||It is difficult to picture a glum KS Chithra. She is always smiling, whether she is chatting with friends or watching a film. She smiles even when she is singing. In her earlier days in the music industry, a popular joke went: “You cannot get Narasimha Rao to smile, and you cannot get Chitra to stop smiling.” Mention this to her, and she breaks into peals of laughter, pronounced even via a patchy telephone call. “I have always been like this. When I was a child, my mother used to admonish me, saying, ‘Girl children should not always go around smiling and giggling.’ My smile has always been a part of my nature,” she says. Chithra has also been spreading smiles through her illustrious musical career — one that includes 25,000-plus songs in various languages. But now, with her latest track ‘Meri Pukar Suno’, she endeavours to spread hope. Composed by AR Rahman and written by Gulzar, this anthem, put together by Sony Music India, also features eminent vocalists like Alka Yagnik, Shreya Ghoshal, Sadhana Sargam, Shashaa Tirupati and Armaan Malik. “I hope it is a balm. It was an exciting and new experience to see myself as part of a team of other established singers,” says the singer. Part of the experience was recording at her home studio. “I am used to going to recording studios, but this was a different experience, especially because I not a tech-savvy person. Thankfully, I had help from my managers, Vinu and Antony, to record my portions. Anytime I work for an AR Rahman track, I ensure that I give him a few options with improvisations so that he can pick and choose which he likes.” A learning experience While singers from across the country look up to Chitra for her dedication and voice texture, she says she is learning from the younger generation. “Every singer has his/her own identity and way of expression. The voice of singers from the younger generation, having been exposed to Western music, is totally different from mine and I learn a lot from them. There are no seniors and juniors when it comes to music.” ‘Meri Pukar Suno’ marks her return to Hindi films after a break. A household name in the southern states, she is also well-established in the North. Starting from SP Venkatesh’s Khushi Aur Khushi in the ‘80s, she also sang for Rangeela , Bombay and Guru . “Growing up in Kerala, Hindi was a compulsory subject. I am comfortable writing and reading it, but I didn’t have enough opportunities to converse with people in the language. I ensured that whenever I recorded for a Hindi song, I wrote the lyric in Hindi; I feel that way, the pronunciation will be perfect. I take extra care when difficult-sounding words like ‘khushboo’ and ‘shraddha’  are used.” Tackling grief Though Chithra’s life has largely been about music and creating happy memories, she is still coming to terms with her daughter Nandana’s demise; she drowned in a swimming pool in Dubai. A decade later, Chithra says “the wounds are still there”. “Whenever I think of the incident, I can feel something churning in my stomach.” She adds, “I cannot forget it but I do not want to keep thinking of it and get into a state of depression. After that incident, I plunged myself into work and music to overcome it. A few mothers who underwent something similar called me asking suggestions to manage the situation. I didn’t have many suggestions, except to say that concentrating on work will help heal a little.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-voice-of-hope/article35089920.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The search for comedy||The tiger never roars in Sherni . It doesn’t need to, and neither does the protagonist, forest officer Vidya Vincent, played by Vidya Balan. In the world visualised by director Amit Masurkar, built upon Aastha Tiku’s writing and research, the quality of quiet fortitude is to be respected, in animal and (wo)man. This is not because of the director’s dislike towards histrionics, but merely a result of observation of real life people on whom he based his characters, explains Amit, over a call from Mumbai. “For Sherni , we wanted an authentic jungle story,” says Amit.  Sherni, streaming on Amazon Prime, is populated by actors cast from the villages where they shot, near Gondia forest in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, and volunteering forest guards, who were all given acting workshops before being cast. When the world is realistically set thus, it organically makes space for humour. This has been consistent in Amit’s limited but standout oeuvre: from Suleimani Keeda (2013) that poked fun at fledgling screenwriters, to more serious dramas like Newton (2017) and Sherni . Introducing humour effectively into taut suspenseful storylines is not something that can be forced — “whatever humour comes in, is a result of the characters being in the situations they are in,” says Amit, who in the start of his career wrote sketches for The Great Indian Comedy Show . He points to Brijendra Kala’s chase sequence (a bureaucratic hunt within the larger jungle hunt): “He’s running around, gasping for breath while there are men assaulting him. It wouldn’t normally have been funny, but the way he played it is what made it so.” So, is it a conscious choice to cast actors who have a knack for comedy? We see this in Newton too, whether it is Pankaj Tripathi and his straight-faced snark, or Rajkummar Rao, who gave his character a distractingly insistent way of blinking and shoulder scratching. “I firmly believe that actors who can do good comedy, can do anything. An actor who has a natural sense of humour and comic timing can play any part. Vijay Raaz (known for his comedic talent) is not doing anything funny in Sherni ; it’s a serious character, but you can feel for the character of Noorani,” says Amit. His next, an OTT series, is once again with Aastha. “It’s going to be set in the city of Mumbai,” is all he is willing to reveal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-search-for-comedy/article35089921.ece

The 2014 coming-of-age Malayalam rom-com has acquired cult status with youngsters, akin to Premam . So when Jude Anthany Joseph, director of OSO , approached her with his new film Sara’s , she was “very excited”. This film is slated for release on Amazon Prime Video on July 5. She is glad that she got to do the entertainer, different from her three earlier films. Unlike her characters in films such as Kumbalangi Nights , Helen and Kappela , Sara’s is different in tone. Anna says, “It is an entertainer with drama, music and humour.” Becoming Sara was not difficult for her; Jude gave her complete freedom to portray the character. A bonus was that it was relatable. “For instance, for Kappela, I went to the location a few days in advance to prepare. Plus, there was the director’s input. My character, Sara, works in the film industry and that background was relatable to me.”  Sara’s is about a young woman’s freedom of choice — whether or not she wants to have a child. “I found the subject interesting. Stories told from differing perspectives make me curious. This is a family-oriented film, but it is thought-provoking as well. The response to a girl’s freedom of choice is mixed. It is not always seen positively, even today. This topic is addressed in a lighter, entertaining manner.” Since her debut in 2019, with Kumbalangi Nights , Anna’s films/roles have been author-backed, female-oriented. However, she denies it is a conscious decision. “It has to be a project that excites me. I am willing to work hard and I am not fussy about being the lead. If we were to speak about Helen or Kappela … the stories were powerful. It did not matter who the female or male lead was. In its entirety, the films would have clicked. I look at a project as a whole when I consider it.”  Sara’s is special for another reason; she acts with her father Benny P Nayarambalam. This would be the veteran scenarist’s first substantial role in a film. “I never imagined I would act with Pappa in a film. Although he has always wanted to act, he put it off for writing. Jude pushed him to act. Earlier this year, he appeared in Aashiq Abu’s segment in the anthology film Aanum Pennum . But Sara’s will be the first time his character appears for a considerable time duration.”  Sara’s has been made for an OTT release; it is Anna’s first such project. “One of the very few positive things to come out during the pandemic is the growth of OTT platforms. As an artiste, this is a great opportunity to connect with audiences. We are all watching more regional content.”  The growth of OTT platforms has been one of the few positive things to come out during the pandemic.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||What doesn’t kill you...||When Kabir Bedi sat down to pen his memoir, Stories I Must Tell , which was launched in April by actor Priyanka Chopra, he offhandedly pasted a sticker onto his computer that read: “Be vulnerable.” It resulted in reliving a quagmire of emotions and a deeply contemplative book beyond the regular glitz and glam of filmdom. It is a story of love and loss, but also milestones and mistakes — Bedi’s words, not mine. “It is a story of what it takes to be a human; to go through the rollercoaster of emotion I went through and the lessons that emerged. I wrote the book to inspire people and at the same time, caution them about the joys and dangers of success,” says Kabir Bedi, who recently gave a talk as part of FICCI FLO Chennai’s chapter titled Stories We Must Hear. Edited excerpts: When you started writing this book, what were the images that came to you? I thought I had a hell of a story to tell. But when I sat down to write, I began to think: ‘how am I going to tell this story?’ Because, if I start from the beginning, it is boring and if I start from the middle, the flashback seemed distracting. I decided to tell mine as a human story, starting from college days at St Stephen’s and the interview I did with The Beatles, which changed my life forever. You started out in the ‘70s and became a bona fide star in Europe. You have worked with some of the biggest names in Indian and European cinema...were you at all worried about being self-indulgent? I was determined not to be self-indulgent. I haven’t shied away from stating the wrongs and I haven’t spared myself either. I have been equally brutal in the mistakes I made or should have done differently. It was also the story of the depths in which I fell into and how I rose from it. I was relooking at my younger self more compassionately in the most interesting way possible. In that sense, it was cathartic. How would you describe the writing process, was it therapeutic or did it make you go further down the rabbit hole, like the chapter about your son? You have to dive in. There is no other way than to relive in its complete complexity, in its beauty and tragedy. Whatever resistances I had about my life came before the book. Is your book a heartfelt apology or a stubborn justification? None of those. It is to give people a vicarious sense of what it is like to be a man who has been out of many relationships. To understand the idealistic era of the freedom struggle where my parents came from, and what it took them from being revolutionaries to becoming religious figures.  To understand what it takes to be in Hollywood where they aren’t writing roles for you; what it takes to be noticed by James Bond fans around the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/what-doesnt-kill-you/article35089918.ece

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Our very own magic||My younger sister is Rina. Her classmate, Bhavi, was gifted a shiny gold pencil by her aunt, who lives in Dubai. Bhavi told her class that it was a magic pencil and whoever wrote the English dictation test — held every Monday — with it would get full marks. Bhavi’s friend Prisha wanted to write the test with the magic pencil. “Give me your pink eraser and I will lend you my magic pencil,” said Bhavi. Prisha agreed. Later that day, Prisha was the only student to have scored full marks in the test. Now, everyone started to believe in the magic pencil! “ Akka , Prisha who usually gets low marks in the dictation test, got full marks because of the magic pencil,” Rina told me that evening after school. “Bhavi is lending the pencil to Charu in exchange for her strawberry-shaped sharpener.” “Prisha must have prepared well for the test. Don’t believe in this magic pencil!” I told Rina. Next week, during the break, Rina came running into my class. “ Akka , Charu got full marks in the test because of the magic pencil! Please give me your orange glitter pen. I will exchange it for the magic pencil. I can use it for the test next week,” said Rina. I refused. Bhavi had promised to lend her magic pencil to Meena for the following week’s dictation test, in exchange for a guitar-shaped eraser. Time for the test That Monday, as Rina and I got down from the school van, Bhavi came up to us and told Rina, “Meena is on leave today. So, you can write the test with my magic pencil today. But you have to give me the orange glitter pen.” “No, she doesn’twant your magic pencil!” I said sternly. Bhavi glared at me and walked away. During the break, I went to Rina’s classroom to check on the test results. “ Akka, I got 18 out of 20!” said Rina excitedly. “Bhavi lent her magic pencil to Divya who gave her a butterfly sticker. But, before the test, Alisha ma’am ordered Bhavi to write the test with her magic pencil. Bhavi got the lowest score of 9 out of 20. The entire class was shocked.” Rina continued without a pause: “Alisha ma’am told us not to believe in magic but to rely on our hard work and preparation instead. Today, Amara scored full marks. She told ma’am that she usually studied for the test only on Sunday evening. But this time, she began preparing from Friday evening itself.” I also learnt that Alisha ma’am had reprimanded Bhavi and asked her to return the stationery she had got from her gullible classmates. “I wonder who told Alisha ma’am about the magic pencil,” Rina wondered. I couldn’t hold back my smile. “ Akka ! I knew it was you!” laughed Rina.   “Akka , Charu got full marks in the test because of the magic pencil!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/our-very-own-magic/article35090160.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The crafty crane||In a forest was a pond filled with fish. One day, a crane flew in and sat by the side of the pond, watching the fish swim around. When the fish saw him, they asked, “What are you thinking about?” The crane said, “Of you…” The fish were surprised. “Why?” “See how the water in your pond has dried up. Soon you will have nothing to eat and it is very hot too. What you will do?” The fish cried out, “Oh yes, it is a great source of worry to us.” “I know a fine, large pond with water where lotuses bloom in plenty. I can take you and put you in that pond.” The fish were amazed. Never in all their lives had a crane thought so kindly about them. Trustingly, they agreed to be moved. Every time the crane returned, he regaled the others with the glories of the new pond. One by one, the crane carried away all the fish, until there was only a crab left. A cunning crane and a crafty crab The crane said, “Hi Crab! Would you too like to go to the other pond?” The crab had been watching the crane but had never trusted him. “Oh yes,” said the crafty crab. “I would like to go too, but how will you carry me there?” “In my beak, of course,” said the crane. “You will drop me halfway through,” said the crab. The crane tried his best to convince the crab but to no avail. Finally, the crab said, “I’ll tell you what, we crabs have a tight grip. I will hang on to your neck till we reach the pond.” The crane, so full of his success with the fish, never thought twice about the suggestion. The crab caught hold of the crane’s neck and they were off. The crane flew over a large pond, filled with lotuses, and veered towards a Varana tree. “Crane, the pond lies that way,” said the crab. “Oh! Does it?” sneered the crane. “You think I am your slave to carry you around? Look at the foot of the Varana tree. Can you see the fish bones? I have eaten all those foolish fish. Now I will eat you!” The crab laughed and said, “I am not like the foolish, trusting fish. I will not let you eat me. Instead, I will destroy you. I will cut off your head with these pincers.” And he caught the crane’s neck in a vice-like grip. With tears in his eyes, the crane gasped, “Please, please let me live! I never intended to eat you.” “In that case go to the pond and put me down there.” The crane turned around and placed the crab in the mud at the edge of the pond. But, the crab cut through the crane’s neck and walked into the water.  “I know a fine, large pond with water where lotuses bloom in plenty. I can take you and put you in that pond.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-crafty-crane/article35090170.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Rings of goodness||A compact snack or a meal by itself. This is the Fitra, a sourdough bread from the island of Malta, which made it to the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, last year. Fitra is a ring-shaped bread with a hole in the middle, usually eaten along with a variety of fillings (carrot, lettuce, mint, basil, beans, sardines, tuna among others). The Maltese word for bread is hobz, which is drawn from Arabic. The making of hobz may have also been influenced by the Romans who brought their own baking techniques and technologies to Malta. The name fitra is derived from the Arabic word fattar (which means to flatten). In Damma , a 1776 dictionary on preparations at the bakery of the Order of St. John’s, linguist Giovanni Francesco Agius de Soldanis describes and records the long process of making the fitra. How it was made First, bread-makers would mix the sourdough starter (a bit of dough from an earlier batch) with the flour to give the bread a tangy flavour. The flour would then be kneaded by hand till the dough reached the right texture and consistency. Then it had to be ‘rested’; this was called proofing and was to allow it to ferment. A little flour would be scattered on top of the dough, which would then be covered with a cloth and put in a warm place. Sometimes, the baker would turn it over once or twice during the proofing. This process took hours and allowed the dough to double in size. Once the dough was ready, it would be portioned and shaped. The fitra was flat and round with a hole in the middle; the hobz was full round with a dark crusty exterior and a soft centre. These were baked in community ovens, which were heated to a temperature of 450-500°F. While the hobz took over an hour in the oven, the fitra was done in around 30 minutes because the making of the dough ensured that all the gases had been released. This process is being followed even today, though bakers have shifted to modern ovens. In fact, bread is such an integral part of Maltese life that the people have many idioms that relate to bread as the basis of life.  Fun Facts  Bakers would make a mark on the side or top of the loaf for identification, since the baking was done in community ovens.  Since the ovens needed fuel, people would give bakers bundles of thistle or wood as payment for the bread. Once on the table, the bread is marked with the cross as a gesture of thanksgiving. This is still done.  The name fitra is derived from the word fattar (which means to flatten).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/rings-of-goodness/article35090207.ece

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The Castle in the House Siblings together||The story so far: Shalu wishes that Samit help her build her castle. And miraculously, her wish comes true!   I had asked for good temper for Samit, thought Shalu. The thought made her giggle. “What is it?” Samit snarled. “Nothing,” Shalu said, straightening her face. Samit had been in a bad mood since he came home from school to find that Amma had hidden his phone. “Two hours!” he exploded. “What will I do without my phone?” “Work on the castle,” Shalu suggested. “I guess, since there’s nothing else to do,” he replied after some time. Shalu simply stared, wondering if he was serious. “What? I thought you were dying to work on your castle,” Samit asked. That brought Shalu to her feet. “Yes, it is in the playroom.” “Playroom? It’s only a tiny cupboard,” Samit snorted. “What a mess!” he said, looking around.  Getting down to work Shalu looked gloomily at the jumble of things on the floor. Last night, she had emptied all the boxes in the carton and now the blocks of different sizes were hopelessly mixed up. “First, let’s sort these,” he said. Shalu began to put the blocks away, chattering happily. Samit, busy reading the instruction booklet, responded with grunts. But when she said, “I hope Nitin doesn’t see this!”, he looked at her in horror. Nitin was their six-year-old neighbour whose one ambition was to join them in whatever they were doing. “Remember, how he ‘helped’ when we were making our cardboard castle?” Shalu giggled. Nitin had been fascinated by everything: the boxes littered around the room, the pot of home-made glue, but mostly the paint. “Let me help,” he was always begging. He had sneaked in once when they were out and painted the castle in a glorious mix of his favourite colours. “Remember how he wanted to fill the moat with water?” Samit laughed. “And how he wanted to feed the soldiers?” Shalu asked. There were plenty of Nitin stories to remember and laugh over. “Wonderful!” Amma said, when she came home. Samit looked proudly at the grey walls of the castle, already quite tall, and said, “It’ll be done in a few days!” “Here,” Amma said, pushing something at Samit. Shalu felt her heart sink when she saw that it was his phone. His face lit up and he went running up the stairs. “Samit,” Shalu called, “there’s so much to do!” There was no reply, only a slam. Shalu knew what that noise was. It was the noise of her being shut out of her brother’s life. To be continued  “Two hours!” he exploded. “What will I do without my phone?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-castle-in-the-house-siblings-together/article35090174.ece

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The dancer frozen in bronze||Leg upraised as he performs the cosmic dance, damaru in one hand and fire in the other, the demon of ignorance lying crushed under his foot… the image of Nataraja fascinates everyone who sees the perfectly balanced and proportioned form. In the magical hands of the craftsmen of the Pallava and Chola eras, bronze took the form of poetry, asmolten metal was frozen to capture beauty and grace in motion. This image has attracted scholars, writers and artists from across the world. “Leonardo [da Vinci] in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance drew together art and science in the two-dimensional Vitruvian Man within a circle. In a preceding era, the casters of the Nataraja bronze had drawn together art, science and dance in an even more daring, dynamic, three-dimensional vision,” says Sharada Srinivasan, archaeologist and archaeometallurgist, who is a professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru. For her work of over three decades, Sharada was recently elected International Honorary Member to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, whose past members have included greats like Albert Einstein and T.S. Eliot. She has made valuable contributions to the study of archaeology and history of art by exploring engineering applications in these disciplines. She has also traced the history of metallurgy in India from prehistoric to modern times, including present-day craft practices. Archaeometallurgy — the study of metallic artefacts, ancient mining and metal extraction — is a sub-discipline of the archaeological sciences. As a B.Tech student of Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, Sharada looked out for kindred spirits who combined scientific and artistic pursuits, such as Nobel Laureate C.V. Raman. “I became interested in spectrochemical analysis for characterising art objects. The archaeometallurgy and art historical study of South Indian and Chola bronzes seemed an ideal research topic for me,” she says. “This was undertaken through a British Chevening Ph.D Scholarship at the Institute of Archaeology, London. To me, the ethno-metallurgical studies of remote foundries were the most fulfilling — to experience first-hand the skill, immersion and resilience of crafts communities.” As a Bharatanatyam dancer, the South Indian Nataraja bronzes have always been of great interest to Sharada. Her research in the area has led to exciting discoveries, she says. “So, while the dancer in me appreciated the metaphorical five elements of Siva’s dance, as a scientist I was intrigued by the prospect that the metallurgical analysis of the elemental composition of the Nataraja and South Indian bronzes might reveal insights into the history of technology, and related art historical trajectories. For representative South Indian bronzes of the early historic, Pallava, Chola, late Chola and Vijayanagara periods, I tried to identify characteristic metallurgical profiles — of both elemental composition and lead isotope ratios — which could then be used as additional criteria to distinguish between them in chronology and style”. Sharada’s work draws on a plethora of sources including literature, iconography, and Saivite hymns. “In two examples of bronzes that I technically identified as Pallava (800 CE) — one from the British Museum, and the other, the Kuniyur Nataraja in the Government Museum, Chennai — the mudras of the drum held slanted are strikingly similar. Neither has the flying matted locks found in the later 10th century Chola bronzes, such as the Nataraja stone and bronze images in the Aduthurai temple built by Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Taken together with seventh century CE devotional poetry such as that of Appar, who sang of the Kuttan or dancer with the raised golden foot, this suggests that the Nataraja bronzes were already prevalent under the Pallavas.” As an archaeometallurgist, Sharada embarked on an arduous journey that took her on a study of not only South Indian bronzes made by the ancient lost-wax process, practised even today by artisans in the temple town of Swamimalai in Tamil Nadu’s Thanjavur district, but also the Aranmula metal mirrors of Kerala and the bronze temple bells of Nachiyarkoil. Another in-depth study was on the manufacture of wootz steel, which the country was renowned for. “I have studied wafer-thin, high-tin bronze vessels (heat treated copper-tin alloys of 23% tin), from the South Indian Iron Age and megalithic sites of the Nilgiris, Adichanallur and Kodumanal, which rank amongst the most finely forged in the world. And I have identified similar rare continuing practices amongst the Kammalar of Palakkad in Kerala,” she says. Archaeometallurgy is also useful in the detection of metal idols and artefacts spirited away from India. “South Indian metal icons are rarely inscribed, particularly Hindu images as compared to Jaina and Buddhist images, and so there are problems in dating and making stylistic attributions,” she points out. “This is complicated by similar artistic conventions being followed over centuries and into the present day at icon-making centres such as Swamimalai. We have the example of the smuggled Sripuranthan Nataraja, which was artificially patinated to change the look before it was sold to the Australian National Gallery and has now been restituted. Hence, having a database of the metallurgical profile and intrinsic fingerprints, such as lead isotope ratio data, can be useful for forensic purposes to tell apart antiques from recent examples.” Sharada is currently working with the Tamil Nadu State Archaeology Department to look at finds from recent excavations to better establish the early trajectory of copper and ferrous metallurgy. She had earlier made some preliminary identification of ferrous crucible processes from Kodumanal, a megalithic site dating to 300 BCE, which testifies to the country’s millennia-old legacy in the field.  The author is a Chennai-based   writer and critic.    I was intrigued by the prospect that the metallurgical analysis of the Nataraja and South Indian bronzes might reveal insights into the history of technology, says Sharada||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-dancer-frozen-in-bronze/article35089370.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||That sweet, haunting voice||It was 1952, and a music director in his early 30s was making his debut in Hindi films. He had been fairly successful in Bengali cinema, both as a singer and composer, but Bombay’s industry promised new opportunities. It was the historical drama Anand Math , and newcomer Hemant Kumar chose ‘Vande Mataram’, a song everyone was familiar with. Sung in separate versions by Lata Mangeshkar and Hemant Kumar, though the film had other well-known songs by Geeta Roy (later Dutt), the success of ‘Vande Mataram’ made filmmakers look at Hemant Kumar in a different light. The legendary musician’s 101st birth anniversary was celebrated on June 16. His career, and the enormous role he played, can be broadly divided into four segments — Bengali music, Hindi music composing, Hindi playback singing, and singing in other languages. For Indian audiences at large, his role as a Hindi film singer has probably been the most admired, with Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle naming him among their favourite male voices. Born Hemanta Mukhopadhyay in Benaras, his family later moved to Kolkata. He was deeply involved in music as a teenager, and cut his first non-film disc in 1937, making his Bengali film debut in Nimai Sanyas in 1941. Though he recorded for the 1944 Hindi film Irada , which had music by Pandit Amarnath, he eventually began focusing on Rabindra Sangeet, becoming one of the most respected exponents of the genre. When director Hemen Gupta asked him to compose music for Anand Math , Hemant Kumar decided to shift to Mumbai. Despite the composing break, he soon became known as a playback singer, singing ‘Yeh raat yeh chandni phir kahan’ for S.D. Burman in the 1952 film Jaal . The following year, his voice was noticed in the Patita song ‘Yaad kiya dil ne,’ composed by Shankar-Jaikishen. He made a mark singing ‘Jaag dard-e-ishq jaag’ and ‘Zindagi pyar ki do char ghadi’ for C. Ramchandra in Anarkali . Though Lata Mangeshkar had some iconic songs in the film, Hemant Kumar’s voice attracted attention for its unique texture. A distinct depth According to connoisseurs, that texture had its advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, it had a distinct depth, and sounded unlike anybody else’s voice. But some music directors felt it did not match every actor. They opted for Mohammed Rafi and later Kishore Kumar for different kinds of songs, and Talat Mahmood or Mukesh for the sad ones. S.D. Burman was the one music director who had tremendous faith in Hemant Kumar’s singing skills and, interestingly, some of their best songs were picturised on Dev Anand. These included ‘Teri duniya mein jeene se’ and ‘Chup hai dharti’ from House No 44 , ‘Hai apna dil toh awara’ from Solva Saal, and ‘Na tum hamein jaano’ from Baat Ek Raat Ki . One of Hemant Kumar’s most iconic songs with S.D. Burman featured Guru Dutt. Interestingly, while Rafi sang the other songs for Pyaasa , ‘Jaane woh kaise log the jinke’ was rendered by Hemant Kumar. This was despite the fact that director Guru Dutt wanted Rafi to sing it. And although the filmmaker was not convinced, he had to bow to his music director. The Hemant Kumar playback catalogue was filled with other gems. He had ‘Nain so nain’ for Vasant Desai in Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje . For Roshan, he sang ‘Chupa lo dil mein’ in Mamta, and for Kalyanji-Anandji, he had ‘Neend na mujhko aaye’ in Post Box 999 and ‘Tumhe yaad hoga’ in Satta Bazaar . Naturally, some of his best songs were from films he composed for. The two best known examples were his productions, Bees Saal Baad and Kohra . The former had ‘Beqarar karke’ and ‘Zara nazron se’, sung by him, and the Lata classic ‘Kahin deep jale kahin dil’, whereas Kohra had ‘Yeh nayan dare dare’ in his voice and Lata’s ‘Jhoom jhoom dhalti raat’. As a music director, his early successes after Anand Math included Shart , which had the song ‘Na yeh chand hoga’, Jagriti , with ‘Aao bachchon’ and Nagin , which had the super-hit ‘been’ song ‘Man dole mera tan dole’. His other successes as a music director included Sahib Bibi Aur Gulam (which had Geeta Dutt’s ‘Na jao saiyyan’ and Asha Bhosle’s ‘Bhanwara bada nadaan’) and Khamoshi (best known for his ‘Tum pukar lo’ and Kishore Kumar’s ‘Woh shaam kuchh ajeeb thi’). Hemant Kumar’s Hindi film career slowed down in the 70s, but he reamined a huge name in Rabindra Sangeet, also composing for Bengali films. He sang in other languages too, with the 1969 Marathi duet with Lata, ‘Mi dolkar daryacha raja’, composed by Hridaynath Mangeshkar, becoming a big hit. His voice still stirs fans whether they listen to the Bengali song ‘Dagor dagor chokhe’ or ‘Ya dil ki suno’. When Hemant Kumar died aged 69 in Kolkata, he left behind a rich legacy and irreplaceable voice. The writer is a Mumbai-based music journalist.  S.D.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A different approach||The vocal recital by Anahita and Apoorva, featured as part of Baithak, a series of online musical evenings organised by HCL Concerts, turned out to be special because it had just one percussion accompaniment — kanjira — by Shree Sundarkumar. The sisters began their concert with the ‘Nera nammithi’ varnam. The Kanada Ata tala varnam was surprisngly followed by a short tani avartanam in Adi talam by Shree Sundarkumar. Anahita and Apoorva rendered the kritis in perfect unison and with clear diction. They sang Tyagaraja’s ‘Teliyaleru Rama’ in Dhenuka, a rather sombre composition where the saint-poet laments about people’s indifference to the ‘bhakti margamulu’ (devotional path). The slow and serene tempo suited the mood of the kriti. ‘Nenarunchi nanu’ in Malavi (Tyagaraja) followed at a brisk pace. Anahita’s Purvikalyani alapana had ample bhava and piety. The choice here was the peerless ‘Meenakshi memudam’ of Muthuswami Dikshitar, which moved on the right rhythm, and the niraval at ‘Madhurapuri nilaye’ was significantly well-structured. Interesting combinations Bilahari’s rather brief sketch led to tanam shared by the duo. Here one saw a smart tanam-ragam exchange between the siblings. The pallavi set in Misra Chapu went as ‘Saravanabhava saranam malaradi saranam arulpuri’. The swara matrices focused on ‘panchamam’ as a landing note and concluded with interesting combinations. It was once again followed by a tani avartanam by Shree Sundarkumar, who provided effective rhythm support. It is, indeed, unusual to have only the kanjira, a ‘upa pakkavadyam’, as accompaniment, but the concert proved that the modest instrument can independently elevate a performance. The closing songs were ‘Kannan varugindra neram’, a Kavadi Chindu by Oothukadu Venkatakavi; and a lively thillana in Behag by vidwan N. Ravikiran. During a post-concert chat, the sisters explained their unusual exercise, saying that online presentations offer the opportunity to try different things. “Though we don’t want to deviate from the basic content or structure of the time-tested concert style, we think there is room for such experiments,” said Anahita.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Of celebrating. And forgetting||Tomorrow, July 3, Swamimalai Rajarathnam Pillai, Bharatanatyam guru, celebrated nattuvanar, and my grandfather, would have turned 90. Many young Bharatanatyam enthusiasts may not know of him. He was the last of the few people who represented the cultural phenomenon of being a nattuvanar — a hereditary practitioner from the disenfranchised Isaivellalar community — who could sing, wield the cymbals, and choreograph simultaneously. Although nattuvanars exercised a degree of power, in that they conducted the Bharatanatyam recital, they had already been pushed to the sidelines after the reinvention of Bharatanatyam in the 1930s. The stigma of the social reform and criminalisation of their female ancestors together with the general disenfranchisement of the community that followed backed them into the weak end of the equation of caste and power when it came to relationships with their (often brahmin) disciples. There are not many hereditary practitioners today, male or female, and certainly the entanglement of the few who do exist in such power relations remains the same as in my grandfather’s time. In the pre-pandemic world, his birth anniversary would have called for a memorial, with performances by his star disciples. I remember, 10 years ago, I played a marginal role in the 80th anniversary memorial for my grandfather, even as I initiated the conversation around a remembrance. I recently discovered that there had been discussions to plan another event for his 90th birth anniversary. When I heard this, I felt both happiness and sorrow — happiness and pride in knowing that my grandfather was a skilled artiste, and sadness that I cannot be uncritically celebratory, given the problematic history of Bharatanatyam weighing down on the shoulders of daughters and granddaughters of celebrated nattuvanars like him. My critical stance comes from the numerous times that it has been pointed out to me that my politics, my articulation, and quest for reflection, reparation, and reconciliation is at odds with the stance my grandfather took during his career. There is no doubt in my mind that he was certainly entangled in the patriarchal, caste-based power and cultural nationalism that shaped Bharatanatyam in his time, and was also driven by a very practical, material need to support a family in the 1950s. So, in a way, I am driven by this doubt: if my grandfather were alive today, he likely wouldn’t support my dancing and the political nature of it. In writing these critical reflections, I want readers to realise that there is a deep degree of emotional labour that goes into articulating the nuances of my situation. This is a central yet untold part of the story of Bharatanatyam in the modern world. It is the story of how complicated the politics of access and denial of access to this art form are for women from hereditary families, like me. Somewhat ironically, the world of Bharatanatyam is reigned over by many of my grandfather’s star disciples. For these sishyas , the association with their vadhyar has given them legitimacy and authority over the art form. By contrast, my association with my thatha , especially when it comes to Bharatanatyam, can only be defined as complicated and lacking in “sanction,” both personally and professionally. I write this knowing well the consequence that I might be reduced to a voice that is frustrated, angry, and unsuccessful. But on the contrary, I refuse to let my writing invoke pity. It reflects the reality of not having had the privilege of learning and being close to my grandfather in ways that his sishyas had. It reflects the reality of not having the privilege of being considered the legitimate carrier of my grandfather’s art, and the lack of acknowledgement of the socially engineered disenfranchisement that women like me live with. And finally, it underscores the inter-generational cultural privilege his sishyas accrued by accessing Bharatanatyam through a nattuvanar like him. Cherished memories I love my grandfather and cherish the many memories of the seven years I spent around him. He often sang to me, exquisitely, a song in raga Nilambari, ‘ Kuttiyammava yar adicha ,’ to put me to sleep — ‘who was it who beat my little one?’ That would have been his sentiment, to keep me protected from the clique-ish world of dance and the kinds of suffering that he went through himself. This was suffering he couldn’t articulate or disclose in his workspace but expressed in the safety of dinner table conversations. He would often say: ‘ Padichu velaiku poidanum’ — you must study and get a ‘respectable’ job — as opposed to a disreputable occupation in the performing arts. His presence was an integral part of my childhood. I was his first grandchild and enjoyed a certain kind of love and attention that came with it. I might even say I was perhaps the grandchild with the greatest access to the art form, albeit circumstantially. I was born and raised at a time when he was at the peak of his career as a celebrated nattuvanar, teaching many privileged caste girls from ‘respectable’ households, fulfilling the moral mandate of the reinvented Bharatanatyam. It is no surprise that they went on to become successful dancers with careers in the very tradition that families like mine historically inherited. Social conditioning and my own circumstances do not allow me “legitimate rights” over my grandfather or Bharatanatyam, and I too don’t feel any sense of ownership over him or the art form. I don’t think I should be the person speaking about him, teaching one of his dance compositions, dancing one of his pieces on his birth anniversary — the system doesn’t give me that space. There are others authorised to celebrate his life, his teachings, his art, his musicality, and his contributions in their lives. But I want to mourn his loss, a loss that happened too early for me. I also, perhaps more importantly, want to mourn the lack of legitimacy and opportunity that women from our families face. If at all we are included, it is always on the margins, reduced to being “carriers of a great tradition,” called in during lecture demonstrations or workshops to demonstrate “old things” that some are curious about (even if in private these “old aesthetics” are mocked at), or other such activities on the fringes of Bharatanatyam’s economy. This phenomenon has been occurring for more than four generations now. As others celebrate my grandfather’s art and his genius, I hope we can reflect more closely on what exactly we are celebrating, and also ask ourselves the deeper (and intentionally invisibilised) questions around ‘legitimacy’, authority, authenticity and power in the world of Bharatanatyam.  The writer, a social and cultural activist, is also a performer and teacher of Bharatanatyam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/of-celebrating-and-forgetting/article35089385.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Music beyond boundaries||The second virtual Asia Music Summit by MusiConnect Asia, Global Toronto Conference and Small World Music brought alive a versatile curation of musical styles and artistes from around the continent. The two-day summit had more than 30 presenters sharing their music and interacting with about 800 people from around the world in panels, performances, break-out sessions and virtual meet-ups. As an artiste-driven venture, MusiConnect Asia focuses on strengthening artiste collaborations across South Asia. With dwindling live performance opportunities, the summit encouraged conversations around strategies for artistes to break into newer markets and platforms. Kaushik Dutta, chairman, Asia Music Summit, and president, MusiConnect Asia, emphasised, “Many Asian artistes have had broad regional and international careers, but the world has had only a mere glimpse of the great Asian music in store. The music summit is showcasing and celebrating its diversity.” Experts meet For many musicians, creative practice has been deeply affected over the last year and there was an urgent need to address this by bringing together experts from across Asia to share ideas and initiate cross-genre collaborations. Dutta reflects, “The summit not only highlighted the sustainability and creative crisis that these artistes are facing today, but also laid out an action plan for a better future. We have been successful in opening up a window of dialogue that allows organisations and artistes from Asia to connect with their counterparts across the world. Programmes are being implemented to facilitate the consolidation of their professional practice.” While the crisis for music professionals has been similar across the sub-continent, the cultural context and support systems within each country offered varying perspectives. Rizu Tuladhar and Bhusan Shiplakar from Nepal presented a documentary that delved into the landscapes of Nepal and living music traditions. Music festivals from across the country provided insights into today’s scenario and emphasised the transitions within the country’s music ecosystem. Sri Lanka-based ethnomusicologist, Sumudi Suraweera, has spent many years researching Sri Lankan traditional drumming. And in his presentation from this research, he featured numerous traditional drumming artistes, their stories of music-making, and their maverick lives. The Musicmatters Transcoastal Collective is rooted in Sri Lankan traditional music and places it in contemporary settings. Fusing folk melodies ‘Purple Fusion’ is a folk fusion band that draws on local Naga traditional songs, layering the melodies with contemporary sounds. The band from Northeast India emphasises the importance of staying true to the traditional flavour while experimenting with new sounds that can resonate with global audiences. Mhathung Odyuo, bassist, Vibiezonuo Rupreo, vocalist, and Imsanger Longkumer, guitarist, shared insights on treading the fine balance between living traditions of music and cross-cultural collaborative work even as they belted out signature tunes from their repertoire. For most uninitiated listeners across the globe, the strongest reference for Hindustani Classical music still remains Ravi Shankar and his collaborative work with bands such as the Beatles, the Doors, Rolling Stones and others. Sitarist Samanwaya Sarkar evoked nostalgia, playing one of Ravi Shankar’s famous renditions in raag Tilak Shyam. Elaborating on his work, he spoke about the journey of sitar and his own interpretations of Shankar’s creations. Chennai-based filmmaker and ethnographer Roy Dipankar shared his explorations and observations on rock music in India. ‘This Is How We Rock’ took the audience through a maze of artistes spanning generations of the genre, their composing, performing, label managing and filmmaking experiences. The camera followed the artistes at work, backstage, to live performances and studio recordings, to music videos and B-rolls, providing glimpses into the past, present and future of rock in India. The summit also had renowned EDM duo from India, L. Shankar (AKA Shenkar) and Eddie Prithviraj performing as the band Radiotronics. Singer, violinist, composer and producer, Shenkar is known for designing the Double Violin, a 10-string stereophonic instrument. Over the years, he has produced different genres of music ranging from classical and pop to rock and EDM, and has also scored music for an Oscar-winning documentary. The summit provided a space for audiences and artistes to connect and steer music towards creative resilience. The upcoming edition of the Asia Music Summit is slated for November, to be held in Nagaland.

02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Music as theatre||Trinity , a play by The Madras Players, which had its first run in 2018, came back in the news when it was recently made available on online platforms for global audiences. Based on the lives of the Carnatic music Trinity, Syama Sastri, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Tyagaraja, the play is an adaptation of short stories written by Seeta Ravi and translated by Prabha Sridevan, retired judge of the Madras High Court. Designed and directed by P.C. Ramakrishna, the play has a stellar cast, with renowned musicians Vijay Siva, Gayatri Venkataraghavan and S. Sunder performing the roles of Dikshitar, Syama Sastri’s wife Lalitha, and Tyagaraja, respectively. The episodic play begins with the narrator Tyagesan setting the story in motion: ‘The three great composers of Carnatic music, all born around the same time in Tiruvaiyaru’. While depicting the lives of the composers, the play makes no effort to dwell on the intellectual exchanges between them or their musical ideas. The stories too are those that abound in the public realm. Dikshitar’s kshetra kritis The story of Dikshitar is chiefly about how he moved from one kshetram to the other with his disciples, composing the major kritis in his huge body of work. In the play, Dikshitar (Vijay Siva) journeys from Mayiladuthurai (‘Mayuranatham,’ Dhanyasi) to Thiruindalur (‘Parimala Rangan,’ Hamir Kalyani) rendering both compositions beautifully. The episode is information oriented, mentioning Dikshitar’s Srividya worship, Panchabhuta kritis, and his penchant for Hindustani ragas. Dikshitar’s Nottuswarams also find a place. The story of Syama Sastri is told through a conversation between his wife Lalitha (Gayatri Venkataraghavan) and Dharmambal. Dharmambal accuses Syama Sastri of neglecting his wife, but Lalitha argues that her loneliness is mitigated by his exquisite music, which is her constant companion. During this exchange, Lalitha soeaks of how Syama Sastri refused to take royal favours, and surrendered only to Goddess Kamakshi. They discuss him as the architect of the swarajite form, narrate stories of how he defeated Appukutti Nattuvanar, Kesavayya from Bobbili and others. Gayatri Venkataraghavan sings some of his masterpieces such as ‘Himachala Tanaya,’ ‘Devi Brova,’ and ‘Kamakshi ’ during the enactment. The last episode dwells is of Tyagaraja, and narrates the famous story of his disciple Walajahpet Venkataramana Bhagavatar gifting Tyagaraja a photo of Rama for his daughter’s wedding. From here, it moves to a conversation with his daughter Seeta about his obsession with Rama. There is also repeated reference to Rama appearing before Tyagaraja and how he was enchanted by the sight of “the four of them”. Much of Tyagaraja’s life has been recounted based on references found in his kritis, and there is no authentic biography of him. Most narratives are, therefore, a figment of people’s imagination. When such is the case, the stories that we uphold and recirculate in the public realm gain enormous significance. S. Sunder, who plays Tyagaraja, sang the kritis with assurance.  Trinity , with all its good intentions and generous amounts of passion, doesn’t succeed as theatre. It has an Amar Chitra Katha feel to it. A highly indulgent script, mediocre set design and choreography, and a cast that has almost no trained actors alters the experience. The chorus does a poor rendition, and most dialogue deliveries have less nuance and tend more towards the high mimetic, making it monotonous. A better script and higher production values could have made this a good piece of art.  The Bengaluru-based journalist writes on art and culture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/music-as-theatre/article35089382.ece
02 July 2021||July 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Swaras under the stars||Anubhav-2021, held from June 21 to 27, concluded with an overnight concert enabling hundreds of rasikas to come online for a sumptuous treat of classical music and dance. SPIC MACAY introduced the Anubhav series as the virtual ‘avatar’ of its international convention last year when the pre-scheduled Inter-Con at IIT Kanpur could not be held due to Covid-19. The virtual Anubhav series offered students across the globe a holistic experience of Indian art and culture. Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia opened the overnight concert with a mesmerising Yaman. Known for treating his raags like a deity, imparting a spiritual aura to its delineation strictly in accordance with tradition, his reposeful alaap-jod-jhala created a tranquil ambience. The medium tempo composition in Rupak taal of seven beats time cycle was followed by a brisk bandish in dhrut Teentaal, where each progressive swara follows an intriguing gait ( vakra gati ) when moving towards the taar gandhar and then reverting to pancham before reaching the sam on gandhar. This also provided a shorter mukhada for the swift jhala reaching a crescendo with Pt. Ravindra Yavgal’s brilliant tabla accompaniment. Pt. Venkatesh Kumar, who performed next, presented an engrossing Bihag and a graceful Kaunsi Kanhada in his robust voice. The purity of the raags and their structure were maintained when rendering the traditional khayals set to Vilambit Ektaal and the Teentaal, through the alap, barhat, boltaans and akar taans. The concluding thumri in Khamaj struck a happier, romantic note, after the sombre renderings of the earlier raags, coming through clearly in the harmonium playing of Guru Prasad Hegde and the unobtrusive tabla by Keshav Joshi. It was heartening to see Pt. Sajan Mishra being personally hosted by Dr. Kiran Seth, the founder of SPIC MACAY. He was perhaps performing for the first time after the demise of his brother Pt. Rajan Mishra. “We always sang together and look at the irony, here I am offering him ‘shraddhanjali’. Accompanied on the tabla by Akram Khan, on the harmonium by Sumit Mishra, and with son Swaransh and grandson Arunansh providing vocal support, he opened the midnight concert with the intensely poignant Malkauns - ‘Jinke man Ram viraaje…’, with its ‘sam’ oscillating on the komal dhaivat of the mandra saptak, portraying his emotional state. The horn of a truck The chhota khayal, ‘Mag rokat dheeth langarawa’ in Teentaal was followed by a Dhrut Ektaal composition. It was created impromptu by Pt. Rajan Mishra when he heard the horn of a truck sounding like ‘sa ga ma dha’ of Malkauns, recalled Pt. Sajan. The bandish had taans adorned with this musical phrase. Young Swaransh came as a pleasant surprise. His sonorous voice conveyed the essence of the Mishra Bandhus’ music. Arunanshu also showed the ability to take the family legacy forward. They assisted Pt. Sajan in singing sargam and akar taans in the raag Megh compositions, before Pt. Sajan Mishra concluded with the Tulasidas bhajan, ‘Main na jiyun bin Ram’, that left many teary-eyed. Bali and Thara  The invigorating Koodiyattam presentation of ‘Balivadham’ by Guru Margi Madhu Chakyar assisted by his powerful orchestra kept the viewers wide awake at 2 a.m. The storyline from Bhasa’s Sanskrit play is based on the well-known sequence when, challenged by Sugriva for a wrestling contest, Bali is angry and upset. His wife Thara forbids him from accepting it but he ignores her advice. Boasting of his strength, Bali asks Thara to go inside and leaves to fight Sugreeva. Guru Margi Madhu, the seasoned Koodiyattam exponent, was of course impressive as Bali, but Dr. Indu was no less convincing as Thara, the magnificent queen of Kishkinda. Thara’s intelligence, courage and devotion for her husband were effectively conveyed by Indu through her nunacedabhinaya. The orchestra comprising Kalamandalam Manikandan on the mizhavu, Kalanilayam Rajan on the edakya, and Anjana Chakyar on the thalam, enhanced the emotional impact of the play. Ustad Shahid Parvez’s Charukeshi was generous in conception with an expansive alap-jod-jhala adorned with an elongated meend of 4-5 notes from a single fret and the oscillating mandra gamakas. His Rupak taal gat was a rhythmic delight. It switched from a seven to eight beat cycle and then to ati-dhrut (faster) Teentaal composition, culminating in the immaculately tuneful jhala played with superb command. The wee hours of the Indian morning suited him for a live interaction from Arizona, U.S. with a SPIC MACAY volunteer, who requested him to play a bhajan because it was the Brahma muhurta in India. He obliged (after taking time to tune his tarab, the resonance strings to Khamaj) with ‘Vaishnav jan to…’, with the romantic touches of Thumri ang. Ustad Waifuddin Dagar provided a befitting finale with his meditative alap, dhrupad and dhamar in raag Ahir Bhairav, assisted on the pakhawaj by Pt. Mohan Shyam Sharma. The rare Bhairavi Sadra of Baiju Bawra, ‘Tu hi Brahma tu hi Vishnu…‘, set to Jhaptaal paved the path for the concluding Devi Stuti in Bharavi. It came as a ‘Purnahuti’ with an inner restraint as the ustad let it submerge in the mystical drone of the tanpura.

02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘HC ruling will ensure dog lovers are not harassed’||Animal rights activists and dog lovers on Thursday welcomed the Delhi High Court ruling that stray or street dogs have the right to food and citizens have the right to feed them. Feeding stray dogs has been an issue that has polarised opinions in the city for a long time and has led to fights in neighbourhoods. Many of them are relieved after the ruling. Avinash Singh, a resident of Sector 20 in Noida, says he was attacked by his neighbour a year ago for feeding street dogs outside his house. He registered an FIR against his neighbour and is still pursuing the case. “Dogs are not a nuisance but they are man’s best friend. I was attacked by my neighbour a year ago for feeding street dog outside my house. No one has right to hurt dogs, they also have a place in the planet like other creatures,” Mr. Singh said. Similarly, Nazia Shakeel, a resident of Mayur Vihar, said that she once filed a complaint against her neighbour for killing two puppies of a street dog. “Even police tried to hush the case. I feed dogs in my society from my personal money every day and I get satisfaction. If people are not feeding dogs then they should not stop those who are feeding and loving them,” said Ms. Shakeel. Animal rights groups feel communities need to accept that it is their responsibility to take care of stray dogs. “Dogs and cats have been domesticated by humans from their wild ancestors and are on the streets because of us. We have made them dependent on humans for food, water and care. We commend the Delhi HC for acknowledging it,” said Manilal Valliyate, CEO of PETA India. Encourage adoption He added that without human help, community dogs and cats face starvation, dehydration, untreated wounds and injuries, and people should be encouraged to opt to adopt a dog or cat in need from an animal shelter or the street. Animal activist and lawyer Gauri Puri said that despite laws and guidelines protecting rights of community dogs in India, the implementation and enforcement is weak and often, efforts of animal activists to seek enforcement of such laws have been rendered insignificant. “The judgment sets a much-needed precedent that strikes a defined balance between the constitutional obligation of the statutory authorities to protect community animals vis-à-vis the fundamental duties, moral and social responsibility of RWAs to ensure that statutory protection is provided to community animals,” Ms. Puri said, adding that, crimes against animals have substantially increased and most of these are against community dogs who do not have a permanent caretaker or owner. Social responsibility She feels that the judgment sensitises the issues pertaining to animals and gives much hope to animal lovers. “By directing the police to ensure no animal feeder is harassed or prohibited by the RWA, this judgment would go a long way in aiding the animal feeders to ensure action by the police in case of any harassment. It would be interesting to see how RWAs deal with this moral and social responsibility towards animal welfare,” Ms. Puri said Divya Puri, founder of Karan Puri Foundation that runs a community kitchen feeding 450 animals a day and works with municipal corporations for sterilisation and vaccination of animals, said that with the recent spike in cases of harassment and cruelty towards animals, the court order will make it easier to fight for the rights of our animals. “Justice R. Midha gave an 86-page long judgment where he emphasised and reiterated on various guidelines issued by Animal Welfare Board of India for stray animals. Right to food, water and treatment, protection of caretakers and involvement of RWA/municipal body as a community to look after strays is a welcome step towards peaceful coexistence,” she said.  By directing the police to ensure no animal feeder is prohibited by the RWA, this judgment would go a long way in aiding the animal feeders to ensure police action in case of any harassment Gauri Puri Animal activist and lawyer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-ruling-will-ensure-dog-lovers-are-not-harassed/article35089697.ece
02 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder holds lunch meeting with senior Congress leaders||Amid the ongoing infighting within the Punjab Congress, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday hosted a meeting over lunch with close to two dozen Congress leaders, including Ministers and MLAs – a move which is being seen as a show of strength. Party sources said the meeting was primarily held with Hindu leaders, amid reports that many among them have been feeling marginalised in the party since it came to power in 2017. MLAs from urban constituencies were also present in the meeting. The attempt was to keep the flock together as the power tussle between former Cabinet Minister Navjot Sidhu and Capt. Amarinder is far from over. The luncheon meeting came a day after former party president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met Navjot Singh Sidhu in New Delhi. Ahead of the Assembly election in Punjab, which are due early next year, insiders maintain that there could be significant changes in the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) as well as the Punjab Cabinet. The AICC panel, including Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, AICC general secretary (Punjab) Harish Rawat and J.P. Aggarwal, had a few days ago submitted its report to Congress president Sonia Gandhi with suggestions to resolve infighting in the party’s State unit. The panel is learnt to have suggested that Mr. Sidhu needs to be suitably accommodated. The Chief Minister, however, it was learnt to have made it clear to the panel that PCC should not be headed by another Jat Sikh as the State government is already being headed by one. PCC chief post Member of Parliament Manish Tewari and State Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla were among those present in the luncheon meeting, the names of both these leaders have been doing rounds for the post of PCC president as both are seen as confidants of the Capt. Amarinder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/amarinder-holds-lunch-meeting-with-senior-congress-leaders/article35089691.ece
02 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Dhansa metro station to get first-ever underground integrated parking facility||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday said that the Dhansa Bus Stand metro station on the Dwarka-Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand corridor will be the first ever underground metro station of the Delhi Metro network to have an entire underground floor dedicated for parking vehicles. In a statement, it said that the work on the 1.8 km-long Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand section on the Grey Line is now almost complete, and with the completion of this section, this corridor will become 6.1-km-long with four stations. “This extension will immensely benefit the residents of the interior areas around Najafgarh. All efforts are being made to open the Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand section sometime later this month after complying with all statutory requirements,” the DMRC said. The station, designed as a four-level underground structure will have a platform at the bottom (at an approximate depth of 18 metres) followed by the concourse and then an entire floor for parking above it with the roof level at the top (ground level). The DMRC said that the parking facility will be integrated with the main station area where vehicle users will be able to park their cars and two-wheelers and then proceed to the concourse of the station directly using lifts and escalators. “The facility will have a parking space for about 110 cars and 185 two wheelers. There would be provision for property development activities at the ground level in the future. The parking facility can be considered a major design-based improvement since no other underground metro station in Delhi Metro’s network has any such facility,” the DMRC said. Long queues The DMRC also said that metro trains are running almost empty due to COVID-19 restrictions, trains are only 10%-15% of passenger capacity. It said that lockdown guidelines have been further eased by the authorities, enabling most of the economic activities to take place due to which, there has been continuous build up of the passenger crowd outside stations due to regulated entry resulting in inconvenience to them. “The DMRC regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers due to these restrictions. It hopes that the situation shall improve once the restrictions are relaxed by the authorities,” a spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dhansa-metro-station-to-get-first-ever-underground-integrated-parking-facility/article35089695.ece
