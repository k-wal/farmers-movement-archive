08 July 2021||New Delhi,||Heavyweights shown the door as PM Modi rejigs Cabinet||In a major shake up of his Council of Ministers almost midway through his second term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi oversaw the swearing-in of 43 Ministers (new faces and seven promotions to Cabinet rank) and dropped 12 Ministers (seven Cabinet and five Ministers of State) including Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, India’s new Health Minister would be the newly elevated Cabinet Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. Government sources termed it an effort by Mr. Modi to strike a balance between political messaging of including MPs from various regional centres as well as from marginalised communities and beefing up the skill set of the ministries with professionally and educationally qualified additions. Several ministries have been clubbed together, sources say, to increase synergy. For example, Odisha MP and former bureaucrat Ashwini Vaishnaw will be the Railway Minister, with additional charge of Information and Technology and Communications, and Dharmendra Pradhan will handle Education with Skill Development while Home Minister Amit Shah will have additional charge of the new Ministry of Cooperation. The exclusions The rejig was significant not just for the inclusions but also the heavyweights who were dropped, including Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ and Ministers of State Babul Supriyo, Debashree Choudhary, Ratan Lal Kataria, Pratap Sarangi and Sanjay Dhotre. While unhappiness with the handling of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is being cited as the reason why Dr. Harsh Vardhan had to go, Mr. Javadekar and Mr. Prasad’s exits appeared to be over the failure to handle controversial issues hitting the government with regard to their ministries. Portfolios announced The portfolios of the new Ministers were announced late at night with Jyotiraditya Scindia getting the Civil Aviation portfolio and former Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan getting the Education Ministry. Mr. Pradhan’s Petroleum portfolio will be handled by Hardeep Singh Puri, who holds on to one of his old portfolios of Urban Development. Former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal will handle Ports and Shipping while the first Cabinet Minister from Arunachal Pradesh, Kiren Rijiju, will handle Law and Justice after the resignation of Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad. Janata Dal (United)’s R.C.P. Singh will be the new Steel Minister, and Pashupati Paras will occupy his brother, late Ram Vilas Paswan’s old portfolio of Food and Consumer Affairs. BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav will be the new Environment and Labour Minister, replacing Mr. Gangwar, who quit on Wednesday, and the Ministry of External Affairs will have three Ministers of State — V. Muraleedharan and new inductees Meenakshi Lekhi and Rajkumar Ranjan Singh. Political signalling With Wednesday’s inclusions, the government now has a record 12 Ministers belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 27 belonging to the Other Backward Classes, eight Ministers belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and five Ministers belonging to the minority communities, including one Muslim, one Christian, one Sikh and two Buddhists. Women Ministers number 11 in the Modi government, with two Cabinet Ministers and others being Ministers of State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cabinet-reshuffle-attempts-inclusion-political-messaging/article35204670.ece
08 July 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,||Happy reunion for a family from Odisha after 3 years||It was a happy reunion for a family from Odisha on Wednesday. The family that ‘lost’ its pregnant mother and 18-month-old girl has got them back after three years. When the public happened to see a pregnant woman wandering along the streets of Tiruchendur three years ago with an 18-month-old girl child, they informed the police, who, in turn, alerted the officials of District Child Welfare Committee and the Department of Social Welfare. The woman was rescued but no useful information could be extracted from her by the officials about her native place as she was mentally unsound. While the girl was handed over to St. Joseph’s Home, a shelter being run by the RC Diocese of Thoothukudi at Adaikkalaapuram to take care of orphans, the woman was taken to ‘Active Minds’, a non-governmental organisation, running home for the destitute women. Besides giving her due medical treatment for pregnancy and the psychological issues, the rescued woman was given counselling that had positive impact. Meanwhile, she gave birth to a baby boy. “On regaining memories about her native place, the woman told us about her name, native place in Odisha and other relevant information that came in handy for us to locate the family,” said Dhanalakshmi, District Social Welfare Officer. Though the woman’s family could be contacted in April 2020, they could not come to Thoothukudi immediately due to the lockdown. As the lockdown relaxations came into force recently, Collector K. Senthil Raj initiated steps to ensure early arrival of the woman’s husband and the police officials from Odisha to complete the mandatory formalities. When three police officers from Odisha arrived here on Wednesday with the woman’s husband and her brother-in-law, a small function was organised in the evening to celebrate the happy reunion of the family after a gap of 3 years. After handing over new clothes, organised by ‘Sakhi,’ to the reunited family members, he also brought a cake to be cut by the little daughter of the woman in the presence of Dean of Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital Nehru, ‘Sakhi’ administrator Celine George and the representatives of Active Minds. The reunited family, accompanied by the Odisha police officers, left for their home State in the night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/happy-reunion-for-a-family-from-odisha-after-3-years/article35205095.ece
08 July 2021||Mumbai,||Thespian Dilip Kumar dies, the legend lives on||Legendary actor Dilip Kumar died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday morning and was laid to rest with full state honours in the evening, his death a testament that the end of an era can be more than just a cliché. He was 98. The actor, known to generations of film-goers as “tragedy king” for his portrayal of the brooding, intense romantic in classics like Mughal-e-Azam and Devdas , is survived by his wife Saira Banu. Kumar, born Yusuf Khan, an enduring legend through his decades in cinema and in public life, had been admitted to Hinduja Hospital, a non-COVID-19 facility in Khar, since last Tuesday. “He passed away due to prolonged illness at 7.30 a.m.,” Dr. Jalil Parkar, who had been treating Kumar, told PTI . “With a heavy heart and profound grief, I announce the passing away of our beloved Dilip Saab a few minutes ago. We are from God and to Him we return,” family friend Faisal Farooqui posted on the actor’s Twitter handle at 8.01 a.m. Kumar’s body was taken to his Pali Hill residence around 9.30 a.m., where friends, political leaders and colleagues, including Dharmendra, Shabana Azmi, Shah Rukh Khan and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, paid their respects. “I am very sad today, I can’t say anything. I’ve lost my brother,” an emotional Dharmendra told reporters outside Kumar’s residence. Condolence messages for the much-loved star poured in, with President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi joining political leaders, the film fraternity and others to express their grief. “Dilip Kumar summarised in himself a history of emerging India. The thespian’s charm transcended all boundaries, and he was loved across the subcontinent… Dilip Saab will live forever in the heart of India,” the President said. Prime Minister Modi tweeted: “He was blessed with unparalleled brilliance, due to which audiences across generations were enthralled. His passing away is a loss to our cultural world. Condolences to his family, friends and innumerable admirers. RIP.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/thespian-dilip-kumar-dies-the-legend-lives-on/article35204672.ece
08 July 2021||CHENNAI,||States can’t claim ownership of rivers, says Duraimurugan||Tamil Nadu Water Resources Minister Duraimurugan on Wednesday criticised the Karnataka government for trying to build a dam in Mekedatu and said that the States cannot claim sole ownership of rivers flowing within it. Speaking to the reporters in Chennai upon his return from a meeting in New Delhi, Mr. Duraimurugan said that a wide-ranging Detailed Project Report is being allowed by the Central Water Commission even as the Karnataka government is bent on building the dam. “I asked if this is fair. The [Union] Minister [at the meeting] said that just because a DPR is being allowed to be prepared, the dam cannot be built. There are thousands of issues and clearances required and said that the Union government will not keep quiet,” he said. He also said that a tribunal will be formed to look into the issue of dams being built across the Markandeya River.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-cant-claim-ownership-of-rivers/article35204794.ece
08 July 2021||CHENNAI,||Temples asked to upload annual budgets online||Temples have been asked to upload their annual budgets online on the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Department website. The budgets, which should have prior approval from respective officials, should also have savings to be done by the temple under various heads, explained a source in the department. The HR and CE Act stipulates the submission of the budget for the Fasali year that starts on July 1 every year. Temples were supposed to put up the budgets on notice boards. However, former officials said that many times budgets did not get the required approval for silly reasons. “They would not have filled up columns showing the amount meant for the Commissioner's Common Good Fund or the government grant. Despite providing training to fill up the form, officials would make mistakes or the total would not add up,” said a retired official. Welcome move Another retired official, who welcomed the move, said that online accounting should also be introduced so that temples can upload expenses and income at least once a month so that they can immediately spot over-spending. Any additional expense should be done with due permissions, which is a procedure that is followed in many temples,” he said. Citing the example of how a clerk had misappropriated Rs. 50 lakh belonging to a Shiva temple near Chennai, he said that if an online accounting system had been there it would have helped to keep tab of the accounts more effectively. Minister for HR and CE P. K. Sekar Babu said that the online budget would allow temple administrations to be more transparent. “People can see how much is the income of a temple and what is spent on daily rituals or during festivals,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/temple-budgets-will-go-online-soon/article35204799.ece
08 July 2021||MANGALURU,||Coastal region gets a Central Minister in its true sense||With the induction of two-time MP Shobha Karandlaje representing Udupi-Chikkamagaluru Lok Sabha constituency into the Union Council of Ministers on Wednesday as a Minister of State, the coastal region has been given representation in its true sense. Though D.V. Sadananda Gowda hails from Dakshina Kannada, he represented Bengaluru North Lok Sabha constituency. A one-time MLC (2004) and MLA (2008), a Cabinet Minister in the State between 2008-2013 and two -time MP (2014 and 2019) representing Udupi-Chikkamagaluru, Ms. Karandlaje hails from Charvaka village in Puttur taluk, Dakshina Kannada. She held portfolios of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj in the B.S. Yediyurappa government and Energy in the Jagadish Shettar government. The 54-year-old Parliamentarian acquired her bachelors degree from St. Philomena College, Puttur, MA in Social Work from Mangalore University and MA in Sociology from Mysore University. Ms. Karandlaje grew up under RSS ideology and held different positions starting from general secretary of BJP’s Udupi district Mahila Morcha. In 2004, she became a member of the Legislative Council and then MLA representing Yeshwantpur constituency in Bengaluru in 2008. While a section of BJP supporters in Udupi-Chikkamagaluru Lok Sabha constituency opposed her renomination in the 2019 polls claiming that she was not available to voters, Ms. Karandlaje was renominated and she won by a margin of 3.49 lakh votes against Pramod Madhwaraj, who was in the Janata Dal (S) then. She had defeated K. Jayaprakash Hegde, then in the Congress and now in the BJP, with a margin of 1.81 lakh votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Termed as a firebrand leader for Hindutva cause, Ms. Karandlaje will respond immediately to issues and concerns of general public as admitted by BJP insiders. She is equally vocal on issues concerning women empowerment and injustice to them, they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/coastal-region-gets-a-central-minister-in-its-true-sense/article35205213.ece

08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||P.R. Kumaramangalam’s wife murdered at her Delhi home||Kitty Kumaramangalam, 70, wife of former Union Minister the late P. Rangarajan Kumaramangalam and a lawyer by profession, was murdered at her residence in southwest Delhi’s Vasant Vihar area on Tuesday night. Police have arrested two persons in connection with the case.

08 July 2021||KALABURAGI,||67 pharmacy projects approved at Kadechur-Badiyal Bulk Drug Park||Reiterating his government’s commitment to ensuring industrial development of Kalyana Karnataka region, Minister for Large and Medium Scale Industries Jagadish Shettar said that the government has already given approval to 67 pharmacy companies to set up their units in Kadechur-Badiyal Bulk Drug Park in Yadgir district. “These 67 companies are expected to invest over Rs. 2,812 crore and generate over 11,000 jobs. We have developed the industrial area on over 3,000 acres in Kadechur. And, we have developed infrastructure required for pharmaceutical industries on 50% of the area, around 1,500 acres,” Mr. Shettar said during his interaction with industrialists at the conference hall of the district administrative complex here on Wednesday. When local industrialists aired their grievances at the meeting, Mr. Shettar asked the officers concerned how frequently they held meetings of the Single Window Committee to address such grievances. In their response, the officers said that they could hold only five meetings in the last two years. Disappointed by the answer, Mr. Shettar directed the officers, especially Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna, to hold the meetings every month. “Even during COVID-19 pandemic, we, at the State-level, did not stop holding Single Window Committee meetings. You too should hold monthly meetings of the Single Window Committee without fail and address the issues of industrialists. The officers at the district level should, instead of creating hurdles for industrialists, encourage them to invest more and more,” Mr. Shettar said. In response to president of North East Small Scale Industrialists Association Kupendra S. Dhule, who said that three of the total 10 acres in Aland Industrial Estate was encroached upon and misused, Mr. Shettar directed the officers of his department to have a survey done immediately and initiate legal action. “If the plots in the industrial estate which have been allotted for industrial purposes are misused for residential purposes, it is a clear violation of terms and conditions of allocation. You [the officers] should initiate legal action and demolish such structures. Submit a detailed report to my office within a week on the action taken in the issue,” Mr. Shettar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/67-pharmacy-projects-approved-at-kadechur-badiyal-bulk-drug-park/article35204924.ece

08 July 2021||Pune,||Move to weaken Sena grip in Maharashtra’s key areas||With four BJP leaders from Maharashtra starring in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mega Cabinet reshuffle, the BJP appears to have worked out a well thought-out stratagem to unsettle the tripartite Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and particularly target its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena, in key regions of the State. The exercise saw the induction of the Sena’s perennial bete noire , former Maharashtra CM Narayan Rane, into the Union Cabinet and Kapil Patil, Dr. Bhagwat Karad and Bharati Pawar as Ministers of State. The induction of the Konkan strongman, a former Shiv Sainik, who is also an important face of the Maratha community, is clearly viewed as an aggressive move on the BJP’s part to neutralise the Sena in the region. Since exiting the Congress in 2017, Mr. Rane’s ‘Sena baiting’ has grown even more strident. However, his entry into the BJP had not been smooth and was a bone of contention when the BJP and the Sena were in alliance in the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government. He had accused the Sena of deliberately delaying his entry, given the mutual antipathy between himself and Mr. Thackeray. In September 2017, Mr. Rane severed his decade plus-long association with the Congress with the expectation that the BJP, which is weak in the Konkan belt, would welcome him with open arms. At the time of his exit, he had vowed to deplete the ranks of his former parties, the Shiv Sena and the Congress. Attacks on Thackeray He has repeatedly launched vitriolic attacks on Mr. Thackeray, berating the latter’s capabilities as party head and then as Chief Minister. Mr. Rane, who ruled his fiefdom of Kudal in Sindhudurg district which he held for six terms as MLA, was trounced by the Sena’s Vaibhav Naik in the 2014 Assembly elections. After a long period in limbo following his exit from the Congress, Mr. Rane was sent to the Rajya Sabha backed by the BJP. However, it was only in October 2019, just ahead of the Assembly polls, that he merged his party, the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha, with the BJP. The induction of Mr. Patil, a former NCP leader who joined the BJP before the 2014 general election, is being viewed as a move to counter Sena stalwart and Maharashtra Minister Eknath Shinde, who currently holds sway over Thane. The reshuffle also reflects a keen balance of caste interests: the induction of Dr. Bhagwat Karad, an influential and experienced OBC leader from the Marathwada region, is meant to serve as a stimulus for the party’s further expansion in the area. The induction of Ms. Bharati Pawar, a first-time MP from Dindori, a tribal constituency in Nasik District, is being seen as a step to neutralise the NCP in northern Maharashtra. Incidentally, just before the 2019 election, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had announced Ms. Pawar’s name as a candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/move-to-weaken-sena-grip-in-maharashtra-key-areas/article35205051.ece

Given his “seniority, experience and goodwill”, party sources said Dr. Harsh Vardhan’s exit heralds his return to Delhi politics in the run-up to the civic elections due early next year. “Dr. Harsh Vardhan was the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate in the 2013 Delhi Assembly polls. The party’s State unit will do much better if he is at the helm in one way or another,” said a senior leader in the Delhi BJP. According to party sources, Ms. Lekhi’s legal acumen and experience in the administration of Lutyens’ Delhi where most embassies are located, as Member, New Delhi Municipal Council, was expected to inform the choice of portfolios for her. Ms. Lekhi, a practising Supreme Court lawyer, was named Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lekhi-in-harsh-vardhan-all-set-for-delhi-return/article35204833.ece

Ally unhappy The seven who took oath as Ministers of State included Anupriya Patel, president of the Apna Dal (Sonelal), a key ally. Her induction, however, did not go well with the BJP’s second ally, the Nishad Party, which has for weeks been demanding a promotion in either the State government or the Centre. The Nishad Party claims to be the voice of the riverine OBC castes. The seven new Ministers reflected caste and regional necessities of the BJP, with the induction of a Brahmin from central-north U.P., two Kurmis from Purvanchal, one Lodh from Rohilkhand, one Kori from Bundelkhand, one Pasi from Awadh and one Dhangar from Braj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/inductions-from-up-reflect-focus-on-caste-equations/article35205127.ece
08 July 2021||Kolkata,||Judge recuses from hearing Mamata’s election petition||Calcutta High Court Justice Kaushik Chanda on Wednesday imposed a cost of Rs. 5 lakh on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee while recusing himself from hearing an election petition filed by her. The cost has been imposed for “vilification adopted to seek recusal”. The Chief Minister had filed an election petition in June 2021 before the High Court, alleging irregularities in the counting process in the Nandigram Assembly poll. The matter came for hearing before Justice Kaushik Chanda. Ms. Banerjee urged the judge to recuse himself from hearing the petition, alleging that he had links with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The order said, “The calculated psychological offensives and vilification adopted to seek recusal need to be firmly repulsed, and a cost of Rs. 5 lakh is imposed upon the petitioner… Such cost should be deposited with the Bar Council of West Bengal within two weeks from date, and upon such deposit, the Bar Council shall set aside the amount for the families of the advocates who had succumbed to COVID-19.” Justice Chanda said that the petitioner had approached the Hon’ble Chief Justice (Acting) on the administrative side on 16th June, 2021. “The election petition was first taken up for hearing on 18th June, 2021, before this Bench, and quite surprisingly, nothing regarding recusal was revealed. No clue was given to me as to the fact that the petitioner had already approached the Hon’ble Acting Chief Justice for reassignment of the petition,” the Judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/judge-recuses-from-hearing-mamatas-election-petition/article35204673.ece

08 July 2021||Mangaluru,||Corpn. urged to make lake water potable||While activists fighting for the restoration of the old waterbody Gujjarkere at Jeppu in the city are happy over the recent progress made in restoration project, they are demanding that the Mangaluru City Corporation work towards making the water potable. “We are happy that our two-decade fight for restoration of the lake has yielded fruits and the lake is regaining lost glory. But the real thing that is needed is to make the water potable which, in turn, will help restart the annual ritual of immersing the idols of Mangaladevi and Mariyamma deities in this waterbody,” said Nemu Kottary, convener of Gujjarkere Theerta Samrakshna Samiti, which has been fighting for restoration of the lake since 2001. In 2007, the then district in-charge Minister Krishna J. Palemar initiated the work of building embankment around the lake after clearing debris dumped in the waterbody. This did not help improve the condition of the lake and waste water continued to accumulate. The work of realigning drainage network taken up in 2011 did not help too. So too the work of restoring the lake taken up in 2015. It was in 2016 that the work of laying new sewer network was taken up between Morgan’s Gate and Leewell areas. And, Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) took up restoration work at a cost of Rs. 4 crore in February last year. As part of restoration, hyacinth in the lake has been removed and the lake bed has been dredged for about 2 m. The lake embankment has been constructed and railings have been laid. A new concrete road is being laid around the lake. Work on walking track and landscaping are on now. Mr. Kottary said that the problem of sewage leaking into the lake still remains. “We have noticed leakage of sewage from the manhole at the junction of Gujjarkere Main Road and the new concrete road off the lake bund. We have brought this to notice of Mayor Premanand Shetty and MSCL officials,” he said. Shravan Shetty, another member of the samiti, said that the new concrete road on the lake bund is too wide. Such a wide road, which enables movement of heavy vehicles, will have negative impact on the lake, he said. Mr. Shetty said that officials should plant more saplings on the lake bund and make this old waterbody, a model natural lake. Ruling out leakage of sewage into the lake, Mr. Shetty said that the accumulation of waste over a long period has affected the quality of water. “We will have an oxidation plant at the lake, which will greatly improve the water quality.

08 July 2021||New Delhi,||Method actor with an understated elegance||When Marlon Brando was struggling to find a footing in Hollywood, a shy Pathan boy from Peshawar was practising method acting in what was then the Bombay film industry, helping it come out of the Parsi theatre’s influence. As Dilip Kumar transcends to a new stage, the pole star of the golden age of Hindi cinema would be remembered for setting a template of acting for generations to come. A veritable cultural icon who inspired economist Meghnad Desai to draw parallels between his films and the newly independent India’s tryst with socialism and capitalism in his seminal work, Nehru’s Hero: Dilip Kumar in the Life of India , there is a bit of Dilip Kumar in everyone’s life. Discovered and later renamed by Devika Rani of the famed Bombay Talkies, Dilip Kumar, along with Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand, were part of the discovery of cinema in India as a means of mass communication as we see it today. They had had few examples to follow and perhaps it worked to their advantage as each one carved out his own niche. Naturalistic style Out of the three, Dilip Kumar’s naturalistic style never became stale or dated. The right blend of star and actor who could keep both the public and the purist engaged with his craft, he kept his performances subtle, understated but always believable. Not just his younger contemporaries like Rajendra Kumar, Manoj Kumar and Dharmendra, generations of dependable actors, from Amitabh Bachchan to Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan to Irrfan, built edifices of their performances on the foundation laid by Dilip Kumar. Mr. Bachchan, who played Dilip Kumar’s son in Shakti , once said there was such finality to Dilip sahib ’s performances that once he enacted a scene, there was no alternative to it. Irrfan once told this journalist that he often wondered when trained actors like him found it difficult to deal with scars left by tragic roles, how Dilip Kumar, who learnt the craft on his own, came to terms with it. Well, he did approach doctors in London, who advised him to consider lighter roles. Film historians often label the thespian as the tragedy king for his moving portrayal of a loner who loses everything in love in a series of films such as Jugnu , Deedar and Devdas , but the eight-time Filmfare Award winner was equally compelling as a winsome romantic in Shabnam , Azaad and Kohinoor . Not to forget his intense performances as a revolutionary in Shaheed and a trade union leader in Paigham . Be it the lawyer who rapes a village girl in Mehboob Khan’s Amar , the journalist who becomes black-marketeer in Zia Sarhady’s Footpath , the atheist in love with a mendicant in Kidar Sharma’s Jogan or the wheel-chair bound Raja Sahib in Aadmi , a role earlier essayed by Sivaji Ganesan, the Padma Vibhushan awardee constantly lunged for complex characters where he was expected to evoke multiple emotions in a single frame. He experimented not just with characters but also directorial styles. Both Amar and Footpath deal with moral guilt but while Mehboob Khan visualised a mass entertainer, Zia’s treatment was neorealist. With Tapan Sinha’s Sagina Mahto , he ventured into parallel cinema and earned praise from his contemporaries. At the time of Mughal-e-Azam , he was the top draw, but the narrative demanded Kumar to play second fiddle to Prithviraj Kapoor, a senior and a friend of his father. He delivered a restrained performance, a subtle counterpoint to the bombastic Kapoor that is etched in the minds of cinegoers. Home production The one that stands out and inspired many adaptations is the dacoit in Gunga Jumna , his ambitious home production where the sophisticated Kumar transformed into an Awadhi-speaking rustic who is forced to pick up the gun. It is this constant urge for variety and chiselling of the craft that the megastar, despite the world at his feet, chose to do only around 60 films spanning over almost five decades. He refused Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa for he found the character similar to Devdas. He said no to David Lean for Lawrence of Arabia as he was not keen to commit the amount of time that the director was asking from him. In a BBC interview, he once said that when the director came to him with a 30-year-old character, he tried to find and build the first 29 years of his life from the script so that, “I start identifying with the character. Often directors leave it to me to interpret the character.” Known to help out his colleagues in finding a rhythm that suited the narrative, the actor is said to have ghost-directed many films such as Gunga Jumna , Ram Aur Shyam and Aadmi . He took the preparation for a character to a different level. For “Madhuban Mein Radhika Nache Re” from Kohinoor , where he played sitar on screen, he trained with sitarist Ustad Halim Jaffar Khan for six months. It is said while filming for Dil Diya Dard Liya , he ran four rounds of the studio because in the next sequence he was supposed to snatch a rifle from Pran, playing the villain, in a state of breathlessness. Even in his second innings, when his mannerisms became marked, he impressed with power-packed performances in Shakti , Mashaal and Karma .  I start identifying with the character. Often directors leave it to me to interpret the character Dilip Kumar in a BBC interview||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/method-actor-with-an-understated-elegance/article35204595.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||4 States alerted on virus surge||The Union Health Ministry has sent letters to Odisha, Assam, Tripura and Sikkim, pointing to a rise in COVID-19 cases despite a decline in the national curve. It directed them to take steps such as improving containment measures and ramping up testing, vaccination and emphasising pandemic-appropriate behaviour. The letter, signed by Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, to the State Chief Secretaries is common in format except for the details on the caseloads. In Odisha, five districts (Baleshwar, Cuttack, Jagatsinghapur, Kendrapara and Khorda) had shown an increase in cases over the previous week. The Odisha case fatality ratio was less than 0.46%, but there was an increase in deaths over the past two weeks. Three districts had reported a test positivity greater than 10%. In Tripura, there was a 11% increase in the number of weekly new cases, with 2,814 cases reported during June 28-July 4. All eight districts reported more than 100 new cases over the previous week. Four out of eight districts had reported a test positivity rate above 10%. 25% jump in Sikkim Sikkim had a weekly positivity rate of 18.7% and was consistently over 15% during the last four weeks. There was a 25% increase in the weekly new cases over the previous week. In Assam, four out of 33 districts were showing an increase in the weekly new cases and 29 out of 33 districts had reported over 100 new cases. Two out of 33 districts had shown a positivity rate of over 10%. On Tuesday, Balram Bhargava, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said at a press conference that 73 districts were clocking over 10% positivity and that this was a cause of worry. “We have to be careful, responsible and cautious — the second wave is still on in some parts of this large country,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/4-states-alerted-on-virus-surge/article35204393.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP drawing up its playbook for 2024 battle||The massive redrawing of the Union government in Wednesday’s Cabinet expansion has the seeds of the political battle lines over which the 2024 Lok Sabha election will be fought. The Narendra Modi government now has 27 Ministers belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBC), 12 to the Scheduled Castes, eight to the Scheduled Tribes and five to minority religious communities, and 11 women, who represent some of the more marginalised regional areas of the country as well. Out of the 77 Ministers in the Council of Ministers, therefore, 48 are from non-upper caste backgrounds. This redrawing of the government represents the direction in which the Modi government will move the BJP in its social appeal as well, to try and break in public perception its upper caste moorings. Political scientist Badri Narayan, author of a well-regarded biography of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram, terms it, “The widening of the social pyramid via governance by bringing as many communities as possible into the orbit of democratic power.” The first test for it will be the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election in 2022. Currently, the government has 14 Ministers from the State and today’s seven inclusions have three OBC Ministers, three Scheduled Castes and only one Brahmin. Look east The Cabinet expansion also points to the large number of inclusions from the east and the northeast, with Ministers from Assam, Manipur and Tripura, and four Ministers from West Bengal, sworn in on Wednesday, indicating that the region remains a major political project for the BJP in the coming years. An interesting point in the reshuffle are the inclusions from Maharashtra. The four additions from the State, including of powerful Maratha leader and former Chief Minister Narayan Rane, points to the fact that the loss of Maharashtra, of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory that happened subsequent to the 2019 Assembly election in the State, after the alliance with the Shiv Sena broke, still rankles. It does not bode well for a peaceful relationship between the Centre and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra. Political scientist Rahul Verma says the axing of Ministers of the Departments like Social Justice and Empowerment, Health, Education, Labour, Information and Technology, and Environment and Climate Change, and the bringing in of technocrats from among the political cohort group “points to the fact that these Ministries will be key in the government going forward”. The exclusions, according to sources, are a combination of a case of individual evaluation and finding the Ministers wanting in performance, but also the failure of these Ministers to explain the major controversies dogging these departments in a way that does not get the government deeper into the mess. With the dropping of seven Cabinet Ministers, including Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar, only Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi remain flag bearers of the old National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that existed under the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. While much had already changed under Mr. Modi’s leadership of the NDA, this rejig is a more comprehensive passing of an era.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/massive-reshuffle-with-sights-set-on-2024-poll/article35204579.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exclusions and excuses aplenty||Among the reasons that some of the 12 Ministers who resigned ahead of the Cabinet expansion on Wednesday cited for putting in their papers were health concerns as well as just “asked to do so”. When asked for the reason for his resignation, former Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar told The Hindu: “Ask me in two days”. Mr. Gangwar is an eight-time MP from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, a State where the Assembly election is expected in the first half of 2022. During the second wave of the pandemic in May, he wrote to Chief Minister Yogi Adiyanath about the poor response of officials in handling the pandemic. Former Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Babul Supriyo first said on social media posts that he had been asked to resign, but then issued a clarification. In a tweet, Mr. Supriyo said: “Yes, I have resigned from the Council Of Ministers (As I had framed it earlier, “Asked to resign” may not be the right way to put it )…” In a series of tweets, he said he was “surely sad” for himself, but happy for his colleagues who would be sworn in later on Wednesday. Former Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank resigned citing health reasons. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 in May, and had been hospitalised with breathing difficulties and post-COVID complications for much of last month. However, Ministry officials note that several key decisions in the recent past have been made by the Prime Minister’s Office rather than the Education Minister. That includes Mr. Modi’s decision to cancel Class 12 exams, shortly after Mr. Nishank published an article indicating he was in favour of holding the exams in a shortened format. Mr. Nishank’s biggest legacy will be the National Education Policy 2020, although the lion’s share of the work in developing the policy was done during the tenure of his predecessor Prakash Javadekar. His two-year term in office was marred by school and university closures due to the pandemic, a cut in the school education budget, and a failure to appoint Vice-Chancellors at a large number of Central universities. Minister of State for Education Sanjay Dhotre has also been dropped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pokhriyal-cites-health-reason-gangwar-leaves-a-suspense/article35204575.ece
08 July 2021||Pune,||Summer of 1978: when the hero saw his epic||The passing away of Bollywood film legend Dilip Kumar has opened a floodgate of reminiscences — both cinematic memories and private recollections — by people cutting across social, economic, political and national barriers. However, few would know that it was in the main theatre of Pune’s Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) that Dilip Kumar finally watched one of his defining classics, K. Asif’s spellbinding Mughal-e-Azam for the first time in his life — a full 18 years after the film was released. As the story goes, in the summer of 1978, the legendary actor wanted to see 15 classics during a sojourn in the city. “It was the great P.K. Nair, the country’s pre-eminent archivist and scholar and the driving force behind the National Film Archive of India (NFAI), who had arranged the screening of the films at the FTII main theatre. All films were chosen by his actress wife Saira Bano,” says current FTII Director Bhupendra Kainthola. Cinema marathon Then, in a veritable cinema marathon, Dilip Kumar saw a film a day at the main theatre and Saira Bano was by his side when he finally watched Mughal-e-Azam — which he had reportedly never seen since it took the country by storm in 1960. The incident bears an astonishing similarity with the experience of another legendary actor — Peter O’Toole, who reportedly viewed his greatest cinematic role, that of T.E. Lawrence in David Lean’s immortal Lawrence of Arabia , almost two decades after that film’s initial release in 1962. Later, in another visit to the FTII, the actor was chief guest at a convocation ceremony in December 1997. Also present on the occasion were iconic theatre and film personality Mohan Agashe, then Director of the institute, and filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, who was then FTII Chairman. However, despite the occasion being somewhat marred by students who chose to air some of their complaints publicly, Dr. Agashe recalls how Dilip sahab ’s magnificent dignity humbled all those present. “I had organised the convocation which was interrupted by students voicing their complaints. Mahesh Bhatt was very upset. But Dilip Kumar shone through it all with his tremendous and awesome dignity. He told the protesting students that the FTII was a temple and that they ought not to wash their dirty linen in public,” reminisced Dr. Agashe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/summer-of-1978-at-punes-ftii/article35204602.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A philanthropist who always stepped up||As tributes tumble out at the passing of Dilip Kumar — with Amitabh Bachchan going so far as to declare that when the history of Indian cinema will be written, it shall always be “before Dilip Kumar and after Dilip Kumar” — we shall leave it to the film critics and the serious student of Hindi cinema to assess his impact on the Hindi film industry. For now, let us see him as the man who always chose to step up and speak up. When the moment come to speak truth to power, here was a superstar who chose not to be content with his superstardom but to put it good use, as and when required. Born as Mohammad Yusuf Khan in Peshawar in 1922 in the home of a fruit merchant, he went on to enjoy a career in the movies spanning five decades, blessed with a longevity enjoyed by few of his contemporaries. A hapless farmer, an outlawed bandit, a fiery student leader, a trade unionist — Dilip Kumar essayed the new face of a new India as it unfolded. Not content with mere stardom, Dilip sahib was possibly among the earliest Indian actors to lend his star status to a variety of causes — an early patron of the National Association for the Blind (NAB) who never missed its annual fund-raising train run, he chose to lend his name and face to charitable institutions such as this and the Ali Yavar Jung Institute of Speech and Hearing in Bandra rather than modelling for commercial gain. The film lyricist and director Gulzar remembers Dilip organising donation drives and rallies during the Indo-China war that began at Mumbai’s Shivaji Park, wound their way through Crawford Market and the gullies of Bhendi Bazaar, where money would be literally showered at them from rooftops, before ending at Azad Maidan. All through the late 1950s and 1960s, Dilip Kumar, along with Sunil Dutt, also visited troops stationed at border postings for morale-boosting interactions with jawans. Gulzar also recalls Dilip Kumar stepping up for similar interactions for the benefit of the film industry, lending his moral gravitas and serving as a bridge between actors and producers-directors. At a seminal meeting of the Indian Motion Picture Association held at Dilip Kumar’s home, several landmark decisions were taken to break the impasse that gridlocked the industry: actors, it was decided, would not take on more than three films (on the floors) at a time, and the directors-producers, on their part, would prune the shift timings to more humane hours. Appointed Sheriff of Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1980, he worked for the improvement of the city’s infrastructure, giving it the iconic Joggers Park, where he himself went for his early morning walks in later years. As a Member of Parliament from the Rajya Sabha, he ploughed the MPLAD (Members of Parliament Local Area Development) fund into improving the Bandstand Promenade and the Bandra Fort area. However, it was the Bombay riots of 1992 that saw Dilip Kumar truly come into his own: turning his home into a command centre for relief work, rescuing those trapped in burning shanty towns, arranging police protection for the most vulnerable and organising food supplies for those who were going hungry for days as communal riots ravaged Bombay. He later mobilised money and legal aid for those who were unfairly detained under the draconian Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. Of course he paid a price for this. When Pakistan honored him with its highest civilian award, the Nishan-i Imtiaz in 1998, it was met with outrage in a cross-section of society, with not merely threats and abuses directed against the thespian, but regurgitation of the old “Pakistani spy” gossip by his old nemesis, the Shiv Seva. Javed Akhtar puts it best when he says that there is a virtue that has become obsolete and that is dignity — Dilip Kumar was a personification of that virtue. “ Eik tehzeeb thii jo kho gayii hai ,” he says, ruing a lost culture. “To be cool, happening and contemporary are on the borderline of rudeness. Decency, reserve, measure, these have become un-cool and obsolete.” ( Rakshanda Jalil is a Delhi-based writer, translator   and literary historian )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-philanthropist-who-always-stepped-up/article35204601.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||New platform maps Pegasus spread||An online database on spyware Pegasus’ use was recently launched by Forensic Architecture, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab to document attacks against human rights defenders. In a statement on July 3, Amnesty said the interactive platform — Digital Violence: How the NSO Group Enables State Terror — showed the connections between ‘digital violence’ of Pegasus spyware and the real-world harms faced by lawyers, activists, and other civil society figures. Amnesty said the NSO Group, which makes the spyware, was a “major player in the shadowy surveillance company” and Pegasus had been used in some of the “most insidious digital attacks” on human rights activists in the world. The spyware enabled an attacker to get complete access to a person’s phone, it stated. “The investigation reveals the extent to which the digital domain we inhabit has become the new frontier of human rights violations, a site of state surveillance and intimidation that enables physical violations in real space,” said Shourideh C. Molavi, Forensic Architecture’s researcher in charge. Bhima Koregaon case The platform, available at digitalviolence.org, lists out “targets” of the spyware in India that include activists Bela Bhatia and Anand Teltumbde. In 2020, Amnesty and Citizen Lab revealed that the spyware was used on nine human rights defenders who were accused in the Bhima Koregaon case. “The spyware campaign… targeted lawyers and activists Nihalsing B. Rathod, Degree Prasad Chouhan, Yug Mohit Choudhary and Ragini Ahuja; academics Partho Sarothi Ray and P.K. Vijayan; a journalist who prefers to stay anonymous; and a human rights collective – Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group (JAGLAG), received malicious e-mails on the group’s official ID,” a blog post by Amnesty on June 15, 2020, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-platform-maps-pegasus-spread/article35204389.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||NCBS lab retracts paper after data fraud||A research paper by scientists at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), among India’s top research institutes and part of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, announcing a breakthrough in the field of chemical biology, and published in the prestigious Nature Chemical Biology (NCB), has been retracted as its key findings were manipulated. On October 5, 2020, the paper “Discovery of iron-sensing bacterial riboswitches” was published online in the NCB . The publication was announced in an NCBS press release on October 6, 2020. Its listed authors were Siladitya Bandyopadhyay, Susmitnarayan Chaudhury, Dolly Mehta and Arati Ramesh, the last of whom was the group leader and is faculty at the NCBS. The finding was significant as it announced the discovery of a new class of RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules that could detect iron. Thus far, it was thought, iron could be detected only by specialised protein. RNA molecules, it has emerged, could detect nickel, cobalt, manganese but being able to detect iron, a key element that is vital for governing many biochemical processes, opened the possibility of designing RNA-based sensors. Though it had ostensibly passed the process of peer review, within weeks of the discovery being made public, independent commentators said images included with the article, that provided critical proof of the discovery, appeared manipulated. In response, Ms. Ramesh uploaded original images and denied manipulation. Other commentators pointed out several more discrepancies in the original files. Inquiry held Ms. Ramesh meanwhile informed NCBS Director Satyajit Mayor of these comments. He set up a departmental inquiry that found that the images had most certainly been manipulated “by a single individual”. The NCBS hasn’t named the individual responsible, but Mr. Mayor told The Hindu that the person was no longer with the institute. The journal formally retracted the paper on June 30 but it was only on Wednesday, the NCBS issued a press statement on the retraction. “As the corresponding author, I must bear responsibility and am deeply shocked and saddened that such scientific misconduct could happen under my watch,” Ms. Ramesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncbs-lab-retracts-paper-after-data-fraud/article35204385.ece
08 July 2021||New Delhi,||Vardhan has become the fall guy for Centre’s failures: Cong.||Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Wednesday that the resignation of Harsh Vardhan as the Health Minister during the Cabinet reshuffle was an admission that the Narendra Modi government had “utterly failed” in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Ministers must realise that if things go wrong they will be the fall guys, he said in a couple of tweets. “The resignations of the Union Health Minister and the MoS Health is a candid confession that the Modi government has utterly failed in managing the pandemic. There is a lesson for Ministers in these resignations. If things go right the credit will go to the PM, if things go wrong the Minister will be the fall guy. That is the price a Minister pays for implicit obedience and unquestioning subservience,” the former Finance Minister said on Twitter. His party colleague Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “Poor Dr. Harsh Vardhan, a good man has been made a scapegoat for monumental failures at the highest level — nowhere else.” Mr. Chidambaram also said since Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank had resigned as the Education Minister, the National Education Policy should also be scrapped. Cabinet reshuffle Commenting on the exercise to rejig the Cabinet, party general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it was not a Cabinet expansion, but “distributing the spoils of power” and “defector adjustment programme”. He said if performance and governance were the criteria, then Defence Minister Rajnath Singh should have been sacked, as the Chinese had occupied Indian territory and refused to vacate; Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should have gone, as the economic growth was now minus-8%; and Home Minister Amit Shah should have stepped down as naxal attacks and mob lynchings continued “unabated”. “If performance and governance were the criteria, then the first person to be sacked should be the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, for he has brought the government, the entire country to a standstill, progress, peace and harmony has been thrown in the dustbin of history and the present Prime Minister would be remembered as an autocrat...,” Mr. Surjewala added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vardhan-made-scapegoat-congress/article35204583.ece
08 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||Caste and regional balance decided nominees from U.P.||Seven leaders from Uttar Pradesh were inducted into the Union Cabinet, reflecting the ruling BJP’s focus on its targeted constituencies of non-Yadav OBC and non-Jatav Dalits ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls. The seven who took oath as Ministers of State included Anupriya Patel, president of the Apna Dal (Sonelal), a key ally. Ms. Patel, 40, is an MP from Mirzapur, adjoining Varanasi, and hails from the Kurmi backward caste, one of the dominant non-Yadav OBCs traditionally associated with farming. Apna Dal has nine MLAs and one MLC, her husband Ashish Patel. Mr. Patel was also a Minister in the first Modi government. Her induction, however, did not go well with the BJP’s second ally, the Nishad Party, which has for weeks been demanding a promotion in either the State government or the Central government. The Nishad Party claims to be the voice of the riverine OBC castes. “Our people are already angry and it reflected in the recent panchayat polls result. Some infiltrators [in the BJP] want Nishads to get enraged and the BJP’s boat to sink,” Nishad Party president Sanjay Nishad told The Hindu . “Our community will be compelled to come out on the streets again in a democratic way,” he said, adding that the negative reaction among the Nishads would prove to be a setback for the BJP in 2022. The seven new Ministers reflected caste and regional necessities of the BJP, with the induction of a Brahmin from central-north U.P., two Kurmis from Purvanchal, one Lodh from Rohilkhand, one Kori from Bundelkhand, one Pasi from Awadh and one Dhangar from Braj. Kaushal Kishor, a two-time MP from Mohanlaganj, heads the party’s SC/ST wing and is seen as its Pasi face. Pasis are the second largest Dalit community in U.P. after Jatavs and are numerically concentrated in Awadh and Purvanchal. Mr. Kishor is known for his ground activism for Dalits. While congratulating Mr. Kishor, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the MP has “always been active on issues of social justice”. S.P.S Baghel, who belongs to the Gaderia-Dhangar community, traditionally associated with livestock breeding, won the reserved seat (SC) of Agra in Lok Sabha 2019. Mr. Baghel served as a Minister in the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet for two years after winning from Tundla Assembly in 2017. Six-time Maharajganj MP Pankaj Chaudhary, a Kurmi, was also inducted to the Union Council of Ministers. Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma, a five-time MP from Jalaun, and Kori by caste, was the choice from the backward region of Bundelkhand. B.L. Verma, a first-time Rajya Sabha member who belongs to the Lodh OBC caste, took oath as Minister of State. Ajay Mishra, MP from Kheri, was inducted at a time the dominant Brahmin community is seeking more representation in power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inductions-from-up-reflect-bjps-focus-on-caste-equations/article35204581.ece

She said as soon as she turned after opening the door, he overpowered her and dragged her to a room. Meanwhile, two others, later identified as Raju’s friends Rakesh and Suraj, entered the house and approached Ms. Kitty who was in another room. They allegedly smothered her with a pillow. “The articles and cash that are missing are yet to be ascertained. At least three bags are missing and a few briefcases were open at the spot,” the officer said. After the accused left, Mithila managed to free herself and call her brother-in-law. Sources said she would also be examined. Mr. Singh said a team went to Raju’s residence in Bhanwar Singh Camp, from where he was arrested. He reportedly told the police that he was familiar with the house because he was a regular there and he told this to Rakesh and Suraj. He said he had known Rakesh for a year and Suraj for eight years. “A bag was recovered on Raju’s instance, but it had nothing but clothes. It appears that the other two planned to fool him,” Mr. Singh said. On Wednesday afternoon, Rakesh was also arrested. Ms. Kitty is survived by her son Rangarajan Mohan Kumaramangalam, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee working president and a resident of Bengaluru, and daughter Ruchira. Rangarajan Mohan Kumaramangalam noted with pain that his mother died on his birthday. “The most independent and powerful woman I knew, the one who taught me right from wrong, who raised me to be who I am, who suffered through my pain, laughed loudest for my joy, loved me unconditionally, left this realm on the date she gave birth to me,” he tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pr-kumaramangalams-wife-murdered-at-home/article35204386.ece
08 July 2021||New Delhi,||PTI challenges new IT rules in Delhi court||India’s largest news agency, Press Trust of India (PTI), has approached the Delhi High Court, challenging the 2021 Information Technology (IT) Rules. It said the Central government was attempting to regulate digital news media. A bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice J.R. Midha issued notice to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting on the petition. The court tagged the plea to be heard along with similar petitions filed by several online news outlets against the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 on August 20. Ethics code questioned PTI has challenged the constitutional validity of the rules as it purports to regulate ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’, particularly digital news portals, by imposing “sweeping” government oversight and a vaguely worded ‘Code of Ethics’. ‘Era of fear’ The petitioner argued that the new IT Rules would “usher in an era of surveillance and fear, thereby resulting in self-censorship, which results in abridgement/ violation of Fundamental Rights as enshrined under Part III of the Constitution of India.” The rules was notified on February 25, 2021. PTI said the rules enabled the government to “virtually dictate content to digital news portals, and squarely violate media freedom”. The High Court is already seized of similar pleas by major online news portals such as The Wire , The News Minute , Alt News , and the Quint Digital Media Ltd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pti-challenges-new-it-rules-in-delhi-court/article35204397.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indemnity issues hold up U.S. vaccine donation||More than a month after the U.S. announced the donation of 80 million doses of American-made COVID-19 vaccines to dozens of countries including India, and Vice-President Kamala Harris called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convey the decision, the vaccines are being held up by regulatory issues over indemnity, Indian and U.S. officials confirmed. According to the officials, the demand by the U.S. companies, including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson, to be granted an indemnity or waiver of liability has yet to be resolved, which is also holding up the donations from the U.S. Since June 3, the U.S. has already distributed 40 million doses to about 12 countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Legal provisions “The delay is not from the U.S. side,” an American Embassy spokesperson said to queries about the fact that the shipments are yet to be announced. “India has determined that it needs further time to review legal provisions related to accepting vaccine donations. Once India works through its legal process, our donation will proceed expeditiously.” The MEA declined to comment on the issue, directing queries to the Ministry of Health. Health Secretary Bharat Bhushan told The Hindu that the “specific provisions of indemnification are still under discussion”, indicating that not only are the U.S. vaccine donations on hold for the moment, but casting a cloud over the delivery of Moderna vaccines, which have already received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) in India, of which the first consignment was due to arrive this week. During his visit to the U.S. in May, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had met pharma company executives and U.S. business chambers who had conveyed concerns about India’s request for them to provide vaccines without receiving indemnity in case of side effects. The indemnity would be used as a legal defence to protect the U.S. firms, which have pointed out that they cannot take responsibility for cold-chain lapses and transportation problems within India. “Yes, liability issues remain unresolved,” confirmed one official involved in the negotiations, adding that the ‘dilemma’ on the Indian side is that if the U.S. companies are given indemnities, all vaccine makers, including Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Sputnik, would also demand them. Last month, the U.S. announced the distribution of 80 million doses as part of its “COVID-19 Global Response and Recovery Framework”. Indian officials had estimated that India’s share would total not more than a mere 2 million doses, less than half of its daily disbursal of vaccines, but said the donation was important as it made more types of vaccines available to Indians.

Jaishankar travelled to Tehran on Thursday, and called on Iranian President-elect Ebrahim Raisi, a month before he assumes office. Mr. Jaishankar, who made a transit halt in Tehran on his way to Moscow for bilateral consultations, handed over a personal message to Mr. Raisi from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and also met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. “Appreciate [Mr. Raisi’s] warm sentiments for India. Deeply value his strong commitment to strengthen our bilateral ties and expand cooperation on regional and global issues,” Mr. Jaishankar tweeted after his meeting, which was the first such call on Mr. Raisi by a foreign dignitary since he won the presidential poll on June 19, Indian officials said.  “I am sure this visit will be the basic basis for Iran-India relations during the Presidency of Ayatollah Raisi,” said Rasoul Mousavi, a senior diplomat in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, describing Mr. Jaishankar’s meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-calls-on-iranian-president-elect/article35204644.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Cabinet reshuffle attempts inclusion||BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav will be the new Environment and Labour Minister, replacing Mr. Gangwar, who quit on Wednesday, and the Ministry of External Affairs will have three Ministers of State — V. Muraleedharan and new inductees Meenakshi Lekhi and Rajkumar Ranjan Singh. Political signalling With Wednesday’s inclusions, the government now has a record 12 Ministers belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 27 belonging to the Other Backward Classes, eight Ministers belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and five Ministers belonging to the minority communities, including one Muslim, one Christian, one Sikh and two Buddhists. Women Ministers number 11 in the Modi government, with two Cabinet Ministers and others being Ministers of State. “The spread of the Council of Ministers has been to reflect not just marginalised sections of society but also marginalised regions like the northeast with a Minister each from Tripura [Pratima Bhowmick] and Manipur [Rajkumar Ranjan Singh], a Cabinet Minister [Virendra Kumar] from Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh, et al,” said a government source. Women emerged as a significant vote bank for the BJP in the general elections and in the Bihar Assembly poll, and therefore form a sizeable presence in the government. This sense of inclusion is tinged with the need to beef up the governance deficit that emerged especially during the second wave of the pandemic. Former Chief Ministers Mr. Sonowal and Narayan Rane, have been made Cabinet Ministers and those with experience in State governments like Purushottam Rupala and long-term MPs like Virender Singh, a six-term MP, have been included. Former bureaucrat and Odisha MP Ashwini Vaishnaw was included as a Cabinet Minister and gets the Railway portfolio. The current government has 13 lawyers, six doctors, five engineers, seven civil servants, seven Ph.D.s and three MBAs along with 68 Ministers with graduate degrees. Like all reshuffles, this one too made a significant nod to the States going to polls next year, with Uttar Pradesh getting seven ministerial berths, taking its tally in the Council of Ministers to 14. Uttarakhand saw the inclusion of Ajay Bhatt; for Punjab, the elevation of Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri was a nod to Sikh sentiments; and Manipur got Rajkumar Ranjan Singh in a Minister of State berth. Gujarat, which goes to polls a little later in 2022, got two Cabinet berths with Mr. Mansukh Mandaviya and Mr. Purushottam Rupala’s elevation, and a Minister of State berth for Darshana Jardosh, MP from Surat. With the inclusion of four Ministers — Nishith Pramanik, John Barla, Subhash Sarkar and Shantanu Thakur, Mr. Modi established that West Bengal would continue to be important as a political project for the BJP. The inclusion of Maratha strongman Mr. Rane proved the same for Maharashtra, with the portends of a peaceful relationship between the Centre and the Maha Vikas Aghadi-led Maharashtra government not very sunny.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cabinet-reshuffle-attempts-inclusion/article35204400.ece

No clue was given to me as to the fact that the petitioner had already approached the Hon’ble Acting Chief Justice for reassignment of the petition,” the Judge said. In the 13-page order, Justice Chanda referred to tweets by leaders of the State’s ruling party, and as well as statements in public, and said that a “deliberate and conscious attempt was made to influence my decision before the recusal application was placed before me for judicial consideration on June 24, 2021”. While recusing himself from hearing the case, Justice Chanda said he had “no personal inclination to hear out the case of the petitioner. I had no hesitation in taking up the case, either”. “I have, however, decided to recuse myself from this case for a different reason.” The Judge also stated, “The imbroglio stemmed from the inception of the litigation was due to the assignment of this case before this Bench. Since the two persons involved in this case belong to the highest echelon of the State politics, in the name of saving the judiciary, some opportunists have already emerged. These trouble-mongers will try to keep the controversy alive and create newer controversies. The trial of the case before this Bench will be a tool to aggrandise themselves. It would be contrary to the interest of justice if such unwarranted squabble continues along with the trial of the case, and such attempts should be thwarted at the threshold.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/judge-recuses-from-mamatas-election-case/article35204402.ece
08 July 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Placating Patidars before the 2022 poll||The elevation of two junior Ministers to the Cabinet rank and the induction of three MPs as junior Ministers from Gujarat in the Union government appears to be part of the ruling BJP’s strategy to give representation to the Patidars and the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) ahead of next year’s Assembly election. Mansukh Mandavia and Parshottam Rupala, both belonging to the powerful Patidar community, were sworn in as Cabinet Ministers. Both are Rajya Sabha members and hail from the politically important Saurashtra region. In fact, Mr. Mandavia is often seen as a chief ministerial contender if the party decides to replace Vijay Rupani. Both have been openly demanding that the next Chief Minister should be from the community. Naresh Patel, another community leader with a substantial base, also demanded so. After his statement, several Patidar leaders have joined the Aam Admi Party (AAP), which wants to emerge as an alternative to the BJP. In Surat, leading businessman and influential Patidar leader Mahesh Savani joined the AAP, while several others are said to be contemplating to do so. In a move seen as an attempt to woo the OBCs, Devusinh Chauhan, Darshana Jordosh and Dr. Mahendra Munjpara, MPs of Kheda, Surat and Surendranagar seats respectively, have been accommodated as Ministers of State. Mr. Chauhan and Ms. Jordosh are two-term MPs, while Dr. Munjapara is a first-timer. In Gujarat, the BJP won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in the parliamentary polls in 2019 and holds eight of the 11 Rajya Sabha seats. The BJP picked up a senior tribal leader, Mangubhai Patel, as Governor of Madhya Pradesh. Mr. Mangubhai has been a six-time legislator and former Minister of Environment and Forest and Tribal Development in Gujarat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/placating-patidars-before-the-2022-battle/article35204577.ece
08 July 2021||Kolkata,||West Bengal gets its highest share ever||The BJP has tried to cater to different regions and ethnicities of West Bengal while inducting four of its MPs in the Union Council of Ministers on Wednesday. This is the highest-ever representation from the State in any government of the BJP. The four MPs who were sworn in as Union Ministers are: two from south Bengal, Santanu Thakur and Subhas Sarkar, and two from north Bengal, John Barla and Nisith Pramanik. While Mr. Thakur, MP from Bongaon, is a leader of the Matua sect (Hindu refugees from Bangladesh settled along the bordering regions of the State), Mr. Barla, MP from Alipurduar, is a tribal leader with considerable influence over the tea gardens. A few days ago, he had highlighted the south-north divide by raising the demand of a separate State or Union Territory for north Bengal. Mr. Pramanik, a young MP from Cooch Behar, represents the Rajbanshi community, while Mr. Sarkar, MP from Bankura and a trained medical practitioner, represents the tribal dominated Jangalmahal region in the southwestern part of the State. Those inducted in the Union Cabinet from the State are MPs who have been elected for the first time in 2019. The BJP had done combatively well in the regions represented by these MPs in the recent Assembly election. It won most of the Assembly seats in Cooch Behar and Alipurduar district. Compared to other regions of south Bengal, it won more seats in the Matua-dominated area of Bongaon subdivision and the Jangalmahal region. The regions represented by the four MPs are economically deprived areas. Sources in the West Bengal BJP said the MPs had been given a chance where the party thinks its support base has remained intact and there was a likelihood of retaining the seats in 2024. “It is a part of the future planning of the BJP, where MPs representing different regions and ethnicities have been inducted in the Union Council of Ministers,” Biswanath Chakraborty, a political observer, said. The BJP won 18 of the 42 seats in the 2019 general election. The BJP has dropped Ministers of State Babul Surpriyo and Deboshree Chowdhury from the Council of Ministers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/west-bengal-gets-its-highest-share-ever/article35204584.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Ashtavakra, great scholar||Prakarana granthas are texts written by preceptors and gurus to introduce beginners to Vedanta study and to clarify Vedanta knowledge to those already familiar with it. For instance, Adi Sankara’s Viveka Chudamani, Satasloki, come under this category. Likewise Ashtavakra Samhita, known as Ashtavakra Gita, attributed to one Ashtavakra, a sage with exceptional scholarship, is classified as a Prakarana grantha. This text presents an interesting exposition of self knowledge or atma tatva jnana, and is in the form of a dialogue between the young preceptor and king Janaka of Mithila, pointed out Sri R. Rajagopala Sarma in a discourse. Janaka is a celebrated Raja rishi and in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna quotes him as one who is a realised soul and a jivanmukta who is also an example of a karma yogi. Many stories are quoted about Ashtavakra who hails from a family of Vedic scholars. He was born to Sujatha, the daughter of Uddalaka, the famed teacher in the Upanishads, and Kahola, a disciple of Uddalaka. By the age of twelve, he had completed Vedic studies. The name Ashtavakra refers to the crooked frame that he developed in his mother’s womb owing to his sensitive reactions to the slips in his father’s Veda chanting. That he impressed people, including Janaka, with his sastra knowledge despite his crooked appearance and young age is evident from the incident at Janaka’s court. Janaka, who was immersed in Vedantic thought, used to invite scholars and rishis to his court to engage in debates and discussions on many important and interesting esoteric ideas on Brahman, Self, the path to realisation, and so on. It is held that in one such debate, his father Kahola was defeated by another scholar named Vandi. So, Ashtavakra wished to give a fitting reply to Vandi and did so in a remarkable debate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ashtavakra-great-scholar/article35204596.ece

A Bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari directed the government amidst submissions made by advocate Prashant Bhushan, for activist Anjali Bhardwaj that “party acolytes” and bureaucrats have been appointed to the CIC in an opaque manner despite a specific direction from the court in 2019 that the appointment process should be transparent and has to be put in the public domain. Mr. Bhushan referred to the dissent note of the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, a member of the Selection Committee comprising the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, on the recommendations made by the Search Committee. “It is shocking that the dissent note was not put on record,” Mr. Bhushan submitted. Additional Solicitor General Madhavi Divan said the government had fully complied with the Supreme Court direction and filed a compliance-cum-status report on April 24 last year. ‘Mention latest position’ “More than a year has passed since your report … Let us know the latest position and then we will take a call,” Justice Nazeer addressed Ms. Divan. Ms. Divan agreed to do so but said Mr. Bhushan should file an affidavit spelling out his allegations of “bogus” appointment to the CIC. “We will respond to the allegations one by one,” she said. Mr. Bhushan said more than 300 people had applied for Information Commissioner posts. “But a person who had not even applied has been appointed… Meanwhile, pendency of the cases in the CIC has grown to 36,000. The RTI Act is being destroyed,” he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/give-details-on-information-commission-sc-tells-govt/article35204391.ece

The school, which had minimal admissions until last year, has tripled its enrolment this time, thanks to their efforts. Speaking to The Hindu , Block Education Officer Mathalai Raj said the school had only up to 20 children enrolling each year, but this time the number had gone up to 64. The two teachers in the school and local youth who studied there lent a hand in promoting the importance of education. “The school, constructed in 1935, has seen many young children grow up into responsible adults. Over the years, it has lost importance and has seen only about 20 children a year. We have made a choice to change that," he said. A. Ramadoss, a teacher at the school, has been credited for the change. “He has spent time going from home to home to raise awareness among parents. He printed leaflets and went door-to-door to create awareness and the youth joined him,” Mr. Raj recalled. The school was under the threat of shutting down a few years ago. “It is a small building and had very few students. However, due to the efforts of the teachers, the condition has improved,” he pointed out. This year alone, the school saw thrice the number of enrolments. “We hope this streak continues. I have been asked to send a report on the increase in admissions and how we did it. Hope we can emulate the model elsewhere," he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/record-enrolment-at-sendurai-school-thanks-to-teachers-local-youth/article35204874.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy ordered that notices should be issued to the encroachers under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachments Act, 2007. The government was also directed to aggressively defend litigations, if any, resorted to by the encroachers challenging the action taken by it to evict them from the waterbody. The court insisted upon ensuring adequate safeguards, including deployment of personnel, to keep a watch on the waterbody, and make sure that no further encroachments take place in the future. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition, filed by non-governmental organisation Arappor Iyakkam in 2019, complaining about largescale encroachments on the sprawling waterbody that helps maintain the ecology and groundwater levels. When the case was heard last in April, the government reported to the court that it had found 403 encroachments and taken steps to evict all of them but some encroachers had obtained interim stay from single judges of the court. Time sought The government sought a couple of months to clear all the encroachments. However, when the case was taken up on Wednesday, it was reported that the encroachments could not be evicted due to the lockdown imposed to fight the second wave of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/clear-encroachments-in-chitlapakkam-lake-hc/article35204772.ece
08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cases of vascular issues high in post-COVID patients: doctors||A number of patients who had undergone treatment for COVID-19 are being diagnosed with vascular complications at the post-COVID clinic of the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital (RGGGH). Though this was a cause for concern, doctors said that proper follow-up, early detection of symptoms and timely medical help would prevent complications. Vascular complications in patients during the post-COVID period were not new. According to doctors, there were patients who developed vascular complications in the first wave too. But now, the cases were slightly more in a shorter duration, and severity was high with more involvement of the arteries. Multiple symptoms E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said around 2,500 people had been attended to by the post-COVID clinic till now. “We are receiving many patients with vascular complications. If we miss the symptoms early, it will lead to complications. We have seen patients with limb ischemia, mesenteric artery occlusion presenting as acute abdominal pain and pulmonary embolism,” he added. In the post-COVID clinic, the hospital has received 182 patients with vascular complications. “We have seen vascular complications in both waves. While there were 90 patients in the first wave during the one-year period, we have seen 92 patients in the last few months of the second wave. The severity is more. In the first wave, we had more patients with clots in their veins compared to the second wave — a condition called deep vein thrombosis. Now, we are seeing more involvement of the arteries,” N. Sritharan, professor and director of the Institute of Vascular Surgery, RGGGH, said. He added that in the post-COVID period, any swelling in the legs and severe pain should not be ignored. The pain would be unbearable, and as a result, persons would not be able to sleep. This means that they need to get immediate medical help, he said. Lack of awareness “There is no awareness among patients and some of them ignore the early symptoms. Some come to the hospital in advanced stages, in which there is discolouration of skin or gangrene. The first six hours of symptoms are crucial as we need to restore blood circulation,” he explained. Dr. Sritharan added that they were able to save the legs of many patients as they were better prepared to tackle emergencies. “We now have a better understanding of the disease process, and the treatment protocols have evolved. We have set up a separate ward for patients with vascular complications. Postgraduates of the department monitor patients round-the-clock. This has helped in better treatment outcomes,” he said. Dr. Theranirajan said a few patients, who had undergone renal transplant, had developed nephropathy as a result of vascular complications. “Apart from vascular complications, we are seeing patients with neurological complications and myocardial infarction in the post-COVID period. Myocardial infarction seems to be predominant in a number of them,” he said. This was why doctors stressed on the need for patients to come for a review after 28 days, he said, adding: “At the post-COVID clinic, they can consult with doctors of various specialities and get tested as per their symptoms. We check for rhythm disturbances, lipid profile and fibrosis in the lungs. In case of symptoms of vascular complications, a Doppler Study is done. It is important to exclude symptoms and undergo a complete medical check-up,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cases-of-vascular-issues-high-in-post-covid-patients-doctors/article35204778.ece
08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK swings into damage control||The AIADMK leadership on Wednesday cleared the air over its relationship with the BJP, stating that the alliance, which was formed for the Assembly election, continued. AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami issued a joint statement, setting forth their position, hours after former Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam caused a controversy by saying the alliance with the BJP had alienated the minorities, leading to the AIADMK’s defeat. “Let us stand by each other and strive for the progress of Tamil Nadu. Let there be no need for any doubt among anyone at any point of time on this matter,” the joint statement said, without naming the BJP or any other ally. On Tuesday, Mr. Shanmugam, the AIADMK’s Villupuram (North) secretary, said at a meeting of workers at Vanur that though the AIADMK government had implemented several welfare schemes in the last 10 years and “earned a good name among people”, all calculations went wrong owing to a combination of factors, including the alliance and the minority vote. “Had this [alliance] not been the case, the DMK would not have been in power today. Even if it had come to power accidentally, it would have only been a coalition government,” he said. Referring to the Villupuram Assembly constituency, he said it had about 20,000 minority voters, 18,000 of them in Villupuram town alone. However, the party lost the support of the minorities because of its alliance with the BJP. In the morning, the BJP reacted strongly to Mr. Shanmugam’s remarks. Thereafter, former Fisheries Minister and AIADMK organisation secretary D. Jayakumar said Mr. Shanmugam’s comments reflected an “indoor and off-the-record” discussion, and they merited no reaction. In their statement, Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK lost the election “by a narrow margin” and yet, people still had their “affection” for it. They said that it was because of the “overwhelming support” of people that 75 candidates of the AIADMK-led front were now members of the Assembly. This marked a “commendation” of the AIADMK’s rule which had “worked for the progress and bright future” of the State over the last 10 years. In the afternoon, Mr. Panneerselvam took to Twitter, seeking to put a lid on the debate, asserting that his party’s alliance with the BJP would continue, “given national interest and also the welfare of Tamil Nadu”. He emphasised that “there is no second opinion on this [the relationship between the AIADMK and the BJP]”. Furthermore, his party had “full faith” in the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Panneerselvam’s response came barely a few hours before the Union Cabinet was reshuffled. Sources in the AIADMK said that though the leadership did not make any formal request to the BJP for a berth, the names of Rajya Sabha member M. Thambi Durai and Theni Lok Sabha member P. Ravindhranath did the rounds. (Eventually, L. Murugan of the BJP was inducted). Earlier, asked whether the party would take any disciplinary action against Mr. Shanmugam, as demanded by BJP leader K.T. Raghavan, Mr. Jayakumar replied that no one had “the right to dictate terms” to the AIADMK on such a matter.  Let us stand by each other and strive for the progress of Tamil Nadu. Let there be no need for any doubt among anyone at any point of time on this matter O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K.

08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Madras High Court invites suggestions on weeding out fake journalists||The Madras High Court on Wednesday invited press clubs and genuine individual journalists in the State to come up with suggestions on restoring the image of the media by weeding out fake journalists who indulge in blackmailing and other illegal money making activities. Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan said the suggestions could be made in the court on July 14. The judges made it clear that they shall pass comprehensive orders on the issue of creating a committee to identify bogus journalists after hearing all stakeholders concerned. The judges had taken up the task of cleansing the media of the black sheep during the hearing of a writ petition filed in 2019 by S. Sekaran who claimed to be a journalist. He had accused former Idol Wing CID head A.G. Ponn Manickavel of having misled the court on recovery of stolen idols. Denying the accusation in toto, the former police officer’s counsel V. Selvaraj told the court that the petitioner was not a genuine journalist. The court also, on inquiry, found that the writ petitioner was in possession of multiple identity cards to claim himself to be a reporter. Hence, the court wanted him to appear through video call and explain his stand. However, the petitioner did not appear on Tuesday and instead sent a representation to Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee requesting him to list the case before some other Division Bench. On Tuesday, the petitioner’s counsel Lita Srinivasan told the court that her client had sent the representation to the Chief Justice without her knowledge and that she was not interested in representing him before the court any more. She, however, agreed to convey the message that the court wants him to appear on July 14. During the course of hearing of the case, Justice Kirubakaran said people were highly dependent upon journalists for credible news and information and therefore they should not end up getting misled by bogus journalists who write articles to extort money. The senior judge also disapproved of the practice of many retired journalists continuing to hold sway in press clubs and “changing their colours according to the political party that assumes power”. Advocate Gautam S. Raman, representing six journalists who had got themselves impleaded in the case, told the court that he had already submitted a statement of recommendations and that may be taken in to consideration while passing orders in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-invites-suggestions-on-weeding-out-fake-journalists/article35204797.ece
08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Zero waste plan stalled due to poor public cooperation||The Greater Chennai Corporation’s ambitious plan to go zero waste by the end of the year looks distant now. The civic body, which is in the process of creating several solid waste management infrastructure facilities to clear legacy, dry and wet waste and construction debris, has been able to achieve only 42% of source segregation as of now, even while succeeding in collecting 95% of household waste through door-to-door operations using two private conservancy agencies. The lack of cooperation from residents, commercial establishments and bulk waste generators (BWG) has stymied the civic body’s agenda to achieve 100% source segregation. The city, on average, generates around 5,000 tonnes of waste daily, comprising wet and dry waste. A senior official of the Corporation said unless there was cooperation from all stakeholders, zero waste management would only remain on paper. Despite having the provision to penalise those failing to segregate garbage under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the civic body is facing difficulties in implementing it fully as it looks to be a politically sensitive issue, a senior official added. The Solid Waste Management Bylaws, 2019, also stated it was the responsibility of the generator of wastes to cooperate with the municipal authority concerned by avoiding littering and source segregating the wastes. While the bylaws clearly give authority, civic officials cited the inability of local officials, including conservancy inspectors, to penalise violators, besides issuing hollow warnings. The official also complained about the return of single-use plastic, the usage of which has been banned. Taking into consideration the sensitivity of penalising individual households, the Corporation is finalising a strategy to make at least BWGs, who number around 2,000, to fall in line towards 100% source segregation. BWGs are those places which generate more than 100 kg of waste per day. The civic body has appointed 23 service providers for wet waste processing, four for dry waste processing and nine for processing both kinds, and has published the details on the Corporation website. BWGs, which lack in-house waste processing, should utilise these service providers. The official said the last time the civic body tried to crack the whip on using and throwing one time plastic waste was in November, but this was stopped midway owing to the Assembly election. He said during that period, the civic body conducted more than 4.5 lakh inspections/raids, and seized 318 metric tonnes of banned plastic. They also collected fines of Rs. 1.3 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/zero-waste-plan-stalled-due-to-poor-public-cooperation/article35204780.ece

Based on the directions of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, the State Transport Department is taking steps to fix boards containing verses from the works of Tamil poet Tiruvalluvar, along with their meanings, in the 19,700-strong fleet of buses, belonging to the eight State Transport Corporations (STCs), including the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC). In a press release, Transport Minister R.S. Rajakannappan said the job of fixing the Tirukkural boards would be completed within 10 days. Mr. Rajakannappan also pointed out that with the inter- and intra-district travel having been allowed from Monday, 14,215 buses were being operated, while 2,100 inter-State buses still remained non-operational. Electric switchover He said as the diesel price had been increasing day by day, and the STCs were suffering a loss of around Rs. 33,000 crore, the State Transport Department was planning to switch over to electric buses. However, the cost of electric buses was five times higher than the cost of diesel buses. The department was taking all steps to create the necessary infrastructure, including charging stations, for operating the electric buses in the State, and the work would be completed within six months. Free bus rides Mr. Rajakannappan said the free bus rides for women, transpersons and differently abled persons and their companions, had been well received, with the MTC permitting the free rides in over 1,550 ordinary buses out of its operating fleet of 3,250 buses.

Stalin has directed officials of the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department to regularly inspect the local areas for supply of water, clearing of garbage and repairs to street-lights. He advised senior officials of the department, which also oversees the Greater Chennai Corporation, to visit the localities between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. The directions were issued at a review meeting held on June 30.

08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anti-incumbency was a liability for us, says BJP||Former Law Minister C. Ve. Shanmugam’s statement that the AIADMK lost in the Assembly election because of its alliance with the BJP, “which alienated the minorities”, has taken BJP leaders in Tamil Nadu unit by surprise. While they said the alliance would not be affected by his statement, some said the anti-incumbency sentiment had become a liability for the national party. BJP State general secretary K.T. Raghavan said his party lost in many seats owing to the anti-incumbency sentiment against the AIADMK government. ‘Not right’ “We are ruling at the Centre and won 303 seats [in the 2019 Lok Sabha election], including the Muslim-dominated Meerut. We are in power in many States that have a minority population. The minorities have voted for the BJP. These statements made by Mr. Shanmugam are not right. In fact, the anti-incumbency sentiment against the AIADMK was a liability for us,” he told The Hindu.  According to him, many of the Prime Minister’s good works and achievements were undone by the anti-incumbency sentiment, and it contributed to the BJP’s defeat in many seats. He said a senior leader and a former Minister should not have made such statements and it was incumbent upon the AIADMK leadership of Edappadi K. Palaniswami and O. Panneerselvam to “control him”. ‘Good relations’ BJP vice-president K. Annamalai said his party had been dealing with the AIADMK’S coordinator and co-coordinator. “Both have had very good relations with our party, and both parties worked hard for each other’s candidates. That is a fact,” Mr. Annamalai said. He said the BJP did not collaborate with Mr. Shanmugam during the election. “We have been speaking to EPS [Mr. Palaniswami] and OPS [Mr. Panneerselvam]. I don’t think his statement will affect the local bodies elections,” he said. Kushboo Sundar, who contested from Thousand Lights, shared a news report on Mr. Shanmugam’s remarks and tweeted: “Actually it’s the other way around”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anti-incumbency-was-a-liability-for-us-says-bjp/article35204763.ece

08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Categorical stand ends spat between AIADMK and BJP||The categorical statement by the AIADMK leadership on Wednesday evening on the continuance of the alliance headed by it, worked out at the time of the Assembly election, appears to have brought to an end the spat between the AIADMK and the BJP. Though the AIADMK’s strongman from Villupuram and former Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam identifying the tie-up with the national party as one of the reasons for the Dravidian party’s defeat in the Assembly poll was not a surprise to many in the party, he is the first prominent figure in the AIADMK to speak out on the matter. This was followed by State BJP leader K.T. Raghavan’s sharp response, blaming the regional party for the defeat and the AIADMK’s organisation secretary D. Jayakumar’s reaction. The development comes in the backdrop of the AIADMK calling a meeting of secretaries of all district units for Friday to discuss matters such as the organisational elections, preparedness for the local bodies elections, the strategy to be adopted to face litigation against office-bearers of the party and the measures to contain the influence of former interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala over party members. Gaining ground There is a view among certain sections that after having lost power, the party does not stand to “gain much” by breaking its ties with the BJP. Under the given circumstances, it requires at least someone to lean on, the role of which can be played by the national party. Besides, if the “Sasikala factor” becomes a challenge, the AIADMK needs the support of a party like the BJP to defend itself. But some others feel that the party can hope to regain the goodwill of a section of the minorities during the proposed elections to the rural local bodies in nine districts, if it declares that its relationship with the BJP is over at the time of the local bodies polls. The AIADMK leadership has decided, at least for the time being, to make it clear that there is no going back on its relationship with the national party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/categorical-stand-ends-spat-between-aiadmk-and-bjp/article35204768.ece

Nagar this week, police personnel of the Special Wing for Crime against Women and Children are on the lookout for the 23-year-old bridegroom. Earlier, on June 28, the police stopped another child marriage at a temple in Kasimedu. The girl was pregnant and the 20-year-old, who was about to marry her, was arrested. In the same area, the police stopped another child marriage in May, and arrested the youth for raping the victim. As many as 18 cases were registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, in the city limits in the past month. The accused and family members, who harboured them, were also arrested. The victims have been sheltered or reunited with their parents, said a senior police officer. Kanya Babu, co-founder, All India Movement for Service, said, “We keep receiving reports about child marriages from slum and resettlement areas. The police should effectively punish parents who solemnise child marriages. Awareness programmes should be conducted in these areas.” “Retaining children in school is the only solution. Due to the lockdown, schools have been closed for nearly 15 months, and parents with poor backgrounds treat girl children as a burden and look to shift responsibility. If schools are functional, a friend or teacher may notify authorities,” said Andrew Sesuraj, convener of the Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch.

08 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Russian boy undergoes bilateral lung transplant after 3 years||After being kept on a ventilator for three years, a four-year-old boy from Russia, diagnosed with fibrosing alveolitis, a condition in which there is progressive scarring of the lungs, underwent bilateral lung transplant at MGM Healthcare. The boy, Nazar Dianov, was diagnosed with the disease when he was two months old. He was put on a ventilator as his oxygen saturation was extremely low. He underwent tracheostomy at six months in Russia, and was airlifted to the hospital in the city in 2018 for further treatment. Last December, a 20-member team led by K.R. Balakrishnan, chairman and director of cardiac sciences and director of the Heart and Lung Transplant Programme, performed the bilateral lung transplant on him. Suresh Rao K.G., co-director of the Heart and Lung Transplantation Programme and Mechanical Circulatory Support, said the boy was kept on a ventilator for three years as they tried to find a suitable donor organ for him. The family of a two-year-old boy from Surat, who was declared brain dead, came forward to donate his organs. After allocation, the organ was airlifted to the city and transplanted to Mr. Dianov. The hospital claimed that the boy was one of Asia’s youngest recipients to undergo bilateral lung transplant. “The child was put in a ventilator till four years of age. Keeping a child in the intensive care unit is not an easy task. Another aspect is that the transplant was done during the pandemic. We had to prevent the transmission of infection to the recipient and healthcare workers,” he said. The success, Dr. Balakrishnan said, was largely due to the excellent nurses in the State. “His parents had the fortitude to wait three years in a foreign country. The size of a child’s chest is very small, and we cannot use adult organs. This is why we had to wait a long time. Three years was a very long period, and even more difficult in paediatric cases,” he said. Many challenges The doctors noted that there were many challenges during these years as the child suffered from lung infections, fever and desaturation. Dr. Balakrishnan said the challenge now was that the boy had not spoken at all due to the tracheostomy. “He is getting rehabilitated. Speech therapy and language learning must be done,” he added. Harish Manian, chief executive officer, MGM Healthcare, stressed on the need for more awareness on organ donation.

Sources familiar with the development said, the Corporation began the swab collection drive right from Monday by deploying the mobile medical teams. Corporation health wing officials under the supervision of the zonal sanitary officers had deployed a few of the five mobile medical teams that the officers had at their disposal. The Corporation had assigned five teams each for the five zones. Each team comprising a lab technician and an assistant had been going around all the commercial areas – Oppanakara Street, Raja Street, Edayar Street, R.G. Street, Vysial Street, Cross Cut Road, 100 Feet Road, D.B. Road, T.V. Swamy Street, Trichy Road, Kalapatti Road among others – to lift samples from shop owners, managers or supervisors and employees. The swab collection drive aimed exclusively at shop keepers was a part of the over-all drive conducted across the city, the sources said and added that between 150 and 300 samples a zone were collected every day in the last three days. After completing a street in a commercial area, the teams would go around and return to the very street after a few days to continue the drive. If in the first round, the teams lifted samples from a set of workers, then in the second round they would collect from the others, the sources explained. And, if the samples were positive, the Corporation would follow the protocol it had followed in the past. Likewise, the Corporation had been lifting samples on almost every alternate day from the vegetable markets in the city, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-lifts-swab-samples-from-shopkeepers/article35204806.ece

Road, R.S. Puram, the Coimbatore Corporation has dug it. The Corporation had thrown open the road on February 24 after investing Rs. 27 crore to develop the 1.80 km stretch, just days ahead of the Election Commission of India imposing the Model Code of Conduct. The Corporation had taken it up as a model road under the Smart Cities Mission project saying it would be a world class road where it would take underneath all utility lines, relay new sewer lines to replace old, worn out pipes and redesign platforms to make it pedestrian-friendly. As the Corporation started work on the southern side, it also replaced the old underground sewer line saying that new lines would eliminate the need for digging roads in the near future. But within months of replacing the sewer lines, the Corporation was forced to dig the road. Shopkeepers on D.B. Road said the civic body had dug the road at three places on that stretch that was north of the D.B. Road - T.V. Swamy Road junction to open the lids of the underground sewer chambers as two commercial establishments had complained of chokes in sewer lines. Corporation workers began work on Tuesday afternoon and had placed barricades near the dug places to caution road users, they added. They asked what had the Corporation achieved by investing Rs. 27 crore on D.B. Road if it had to dig the road the old way and that too within four months. It showed that the model road project was a failure or the Corporation had ill-executed the work or the quality was poor, the shopkeepers quipped. The Corporation officials did not answer calls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-digs-up-db-road-to-take-up-ugd-repair-work/article35204808.ece

Officials said that the 620 buses comprised 360 town buses and 260 mofussil buses.

08 July 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Threshold limits not set for 19 stack parameters in SIPCOT’||Environmentalists have complained that threshold limits have not been set up for 19 stack parameters for industries falling under the ‘Red’ category in the Cuddalore SIPCOT industrial complex, connected to the Centre for Accessing Real Time Air (Quality) Information Report (Care Air Centre) to assess real-time emission from factories. Though the Care Air Centre was set up in Cuddalore, a critically-polluted area a decade ago to monitor the ambient air quality, the lack of threshold limits for 19 stack parameters for industries in the ‘Red’ category has resulted in a regulatory vacuum. According to T. Arul Selvam, coordinator of SIPCOT Area Community Environmental Monitors (SACEM), an environmental watchdog, a reply received from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has revealed that for 19 stack parameters, no threshold limits were set by the Care Air Centre. Thresholds for stack emissions are norms that should have been set up in the first place to regulate emissions from industries. “When there is no threshold limit, critical pollutants may escape into the atmosphere impacting heavily on ambient pollution levels thereby affecting the health of vulnerable sections including newborn children, women, the elderly and the sick population. Lack of a threshold also means that there is no upper limit that can be used to hold polluting industries liable,” he also said. The fact that TNPCB had been merely collecting data without even setting thresholds that should enable the agency to hold industries accountable for when they emit pollutants at harmful levels clearly indicates a regulatory failure. This could potentially be a roadblock to a proper assessment of the air pollution levels, SACEM said. According to S. Ramanathan, former member of the Local Area Environment Committee, “The continuing high levels of pollution in Cuddalore is a cause for concern. Keen monitoring of the industries’ emissions by the regulatory bodies, especially TNPCB is the need of the hour to check air pollution levels.” Restricting emissions within safe standards mandated by law and protecting the environment and health of the people is the responsibility of the regulatory agencies, he said. Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) should be installed in all large/medium and polluting industries and connected to the servers of TNPCB and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The stack emission levels should be stringent than the existing standards in terms of the identified critical pollutants, SACEM said. When contacted, an official of the TNPCB said that the real time air quality of industries was being monitored round-the-clock and some of the parameters were available in the public domain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/threshold-limits-not-set-for-19-stack-parameters-in-sipcot/article35205173.ece

Under the Samagra Shiksha, a Centrally sponsored integrated scheme for School Education, a total of 28,215 school-going ST students studying in Classes 6 to 12 in government schools in Coimbatore, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Villupuram, Erode, The Nilgiris and Krishnagiri would be given special classes for two hours everyday by the Educational Volunteers (EVs) in their respective habitations, after school hours. The EVs would help students revise the lessons taught in schools and also play a role in their overall development. A group of four students would be provided a tablet computer to access the digital world. Students would also get nutritious snacks, physical education training and yoga. An official at the education department told The Hindu that though schools play a major role in ensuring the successful development of the students, learning environment and the area where the students live play a major role in determining their performance. “Students of hilly areas lack access to technology and migration of parents for jobs and other factors pose challenges to them,” the official said. The objective is to improve the transition rate of ST students and improve their higher education prospects, which will finally improve their socio-economic conditions, the official said. A sum of Rs. 18.31 crore has been proposed for the project, which is expected to be conducted from July to February 2022. Work is on to identify students in hilly areas and EVs, who would be paid a monthly remuneration of Rs. 6,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/evening-care-centres-to-uplift-tribal-students-in-10-districts/article35204910.ece
08 July 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||Farmers want Uzhavar Sandhai reopened||With bus service resumed and wholesale and retail vegetable markets started functioning from July 5, farmers urged the district administration to reopen the Uzhavar Sandhai in the district. Due to COVID-19 second wave, the market at Sampath Nagar and Periyar Nagar was shifted to the Government Girls Model Higher Secondary School at Panneerselvam Park and later it was closed. Since TNSTC bus services were not operated in May and June, farmers faced difficulty in selling their produce and were forced to sell their produce at a very low price to the middlemen. After the State government relaxed lockdown restrictions, buses were operated while the market that functioned temporarily at the VOC Park Ground was also re-opened. But, no announcement was made regarding reopening of uzhavar sandhai. Members of the Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association said that only farmers market, weekly sandhai and cattle sandhai were not allowed to function that affect the farmers directly. “Farmers sell their produce directly to the people at low price benefiting both. For the past two months, only middlemen were benefited”, they added. Since the sandhai at Sampath Nagar was not opened, roadside shops selling vegetables and fruits have come up in large numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-want-uzhavar-sandhai-reopened/article35204912.ece

In an email sent to the Chief Minister, association coordinator S.

But water bodies in the panchayats of Perundurai, Ingur, Vadamugam Vellode, Vaipadi, Kambiliyampatti, Panayampalli, Ottaparai and Mugasi Pidariyur were left out. The email claimed that the discharge of untreated effluents from the dyeing and tannery units functioning at the Sipcot Industrial Estate had polluted the water bodies around the premises. “The Total Dissolved Solids is 10,000 parts per million and the water cannot be used,” the email said. The villagers depend on River Cauvery and since the distributed water is insufficient to meet their needs, they have been demanding inclusion of the water bodies in their villages under the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-include-25-water-bodies-under-groundwater-recharge-scheme/article35204918.ece
08 July 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||HC for further probe into Fazal’s murder||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct further investigation into the murder of National Development Front (NDF), now Popular Front of India, activist Mohammed Fazal at Thalassery in 2006 in view of the confessional statement given by a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activist. Justice Ashok Menon directed the CBI to constitute a special team to further investigate the case. The order was passed while allowing a petition filed by P.K. Abdul Sathar, elder brother of Fazal, for a directive to conduct further investigation into the case. He pointed out that further investigation was required in the light of the statement given by RSS activist Subeesh alias ‘Kuppi’ Subeesh that he was involved in the murder. Subeesh had made the confession in 2016 when he was interrogated by the Koothuparamba police in connection with the murder of CPI(M) activist Mohanan. He had stated that Fazal was murdered by RSS gangsters, including himself and three others, namely Proneesh, Prabheesh and Shinoj. The court observed that there was undoubtedly a need for examination of the confession statement of Subeesh and the attending circumstances. It might be true that the CBI might not be satisfied with the materials now collected by the local police during the investigation in some other case involving Subeesh. But there was no harm in examining those materials also, as a part of a further investigation. Without an examination of those materials by the investigating agency, it was not proper to discard them altogether. The Ernakulam CBI Special Court had earlier dismissed the petitioner’s plea for a further investigation, holding that once the final report was filed, the de facto complainant could not seek further investigation invoking the provisions under Section 173(8) CrPC, without the investigating officer asking for it. The State government had submitted before the court that the murder was a sequel to the NDF-RSS standoff in Thalassery in October 2006. The CBI took over the investigation on the directive of the High Court on a plea by the victim’s wife Mariyu. According to the investigation agency, Fazal of Madapedika from Kodiyeri was murdered allegedly by a group of CPI(M) sympathisers after he defected from the CPI(M) and joined the NDF on October 22, 2006. Eight persons, including Karayi Rajan and Karayi Chandrashekaran, CPI(M) local leaders, were arrested by the CBI. M.K. Sunil Kumar, alias ‘Kodi’ Suni, who had been convicted in the case of the murder of Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader T.P. Chandrashekaran, was named the prime accused in the case. According to the CBI, the murder was masterminded by Rajan and Chandrashekaran because of political animosity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-for-further-probe-into-fazals-murder/article35204611.ece

A special team’s probe into the recent murder unearthed the earlier one with the help of the alleged confession of the accused. The team was felicitated by R. Sudhakar, Inspector General of Police, West Zone here on Wednesday. Superintendent of Police E. Sai Charan Tejaswi and Deputy Inspector General of Police Maheshwari were present. What started off as an investigation into a recent murder led the police to another case that was registered under Section 174 of the IPC as unnatural death by drowning in 2018. On June 17 this year, Abi alias Abilash (29) of Rajaji Layout in Pedarapalli was found murdered within SIPCOT police station limits. A special team formed to investigate the case arrested Sabari alias Sabari Singh (29) of Pedarapalli and his accomplices Navi, Murali, Karthik, and Harikrishna within 24 hours of the crime, police said. Subsequently, the team arrested Kantharaj of Pedarapalli on charges of aiding Sabari in the crime. During interrogation, it was found that Sabari had murdered Muthu alias Azhagumuthu of Sikkarimettai in 2018 and disposed of his body in River Thenpennai. The Shoolagiri police had registered this as a case of death by drowning. Sabari’s confession now led to the arrest of three co-accused in the murder of Muthu, and the cracking of another case of murder in Denkanikottai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/murder-case-cracked-after-three-years/article35204916.ece

08 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Illegal adoption: Bid to make quick money landed him in jail||Sivakumar, a school dropout, became popular among philanthropists of Madurai in a short period of time and he got all help to pursue his “passion” of helping the needy. However, he was lured to make quick money and he ended up becoming the prime accused in a case of cheating in the sale of children for illegal adoption. Earlier, impressed by his social service, some police and corporation officials had also provided him all help. Several philanthropists helped him in cash and kind. Between the first and second wave of pandemic, he got a Madurai Corporation building to set up a geriatric centre to take care of the elderly who were living on the roadside. He accommodated destitute women along with their children there. Sivakumar and his colleagues also got district-level and State-level government recognition for their work. “Sivakumar picked up photography and related digital editing skills when he worked as an office-boy in a studio at a young age. He befriended some police officials whenever he went to them with regard to his professional job,” a police officer privy to investigation into illegal adoption case said. His association as a member with Indian Red Cross Society brought out his urge to help the needy. “He used to cut hair for roadside beggars and distribute food and clothing. Slowly, he became popular with the help of social media. Later, when the pandemic broke out, he sought a good building for setting up a home where he could provide good accommodation, food and care for the destitute. The goodwill he had earned over all these days, helped him set up the home where over 80 inmates were accommodated. “There was no dearth for foodgrains and other groceries. A hotelier donated a second-hand ambulance and he bought it through Idhayam Trust. A hospital employee was supplying him groceries every month,” the police official said. A professor helped him buy a second-hand car. The police also provided him an unused building of a police outpost at Mattuthavani bus stand to run a centre to rescue destitutes who come to the bus stand. When it looked everything was going on well, Sivakumar got new friends through social media and his spending increased. As the gravity of pandemic came down, the flow of cash from donors also dwindled even as the monthly expenditure for office maintenance had increased. It was then that he turned a villain. Within a gap of three days, he sold two kids of destitute mothers lodged in his home to two different childless couples for a couple of lakhs of rupees and is now cooling his heels behind bars.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bid-to-make-quick-money-landed-him-in-jail/article35204902.ece

08 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Corporation on a cleaning drive||On day one of the mass campaign ‘Ezhilmigu Madurai,’ Corporation lifted 810 tonnes of garbage, said Commissioner K. P. Karthikeyan here on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Corporation embarked on a new and novel initiative to clean the city by focusing on select wards/streets or any specific location, where debris had accumulated for years together. By choosing one ward from each of the four zones, with the deployment of conservancy workers on a massive scale and with machines required for evicting or removing the debris, the workers were able to clear the garbage on the same day of operation. The Commissioner said that on an average, the civic body lifted 600 metric tons of garbage daily from across the 100 wards. During COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, the garbage output had dropped to 400 MT. “Now, during the mass campaign, we have lifted 810 MT on the first day indicating that the volume was almost double during the pandemic,” he added. The conservancy workers would be assigned the duty between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. and the mass cleaning would go on for five days a week till August 15, Dr Karthikeyan said and added that they planned to cover all the 100 wards. In the last dengue season, those wards, which were hit with high number of cases, would be given special focus. The public can call senior officers, who are supervising the mass cleaning campaign on their mobile phones, namely 94437-39500 (Deputy Commissioner), 9442639595 (Executive Engineer), 9788810185 (Superintending Engineer) and 9443739508 (City Engineer), a press release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-on-a-cleaning-drive/article35205100.ece
08 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Sale transactions by cooperative societies come under HC scanner||Taking a serious view of the fact that officer-bearers of a cooperative society and third parties had entered into a conspiracy and conveyed properties worth crores of rupees at throw away prices, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has imposed a cost of Rs. 10 lakh on a petitioner who sought a direction to the authorities to execute a registered sale deed. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983 was enacted to provide an orderly development of the cooperative movement in accordance with cooperative principles to bring about an improvement in agriculture and industry, better methods of production, better business and better living. The Centre and the State were striving to improve the status of the cooperative movement. But unfortunately, there was no growth and many societies had become defunct. The manner in which the cooperative movement was functioning in the State militates against the very object of the Act, the judge said. Causes of failure There are various causes attributed for this failure and it includes government interference, mismanagement and manipulation, lack of awareness and functional weakness. The bane that afflicts the cooperative movement in the State is mainly attributable to misappropriation and manipulation of funds of the societies by its office bearers and staff. The judge said that the poor who were contributing their hard earned money to the societies were ultimately left in the lurch. Due to their poor bargaining capacity, many misappropriation cases go unquestioned and there are several criminal cases pending before the courts. The present case was a classic case, the court said. It was hearing the petition filed by R.V. Shanmuganandam of Tiruchi. The petitioner challenged the proceedings of the Cooperative Sub-Registrar, Tiruchirappalli Cooperative House Construction Societies, Tiruchi. He sought a direction to the society to execute a sale deed in his favour. The court took note of the fact that there was a scam. According to a government order, a price fixing committee was constituted and the cooperative societies were informed that no properties belonging to them can be sold below the price fixed by the committee. But, this government order was ignored. The petitioner had wrongfully gained. Taking note of the fact that a probe was on into the scam, the court directed the petitioner to pay the cost of Rs. 10 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund. The court also directed the Registrar of Cooperative Societies to conduct a thorough audit of the sale transactions entered into by the societies to find out if any other society had indulged in such scams. The writ petition was dismissed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sale-transactions-by-cooperative-societies-come-under-hc-scanner/article35205096.ece
08 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||What nailed Sivakumar?||Sivakumar thought the destitute woman (whose child he had sold) would buy his stories. He convinced her saying that her one-year-old son died after treatment for COVID-19. “But, a social worker, Azharuddin, who had admitted the woman in the home, dug deep and he found out the fake documents given by Sivakumar. The fake documents showed that Sivakumar had admitted the child at the Corporation hospital and another showed the child’s burial at the cremation ground ,” the police official said. An enquiry by Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar and subsequent investigation by police revealed “sale” of not one but two children from the home for illegal adoption. The fake documents and a photograph showing one of the mothers performing the last rites for her “dead” child nailed his criminal intention. After City Police Commissioner Prem Anand Sinha gave a State-wide lookout alert, Sivakumar’s run came to an end when he was nabbed on the way to Kerala. “He has admitted to the crime,” the Police Commissioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/what-nailed-sivakumar/article35205102.ece

08 July 2021||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||8.25 lakh tests done in Kanniyakumari district||The district administration has so far conducted 8,25,227 COVID-19 tests on the samples collected in Government Medical College Hospital at Aasaaripallam and in various check-posts across the district ever since the pandemic outbreak in March 2020. Of this, the Department of Microbiology of Government Medical College Hospital at Aasaaripallam here has conducted 7,13,000 tests at a cost of Rs. 35 crores, according to Collector M. Aravind. Consequently, 10,694 COVID-19 positive patients with severe symptoms of the viral infection were admitted in the medical college hospital and treated successfully. Of this, 80% of them were admitted in the intensive care unit since their oxygen saturation levels were alarmingly low. He said the microbiology laboratory of Government Medical College Hospital is doing anywhere between 2,000 and 4,000 COVID-19 tests a day, which is the reason for bringing down the district’s positivity rate that once crossed even 1,000 cases a day. “After the triaging centre was established following the onset of the second wave, 31,835 persons have been tested. Of this, 6,803 patients were admitted in the Government Hospital at Thuckalay and the Government Ayurveda Hospital in Kottar. While 8,479 persons, having mild symptoms, were taken to the COVID Care Centres, the remaining 5,589 were asked to be in home quarantine based on the symptoms they had and subsequent screening results,” the Collector said. On the number of pregnant women treated successfully for COVID-19, he said 623 expectant mothers were admitted to the medical college hospital and got treated. Of them, 78 women delivered babies – 56 through Cesarian section and remaining 22 through normal delivery - in the medical college hospital itself. “Since 6 neonatal babies too tested positive for COVID-19 as they had contracted the infection from their mothers, they were also successfully treated,” HE said. On the investigation side, the medical college hospital had taken x-ray of 5,867 COVID-19 patients while 4,639 others were in need of advanced radiological investigation like CT scan. A total of 301 patients having nephrological complications underwent haemo dialysis in the medical college hospital. While the intensity of the second wave of COVID-19 has subsided to a greater extent, the district administration is now gearing up to face the possible third wave by creating as many oxygen-supported beds in the hospitals other than the medical college hospital. “As part of this move, we’ve kept ready 100 oxygen-supported beds in the government hospital in Kulasekaram and created facilities to treat 20 children in the Padmanabhapuram Government Hospital,” the Collector said. He said 3,27,336 persons have received the first dose of the vaccine while both the doses have been administered to 61,135 persons till July 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/825-lakh-tests-done-in-kanniyakumari/article35204904.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||T.N.’s health infrastructure comes in for praise from SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said Tamil Nadu has one of the better health infrastructure systems in the country and it showed during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Tamil Nadu has one of the better infrastructure in the country,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud orally remarked at a virtual hearing. The Bench, also comprising Justice M.R. Shah, was hearing an appeal filed by United India Insurance Company Limited in a case concerning the implementation of the New Health Insurance Scheme of 2012 and 2014 for government employees and pensioners in the State. The State was represented by counsel Joseph Aristotle. The scheme was based on an agreement between the company and the government. It is a cashless insurance scheme for specified diseases, treatment and surgeries. A network of nominated and approved hospitals comes under it. United Insurance has challenged a single judge decision of the Madras High Court that it ought to pay the claims of patients who availed themselves of treatment and surgeries at hospitals outside the network. One of the respondent hospitals was represented by advocate Siva Balamurugan. The single judge had said the company could recover the money from the government. The single judge invoked Article 21 (right to life) to justify the order. The company’s subsequent appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court failed. The company contended that there was no provision for reimbursement. It reasoned that “a contract of insurance, like any other contract, is a commercial transaction, and parties are bound by the terms of the contract duly indicated in the cashless scheme for defined surgeries, diseases and treatment”. The company said the High Court had erroneously invoked Article 21. The patients argued that it was a matter of their right to have the claims settled by the company. Mr. Aristotle said the claimants could also get reimbursed under the Tamil Nadu Medical Attendance Rules. On hearing this, Justice Chandrachud remarked approvingly about the State’s health infrastructure. The hearing would resume on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tns-health-infrastructure-comes-in-for-praise-from-sc/article35204761.ece

The river, originating from Gingee in Villupuram, has become highly polluted in recent times due to the unscientific disposal of sewage into it. The Department has identified 106 sewage drains that flows into the river at various locations in town and suburban areas. Senior Environment Engineer of the Department N. Ramesh told The Hindu that as a pilot project, one of the drains at Ariyapalayam near Chunnambar would be taken up for cleaning using bio-remediation techniques. The technique would be used to bring down the Biological Oxygen Demand by less than 3 mg/L and fecal coliform by less than 500 MPN, he said. On Tuesday, a team from Biox Green Technology and officials visited Ariyapalyam. In a phased manner, the cleaning up of the river would be taken up along with Arasalar in Karaikal.

08 July 2021||Salem,TAMIL NADU||Four detained under Goondas Act||City Police Commissioner Najmal Hoda invoked provisions of the Goondas Act against four persons who were arrested for selling banned gutkha items in the city. On June 23, Shevapet police found a 17-year-old boy in possession of the banned substance and questioned him. The police traced M. Bharatsingh (25), H. Omsingh (28), P. Deepsingh (32), all from Shevapet and S. Madhan (31) of Magudanchavadi. The three purchased gutkha from Madhan and were selling it in Shevapet. Inquiries further revealed that Madhan purchased the expiry dated items from Bengaluru and was involved in selling it at exorbitant price to the three. The police seized Rs. 20 lakh worth gutkha, Rs. 33 lakh and two mobile phones. A case was registered under Sections 273, 328 and 511 of Indian Penal Code, Sections 57 and 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, Section 77 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and Sections 6 and 24 (1) of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003. All the four were arrested and lodged at the Salem Central Prison. Since they were found selling the banned gutkha items at places where school and college students and labourers move frequently, their acts were found to jeopardise public health. Hence, based on the recommendations, they were detained under the act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-detained-under-goondas-act/article35204908.ece

08 July 2021||Srivilliputtur,TAMIL NADU||Heavy rain lashes Srivilliputtur||Heavy rain that lashed Watrap and Srivilliputtur led to power cuts in many areas after several trees uprooted and fell on overhead electricity cables on Tuesday night. Crackers stocked in a fireworks unit went up in flames after lightning struck a magazine near Sivakasi. While Watrap recorded 108.4 mm of rainfall, Srivilliputtur reported 93.60 mm of rainfall. The rain that started at around 6 p.m. was accompanied by thunder and lightning. Strong wind led to around 40 trees getting uprooted and broken branches fell on electric cables. Srivilliputtur town plunged into darkness due to power cut. “The rain that started around 6 p.m. continued till 8.30 p.m. Heavy rain accompanied by frequent thunder and lightning prevented us from taking up restoration works,” TANGEDCO Divisional Engineer, L. Chinnadurai said. The uprooted trees brought down 22 electricity poles of low-tension power cables and two poles of high tension power cables. Over 200 workers were deployed to restore power. “Insulators on poles were damaged by lightning in at least 15 locations that had to be changed,” he added. The workers continued the work throughout the night and power restoration started late at night. “Power was restored in almost all areas in the town by midnight. Power supply in some areas in Watrap also was restored,” he added. However, some poles that were located in tanks meant for power supply to farms were under restoration, he added. Meanwhile, fire triggered by lightning destroyed finished goods stocked in a magazine at a fireworks unit near Maraneri. The fire was reported at around 7.30 p.m. following heavy rain. Fire and Rescue Services personnel from Sivakasi, led by its Station Fire Officer, K.P. Balamurugan, fought the flames for more than two hours. However, no one was injured in the accident. Meanwhile, following overnight heavy rain in Watrap region, the district administration did not allow devotees to climb up Sathuragiri hills to offer prayers at Sundaramahalingam temple. The temple authorities had allowed devotees to go to the hill-top temple for four days from Wednesday in connection with Amavasai festival on Friday. However, as the wild streams were in spate, as a precautionary measure officials of Forest Department stopped the devotees at the foothills in Thaniparai. “Based on tonight’s (Wednesday) rain, we will take a call on permitting devotees for the trekking in the hills on Thursday,” a temple official said. Rainfall reported in other areas (in mm): Vembakottai – 33.30, Pilavakkal 24.40, Virudhunagar 15 and Rajapalayam 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heavy-rain-lashes-srivilliputtur/article35204892.ece

The road, which serves as an alternative to Kumbakonam-Papanasam-Ayyampettai-Thanjavur Road with several curves passing through thickly populated areas, has witnessed sudden increase in movement of heavy vehicles in view of the ongoing Thanjavur-Vikiravandi Road construction. The road has developed potholes near the level-crossing gate causing inconvenience to motorists and devotees to Karbarakshambigai temple at Thirukarukavur on Papanasam-Saliamangalam Road, say Papanasam residents. Due to the tattered road, heavy vehicles negotiating the stretch are forced to move slowly, resulting in frequent traffic snarls on the carriageway even when lockdown conditions were relaxed slightly. With the conditions further relaxed and impending monsoon, locals expect the authorities to rectify the defects and ensure smooth passage for motorists and other road users.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-repair-roads/article35204879.ece

08 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Traffic conundrum back to square one||Traffic bedlam has returned to haunt the general public due to full-scale resumption of bus services to various destinations and haphazard parking of city and mofussil buses around Chathiram Bus Stand here. Since the start of construction of a new bus terminus at Chathiram Bus Stand in November 2019, town buses are operated from bays allotted along the extreme left of the road from the entrance of St. Joseph’s College towards Karur Road. Similarly, the extreme left side of the road along Shrimati Indira Gandhi College is being used to operate buses bound for various city destinations towards Central Bus Stand. Buses bound for Ariyalur, Perambalur, Virudhachalam, Kallakurichi and other destinations in north and north-east of Tiruchi are operated on about 60% of road space near the water tank at Chathiram Bus Stand. Karur Bypass Road, Karur Road and the peripherals of the bus stand are witnessing frequent traffic jams during peak hour since resumption of bus services. The space where Karur, Coimbatore and Erode, Ariyalur and Perambalur bound buses load passengers is said to be causing traffic jams. The cascading impact is felt right from Anna statue to Karur Road and Karur Bypass Road. In the absence of a proper terminus, bus crew halt the vehicles almost on the middle of the roads to load and offload passengers, thereby impeding free flow of traffic. The diversion of cars, buses and two-wheelers, which are supposed to use Fort Station Road, on Karur Bypass road is also adding to the traffic snarls. During peak hours vehicles line up for about half a km on Karur Bypass Road. It has rippling effect up to Chathiram Bus Stand on Karur Road. Private vehicles which were off the roads during the intense lockdown have begun to hit the roads since Monday with the reopening of temples, restaurants, hotels, showrooms and other business establishments. “Most of private and public vehicles have started hitting the roads similar to pre-pandemic level. It is difficult to find space to drive vehicles around the peripheries of Chathiram Bus Stand. Haphazard parking of buses on the road is the main reason for the frequent traffic jams,” says Mohammed Hanifa of Bheema Nagar. He says there are just a few traffic policemen on Karur Road.

08 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Third phase of serosurvey to identify COVID-19 antibodies under way||Health officials in the district have undertaken the third round of serological surveillance to determine the development of antibodies against COVID-19 among the people. The exercise, undertaken across the State, would help in indicating herd immunity, officials said. Herd immunity is a form of protection from an infection that can occur when over half of a population is immune to it, either through vaccination or from getting infected, M. Yazhini, City Health Officer told The Hindu . The Directorate of Public Health would study the incidence of infection, identify hotspots and inform local health officials, who would take blood samples to test for antibodies for COVID-19. In Tiruchi city, eight such locations have been identified. “We took 30 samples from each location. So, 30 samples of 30 different individuals in 30 adjacent houses,” Dr. Yazhini said. Residents who were unwilling to take part or unavailable were skipped. The localities identified were different from those surveyed in the previous two rounds. The samples are sent to a laboratory of the DPH to test for antibodies. “Our nearest lab is in Manapparai, and samples from over six districts have been submitted for processing,” she said. In the first serosurvey, they found 30% of the population with antibodies, while in the second, which was between the first and the second, it was around 27%. “This time around, we are expecting at least 40%,” she said. The vaccination drive, which has picked up pace in the district, would contribute to the population with antibodies. “We can soon reach over 50% and achieve herd immunity, protecting us from future waves of COVID-19,” she added. A similar exercise is also being undertaken in rural parts of the district, where 27 hotspots have been identified. Once all the samples are submitted, results of the serosurvey could be expected within 10 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/third-phase-of-serosurvey-to-identify-covid-19-antibodies-under-way/article35204883.ece

08 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Opening in traffic island on Oyyamari Road barricaded again||Months ago, in a move to check wrong side driving on Oyyamari Road along the Cauvery, city police removed a portion of the traffic island at the far end of the stretch where it meets Chennai Bypass Road to create a path for light vehicles proceeding towards Sanjeevi Nagar. Now, the law enforcers have walked back on the measure. A barricade has been placed at the spot where a part of the traffic island was removed and police personnel have been deployed there. Motorists taking Oyyamari Road to proceed towards Sanjeevi Nagar will again have to take a left at the far end and proceed via Chennai Bypass Road up to Kondayampettai and take a turn there to proceed on the national highway to reach Sanjeevi Nagar. In an effort to check wrong side driving, resorted to by several motorists on Oyyamari Rroad to reach Sanjeevi Nagar, city police held consultations with State Highways and National Highways Authority of India in January. Post-consultations, a portion of the traffic island at the far end of Oyyamari Road near Chennai Bypass Road was removed by city police with an earthmover to create a path for movement of light vehicles such as two-wheelers and auto rickshaws to take a right turn at the far end of the road to proceed in the direction of Sanjeevi Nagar. The measure was put on trial following complaints that several motorists proceeding towards Sanjeevi Nagar from Oyyamari Road took a right turn at the opening near the Regional Transport Office (East) and resorted to wrong side driving, posing danger to rule abiding motorists coming in the opposite direction. Police said the exercise was being done as a trial measure to ascertain how the system worked. The measure, however, was in place for over five months before the city police barricaded the spot a few days ago. Traffic officials say the move to close the portion of the traffic island came after a few fatalities were reported there. Violation by lorries And although the trial measure was aimed at allowing light vehicles, lorries also began to use them and proceeded on the wrong side of the service road towards Sanjeevi Nagar. This prompted the police to reverse the measure. A senior police officer says the issue of wrong side driving on Oyyamari Road will be looked into and steps will be taken to curb the violation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/opening-in-traffic-island-on-oyyamari-road-barricaded-again/article35204888.ece
08 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Polytechnics forced to settle for low scorers||Polytechnic colleges have been left high and dry what with the principals lamenting that late start of the admission process has meant a compromise on the quality of students for second time in a row. They blame the pandemic-induced necessity that led the State government to declare ‘all pass’ in class X for the situation. Unlike last year, this time the going seems to be tough since the colleges are yet to receive official guidelines on the admission process based on class IX marks. The reason is the reluctance of headmasters of government schools, both government and private, to issue transfer certificates to the students. As the Plus One admission process began early, schools have already completed the enrolment process, prioritising students who scored well. “Issuing transfer certificates to students at this juncture will be detrimental to teacher-student ratio at the higher secondary level,” a headmaster of a government higher secondary school said. Chief Educational Officer R. Arivazhagan, however, says headmasters are not supposed to refuse transfer certificates to students seeking admission in polytechnic colleges. “We came across some complaints and prevailed upon school headmasters to issue the transfer certificates in the interest of the students.” But, not all parents are aware of the scope for intervention by District Educational Officers. Eventually, the polytechnics end up admitting students rejected by schools. “It is not a matter of surprise that students with average scores had to be admitted last year. This year, too, the scope for admitting students with tough cut-off marks does not exist,” K. Vijaykumar, Prinicpal of Seshasayee Institute of Technology, Tiruchi, said. Only two years ago, front-ranking polytechnic colleges did not have seats even for those with scores upwards of 85%. Last year, even students with less than 50% score could not be ignored as seats would otherwise have gone unfilled, he pointed out. The teachers find themselves necessitated to alter their pedagogical approach from teaching to coaching, which is not ideal for polytechnics. Industries have all along preferred to recruit students from polytechnic colleges only because of vibrant orientation on practical component of their syllabi,” Mr. Vijaykumar said. “The online registration of students will continue till July 12. Many have been registering even without uploading their class IX marks. But, thankfully, the provision is there for students to register their names online first and upload their marks later on. We are awaiting clear-cut information from the Department of Technical Education for proceeding with admission of students,” Tamilselvan, Principal of Government Polytechnic College, Tiruchi, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/polytechnics-forced-to-settle-for-low-scorers/article35204877.ece

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had announced that children who had lost both parents to COVID-19 would be provided with financial assistance of Rs. 5 lakh as fixed deposit and the amount would be given to them with interest when they turned 18 years of age.

08 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Displaced roadside vendors stage protest||With the city police disallowing push cart and roadside vendors to ply their trade around Gandhi Market over the past few days in an apparent attempt to reduce traffic congestion, a group of affected vendors staged a protest in front of the Corporation Ariyamangalam Zonal Office in the city on Wednesday highlighting their plight and demanding permission to continue to operate from the roadside. Led by A.Ansardeen of Tiruchi District Street Vendors Association, they urged the Corporation to earmark space for push cart/street vendors selling vegetables and fruits around the Gandhi Market so that they can operate without hindrance to the traffic. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Ansardeen said about 100 traders had been doing business around Gandhi Market for several years now. “All of a sudden, without any prior intimation or notice, police removed them a couple of days back, jeopardising their livelihood. About 50% of them are from villages around the city who are selling vegetables raised in their gardens. The police action favours big traders and raises a question mark over the livelihood of small vendors.” K. Suresh, district general secretary, AITUC, who participated in the protest, underlined the need for the Corporation to implement the Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 and ensure that they did not face any hindrance from police or other officials. The demonstrators dispersed after talks with the Corporation Assistant Commissioner. Mr. Suresh said street vendors had been invited for talks called by the Collector R. Sivarasu on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/displaced-roadside-vendors-stage-protest/article35205269.ece

The officials had been instructed to initiate preliminary steps for renovating the ‘Karumaaari’ tank after evicting the encroachments to ensure free flow of rainwater into the tank and ‘navagraha chandran’ statue. He said the temple elephant ‘Gandhimathi’, which would undergo a range of medical examinations once a month, would be taken for this mandatory check-up once in 15 days hereafter. When asked about the renovation of mandapam, he said the work would be taken up after getting due permission from the Department of Archaeology. “Since the sponsors are ready for participating in the renovation of this mandapam, the work will commence shortly.

Subhash Chandra, who hails from Rajasthan and has been a resident of Kongu Nagar in Corporation limits for over a decade, alleged that he and his wife have not been vaccinated so far as the tokens were not issued to them as their names did not figure in the district’s electoral roll. “Only one of my relatives got his first dose of vaccine that too when they were accepting Aadhaar cards [at the vaccination centres],” he told The Hindu on Wednesday. On June 21, the district administration and the Corporation commenced new measures to prevent overcrowding at vaccination centres, according to which the vaccine tokens were issued based on the district's electoral roll and that government and private schools that were designated as polling stations were used as vaccination centres as opposed to primary health centres. K. Ganesan, president of Iduvai village panchayat and a CPI(M) functionary, suggested that the district administration could arrange special vaccination camps for those residents whose names do not feature in the electoral roll, given that many from other districts and States who are working in industries are residing in the district. He alleged that some of the private garment companies have been demanding money from the workers for vaccination, which they were unable to afford. A senior Corporation official said that complaints pertaining to the issue have been received and that measures to ensure vaccination for those whose names do not feature in the electoral roll will be taken up soon. “Till the vaccine supply is low, whatever methodology we take up, most of the people will not be covered,” he said. An official from the Health Department said that about five lakh beneficiaries have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the district and that the district administration is yet to chalk out a plan to vaccinate the residents whose names are missing in the electoral roll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complaints-regarding-vaccination-based-on-electoral-roll-in-tiruppur/article35204813.ece

08 July 2021||Udhagamandalam,TAMIL NADU||Herpetologists criticise use of snake tongs to capture reptiles||The use of snake tongs as an equipment to handle reptiles has come in for criticism from herpetologists and expert snake handlers from across the State. The snake tongs or forceps are used mostly by amateur snake handlers to restrict the movement of the snake’s head, by trapping the head of the reptile between the pincers. However, the tongs, which came into prominence in North America to capture specific species of snakes, are being used incorrectly by not only amateur handlers but also the fire department to rescue the reptiles, often cause an injury that will lead to the reptile’s death, say herpetologists. “For the price of a few hundred rupees, snake tongs can be purchased online by anyone. However, the use of these tongs is extremely dangerous to the reptile. If the handler applies too much pressure, it can easily sever the snake’s spinal column, or cause other serious injuries,” said N. Sadiq Ali, founder of the Wildlife and Nature Conservation Trust (WNCT), who has held training programmes for forest staff on how to safely handle snakes. Another prominent herpetologist from Tamil Nadu, who requested anonymity, said that almost all Indian snake species could be handled easily with a “snake hook,” which is significantly less dangerous to the animal. “Even in parts of the world where the snake tongs are used, they are used only as a last resort to supplement the rescue, and not as a crutch in all situations. This is why snake handlers need to understand the anatomy of the reptile, and handling snakes, especially by amateurs, needs to be treated as a last resort,” he said. When contacted, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, I. Anwardeen, said that the Forest Department always discouraged non-qualified snake-handlers from capturing reptiles. “However, each incident is treated on a case-by-case basis, as in some cases, a person might have intervened fearing the safety of people nearby,” said Mr. Anwardeen. Fire Department Mr. Sadiq Ali said that even staff from the Fire Department were called to rescue snakes. “Only trained Forest Department staff or rescuers notified by the Forest Department should be allowed to rescue snakes if the situation requires. And the use of snake tongs as a handling tool in general needs to be discouraged,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/herpetologists-criticise-use-of-snake-tongs-to-capture-reptiles/article35204804.ece

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Murugan rewarded for his party work||Despite murmurs in the party about his style of functioning, Mr. Murugan kept the party focused on the goal of sending its members to the Assembly, though he lost by a slender margin in Dharapuram. His tenure was filled with attacks on the DMK and its allies. He organised the ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ across the State, following a controversy over the Hindu religious hymn, Kanda Shashti Kavacham, by a YouTube channel, Karuppar Kootam, which he has alleged had the backing of the DMK. The yatra, though failed to become a mass movement, kept the party in the limelight in the run-up to the election while trying to portray the party as the saviour and voice of the Hindus. Mr. Murugan will have to be elected to the Rajya Sabha within six months. With his elevation, the State unit is set to get a new president. Former IPS officer K. Annamalai is considered the frontrunner. The other names doing the rounds are those of Nainar Nagendran, Karuppu Muruganandam and R. Srinivasan. But Mr. Nagendran may not be given the post as he is the party’s floor leader in the Assembly. A party leader said that in the recent past, the BJP had shown that it would promote leaders capable of keeping the party under the spotlight and taking on the two Dravidian parties. Mr. Murugan’s predecessor Tamilisai Soundararajan was made Telangana Governor and then given the additional charge of Puducherry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/murugan-rewarded-for-work-as-tn-bjp-chief/article35204769.ece

08 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State sees big dip in influenza A(H1N1), dengue cases||Although the second wave of COVID-19 had overwhelmed the State’s health infrastructure, there has been a pronounced decline in the number of Influenza ‘A’ H1N1 and dengue cases so far this year. While just one H1N1 case has been reported this year in the State (from Bengaluru Urban), as many as 1,044 dengue cases have been reported from January till July 2. The number of dengue cases have reduced by half in the first quarter (903 cases from January till May) this year compared to the 1,887 cases reported in the corresponding period last year. The State had recorded a total of 458 H1N1 cases and three deaths in 2020 when the pandemic began. While 3,685 dengue cases had been reported, there were no deaths due to this vector borne disease. Greater surveillance Bhanu Murthy, State Joint Director for Communicable Diseases, attributed the decline in H1N1 cases to increased surveillance and COVID-19 precautions such as use of masks and social distancing as it is also a respiratory infection. However, some doctors said there could have been under-reporting of cases because of limited hospital access during the lockdown. Virologist V. Ravi, who formerly headed the department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS and is now part of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), attributed the marked decline in H1N1 cases to herd immunity. “Although the first outbreak of H1N1 was reported in 2009 in India, we developed herd immunity only around 2015 as there were no vaccines available for this respiratory disease,” he said. “The low number of cases so far does not mean that there will be fewer cases this year. The virus exhibits seasonality. But with COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, we will have to wait and watch,” he said. Alternate years State Health Director Om Prakash Patil said dengue in Karnataka has been following a pattern of spiking every alternate year. According to data, 6,083 cases and eight deaths were reported in 2016 while 17,844 cases and 10 deaths were reported in 2017 followed by 4,848 cases and four deaths in 2018. The next year, the State saw 18,183 cases and 17 deaths followed by 3,685 cases in 2020. “As last year had witnessed a dip, this year we are expecting a rise. However, till July 2, only 1,044 dengue cases have been reported,” he said. Sudarshan Ballal, chairman, Manipal Hospitals, and member of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said protocol helped in keeping away H1N1 too. Less construction activity due to the lockdown had prevented mosquito breeding, he said. “Dengue is related to mosquito breeding in stagnant fresh water and high-density populations where infected mosquitoes can bite a large number of individuals in a cluster. It is possible that many migrant workers were displaced and severe crowding in the lower socio-economic area might have been less during the pandemic,” he said. Raghu J., Senior Consultant (Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease Specialist) at Sakra World Hospital, said as H1N1 and COVID-19 have similar manifestations, doctors are always considering H1N1 if a patient does not respond to COVID-19 treatment. “Dengue cases too are decreasing as people are limiting outdoor activities. Staying indoors, people are not exposed to the vector much. However, over the last month, I have seen at least five dengue and two H1N1 patients,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-sees-big-dip-in-influenza-ah1n1-dengue-cases/article35204728.ece
08 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||A new pattern in Central administration||A new order appears to be emerging in Karnataka with respect to Central administration with the dropping of veteran leader D.V. Sadananda Gowda from the Union Ministry and inclusion of four others, including former Minister Shobha Karandlaje and Rajya Sabha member Rajiv Chandrashekhar. Sources in the BJP describe it is a clear indication from the party Central leadership that it is focusing on performance rather than previous laurels, seniority, or political clout. Old equations However, the Central leadership has clearly tried to balance caste and regional equations, as Ms. Karandlaje has been chosen to replace Mr. Gowda as she belongs to his community and region. Similarly, Bhagwanth Khuba, two-time Bidar MP, who belongs to the Lingayat community, has been chosen to fill the slot vacated due to the death of Suresh Angadi. Representation has been given to the SC community by choosing A. Narayanaswamy, who belongs to the ‘Left’ section among SCs. The choice of the four MPs though there were other seniors is being seen as an indication that the Narendra Modi-led dispensation is trying to pick those who are perceived as capable of delivering to improve its image in the post-COVID-19 period. Ties with Sangh Another important factor, according to sources, is that all four new Ministers have good ties with the Sangh Parivar. According to sources, Mr. Khuba was picked considering his active role in reaching the government’s achievements to people through mass contact programmes. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y. Raghavendra and Kalaburagi MP Umesh Jadhav’s names too were in the list of probables. However, others were chosen over them due to strategic reasons. A section of the party leaders also feel that the selection of the new Ministers may also pave the way for nurturing new leadership in the party State unit. The newly-inducted central Ministers from the State are also expected to contribute to “visible” development of the State too apart from their Central responsibilities in tune with Mr. Modi’s pre-poll promise of putting the State on the fast pace of development.  A section of the party leaders also feel that selection of the new Ministers may also pave the way for nurturing new leadership in the party State unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-new-pattern-in-central-administration/article35204742.ece

In an order, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta, stated that the committee will include five experts: Dr. Sanjay, director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, Dr. Mallikarjun, president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Dr. Rakshay Shetty, lead paediatric intensivist of Rainbow Children’s Hospital, Dr. Naresh P. from Manipal Hospital and Dr. Vishwanath Kamoji from Columbia Asia Hospital. The remaining nine members of the committee, which will be headed by Mr. Gupta, are civic officials. Special Commissioner (Health) D. Randeep will be the member secretary. Chief Health Officer (Public Health) B.K. Vijayendra, Chief Health Officer (Clinical) Nirmala Buggi, and other children’s specialists working in the BBMP will also be on the committee.  With the vaccination drives covering college students likely to be completed in around eight days, the availability of vaccines for the general public will improve, said Mr. Gupta. “On an average, around 80,000 vaccine doses are being administered in the city every day. On some days, the number has even crossed 1 lakh. Already around 53% of the eligible adult population in the city has been vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-forms-14-member-paediatric-expert-panel/article35204722.ece
08 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Tepid response to SSLC mock exam plan||A large number of Class 10 students, especially those from private schools, are unlikely to give the SSLC mock examination. Many expressed fears that physically visiting their respective centres and answering the papers would increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. Given that the final examinations are scheduled to be held just a few days after the dry run, they don’t want to take the chance. The Department of Primary and Secondary Education on Tuesday had announced that they would conduct a mock SSLC examination on July 15 and 17 as the question paper pattern had been changed to a multiple choice format. Students will be provided OMR sheets. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that many private schools would conduct the mock examination online in the interest of students’ health. “Parents are not willing to send their children to school for the mock examination. It is meaningless if a mock exam is conducted and we expose students to a health risk. Instead of conducting a mock examination on two days, the department could have conducted a regular SSLC examination for all six subjects,” he said. Online option Students have urged the government to give them the option of taking the mock tests online. M. Dheeraj, a Class X student, said that he and his classmates were ready to take the mock test online as his parents were not willing to send him to school for an offline mock test. Private schools have already started preparing their children for the SSLC examination. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said that they are conducting special classes every day for Class X students. “None of the parents were ready to send their children for mock tests to school,” she said. Government schools On the other hand, government schools have received a more positive response from students. Many have decided to go ahead with the mock examination. “We are expecting an attendance of around 75 % as students are anxious about the change in the pattern. However, I feel that there was no need for a mock examination. Students could have been summoned 15 minutes earlier on the main day where they could be briefed on how to shade the answer keys,” said a teacher of a government high school in North Bengaluru. The final examinations are scheduled to be held on July 19 and 22 and around 8.76 lakh students have registered for the examination. Each subject paper will carry 40 marks. Students will have to answer three papers on each day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tepid-response-to-sslc-mock-exam-plan/article35204725.ece
08 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State will come up with action plan on Mekedatu: Bommai||In the midst of opposition from Tamil Nadu to the Mekedatu project, the Karnataka government has decided to come up with an action plan to start the drinking water project across Cauvery river as early as possible. “Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will discuss the action plan with technical and legal experts during the weekend,” Home, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Wednesday. During the meeting, the Chief Minister would discuss the various permissions and approvals required for the project with technical experts and future course of action with legal experts, he added. Currently, he said only a miscellaneous application pertaining to the Mekedatu project was pending before the Supreme Court. Mekedatu was an important project for Karnataka, the Home Minister said. The project would have a determining role in the management of Cauvery waters in future. “The reservoir will play an important role in sharing Cauvery waters during distress years. Since it has assumed importance for both States, Mr. Yediyurappa will discuss the action plan this weekend,” Mr. Bommai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-will-come-up-with-action-plan-on-mekedatu-bommai/article35204745.ece
08 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BDA complex redevelopment plan back on the cards?||An old and controversial proposal to redevelop six Bangalore Development Authority complexes through joint ventures with private players is likely to be revived. When the proposal was first mooted in 2017, it received widespread opposition from various quarters, including the BJP. Senior BDA officials, who spoke to The Hindu, said the complexes in H.S.R. Layout, R.T. Nagar, Sadashivanagar, Indiranagar, Vijayanagar, and Austin Town had been proposed to be redeveloped and tenders for the same were floated in 2017. It was finalised sometime in 2018, with the joint venture project to be executed by Maverick Holdings and Embassy Group. Following opposition, it was put on the back burner. The officials said that last week, a meeting was held with the bidders who had bagged the tender. The meeting was primarily called to discuss the revenue-sharing model and lease conditions. Earlier, an official explained, the revenue sharing model was 30:70, which would obviously cause a huge loss to the BDA. In September 2019, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa directed the project to be put on hold in view of widespread criticism and opposition to the revised revenue sharing model of 65:35 and the lease for 60 years (30 years initially and an additional lease period of 30 years). “While we have communicated to the bidders that the revenue model and lease period will have to be revised, no other decision has been taken,” a senior BDA official said. He added that there is also a possibility that the tender would be cancelled. BDA chairperson and Yelahanka MLA S.R. Vishwanath reiterated that no decision had yet been taken. “We only met with the bidders to discuss some issues,” he said. Meanwhile, sources questioned whether the BDA would be able to take up such a massive project. “All the funds raised from the auction of corner sites is going towards loan repayment and paying compensation to the farmers. The authority does not have the resources to take up such a project,” they pointed out. Civic groups and activists are up in arms over these plans. Joining the chorus, interestingly, is BJP MLA Satish Reddy. He said the land value of these complexes was more than Rs. 25,000 per sqft, with each complex worth being at least Rs. 500 crore. “The land belongs to the BDA. Where is the logic in entering into a joint venture agreement, demolishing the existing buildings and earning only partial revenue? This is clearly benefiting only the private parties,” he said and added that he would be writing to Mr. Yediyurappa and the BDA Commissioner in this regard. Sneha Nandihal from the B.M. Kaval Residents’ Welfare Association, who had earlier also opposed the redevelopment project, said it was against the premise of why these complexes were constructed by the BDA. “We will petition against the project,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bda-complex-redevelopment-plan-back-on-the-cards/article35204713.ece
08 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Strong evidence between wildlife trade and zoonotic disease risks, says study||Offering insight that may help in developing planned measures to curtail future pandemics, a new paper shows that one-quarter of mammal species in wildlife trade host 75% of diseases known to transfer between animals and humans. The paper, ‘Mammals, wildlife trade and the next global pandemic’ by wildlife trade and infectious diseases researchers from the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), was published in the journal Current Biology . Researchers surveyed the association of 226 viruses responsible for zoonotic diseases with more than 800 mammal species distinguished into three categories: traded, non-traded, and domesticated mammals. Rodents and bats were previously identified as the significant players for disease transmission. The study also added primates and even-toed ungulates such as deer (often poached for their meat) and carnivores to the hot list. It shows that primates, bats, ungulates, and carnivores alone host 58% of the known zoonotic viruses present in the wildlife trade. The study now provides empirical evidence for the strong association between wildlife trade and zoonotic disease risks, said Sandeep Sen of ATREE, one of the co-authors. “It is important to survey and monitor groups that have high zoonotic virus richness. Other than bats, it is primates, carnivores, ungulates and rodents. These groups may likely harbour more undiscovered zoonotic viruses. One-quarter of the mammals in the wildlife trade harbour about 75% of known zoonotic viruses, which is alarming. What this means is that we need to monitor and curtail trade in a very large number of species,” said Mr. Sen. The authors also acknowledge the threats posed by ongoing deforestation, land-use change, and habitat fragmentation which result in direct contact and disease transmission between humans and the species listed in their study. “Strong policy measures are needed for curtailing and monitoring wildlife trade,” added KN Shivaprakash of the TNC, the lead author of the study who heads the research project. Asked about remedial measures, Mr. Sen said, “In a way, it is simple. Curtail deforestation and fragmentation of habitats; increase connectivity of natural habitats..” Kamal Bawa, another co-author and the president of ATREE, said the one health component of the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Wellbeing, proposed the establishment of surveillance sites to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases. Such sites, he said, could also be used for pathogen surveillance in confiscated wildlife specimens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/strong-evidence-between-wildlife-trade-and-zoonotic-disease-risks-says-study/article35204724.ece

The boy along with another 14-year-old girl from Ballari, the first cases of paediatric mucormycosis in Karnataka, was admitted to the hospital on May 27. He was first taken to a private hospital in Tumakuru for fever and exertion. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and past infection of COVID-19 (through an antibody test) there. He was then referred to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH) in Bengaluru from where he was sent to Bowring Hospital. Doctors claimed this is the first case of a child having being infected with post-COVID-19 mucormycosis and MIS-C. “It is unfortunate that the boy developed both mucormycosis and MIS-C, which is very rare,” Chikkanarasa Reddy, professor of Paediatrics at Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute, told The Hindu.  Symptoms The boy had lost vision in the left eye. He had undergone neuro surgery at NIMHANS apart from an endoscopic sinonasal debridement surgery at Bowring hospital. “He was showing improvement for some time but two days back he developed high grade fever and low blood pressure. During investigations, he was found to have developed MIS-C,” the doctor said. The girl, who has also lost vision in one eye, is doing well and is likely to be discharged in another ten days, he said. “Considering the rarity of the case, it has been listed for discussion during a panel discussion at the World Congress on Infectious Diseases that will begin on Thursday,” the doctor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/11-year-old-boy-under-treatment-for-mucormycosis-develops-mis-c-succumbs/article35204729.ece

08 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Gun licence: HC notice on plea against extension of exemption to Kodavas||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday ordered issue of notice to the State and Union governments on a PIL petition questioning the 2019 notification of granting exemption to Kodavas and Jamma land holders in Kodagu district from the requirement to obtain a licence to carry and possess firearms as required under provisions of the Indian Arms Act, 1959. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the order on a PIL petition filed by Capt. Chethan Y.K., who retired from short service commission of Indian Army. The petitioner has questioned the constitutional validity of the notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs extending the exemption for “every person of Coorg race and every Jamma tenure land holder in Coorg” from gun licence till October 31, 2029. It has been contended that the Union government in the latest notification of October 2019 has not “in letter and spirit reviewed or reconsidered” its 1966 notification of granting exemption from obtaining gun licence indefinitely but has only restricted the period of exemption for 10 years, that is, till October 31, 2029 despite certain observations made by the High Court in earlier proceedings. The classification, “every person of Coorg race and every Jamma tenure holder in Coorg” is not based on any intelligible or, even, real factors and such classification is not necessitated by the objectives of the Arms Act of 1959, and this classification and use of term ‘Coorg race’ promotes discrimination between the citizens of Coorg region on the ground of caste, violating Article 15 of the Constitution, the petitioner has contended. By granting exemption under the impugned notification, the petitioner has claimed, the MHA has made away with the scrutiny of persons before granting licence in respect of the persons belonging to the ‘Coorg race’, and this itself is not only derogatory to the citizens of the entire nation other than the ‘Coorg race’ but also possess a threat to the life and liberty as the people exempted are permitted to hold arms and ammunition without any scrutiny of their antecedents or criminal records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gun-licence-hc-notice-on-plea-against-extension-of-exemption-to-kodavas/article35204733.ece

Eshwarappa on Wednesday expressed displeasure over the State Election Commission hurriedly announcing the reservation list for zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat posts. Speaking to presspersons here, Mr. Eshwarappa said that the State Cabinet held a meeting in this regard and also wrote to the Election Commission requesting it too postpone the announcement of reservation fearing the further spread of COVID-19, but the Election Commission turned down the government’s request. “The State government had no other motive in seeking postponement of the poll process but people in rural areas have been affected the most due to the pandemic; however, the government is ready to conduct the poll exercise anytime,” the Minister said. Rumours Accusing the Opposition parties of spreading rumours about change of leadership in the State, Mr. Eshwarappa said that Congress leader Siddaramaiah is under the illusion of becoming the chief minister again.

Patil representing the Lingayat community and Tanveer Sait from the minority, are also daydreaming of becoming chief minister.

Hariprasad that BJP leaders are trained in “Nagpur University”, a reference to the RSS, the Minister said: “We are proud to be trained in Nagpur University [RSS]” and asked the Congress leaders “whether they are trained in ‘Italy University’.” The Minister also clarified that Rs. 1,200 crore funds sanctioned to take up works under Rural Development and Panchayat Raj that was directly transferred to legislators has been allocated to the department.

08 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Traditional fishermen oppose Sagar Mala project, to protest||Traditional fishermen in Mangaluru will hold a protest with their boats on Friday on the banks of the Phalguni (Gurupura) at Bengre calling for scrapping the Sagar Mala project of the Union government that among others proposes a coastal berth at Bengre. Phalguni Sampradayika Meenugarara Sangha president Abdul Tayyur Bengre in a statement here said that the coastal berth project at Bengre will snatch the livelihood of hundreds of traditional fishermen and destroy their right to undertake work. Besides protesting with boats, families of fishermen will hold protests in their respective houses too. Mr. Bengre said that the Union and State governments have decided to introduce several projects along the coastline in the name of Sagar Mala project. Already, the government is using force against fishermen who are protesting against such projects in Karwar, Honnavar and other places. All the projects under Sagar Mala will result in the displacement of fishermen from the coastline on which they have built their life, Mr. Bengre said. Sagar Mala’s intention itself is to remove traditional fishermen from their land and sea and hand fishing over to corporate entities. At Bengre, the governments have proposed to construct the coastal berth to accommodate domestic vessels up to 5,000 tonnes capacity, for which the river bed will be dredged up to 7 m deep. This will not only affect small boats of traditional fishermen but also destroy valuable marine life, including the Maruvai and crabs. Dredging will result in increased speed of river current thereby destabilising traditional fishing boats, Mr. Bengre said. The traditional fishermen thus are not only fighting for their survival but also for the protection of environment, said sangha’s honorary president Muneer Katipalla.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traditional-fishermen-oppose-sagar-mala-project-to-protest/article35205229.ece

08 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vending areas coming up in Mysuru||After a long delay, the Mysuru City Corporation is gearing up to declare “vending zones” for supporting the livelihood of street vendors as part of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM). The MCC has identified vending zones in zones 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 coming under various municipal wards. They were identified based on the directions from Mission Director, DAY-NULM, Bengaluru. The zonal commissioners identified the places in their jurisdictions and submitted proposals. The MCC has now asked the public to submit objections, if any, with regard to the places identified in seven days. Objections that are submitted after seven days will not be accepted and thereafter steps will be taken to establish the vending zones at the designated places, says a release from the MCC. The vending zones had been identified at ward number 49 (Zone 1) – on New Kantharaj Urs Road (left side of the footpath) near Ballal Circle; 56 (Zone 2) – New Kantharaj Urs Road (right side of the footpath) near Ballal Circle; 21 (Zone 4) – in front of Swimming Pool in Saraswathipuram; 20 (Zone 5) – Vijayanagar High Tension Line Road near Vidyavardhaka Engineering College; 17 (Zone 7) – in front of St. Joseph’s Hospital in Bannimantap; 14 (Zone 8) – near P and T Quarters, N.R. Mohalla; and 53 (Zone 9) – on MCC property on the service road of T. Narasipura Main Road. The Mysuru City Corporation did the exercise in its attempt to free non-hawking zones from street vendors. This is in addition to the “hawking zones” already notified. The effort is part of implementing proposals that are crucial to maintaining the city’s cleanliness. The street vendors had been oriented about the steps taken by the MCC for their rehabilitation. Once the facilities such as drinking water and temporary shelter are made available, they have to shift to the designated areas. In the past, there was resistance from street vendors to the MCC’s ideas. Moreover, the MCC also delayed declaring vending zones and providing facilities. A toilet block has been built at the notified vending place near Ballal Circle but no street food vendor has shifted there. It’s not clear whether objections had been invited from the public for the same place, which lacked other facilities and vendors were reluctant to move there. The MCC had earlier stated that it was not building permanent structures in vending zones. Facilities such as toilets, drinking water, and temporary shelters are created for the vendors to carry out their business. ID cards had already been issued to the street vendors with regard to their rehabilitation. Funds were available under the National Urban Livelihood Mission. During the survey conducted a few years ago, as part of DAY-National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM), 1,149 street food vendors had been identified. The MCC wanted to carry out another survey to identify remaining vendors. It is not known whether the survey was completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vending-areas-coming-up-in-mysuru/article35205113.ece
08 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Security apparatus ramped up at Mysuru railway station||Security apparatus is being ramped up at the Mysuru railway station with the installation of IP-based Video Surveillance System (VSS) through Rail Tel, giving a major boost to safety and security of passengers, especially women and children. This is part of a nationwide project being taken by the Indian Railways and will cover major railway stations across the country. The work is in progress at Gadag and Vijayapura apart from Mysuru. Under SWR, the project has been installed at Shivamogga, Hassan, Davanagere, Bangarpet, Kengeri, Bengaluru Cantonment, Satya Sai Prashanti Nilayam, Hubballi, Vasco da Gama, Hosapete, Belagavi and Ballari stations. MoU According to authorities in the South Western Railways, the project covers A1, A, B, C, D and E category railway stations. Indian Railways signed a MoU with RailTel in June last year for installation of CCTV at stations. But a revised tender was floated in May 2021 after revision of specifications to address national security concerns and promote domestic manufacturing. Centralised The authorities said these CCTVs are being networked on optical fibre cable and the video feed of the CCTV cameras will be displayed not only at local RPF posts but also at a centralised CCTV control room at divisional and zonal level. The new arrangement provides for monitoring of CCTV cameras of stations and video feeds at 3 levels to ensure enhanced safety and security at railway premises. The SWR said RailTel has completed work of setting up centralised control room at 14 zonal railways and the room displays video feeds from CCTV installed by RailTel at stations of respective zones. The authorities said a Network Management System (NMS) has been also been provided for monitoring of cameras, server, UPS and switches which can be viewed from any web browser by authorised personnel. Four types In all, 4 types of IP cameras - Dome type, bullet types, Pan Tilt Zoom type, and Ultra HD- 4k - are being installed to ensure maximum coverage on the railway premises. This will give an extra edge to the RPF officials to improve security. The recording of the video feeds form CCTV cameras will be stored for 30 days, according to the authorities. Underlining the benefits of the new system, the authorities said the integrated command and control centre and IP based Surveillance System will not only help in providing better security to passengers and prevent criminal activities, but will also enable quick and coordinated response for crowd management and control. While 813 railway stations already have the system, the work is in progress across 47 other stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/security-apparatus-ramped-up-at-mysuru-railway-station/article35205108.ece
08 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||BJP govt. lying on COVID-19 death toll: Siddaramaiah||Accusing the BJP government in the State of lying to the people on the death toll in COVID-19, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has estimated that about 3.5 lakh people had died. Speaking at Sahaya Hasta and Cycle Jatha, two programmes organised by the party in Mysuru to extend a helping hand to people affected by COVID-19 and condemn the fuel price rise respectively, the former Chief Minister said the second wave has claimed a lot more lives than the the first wave. “Though the government claims that the toll is about 35,000, I would estimate the figure to be ten times more”, he said. He asked people to remain vigilant against COVID-19 and take precautions. Though the second wave is declining, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the experts were predicting the third wave in September-October this year. Citing experts, Mr. Siddaramaiah said people who had not contracted the virus in the first and second wave were susceptible in the third wave and emphasised the importance of vaccinating themselves to keep COVID-19 at bay. The pandemic and the lockdown had affected a large number of people in the State, particularly the poor and labourers. The Congress had advised the BJP government in the State to give Rs. 10,000 and 10 kgs of rice to each BPL family to tide over the unprecedented financial crisis they were facing, but the State government ignored the suggestion, he regretted. “It would have cost the State government only Rs. 15,000 crore”, Mr. Siddaramaiah said adding that the sum was small compared to the State government’s annual budgetary outlay of Rs. 2.45 lakh crore. Though the government was providing 7 kg of rice to each individual belonging to BPL category when he was the Chief Minister, the B.S. Yediyurappa government had brought it down to just 2 kg, he lamented. Mr. Siddaramaiah accused the BJP government of indulging in corruption by allegedly collecting commission. He said files do no not move in the government unless a bribe of 10 per cent commission is paid. The Congress leader trained his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi also. He said people should be wary of the Prime Minister’s “Acche Din”. “Whenever the Prime Minister says Acche Din will come, people have to understand that bad days are coming”, he said. Social distancing Mr. Siddaramaiah took to the task of ensuring social distancing at a party meeting in Mysuru on Wednesday. After entering the venue, he saw people jostling against each other in the hall. He soon went up the dais and cleared it of all the people. He strode along the dais asking people to go down.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-govt-lying-on-covid-19-death-toll-siddaramaiah/article35205112.ece
08 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Ranganathittu sanctuary reopens||Avian enthusiasts can cheer as the bird sanctuary at Ranganathittu on the banks of Cauvery near Mysuru has reopened for visitors after a lengthy closure due to pandemic-induced lockdown. After the lockdown curbs were eased, the Forest Department reopened the key tourist destination on Bengaluru-Mysuru National Highway on Tuesday. The sanctuary was closed for a much longer time in the first wave last year like other tourist spots in Mysuru. Day one of its reopening attracted a few visitors, including children, and the forest officials were hoping for more footfalls during weekends. The Forest Department has asked visitors to strictly follow COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour. The entire sanctuary including boats and life jackets had been disinfected before the gates were thrown open for visitors. Though the number of visitors were not promising, the sanctuary staff said tourist arrivals may go up with the lifting of curbs for inter-State travellers. As visitors usually take boat rides to get close to the birds roosting on the tall trees at the isles, the boats and life jackets are sanitised after every ride besides disinfecting the park, passageway, information centre and toilets at different intervals. The sanctuary staff had been asked to speak less to the visitors and maintain social distancing. The department has issued guidelines to visitors and the staff had been asked to ensure the SOPs in view of the pandemic situation. The staff had been asked to deny entry to those having cough, cold and fever and thermal scanning of all visitors was done at the entrance. Mask is a must and visitors had been told to maintain distance during boat rides. They had been asked not to venture into areas other than those earmarked by the department. Deputy Conservator of Forests (Territorial) K.C. Prashanth Kumar said all safety precautions are in place at the sanctuary and the visitors have been told to take necessary protections, following the recommended SOPs for containing the spread of the infection. Spitting has been prohibited. Migratory birds are expected to flock the sanctuary from October onwards. The birds settled at the site are the local species.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ranganathittu-sanctuary-reopens/article35205110.ece
08 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah opposes return of former Congressmen||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has reiterated his opposition to the return to the party of erstwhile Congressmen, who had repeatedly betrayed the party. Speaking after admitting JD(S) and BJP workers to the party in Mysuru on Wednesday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the party would welcome everybody who wishes to serve the people. But, the doors of the party will be closed to people, who have repeatedly betrayed the party, and wish to return to the Congress only for the sake of power. His stand on return of erstwhile Congresmen assumes significance in the light of KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar’s reported statement that the Congress will consider the applications of all individuals, including defectors, if they accept the party’s ideology and principles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-opposes-return-of-former-congressmen/article35205118.ece
08 July 2021||MYSURU/BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Spat over KRS safety and illegal mining continues||The war of words between former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh continued on Wednesday with the former accusing the actor-turned politician of “attempting to extract money from the mining industry” and the latter hitting back. Ms. Ambareesh, who has locked horns with the JD(S) leaders, including Mr Kumaraswamy, on the safety of the KRS dam and illegal mining, reiterated her concern over the dam’s safety and her resolve to fight illegal mining. She said her decision to inspect a few mines had “rattled those supportive of illegal mining and have benefited from it”. She said people of the region know who is behind illegal mining and those who have nothing to hide should not worry about her decision to inspect the mines. She said threats to release “an audio bomb” against her by her detractors was nothing short of blackmail and intimidation. “Are they terrorists or elected representatives that they use words like bombs and missiles?” she sought to know. Ms. Ambareesh said rivers and dams are governed by Central Acts and are national properties and as an MP she had every right to raise issues related to its safety and seek answers. Referring to the statements of the dam authorities that the structure was safe, Ms. Ambareesh said she would not accept their claims as the were working in the department and insisted on a safety report from experts. The MP reiterated that she was not opposed to legal mining but was concerned about the illegal mining close to KRS. “I had sought an aerial survey of the area over a year ago but it is yet to be done. There is so much resistance to the visit of an MP to the mining site. So imagine the kind of threats officials may encounter if asked to survey the place,” she added. Mr. Kumaraswamy had earlier said that mining in the region had been going on for over 50 years and any agency can investigate it. Efforts to thwart visit Unidentified miscreants had dug up a portion of the road leading to one of the mining sites near Srirangapatana so as to prevent the visit of Ms. Ambareesh on Wednesday. Ms. Ambareesh said she would not be deterred by such tactics. As the convoy came to a halt, the MP got down and walked on the muddy terrain to reach the spot at Chinnakere in Srirangapatana taluk. A section of the villagers alleged that mining in the area was illegal and they had complained about it two years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/spat-over-krs-safety-and-illegal-mining-continues/article35204737.ece
08 July 2021||Shivapura,KARNATAKA||On foot, without a penny in pocket||Vivekananda H.K., 53, is walking across Karnataka with the aim of “reviving human values”. What is unique about his journey is that he is travelling without a rupee in his pocket and has vowed not to touch currency, literally. In the last 247 days, he has covered nearly 7,500 km on foot. He has been carrying just a backpack and a bottle for water. He has interacted with thousands of people along the way. At night, he sleeps wherever he feels comfortable. He eats whatever is offered by the people.  The Hindu met him while he was at Shivapura, near Tarikere, earlier this week. A native of Hoskote in Bengaluru Rural district, Mr. Vivekananda pursued a postgraduate degree in history, and followed it up with a diploma in journalism and film production. Then, he began making ad films.  For almost 25 years, he hardly got down from his car. “I was always travelling by car as part of my work. Now, this journey by foot has helped me visit innumerable villages and meet lakhs of people. I have met many interesting people who have been working for the betterment of society in their own way,” he said. His mother, wife and son reside in Bengaluru. “I gave whatever I had saved to my family, and my mother gets a pension,” said Mr. Vivekananda. He no longer touches currency. “I don’t touch money. If you wish to get me a water bottle, you have to come to a shop and get it for me. Except on few occasions, I have not missed lunch or dinner, thanks to the generosity of people,” he added. Mr. Vivekananda speaks of truth, honesty, non-violence with the people he meets. If politicians, senior officers, journalists, doctors, lawyers and teachers remain true to their conscience, this could be a better world, he said. On an average, he covers 30 km in a day. The long walk, which began at Nagamarapalli in Aurad taluk of Bidar district on November 1, 2020, is expected to end in December this year at Chamarajanagar. He has weathered the cold winter and the hot summer. Now, he is bracing for the heavy rains in Chikkamagaluru and Udupi districts. Social media posts Amidst the lockdown forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, he did not stop walking. He was able to meet friends and well-wishers along the route because of his social media posts. “I have been active on Facebook and other social media platforms. People who are on my friends’ list are aware of my route. They welcome me and offer food and water,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/on-foot-without-a-penny-in-pocket/article35204746.ece

Sayan, prime accused in the 2017 Kodanad estate heist-cum-murder case, after being informed that the trial in the case was at an advanced stage, and that it would have been completed, but for the restricted functioning of courts owing to COVID-19. Justice R. Subramanian granted bail to Sayan after taking into consideration that he was under continuous incarceration since March 1, 2019. Stating that the accused had been in prison for more than two years at a stretch, the judge did not find it necessary to keep him under duress any longer. However, when it was brought to the notice of the court that the accused hailed from Kerala and might abscond, the judge ordered that he stay in Udhagamandalam until the trial court pronounces a judgment in the case, in which only four more defence witnesses have to be examined. The case is being tried before the Nilgiris Principal District and Sessions Court in Udhagamandalam. Justice Subramanian further directed Sayan to provide two sureties to the tune of Rs. 50,000 each, and ordered that the sureties be solvent residents of either the Nilgiris or Coimbatore district. He was also ordered to report before the trial court every Monday, apart from attending regular hearings. The Kodanad estate was jointly owned by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and her close aide V.K. Sasikala. After Jayalalithaa’s death on December 5, 2016, and Sasikala’s incarceration in a disproportionate assets case on February 14, 2017, a heist was reported on the estate on the intervening night of April 23 and 24 of 2017.

The study was led by Prof. P.K. Prasad, Head, Department of Zoology, Kannur University; research scholar P.J. Jithila; adjutant faculty, A.R. Sudha Devi; and P. Abaunza, a scientist at the Insituti Espanol de Ocerajografia in Spain. The phenomenon in which parasites completely or partially disrupt the reproductive process of their hosts is called parasitic castration. A two-year study of the freshwater fish, Aplocheilus lineatus, found that the parasite completely destroyed the ovaries at all stages of the fish. This could adversely affect the reproductive process of the fish and even lead to their extinction, Mr. Prasad said. Parasites are found in shrimps, crabs and mussels, but rarely in fish. These types of parasites complete their life cycle in three or four organisms that are links in the food chain. The research team looked at how metacercaria larvae, a growth phase of the parasite, affects the reproductive process of freshwater fish. The discovery was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Parasitology International , published by Elsevier, an international publisher.

08 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Pandemic puts brakes on tourist buses||The next-to-nil demand for trips from tour groups and inter-State passengers has resulted in operators of many tourist buses and vans putting them up for sale in a desperate bid to stay afloat and tide over loan default. So much so that online sale portals are replete with images of luxury buses put up for sale at rates one could perhaps buy a premium or mid-segment sedan. Ajayan V., vice president of the Contract Carriage Operators' Association (CCOA), says the State has around 10,000 tourist buses. "A vast number of them have been put up for sale, while many old buses are being sold as scrap, for owners to mobilise funds to procure cargo autorickshaws in which they can sell produce like fruits and fish. The situation is such that many are on the verge of suicide," he says. Among them is Vinod V. of Kundara, Kollam, whose brand new AC bus that cost him Rs. 46 lakh in February last year has been put up for sale. "It operated 10,000 km for just about two months when the pandemic struck. While I paid Rs. 14 lakh from my savings, Rs. 36 lakh was raised as loan. I hope to sell off the bus for Rs. 11 lakh, and the buyer would have to repay loan balance,” he says. Capital investment The inhibition to travel in groups, especially in air-conditioned vehicles, has slammed the brakes on the prospects of the sector that was already reeling under the effect of a substantial increase in capital investment due to Bharat Stage-VI emission norms and AIS-052, the new bus-body code, says Aravind Balakrishnan, State executive committee member of the CCOA, which organised a State-wide vehicle-chain protest a week ago to highlight the perilous situation. “The ‘insensitive’ attitude of banks towards those unable to repay loan due to the pandemic-induced crisis has made matters worse. About 85% of bus owners were banking on their buses for their livelihood. The State government's lethargy in providing tax sops, including on diesel, has aggravated the crisis. The cost of bus chassis increased from Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh ever since BS-VI norms took effect. Adding to this are body-building and allied expenses that increased the cost of an AC bus to over Rs. 50 lakh, from what was about Rs. 40 lakh till four years ago," he adds. Ernakulam-based tourist bus operator Sarath G. Nair, who owns a fleet of 28 buses, speaks of how almost all private banks and non-banking financial companies are ruthlessly pressuring those who are unable to repay vehicle loans, in contravention of the RBI guidelines. "Bus operators have approached the court on the issue," he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-puts-brakes-on-tourist-buses/article35205040.ece

The aim is to convert their existing fleet of buses as “smart buses” that operate on CNG and other fuel sources that cause little air and sound pollution, have CCTV, GPS, smart ticketing and also have public information system (PIS), it is learnt. This comes in the wake of only around 200 of the 1,000 city and mofussil service buses regularly operating in the Greater Kochi area, despite relaxation in the pandemic norms. Most of the other buses have not operated for over a year, with their owners submitting the G-form to MVD, making it clear that the buses will not operate, in order to get exemption from vehicle tax which alone accounts for up to Rs. 1.20 lakh per year. “Even the buses that are in operation are not getting anything beyond Rs. 5,000 per day, although they need at least Rs. 8,000 to operate in a feasible manner. Employees of most buses are being paid only one-third of their wages due to fall in revenue. The government is not stepping in with any help either, and this could prove the death knell for the sector. It is in this dire situation that like-minded bus operators have come together to form a smart consortium,” said a bus operator, who is associated with the venture. The main aim is to retrofit CNG kits in buses. Its expenses will come to around Rs. 5 lakh per bus, and they can be recouped in less than two years - considering the over Rs. 30 price difference between diesel and CNG. But most operators are not in a position to raise even this much amount.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crisis-ridden-bus-operators-plan-cng-transition-of-city-fleet/article35205032.ece
08 July 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Teaching in unaided colleges under scanner||The Higher Education Department has plans to set up a mechanism to ensure quality of teaching and learning in unaided institutions in the State. “The idea is to have a system that would evaluate academic and infrastructure capabilities of self-financing institutions,” R. Bindu, Higher Education Minister, told The Hindu . “We have to enhance the overall quality in the self-financing sector,” she said. The Minister pointed out that the department has come across instances in which teachers in the unaided sector were not paid as per prescribed norms. “I am not saying that there is a quality deterioration across the sector. While some are functioning well, there are others who have not yet stepped up their infrastructural and academic facilities,” she said. Accreditation On the aspect of lack of accreditation for an increasing number of higher educational institutions, Dr. Bindu said it is a fact that many institutions have not yet applied for accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). “This list included government colleges. Many were finding it difficult to complete the process as it involved a lot of preparatory work. Regular transfers and retirements of Principals and other staff members in government colleges had delayed such initiatives,” she said. Of the about 1,500 higher educational institutions in the State, only 240 have any kind of accreditation, as per the estimates by the Kerala State Higher Education Council that had initiated the State-level accreditation of higher educational institutions. However, the Higher Education Department seems to be pondering over whether it would be feasible. “The question is whether it would be an additional burden on the institutions to go for accreditation at the State-level and by the NAAC,” said Dr. Bindu. Autonomous colleges Asked about the poor representation of government colleges among autonomous institutions in the State, the Minister said that it would not be a daunting task to elevate government colleges into autonomous institutions. “But it required a policy decision and further deliberations,” she said. Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam is the only government institution among the 19 autonomous colleges in the State. On the delay in the launch of open and distance learning (ODL) programmes under the Sreenarayanaguru Open University, Dr. Bindu said that the pandemic situation had delayed the approval for courses by the Distance Education Bureau (DEB) under the University Grants Commission. “However, we are hopeful of getting it before the start of the admission to undergraduate programmes this year,” said Dr. Bindu.  We have to enhance the overall quality in the self-financing sector, she says||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mechanism-to-ensure-quality-in-unaided-institutions-on-the-anvil/article35205037.ece

Ajith Kumar, managing director, Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (K-Rail), on Wednesday. Mr. Kumar banked on the well-established Land Acquisition Act and took comfort from the fact that the acquisition of land on a much larger scale for the national highway had not led to serious complaints. He was making a presentation on K-Rail at a webinar organised by the Kerala Shastra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) marking its anniversary. Mr. Kumar said that the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of SilverLine was an intellectual property of K-Rail and exempted from sharing under the Right to Information Act. “In another rail project, the Chief Information Commissioner and the Supreme Court have upheld the decision not to share the DPR,” he said. Mr. Kumar said that though Environment Impact Assessment was not needed for railway projects on account of it being the least polluting transportation mode, K-Rail had done one and shared it in the public domain. A Social Impact Assessment and public hearings were also being held by district authorities. The project, however, came in for considerable flak from experts on the panel. Alok Varma, retired chief engineer with the Indian Railways, Southern Region, remarked that the project lacked scientific objectivity, as decisions were made first and then data was sought to support them. He also questioned the decision to adopt standard gauge instead of broad gauge and wondered how any agency other than the Railway Board could unilaterally take such a decision. He said it was initially proposed as broad gauge. He said the feasibility report was based on the alignment drawn up on topography data from Google Earth without any ground investigation. He questioned the logic of conducting a ground investigation after receiving the in-principle approval for the feasibility report from the Railway Board. Mr. Varma also questioned the traffic projection of over 80,000 passengers for SilverLine with only one-seventh of the population of the proposed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, which projected a traffic of just 35,000. R.V.G. Menon, former president of KSSP, backed the arguments of Mr. Varma and questioned Mr. Kumar’s claim that doubling of the existing line was almost complete. “Had a public discussion been held when the decision to adopt standard gauge for SilverLine was made, then the majority of train passengers would have opposed it,” he said. Mr. Menon said that doubling along with modernisation of signalling would have helped the frequency of services. The Railway has shown that it can enhance the speed of services of its choice when it so desires citing the example of Janshatabdi Express operating between Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam in three-and-a-half hours.

08 July 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Move to introduce unified inspection system welcomed||The Kerala State Small Industries Association has welcomed the move by the State government to introduce a centralised and unified system to inspect factory premises. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve said on July 5 that the government was looking at forming a system of unified inspections instead of different departments carrying out checks on industrial units. Industries in the State would be categorised for the purpose of holding inspections. Low-risk industries would be subjected to minimum official oversight and inspections on high-risk category units would be carried out after proper intimation. President of Kerala State Small Industries Association M. Khalid said it had been a long-standing demand of industries in the State that the government should introduce a unified system of inspections to help industries. The government has said that each of the departments involved in carrying out inspections will prepare a list of officials who will be part of the inspection team. It has also been decided that reports on inspections would be uploaded on the Industries Department website within 48 hours and that the reports would be made available to unit owners. The decision comes in the wake of allegations by the Kitex group of companies in Kochi that 11 inspections were conducted on its factory premises in Kizhakkambalam in the month of June and that none of those who inspected the company premises issued notices to the company about the findings of the inspections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/move-to-introduce-unified-inspection-system-welcomed/article35205030.ece

The Bench led by Chief Justice S. Manikumar, while hearing a public interest litigation highlighting the issue of crowding before liquor shops, observed on Wednesday that though periodical orders had been issued by the Central and State governments regarding the pandemic protocol, they did not seem to be observed at some places, particularly before liquor shops. The court observed that the State government was trying to reduce the number of COVID cases by taking appropriate measures, vaccination, etc. Simultaneously, crowding at public places should not be allowed, more particularly, before liquor shops. Health was more important than revenue. N. Manoj Kumar, State Attorney, submitted that appropriate directions/instructions had already been issued regarding the opening of liquor shops and maintenance of the protocol. The court directed the Excise Commissioner to file a detailed report. Meanwhile, Justice Devan Ramachandran directed the Excise Commissioner to appear in person on July 8 before him, when a contempt of court petition against S. Ananthakrishnan, Excise Commissioner, and Sparjankumar, Managing Director, Bevco, for not implementing an order of the court issued in 2017 came up for hearing.

The project launched this month aimed at reaching out to 25,000 families spread across 500 libraries under the district library council. The idea was to lend one lakh books a month by giving four books to a child and cover at least 50 households in every library limits. “We expected to lend 12 lakh books a year, but is now very likely to exceed that going by the great response to the project. In fact, some of the libraries have taken it with such zeal that they have already covered over a hundred households,” said M.R. Surendran, secretary, Ernakulam District Library Council. The State Library Council is keeping a close watch on the progress of the project. “We will be collecting the figures in a fortnight and if found effective, the project will be adopted across the State,” said K.V. Kunjikrishnan, president, State Library Council. The district council launched the project after the Education Department found that reading habit among students has taken a hit in the wake of remote learning. The Chief Minister’s exhortation asking libraries to reach out to young readers at their homes came as another trigger. “The council also found that young children were increasingly getting alienated from words in the absence of constant support from teachers,” said D.R. Rajesh, secretary, library council, Kanayannur taluk. Library authorities visit households with up to 50-100 books mostly during weekends. “We usually carry children’s literary titles and also lend academic books on demand. The enthusiasm is such that when we visit a house those from the neighbourhood also approach us demanding books,” said E.R. Santhosh, secretary, Yuvakalatharang library, Elamakkara. Both English and Malayalam titles are made available. Competitions Two competitions have also been introduced to engage the young readers. Children up to class five are asked to write a page on the books they have read while those between class five and ten may submit a review of a book. The winners will be presented with small gifts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/books-at-doorstep-hit-among-schoolchildren/article35205024.ece

The export from IT companies operating out of the park rose to Rs. 6,310 crore from Rs. 5,200 crore during the previous year, a surge of Rs. 1,110 crore as per the figures as on December 2020. Currently, 415 companies are operating out of Infopark. More than 40 companies started operating from the facility during the pandemic while more are waiting their turn. Though 18 companies either downsized their workforce or ceased operations since the pandemic, it was more than compensated by the arrival of new companies. Further infrastructure developments are progressing in a fast phase at Infopark and more than six lakh square feet of new IT space will be made available by the end of the year. “Though COVID-19 has been a challenge, it has opened up new doors to opportunities and adaptations in the field of technology. Many IT employees who have been working outside are increasingly returning to Kerala. They see Kerala as a safe working place in the changed scenario and want to work here. IT companies in Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai have expressed interest in expanding their operations to Kerala to accommodate this workforce.

Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar passed the order on a writ petition filed by Ariff from Perithalmanna seeking a directive to the government to provide free treatment to his six-month-old son and to import and administer the drug, Onasemnogene Abeparvovec (Zolgensma). The petitioner said since the drug was prohibitively expensive, he could not procure it. Ventilator The government pleader submitted that the criterion prescribed for the administration of the drug was that the patient should be off the ventilator for more than 16 hours. In fact, the child of the petitioner had been on a ventilator for the last two months. Though the hospital authorities tried to wean off the child from the ventilator, they could not do so. Therefore, even if the drug was procured, it could not be administered to the child. The court felt that since the drug was expensive, a committee of expert doctors shall be constituted to form an opinion as to the correctness of the stand of the hospital authorities. When the petition came up for hearing, the government pleader pointed out that a committee could be constituted consisting of Dr. Sreekumar, Superintendent, Institute of Mother and Child Health (IMCH) Kozhikode; Dr. Shankar, genetic expert, department of paediatrics, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram; Dr. Ajithkumar V.T., head of the department of paediatrics, IMCH, Kozhikode; Dr. Mary Ipe, professor of paediatric neurology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram; Dr. Santhini, expert in emergency care, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, and Dr. Jayakrishnan, expert in intensive care, IMCH, for the purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/form-panel-to-check-veracity-of-claim-hc/article35204990.ece

Titled ‘An interactive, dynamic and scalable Ocean Visualisation Tool’, the project is said to be of use to oceanographers, naval personnel and marine engineers. “It aims to build an ocean visualisation software package that performs scalar and vector visualisation of heterogeneous ocean data, ocean phenomena like waves and ocean current visualisation, interactive visualisation of 2D, 3D and 4D data, and offers a platform for multivariate analysis of diverse ocean data. The high dimensional ocean data is really complex, thus making the task of analysis and visualisation highly challenging. The software package will also aid in the visualisation of data collected by ships and AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles),” according to Preetha K.G., associate professor in the department of computer science and engineering and one of the investigators of the project.

08 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fix transportation cost of oxygen fast, HC tells State||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to expedite the process initiated for fixing the transportation cost of liquid medical oxygen and oxygen inhalation (medical gas) in cylinders. Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar also directed the government to devise a mechanism to ensure that medical oxygen suppliers complied with an order issued by the Union Ministry of Chemical and Fertilizers which prescribed a maximum price (ex-factory), including Goods and Service Tax, for liquid medical oxygen at Rs. 15.22 a cubic metre and oxygen inhalation (medicinal gas) in cylinders at Rs. 25.71 a cubic metre. The court passed the interim order on a writ petition filed by the Kerala Private Hospitals Association seeking to restrain the suppliers of medical oxygen from increasing the prices of medical oxygen. The State government submitted that there was no regulatory mechanism for the effective implementation of the order. The government had, therefore, constituted a committee for deciding the transportation cost and for monitoring the effective implementation of the orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fix-transportation-cost-of-oxygen-fast-hc-tells-state/article35205091.ece
08 July 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Tight containment in Kollam||The district administration has stepped up containment measures and strengthened testing and surveillance in areas that reported the Delta variant of COVID-19. “Teams headed by special officers are functioning efficiently in places that reported high test positivity rate in the district,” said Kollam Collector B. Abdul Nasar on Wednesday. The authorities have issued revised guideline as per the test positivity rate-based classification and all government officials have been directed to report for duty if the TPR is below 15%. In areas coming under category C with a TPR between 10% and 15%, only 50% of the staff will attend offices. As on Wednesday, the district has only five local bodies, Karavaloor, Aryankavu, Alappad, Thenmala and Munroe Thuruthu, in the A category where the weekly TPR remains below 5%. Category D In Kollam, extra curbs will be in place in 11 local bodies that reported a TPR above 15%. The local bodies in category D include Kareepra, Kalluvathukkal, Ezhukone, Vettikavala, Kukakada, Chirakara, Mayyanad, Ummannur, Nedumbana, Kulathupuzha and Thrikkovilvattam. Testing will be intensified in railway stations and persons travelling without COVID-19 negative or vaccination certificates will be immediately shifted to domiciliary care centres.  Online classes District and regional-level development committees will be formed to ensure hassle-free online classes and steps will be taken to provide free mobile data and network coverage to students. Unlike many other districts, Kollam is yet to register a steady decline in COVID-19 cases with many parts logging several new patients. The district has been recording more than 1,000 cases almost daily except for a couple of days since the lockdown. A Central team that visited Kollam on Tuesday assessed the caseload, mortality rate, TPR, treatment provisions, facilities for children and the availability of ICUs, ventilators and oxygen beds in Kollam. The district administration has also made all arrangements to face a likely third wave by setting up paediatric ICUs and deploying extra staff.

08 July 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Students caught in a Web of dating apps, porn sites||‘Tinder’ may not be an ideal space for a 13-year-old to be, but many schoolgoers are busy swiping left or right on the dating app. As schools and universities remain closed, students are becoming increasingly hooked to the virtual world. While minors are creating fake profiles and exchanging personal information on dating sites, older students are getting addicted to pornography. “Social isolation has caused maladjustment issues, with a good percentage of them spending long hours on porn sites. Online dating, stalking, and blackmailing have become common,” says Antony Palackal, Professor and Head, Department of Sociology, University of Kerala, who is doing a study on the psychosocial effects of COVID-19-induced social isolation on university students. After interacting with PhD, postgraduate and undergraduate students, he says most youngsters are immensely affected by the situation. “They are using not just common dating apps, but exploring platforms meant for LGBTIQ+ community as well.” Mr. Palackal thinks lockdown is the main cause for this behavioural change as students have been missing all aspects of a normal campus life. “In the absence of social interaction, they are drawn to the digital world,” he says. Teachers and counsellors say they have been getting frantic calls from concerned parents. “Digital dating abuse was not a familiar term for us until recently. We always thought teenagers are relatively free from serious forms of cyberbullying,” says Anna Thomas, teacher. “Since most activities now happen online, there has been a sharp increase in cybercrime. Device addiction, abuse and gaming have surged just like online financial frauds. Cybercrime has seen an upward trend in the past 1.5 years,” says Additional Director General of Police Manoj Abraham, nodal officer of CyberDome. He adds that though porn consumption is no post-COVID-19 phenomenon, the user duration must have doubled now. “According to studies, adult websites recorded huge traffic all over the world during the pandemic. The trend applies to Kerala too” Long-term impact Experts warn that compulsive use of digital space can lead to long-term consequences, including deviant sexual behaviour. Often, this can develop into an obsession and affect one’s mental well-being. “You can gradually wean one off chatting and gaming, but that need not be the case with porn. Often parents fail to identify the problem and when they try to restrict it at a later stage, children retaliate violently. They become easily irritable and aggressive. But they can be corrected with timely intervention and proper parental supervision,” says M.P. Radhakrishnan, psychiatrist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/students-caught-in-a-web-of-dating-apps-porn-sites/article35205093.ece

08 July 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Hariharan’s fan moment with Dilip Kumar||It happened nearly 60 years ago, but director Hariharan still has vivid memories about his first meeting with Dilip Kumar. Like many filmgoers of that time, he was an admirer of the legendary actor, who died in Mumbai at the age of 98 on Wednesday. So when he came to know that Dilip Kumar would be visiting the Crown Theatre in Kozhikode on that day in 1962, Hariharan was determined to catch a glimpse of the star. “His film Gunga Jumna was being screened at Crown. I was a student of art at the Universal Arts College then,” Hariharan told The Hindu over phone from Chennai. “I had grown up watching his films, like Mughal-E-Azam, Madhumati and Footpath , and was a huge fan. So I was delighted when I could meet him and get an autograph,” he says. Cinema wasn’t exactly on Hariharan’s mind at the time. A few years later, he moved to Chennai and became an assistant director. Several meetings “I could meet Dilip Kumar on several occasions after I became part of the film industry,” Hariharan says. “When I came to know that he was shooting for the Hindi film Gopi , directed by A. Bhimsingh, at Newtone Studio in Chennai, I went to the set. I was working as associate director of the Malayalam film Kuruthykkalam , which was also shot at the same studio.” Dilip Kumar then paid a visit to the set of Kuruthykkalam . “Actors Sathyan, Madhu and Sheela were there,” he said. “Since Jose Prakash spoke good Hindi, Dilip Kumar had a long chat with him, I recall.” Hariharan said he would later try to visit Dilip Kumar during his trips to Mumbai. “I was keeping track of his health condition through a mutual friend in Mumbai,” he says. “With his death, we have lost one of the greatest actors of not just India, but the world also.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-directors-fan-moment-with-a-legend/article35204995.ece
08 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Joint drive to check illegal sand mining in Chaliyar||The Revenue Department and the police from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts are planning to intensify their joint inspections against the operation of illegal sand miners in the Chaliyar. Panchayat-level squads will be reconstituted as part of the efforts to support the joint operation covering the ignored stretches along the river bank. Police squads from Areekode, Kondotty, Vazhakkad, Mukkom, Mavoor, Feroke and Beypore will mainly team up for joint enforcement activities. All country boats and goods vehicles being used for illegal sand mining will be impounded. Patrol squads in boats will keep an eye on over-exploited locations at night. In one of the recent surprise inspections, police squads from Vazhakkad and Mukom stations seized 21 country boats used for illegal sand mining. Though workers in the boats escaped on seeing the squads, the police impounded all the boats in the midnight search. Apart from the seizure of boats, Areekode and Kondotty police had impounded a number of goods carriers which were used to cart away river sand. Many of such vehicles had no proper registration or number plates. Youngsters who drove the vehicles fled from the spot on seeing checking squads. According to Revenue Department sources, the formation of new local surveillance squads was necessary in villages like Nilambur, Edavanna, Areekode, Kizhuparamba, Mavoor, Peruvayal, Feroke and Beypore to closely track the movement of illegal operators. In some of the over-exploited locations, a few local residents were also found colluding with river sand traders for exchanging information about surprise raids and getting commission amount, they revealed. Though many local sand miners’ gangs had been busted, they are now back in business. With the pandemic-induced financial crisis, many local fishermen were also found joining such groups for quick money. Additional responsibilities on local police stations as part of COVID-19 prevention activities are reportedly weakening surveillance measures in many vulnerable locations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/joint-drive-to-check-illegal-sand-mining-in-chaliyar/article35205012.ece
08 July 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Virtual scam victims grin and bear it||Apparently fearing social humiliation, many who have lost money to the trickery of cyber scammers on Facebook are reluctant to take legal measures against them. Instead of proceeding with cases, complainants choose to leave the scene after getting the fake social media accounts of their friends deleted from the virtual space with the cyber cell’s support. Officials with the Kozhikode cyber police station said they were yet to register a First Information Report (FIR) on Facebook frauds thanks to reluctance on the part of the victims. Some do not even approach the cyber cell after closing fake accounts using the personal reporting option, they added. “A major reason for the trend is that many of those who have reported such incidents have not lost huge amounts. They also fear that any follow-up legal proceedings may spoil their peace,” said a senior officer with the cyber police station. According to him, those with high-profile jobs are concerned about losing their face owing to a reckless act. Meanwhile, a few who recently reported fake profiles claimed that cyber crime investigators too were finding it hard to track the invisible offenders mostly operating from north India. It was also evident in some suo motu cases that were registered after tracking phone numbers and bank accounts of suspected persons, the officials said, adding that the police were mostly focusing on online awareness campaigns. In some initial incidents, investigation teams had collected the telephone numbers and bank accounts used by offenders. However, it was later found that scammers were cunningly misusing multiple bank accounts they had opened in the names of illiterate people who were totally unaware of modern banking services. The feasible option then was to report such accounts to banks and get them blocked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/virtual-scam-victims-grin-and-bear-it/article35205009.ece
08 July 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Fazal murder probe in spotlight again||It will take some more time for the battle over the investigations into the political murder of Mohammad Fazal at Thalassery to run its course. The case is set to be in the spotlight again with the Kerala High Court’s order on Wednesday for a further probe into it by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The controversy over the probe into the murder of the National Development Front (NDF) [now Popular Front of India (PFI)] worker 15 years ago has not blown over, largely because of new twists given to the case after the CBI filed its chargesheet arraigning eight CPI(M) men as accused. The further investigation is expected to bring under the scanner the ‘disclosures’ that gave the new twists to the case. Sabotage bid alleged The CBI had probed the case following a High Court order on a writ filed by Mariyu, the victim’s wife, who alleged a bid to sabotage the probe by the State police. The latest court direction was issued on a plea by the victim’s brother citing the disclosure of a ‘confession’ by ‘Kuppi’ Subeesh, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker, while in police custody in another murder case, that Fazal had been hacked to death by RSS workers, including himself. Subeesh had later retracted his alleged confession stating that he was tortured by the police into making the confession. Subeesh’s ‘confession’ was the first twist in the case post the chargesheet. Kannur Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) P.P. Sadanandan had disclosed about the confession of Subeesh in June 2017. The CPI(M) expectedly stepped up its demand for further probe, for the arraignment of its leaders Karayi Rajan and Karayi Chandrashekaran was an embarrassment to the party. ‘Kodi’ Suni In addition to the two local CPI(M) leaders, who according to the CBI, had masterminded the murder of the 30-year-old, the accused included ‘Kodi’ Suni, who was since convicted in the case of the murder of Revolutionary Marxist Party leader T.P. Chandrashekaran. The case received another twist when former DySP K. Radhakrishnan disclosed in May 2018 that the then Home Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, currently CPI(M) Polit Bureau member, had removed him from the investigation duty when the probe led to suspected role of local CPI(M) workers. The former police officer, in a disclosure to a TV channel, had also linked his probe in the case and the physical attack on him by alleged CPI(M) workers at a house near Taliparambaon December 14, 2006, accusing him of involvement in immoral activities. The further probe, according to political and legal circles, is hoped to unravel the truth as it is expected to cover the two disclosures, and put an end to the case being used for propaganda war by political rivals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fazal-murder-probe-in-spotlight-again/article35205082.ece
08 July 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Conflict resolution centre a pillar of support for the needy||The Domestic Conflict Resolution Centre (DCRC) opened by the Kozhikode Rural Police a year ago in Vadakara is proving to be a pillar of support for many hapless women facing domestic violence, sexual abuse, and psychological torture. Till date, the rural centre has addressed 54 serious complaints, apart from offering professional counselling to the victims. District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) A. Sreenivas said the project, which was launched on the directive of the National Women’s Commission in 2020, has Nouyjisha, a domestic violence survivor, as the official mascot. At present, DCRS has two professional counsellors, apart from women police officers to take care of additional responsibilities. In the wake of the pandemic situation, the centre is also offering virtual support through telecounselling and online complaint submission services. “Both reconciliatory and legal methods are adopted based on the gravity of the situation. First, we visit the houses of complainants for verification. Sadly, a majority of cases that we investigate pertain to torture by husbands and in-laws,” said Usha Devi, a Circle Inspector who heads the centre. She pointed out that there had been a rise in the number of confidential complaints owing to the full-fledged functioning of the special unit. One of the advantages of DCRC is that it connects local police stations with complainants for quick follow-up action after the preliminary probe. Cases that are not properly investigated by local police stations are handed over to a separate investigation team after getting clearance from the District Police Chief. Officials with DCRC said they expected a spike in the number of direct complaints after the lockdown, given that there were women who found it difficult to avail the online grievance redressal mechanism or telecounselling support. Officials made it clear that the Pink patrol squad was closely monitoring all suspected cases based on intelligence inputs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/conflict-resolution-centre-a-pillar-of-support-for-the-needy/article35205007.ece
08 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||INL and NSC look set to go their separate ways||An ambitious merger between the Indian National League (INL) and the National Secular Conference (NSC) at the behest of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI-M] two years ago has turned into a damp squib as the two parties appear to be parting ways. Both the INL, a party formed by Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait, the then national president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) 27 years ago following the Babri Masjid demolition, and the NSC led by P.T.A. Rahim, MLA, have been feeling unpleasant about the merger that technically happened for political reasons. The induction of INL general secretary Ahamed Devarkovil into the Pinarayi Vijayan 2.0 Cabinet has given a new lease of political life for the party. But for the NSC, it has been caught in its own web of Koduvally politics. Even after the merger in March 2019, Mr. Rahim, a CPI (M)-backed Independent legislator from Kunnamangalam, was not a member of the INL. Similar was the case with the former Koduvally MLA Karat Razak, who had also won as a Left-backed Independent candidate in 2016 Assembly elections. Love-hate relationship From the outset, the love-hate relationship between the leaders of the two political entities came to the fore despite the INL accommodating the NSC leaders into the frontline of the party. Now, these NSC leaders have become a liability for the INL, said a senior party functionary. Certainly, this difference of opinion has been attributed to the incompatible political culture of the two parties. More than coexisting, the INL-NSC merger impacted the organisational set-up of the party as well as civil polity, said a senior party leader. Sources saidt the merger, which many INL leaders believed would pave the way for expanding the anti- IUML platform, only wobbled disastrously. The victory of controversial businessman Karat Faisal, who stood as an Independent candidate from a ward in the Koduvally municipality, was an embarrassment for the party as the INL nominee Abdul Rasheed polled no votes. And now, it has been caught up in a controversial Public Service Commission (PSC) membership scandal. Revival mode For the NSC, its leadership is planning to revive its own political entity with Koduvally-Kunnamangalam as its focus of activity even as the INL is preparing for a membership campaign. For the INL, a ‘purification’ process has already started, while for the NSC, it will revert to its own Koduvally politics. But both will remain in the Left fold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/inl-nsc-now-set-to-part-ways/article35205003.ece

08 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Order on backlog posts for disabled ‘incorrect’||A recent order by the Social Justice Department saying there are no backlog posts for persons with disabilities in government departments between 1996 and 2017 has incurred the wrath of organisations representing differently-abled persons. K.N. Anand, State vice president, Differently abled Employees Association, said on Wednesday that the order was based on a report of an expert committee of retired government officials which claimed that 3% reservation was followed in all appointments made between the above years. He pointed out that the order had violated a Supreme Court directive. “The Supreme Court on October 8, 2013, had sought a report in three months on vacancies in government departments for implementing 3% reservation for differently abled persons as mandated by the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995. All vacancies from February 2, 1996, the date of the enactment of the legislation, were asked to be reported. The order followed a petition filed by the National Federation for the Blind,” he said. Mr. Anand alleged that the Kerala government did not act on the order till 2017. A Government Order was issued in the same year after many petitions were filed before the Kerala High Court. A panel consisting of retired IAS officials M. Gireesh Kumar, S. Suresh Chandran, K. Bahuleyan Nair, and S. Vijaya Mohan was appointed by the Social Justice Department to formulate modalities for the implementation of reservation. The report was submitted on December 27, 2018. It was made available in the public domain for people to express their views on May 27, 2019. The last date to express views was June 10. The report was published only in English language, and details were not made available in the Malayalam media. Mr. Anand alleged that the constitution of the committee itself had drawn flak on various counts, such as how the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities was excluded from it. Its terms of reference too were objected to. Also, data on appointments from the Kerala Public Service Commission, public sector units, and autonomous institutions reveal that the figures given by the committee on backlog vacancies are incorrect, he claimed.

Siddique has demanded that a high-level independent team of experts probe the “drastic under-counting of COVID-19 deaths” in the State. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Siddique said that the probe should be carried out by bodies such as the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Indian Medical Association which were not controlled by the government. Action should be taken against those involved in under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, he said. He also accused the government of under-reporting COVID-19 fatalities only to secure awards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-covid-death-count-says-congress/article35205004.ece
08 July 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||Rebellion sites to be made tourist spots||The historic sites in Malappuram district that witnessed the Malabar Mappila Rebellion of 1921 will soon have a prominent position in the State’s tourism map. Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas indicated that the rebellion had given Malappuram a unique position not only in the State’s history but also in the country’s struggle for independence. The table-top tourist destination of Kottakkunnu here is poised to take the lead in marking the cultural and historic uniqueness of the district prominently in the State’s tourism map. “Immense is the potential of Malappuram in lifting the State’s tourism. Kerala is known for its bold stand in resisting attempts by some sections to portray the historic struggle against colonialists as a communal riot,” said Mr. Riyas. “The Kerala government has declared those who took part in the rebellion as freedom fighters and instituted a pension for them,” he said. Mr. Riyas visited Kottakkunnu, which witnessed the killing of Mappila leader Variyamkunnathu Kunhahammed Haji after the British troops captured him through treachery from Chokad. According to Mr. Riyas, Kottakkunnu continues to give energy for struggles against imperialism. “It gives strong memories. Memories of Variyamkunnathu Kunhahammed Haji who asked the British to shoot him from the front and not from the back, and that too without blindfolding,” he said. Efforts will be made to develop Kottakkunnu to enhance the tourism attraction of the district soon after the second wave of COVID-19 dies down, the Minister said. Besides holding a high-level meeting to discuss the tourism potential of Malappuram district, study reports on cracks at Kottakkunnu be given due consideration. Tourism in the district will be developed by giving thrust to historic locations like Pookkottur and Tirur. “A considerable part of the literary tourism circuit being developed in the State is passing through Malappuram,” he said. Earlier, the Minister held discussions with P. Ubaidullah, MLA; District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan, Malappuram Municipal Chairperson Mujeeb Kaderi, and several government officials.

In a letter to Chief Secretary V.P.Joy, he noted that all the districts in Kerala had reported more than 200 daily cases in the week ending July 4 and two of the 14 districts had shown an increase in new cases over the past four weeks. The letter stressed the need to ramp up testing and vaccination, ensure clinical management and availability of oxygen-supported and ICU beds and enforce COVID-appropriate behaviour to control the spread of infection in the community. Citing an analysis which flagged critical areas of concern, Mr.Bhushan said Kollam and Wayanad districts had shown an increase in the number of weekly deaths over the last four weeks while Thrissur and Malappuram had reported more than 70 deaths in the week ending July 4 and Thiruvananthapuram had registered 111 deaths in the same period. Seven districts, namely Kannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and Thrissur, had more than 100 new cases in the previous week with weekly positivity rate of more than 10%. Increase tests He urged the State to strengthen efforts for contact tracing and called for a microanalysis of high TPR areas. The State should aim at maintaining a positivity rate of below 5% in each district by increasing the number of tests. The letter underlined the need to ensure timely disclosure of the availability of healthcare infrastructure on public portals or through the media. It also called for closer monitoring of COVID fatalities, including deaths reported between 24, 48 and 72 hours of hospitalisation, and deployment of strategic vaccination centres near containment zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/centre-flags-high-tpr-in-the-state/article35205089.ece

08 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||PSC told to include questions on Malayalam in teacher tests||The State government has asked the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) to include questions on Malayalam in examinations conducted by it for appointment of lower and upper primary teachers to State schools. In a letter to the Secretary of the Kerala Public Service Commission, the government has said that all examinations for appointment of lower primary/upper primary assistants (teachers) conducted by the PSC should include questions for 20 marks to test the candidates’ aptitude in Malayalam. The government had, in October last year, sought the PSC’s opinion on the matter, and the PSC had in turn submitted a report to it. In a statement on Wednesday, the Aikya Malayala Prasthanam that had launched a campaign to press for the inclusion of Malayalam questions in the tests said the government direction to the PSC was a culmination of its mass representation that was submitted to the Chief Minister 10 months ago. Signature campaign The online signature campaign was inaugurated by filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan on September 14 and garnered 34,237 signatures. The signatories included prominent names such as M.T. Vasudevan Nair, the late Sugathakumari, M. Leelavathy, K. Satchidanandan, C. Radhakrishnan, M. Mukundan, N.S. Madhavan, V. Madhusoodanan Nair, and George Onakkoor. The Aikya Malayala Prasthanam had alleged that the PSC was continuing its neglect of Malayalam in employment examinations despite the Chief Minister’s assurances that question papers for tests with graduation being the minimum qualification would be prepared in Malayalam. The organisation said in its statement that formation of a ministerial-level department was imperative for the sake of Malayalam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/psc-told-to-include-questions-on-malayalam/article35204996.ece
08 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Panel issues directive to schools on readmission fee||No educational institution in the State can charge readmission fee from a child citing delay in fee payments, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has said. Acting on a petition filed by the father of a student in Ernakulam district, the commission recently directed the Director of General Education, CBSE Regional Officer, and the ICSE Secretary to issue orders in this regard. Report sought The petitioner had said the school where his child was studying had allowed a 30% cut in fee. However, owing to delay in remitting the third instalment of the fee, the school was insisting on paying Rs. 1,000 as readmission fee. Demanding such an amount at a time when classes were being held online was illegal, he had contended. The commission, comprising member K. Nazeer, sought a report from the Principal of the school concerned. In the report, the Principal said the school had slashed its fee by 30% in the wake of COVID-19. The exact time for remitting the fee had been included in the school diary. The diary had also mentioned that those delaying fee payment would have to pay a fine and readmission fee, and the petitioner was aware of this fact. Deadline extended The deadline for remitting fee had been extended many a time following parents’ requests, and hence there was no option but to disallow the petitioner’s child from the classes. In its order, the commission said it was clear from the petition and the school’s report that the school was charging readmission fee from those not paying fee in time. Private schools had the right to seek legitimate fee from students. However, charging readmission fee on the grounds of delay in fee payment was against Sections 3 and 12 of the Right to Education (RTE) Act. Rights violation Whatever be the head under which it was charged, except for legitimate fee no readmission fee could be charged from students this academic year citing delay in fee payments. Demanding readmission fee was a violation of child rights and should not be allowed in schools. The CBSE Regional Officer should direct the school Principal to return the readmission fee charged, the commission said.

The current practice of depicting inputs given by the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) alone as the State’s power policy has resulted in consumers being denied several benefits mentioned in Central policies. An advisory panel of experts on the sector should be formed to ensure proper representation of all stakeholders, the Kerala High Tension and Extra High Tension Industrial Electricity Consumers’ Association has intimated Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty. Tariff subsidy New industries offering direct employment to 50 people and indirect employment to 50 more should be given 50% subsidy on electricity tariffs for the next five years. Companies should be permitted to purchase electricity at lower rates from outside the State and cross subsidy should be waived on such purchases. New industries and expanded units of factories should be given a waiver on electricity duty for five years, it said. Interval for inspections The association has urged the government to set five years as the interval for the periodical inspections carried out by the Electrical Inspectorate. A single-window approval mechanism should be instituted for industries to obtain clearances from the Electrical Inspectorate, State Pollution Control Board, the Factories and Boilers Department, local bodies and the Legal Metrology Department, the association said.

The decision was made to avoid clashing of dates with the third session of the JEE-Main entrance examination from July 20 to 25. The revised schedule will be announced later. The declaration of the schedule of the third and fourth sessions of JEE-Main a day ago sparked a clamour for postponement by several aspirants of engineering and pharmacy entrance in the State who feared the possibility of having to forego one of the examinations. The decision finally came in the aftermath of a discussion that Higher Education Minister R. Bindu had with CEE A. Geetha on Wednesday. The window that commenced on Wednesday to rectify defects in the applications submitted by KEAM candidates has also been suspended for the time being. An opportunity will be provided close to the examination date, an official release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keam-entrance-examination-postponed/article35205085.ece
08 July 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Ruckus at Thrissur Corpn. meet||The special council meeting of Thrissur Corporation council on Wednesday witnessed tense moments as the Opposition members, comprising the Congress and the BJP councillors, gheraoed Mayor M.K. Varghese. The council meeting was convened to discuss the controversial new master plan for city development. The Opposition demanded dropping the master plan, which was approved by the government. “The master plan, which was not approved by the Corporation council, cannot be implemented,” said Opposition leader Rajan Pallan. The Opposition alleged that former Mayor Ajitha Vijayan and the Corporation secretary submitted the plan to the government without the knowledge of the council. “They were cheating the people. We can’t allow it,” Mr. Pallan said. When the Opposition leader was denied permission to speak in the meeting, the Congress members ran to the well of the council and gheraoed Mr. Varghese. The BJP members too soon joined them. Mock salute Tense moments prevailed when the LDF councillors reached the well in support of the Mayor even as some of the Opposition members mockingly saluted the Mayor. Recently, Mr. Varghese’s complaint to the DGP that the police personnel on duty were not saluting him was in the news. The Mayor promised the Opposition members to rectify the shortcomings in the master plan, if any. “The plan, which has been pending for 47 years, has been given the approval by the government now,” the Mayor said. However, the Opposition maintained that the master plan was “anti-people”. Mr. Pallan alleged that LDF leaders, including former Minister A.C. Moideen, pressured the chief town planner to give it the green signal. Even the then Thrissur MLA and former Minister V.S Sunil Kumar was not involved in the discussion, he said. Though Mr. Pallan asked the Mayor for a vote on demand to cancel the master plan, the latter dismissed the meeting without further discussion. At any cost However, standing committee chairman Varghese Kandamkulathy insisted that the Corporation would implement the plan at any cost. He challenged the Opposition members to move court if they had any complaint. “It’s a master plan to save Thrissur,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ruckus-at-thrissur-corpn-meet/article35205163.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Political parties in State embroiled in rows||Mainstream political parties in Kerala seem to have been caught in a web of controversies and internal strife even after the conclusion of the Assembly elections. Despite achieving a historic continuance in power, the ruling (CPI(M) is apparently grappling to shrug off the issue of its cadres’ alleged involvement in smuggling and looting, especially after the Calicut airport gold smuggling incident. Now, the party leadership is compelled to act against those lower-rung activists who involve in nefarious operations and yet enjoy the patronage of the party. This was despite the party emerging victorious and remaining unscathed even after blistering attacks against it by the Congress-led Opposition in connection with the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case and allegations of nepotism. CPI’s state In the case of its junior partner, the CPI, its leadership is facing criticism over Revenue orders for felling scheduled trees on assigned land, also during the previous government’s term. In the eyes of the public, former Ministers E. Chandrasekharan and K. Raju, who were holding the Revenue and Forest portfolios respectively, continue to be suspicious over the contentious orders issued on March 11, 2020 and on October 24, 2020. Further, it has come to light that Mr. Chandrasekharan had issued orders overruling objections from officials even before clarity was received from the Law Department on provisions for tree-felling. Plight of Congress As for the Congress, the State leadership is still in a bind over its restructuring even after the appointment of the new president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) last month. New party chief K. Sudhakaran’s muscular and hard-hitting style of functioning has not been received well by groups affiliated to former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. Even as he is besieged by detractors, Mr. Sudhakaran also has to fend for himself after the LDF government ordered a probe by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau against him on a petition filed by his former driver alleging that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. BJP’s affairs Nevertheless, the leadership of the faction-ridden BJP is facing perhaps the worst phase in the history of the party. Party State office-bearers, including president K. Surendran and organising secretary M. Ganesh, are facing probe in the Kodakara money heist case. This apart, the BJP is not out of the woods yet from its biggest embarrassment over poll-fund misuse and losing the lone Nemom seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/political-parties-in-state-embroiled-in-rows/article35204993.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A commendable attempt at shaking a societal norm||Dislodging ideas cast in stone requires more than a gentle push. In Sara's , director Jude Anthany Joseph and scriptwriter Akshay Hareesh attempt to shake from its foundation one such idea, which has been accepted as normal in society, and by extension in mainstream cinema. Sara (Anna Ben), an associate director in the film industry, wants to make a movie of her own. While working on the script for her dream debut, she meets Jeevan (Sunny Wayne) who is taking a break back home, away from the hectic life in the IT industry. They fall in love, with Sara especially being drawn to him for the fact that he shares her choice to remain child-free. But, as time passes, societal pressures begin to act on them. In his third outing too, Jude Anthany Joseph sticks to a woman-centric subject, but the similarity with the previous two films ends there, except for the relationship between Sara and her father, which is similar to the one in Ohm Shanthi Oshana . He also retains the somewhat light treatment that he gave for heavy subjects here too. It works at times, but at other times it leaves us wishing for something more concrete. What deserves applause though is the fact that the script never diverts from the central idea, which revolves around Sara's choice and her intense wish to become a filmmaker. The narrative is a deft balance between these two, for the societal pressures on her choice in turn has a bearing on her dream too. It also portrays her struggles to convince producers with her script, which we are told, does not have the elements expected from a mainstream film. As for Jude's film, the laudable progressive stand that it takes does not always make up for the plain, lazy filmmaking in some parts. Other than Sara's character, the rest of them appear hazy and stuck in a single tone. The transformation in some characters too appears quick and rather convenient. In real world, women like Sara will not have it easy, as the protagonist here has. Brave reversal Yet, this is a brave reversal of years of glorification of motherhood and looking down upon those who dare to take a path of their choice. It is a study in contrast to films like the Salman Khan-starrer Sultan , which had a woman wrestler who was working towards an Olympic gold, giving up the dream after she becomes pregnant, with the script glorifying it. Anna Ben's assured performance goes a long way in propping up the film even in places where it sags due to below-par writing. Despite the glitches, Sara's is a commendable attempt at course correction on some deeply set societal norms. S.R. Praveen    Film: Sara's Starring: Anna Ben, Sunny Wayne Direction: Jude Anthany Joseph||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-commendable-attempt-at-shaking-a-societal-norm/article35205059.ece

08 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||NO2 pollution a problem in major cities: Greenpeace||Despite initial gains during the national lockdown in 2020 and subsequent ones imposed by various State governments this year to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, pollution levels remained a problem in major cities in the country. A new report from Greenpeace India revealed that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution increased in all eight most populous State capitals studied. Among Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow, the national capital saw the most dramatic increase between April 2020 and April 2021. NO2 is a dangerous air pollutant that is released when fuel is burned, including in most motor vehicles, power generation, and industrial processes. Exposure is known to severely impact people’s health at all ages, including the respiratory and circulatory systems and the brain, leading to increases in hospital admissions and mortality, Greenpeace said. “According to satellite observations, NO2 pollution in Bengaluru increased by 90% between April 2020 and April 2021. The weather had only little contribution to this change. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125%, in Mumbai, 52% higher, Hyderabad by 69%, Chennai by 94%, Kolkata by 11%, Jaipur by 47%, and Lucknow by 32% in April 2021 than in the same month of the previous year,” a release said. Greenpeace pointed out that as the pandemic continues to have a severe impact, there is growing evidence that polluted cities suffer disproportionately more coronavirus cases. “The health impact of fossil-fuel related air pollution is severe and has been reflected time and again in several reports. Yet, there has been little change to our reliance on fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas, increased economic activity is still largely coupled to toxic air pollution in most of the cities,” the release said. Avinash Chanchal, Senior Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India, said air quality levels in these cities are alarming and the people are already paying a huge price for our reliance on burning fossil fuels. “People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown, though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case to transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility must be central to recovery efforts across cities. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution,” he said. He recommended that governments, local administration and city planners must initiate the transition from privately owned vehicles to an efficient, clean and safe public transport system that is run on clean energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no2-pollution-a-problem-in-major-cities-greenpeace/article35204604.ece

08 July 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police launch campaign urging Maoists to join the mainstream||As part of a multi-pronged strategy to ensure surrender of key Maoist cadres active in the forest region along the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border, the Bhadrachalam sub-division police launched a campaign titled ‘ Intiki Randi-Kutumbamtho Jeevinchandi ’ (Return to your home – live with your families). The campaign forms the crux of the uni-focal strategy of the police to reach out to the family members of the underground Maoist guerrillas in the remote tribal habitations along the inter-State border to persuade them to prevail upon the Maoists working underground to join the mainstream. The move comes ahead of the CPI (Maoist)’s Martyrs’ week slated to be held from July 28 to August 3. The COVID-19 lockdown period in the past two months saw vigorous outreach activities by the police in the remote tribal pockets of Bhadrachalam Agency bordering the Maoist strongholds in Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar division. The CPI (Maoist) Manuguru Local Organising Squad (LOS) Area Committee Member (ACM) Madivi Iduma alias Surender, 23, along with his wife Madakam Budri alias Sony, 23, Dalam member, surrendered before the Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt in Kothagudem last month. Police sources said the couple surrendered due to fear of the spread of COVID-19 among Maoist ranks. About 19 Maoist militia/village committee members from three remote tribal habitations in Charla and Dummugudem mandals turned themselves in before the police in Kothagudem on June 15. Mr Sunil Dutt interacted with the family members of several Maoist underground cadres during a meeting held to mark the launch of Intiki Randi-Kutumbamtho Jeevinchandi campaign at Charla police station on Monday. The SP handed over rice and groceries to the family members of the Maoist rebels on the occasion. The SP called upon the Maoist guerrillas to abjure violence and return to the mainstream to live a normal life along with their family members by availing the government’s rehabilitation package for surrendered Maoists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-launch-campaign-urging-maoists-to-join-the-mainstream/article35205285.ece

Sri Ranganatha Raju on Wednesday said “Pedalandariki Illu” scheme was a continuous process and not even a single beneficiary would be left out of the housing scheme. He said of the 31 lakh housing units, as many as 17.6 lakh units were already sanctioned and the remaining target would be grounded on a war-footing. The Minister was speaking at the district-level review meeting on housing and agriculture issues at Srinivasa Auditorium at Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati. ‘Employment generator’ The Minister said that in order to expedite construction of as many as 17,005 Jagananna Colonies in the State, a toll free number was put in place for queries regarding supply of sand, cement, steel and construction material. “The housing scheme is expected to create assets to the tune of Rs. 4 lakh crores and employment to lakhs of families,” Mr Raju said. Minister for Panchayat Raj P. Ramachandra Reddy said the prime objective of setting of the district-level agriculture advisory boards was to stand by the farmers and to resolve their problems. “During the Rythu Chaitanya Yatras, scheduled from July 9 to 22, as many as 187 Rythu Bharosa Kendras and 5 agriculture labs would be inaugurated in Chittoor district,” the Minister said. The RBKs would also look into the aspects of generating support price to the crops and localized crop patterns for better yields. Coconut saplings Deputy Chief Minister K.

Jagan Mohan Reddy to make infrastructure tycoon Goutham Adani as Rajya Sabha MP from Andhra Pradesh. Speaking to mediapersons at Tirupati after participating in the Congress party’s stir against hike in petrol and diesel prices at Jyothirao Phule statue, Mr. Chinta Mohan said the speculation regarding the alleged Rajya Sabha membership to Mr. Adani ,with the YSR Congress Party support, was rife in New Delhi. The former Minister said the skyrocketing of prices of essential goods and steep rise in prices of petrol and diesel had thrown the poor and middleclass sections into a debt trap. “Due to sliding of economy, even the IAS and IPS officers are not getting their salaries on time in the State. The health workers at SVRR Hospital in Tirupati have not been paid their salaries for one year,” Mr. Mohan said. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president, S.Sailajanath and its secretary C.D. Meyyappan launched a cycle rally against the price hike of petrol and diesel at Jyothirao Phule statue in Tirupati. In another stir, the police took the activists of the Telugu Yuvatha into custody after foiling their bike-rally in Tirupati which was to demand cancellation of the “Job calendar” of the YSRCP government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-ysrcp-struck-deal-to-favour-adani-as-mp-chinta/article35205136.ece

08 July 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ryots worried over delay in water release from Sagar||Farmers in the Krishna Western Delta (KWD) and Nagarjuna Sagar ayacut are a harried lot as Telangana showed no signs of abating from its stand on power generation at Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and K.L Rao Pulichintala multi-purpose projects. The “indiscriminate” drawal of water by Telangana had hurt the farmers of the lower riparian State of Andhra Pradesh and had affected the plans of the Andhra Pradesh government to release water into Krishna Western Delta on July 1 and water into Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal on August 15.   So far, Telangana had utilised 19 tmcft of water from Srisailam reservoir of the 26 tmcft of inflows since June 1, thereby making it near possible to reach the water levels of +854 feet. The MDDL was essential for drawing water through gravity for the schemes dependant on Pothireddypadu Head Regulator, which could severe distress to drought prone regions of Rayalaseema, Nellore, Prakasam districts. The present water levels of Srisailam reservoir stand at 814.3ft with a gross storage capacity of 36.93 tmncft as against the Full Reservoir Level of 885ft and storage capacity of 215.8 tmcft. On July 1, Telangana drew 29,682 cusecs of water for power generation when the gross storage was at 43.55ft, the highest drawal of water since June 1. On June 19, it drew 3,818 cusecs when the gross storage was at 39.84ft. The situation at Nagarjuna Sagar is no better. The present water levels at Nagarjuna Sagar stand at 531.7ft with a gross storage capacity of 171.48 tmcft as against the Full Reservoir Level of 590ft and storage capacity of 312.04 tmcft. Water would be released to Sagar Right Canal if the storage capacity reaches at least 270 tmcft. With dwindling inflows from Srisailam, there is no certainty over water releases, leaving farmers in 6.54 lakh acres in the lurch. Krishna Western Delta has an ayacut of 4.99 lakh acres requiring 69 tmcft of water. With Telangana stepping up of power generation at full steam at all reservoirs, outflows at Prakasam Barrage increased to 8,000 cusecs flowing into the Bay of Bengal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ryots-worried-over-delay-in-water-release-from-sagar/article35205155.ece

On Wednesday, it saw a return of such festive mood after a good seven-year gap, when the newly appointed Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A Revanth Reddy took over the reins of the party that saw a series of defeats in elections despite delivering the 70-year-old dream of a separate State. The entire space was filled while the remaining cadre that turned up in large numbers had to stay on the roads with the gates locked. Most roads from the city led to Gandhi Bhavan with a large number of enthused cadre turning up from across the State. The setting was the perfect launchpad for Mr Revanth to roar against the government and send a signal that the fight had begun and the beleaguered Congress workers would not budge now. He said the same in as many words, receiving huge applause from the cadre. The entire show saw the projection of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as the leaders of the party and Mr. Revanth just as their nominee. When some cadre raised slogans in favour of Revanth, he chided them and warned them of suspension from the party. “Only Sonia and Rahul are our leaders and we all are their soldiers,” he said reminding them that from now onwards individual praise will not be tolerated. Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy and his brother and Munugode MLA Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy were conspicuous by their absence despite the presence of top leaders from AICC. Mr. Venkata Reddy had openly expressed his displeasure on the very day the new PCC chief’s name was announced. MLC T Jeevan Reddy too did not turn up, but sent a message wishing the best for the new team. Huge rally Earlier, Mr Revanth Reddy came in a huge rally after performing puja at the Peddamma temple in Jubilee Hills and on the way at Nampally dargah. The stamp of Mr Revanth Reddy in the entire ceremony was visible with the party banners occupying all the billboards en route and the followers raising slogans of Congress coming back.

Special Court for trial of MPs/MLAs judge Varaprasad held Mr. Nagender and Mr. Raju guilty of assaulting a person and awarded the punishment. Along with the jail term, the MLA and his driver were imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 each. In default of payment of fine, they should undergo one more month of simple imprisonment. The case was registered against Mr. Nagender when he was the minister of erstwhile A.P. Cabinet. “The complainant Subba Rao was driving a vehicle and stopped before a traffic signal. Raju, who was travelling in another vehicle, had an altercation with him over stopping at the signal,” Special Public Prosecutor G. Narayana said. Both went to the police station.

08 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram/Kochi,ANDHRA PRADESH||ISRO spy case: bail plea of former DGP adjourned||A court here on Wednesday adjourned till July 12 the hearing on the anticipatory bail plea of former Kerala Director General of Police (DGP) Siby Mathews in a case registered by the the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him and 17 other police officers in connection with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage case. Principal District and Sessions Judge P. Krishnakumar posted the matter to next week after the district court was told that bail applications of two other accused in the case were pending before the Kerala High Court and that the matter was likely to be heard during the day. “If similar matters are pending before the High Court, let’s see what happens there,” the court said. Two Maldivian women, “wrongfully” arraigned as accused in the case have opposed Mr. Mathews’ anticipatory bail petition. Mr. Mathews had moved the district court here for protection from arrest after the CBI named him as accused in the 1994 “police frame-up” case. Former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan, the de facto complainant in the case, had done the same earlier. The CBI on Wednesday informed the High Court that if anticipatory bail was granted to the two former police officers, S. Vijayan and Thampi S. Durga Dutt, it would cause serious prejudice to the investigation in the case. In a statement filed before the High Court, the CBI pointed out that the police officers had played an active role and concocted an espionage case following a conspiracy with the other accused in the FIR and other unknown persons. The petitioners were still very influential as they were seated in the offices of power. If bail was granted, it would create fear in the minds of probable witnesses who may otherwise speak the truth. They were well versed in investigation techniques, the CBI said.

08 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jana Sena PAC resolves to expose ‘government’s failures’||The Jana Sena Party’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) has resolved to ‘expose the YSRCP government’s failures’ including on the law and order front, and demanded that the facts behind the standoff with Telangana on the Krishna river water utilisation should be put in the public domain. In its meeting at the party office near Mangalagiri on Wednesday, the committee observed that the Disha app and Disha police stations were only ‘meant to give publicity to the government and were serving little purpose as the attacks on women and girls were going on unabated’. The alleged sexual assault of a woman on the Krishna riverbank and the police failure in apprehending the culprits reflected the sordid state of affairs, the committee said. “The officials are playing the role of spectators to the attacks on those expressing their resentment against the government on various policy matters. Sarpanches who had the Jana Sena’s support are being intimidated by the YSRCP leaders and the police are turning a blind eye to such incidents,” said Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan. ‘Farmers in dire straits’ Mr. Kalyan said that farmers in the State were in dire straits due to the vagaries of the market and natural calamities, but the government was least bothered about their plight. “The government has failed in the procurement of paddy and compensating the loss incurred by mango farmers and others. It is making false claims that it has given a new lease of life to the farmers who have lost their crops, by providing them input subsidy and insurance,” he said. The party would fight for the cause of farmers, who were left in the lurch by the government’s ‘irrational policies’. The government had been saying that it was taking necessary market intervention measures from time to time to mitigate the woes of farmers, but the situation on the ground was telling a different story, he added. ‘Job calendar a letdown’ The job calendar was a big letdown for the unemployed youth, Mr. Kalyan alleged, warning that if the government did not do justice to them, the Jana Sena would stage protests across the State. Later, several families living in close proximity to the Chief Minister’s camp office at Tadepalli complained to Mr. Kalyan that they were asked to vacate their houses on security grounds and those who questioned the decision were being threatened. The JSP chief said he would see to it that they were not evicted in the name of Chief Minister’s security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jana-sena-pac-resolves-to-expose-governments-failures/article35205284.ece

University and College of Food Science and Technology, Pulivendula, for the invention titled, ‘A process for preparing dehydrated fruit bar from prickly pear fruits ( Opuntia ficus indica ) and product thereof’. Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University Vice-Chancellor A. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said on Wednesday that the patent was granted to the team that comprised Chennakesava Reddy Sangati (the then Teaching Associate, CFST, Pulivendula), Sucharitha Kumaram Venkata, Syamala Boreddy, Eswara Reddy, Narreddy Peddanarapagari, and Dr. Kaleemullah Shaik (the then Associate Dean & Professor (Co-Chairman), CFST, Pulivendula). The invention discloses the process for preparing the dehydrated fruit bar from prickly pear fruit. “The process involves harvesting the prickly pear fruit with predetermined total soluble solids (TSS) and acidity value. Thereafter, the glochids and thorns are removed. The fruit is then blanched in water at 60° C for five minutes. Later, pulping of the fruit is carried out using the Partial Cooking of Pulp (PCP) method at 65° C for 20 minutes to obtain pulp,” Prof. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said. “Subsequently, the pulp is pasteurised at 70° C for 15 minutes for destruction of micro-organism. Then the TSS value, acidity value and consistency is adjusted by adding jaggery, citric acid and papaya pulp extract respectively. After that the pulp is filtered and sheeting is carried with predetermined thickness. Finally, the sheeted pulp is dried at 60°C for 18 hours and the dried pulp is cut into small bars to obtain the dehydrated prickly pear fruit bar,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/process-for-preparing-dehydrated-prickly-pear-fruit-bar-gets-patent/article35204680.ece
08 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||CM urges Modi to intervene in Krishna water dispute with TS||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday reiterated that the drawing of water from the common reservoirs on the Krishna river by Telangana allegedly without obtaining the necessary clearances from the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) warranted his (the PM’s) intervention, lest Andhra Pradesh would suffer a grave injustice . The Chief Minister stated that the Telangana government was drawing water from Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar (NSP) and Pulichintala projects for hydel power generation in blatant violation of the Andhra Pradesh State Reorganisation Act, 2014 and the established protocol which mandates that the irrigation requirements are to be met first and only then water can be drawn for power generation and drinking water purposes. Despite repeated complaints to the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS), and the KRMB, wherein it was requested to stop Telangana from constructing unauthorised projects and from drawing water without the appraisal of DPRs by the KRMB, scrutiny by the Central Water Commission and approvals of the Apex Council, no effective steps have been taken so far to protect the legitimate rights of Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy pointed out. He appealed to the Prime Minister to intervene and direct the MoJS and the Telangana government to take action that would enable Andhra Pradesh to utilise its rightful share of water from the projects on the Krishna River.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-urges-modi-to-intervene-in-krishna-water-dispute-with-ts/article35205152.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy, opposing the alleged eviction of the Polavaram project evacuees from their villages without paying the promised compensation. “The second Detailed Project Report (DPR) was approved by the technical wing of the Central Water Commission (CWC). However, the Ministry of Finance is yet to allocate Rs. 55,548 crore to the State as approved by the CWC. As per the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, the project evacuees should be paid Rs. 33,000 crore, but only Rs. 7,000 crore has been paid so far,” Mr. Ramakrishna pointed out in his letter. He alleged that the State government had neither paid the promised compensation nor provided the rehabilitation to the evacuees. “The police even did not allow the villagers who were returning from a weekly shanty to return to their villages,” he said. The CPI leader accused the revenue and police officials of intimidating the evacuees to vacate the villages. “The Chief Minister must ensure that the evacuees get justice,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-seeks-justice-for-polavaram-evacuees/article35205157.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has alleged that the State government has failed in ensuring remunerative prices for agricultural produces, at a time when farmers were enduring severe financial problems because of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement on Wednesday on the eve of Farmers’ Day being organised in the State, the former Chief Minister said that the farmers had lost crops in more than 37 lakh acres to seven cyclones that hit the State since 2020, incurring a loss of Rs. 15,000 crore. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to compensate 58 lakh farmers, but the number was brought down to 26 lakh. The disaster management department estimated the paddy loss to be Rs. 15,000 per acre but the government gave just Rs. 4,000,” said Mr. Naidu. He pointed out that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had demanded Rs. 30,000 per acre when he was in the opposition. “Now, the his (Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy) government has reduced the compensation to Rs. 5,000 per acre. In 2018, the TDP government provided Rs. 1,860 crore as crop loss compensation,” he said. The government owes an explanation as to why just Rs. 7,500 was paid under the ‘Rythu Bharosa’ scheme, contrary to the pre-poll promise of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy to pay Rs. 13,500. “The Rythu Bharosa benefits were promised for 15 lakh tenant farmers, but was given to just 41,000,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-demands-payment-of-farmers-dues/article35205161.ece

08 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Negligence caused Anakapalle flyover mishap, allege residents||Anakapalle locals and political leaders on Wednesday alleged that a cocktail of poor construction quality, human error and lack of safety measures led to the collapse of two girders from a flyover here that left two people dead and three injured. The under-construction flyover, coming up at the Y-Junction in Anakapalle, is part of the Anandapuram-Anakapalle highway project. Two concrete girders spanning 40 m in width and weighing over 35 tonnes came crashing down on a lorry and another vehicle that were below the flyover on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves in the town. The highway project covers a distance of 51 km and is being built at an estimated budget of Rs. 2,000 crore. Once completed, the flyover will connect the State Highway to NH-16. Sources said that the private construction company tasked with the project had erected the pre-fabricated the girders two weeks ago. Senior architects and structural engineers in the city say that while there may not have been any faults in the structural design, the incident itself could have occurred due to improper alignment of the girders. Speaking to The Hindu , CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao, who visited the accident spot, said that the government should conduct a full-fledged investigation by constituting a committee headed by a retired judge to ascertain the cause of the mishap. The investigation team should verify whether there were issues in the design or quality of the materials used for construction. The State government should immediately arrest the contractor and also blacklist the company for their negligence, Mr. Narasinga Rao said. CPI(M) district secretary K. Lokanadham added that the Anandapuram-Anakapalle project should have been completed by July, but had overshot its target. He also alleged lack of proper supervision and measures by the National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI) during its construction. The State government should pay ex gratia of Rs. 1 crore to the family members of the victim and provide proper treatment to the injured, he said. Residents shocked The incident has left residents of Anakapalle in shock. People questioned how the officials allowed passing of vehicles under a bridge which was still under construction. “A large number of people from Vizag travel under the flyover. The NHAI should have asked the contractor to cordon off the area and not allow free passage below it. What if there was a school bus or several two-wheelers under the bridge when the accident occurred?” asked A. Radhakrishna, a resident of Anakapalle. Soon after the incident, officials cordoned off the route under the bridge and diverted the traffic from Anakapalle to Vizag city, resulting in long traffic snarls. ‘Delayed response’ Locals alleged that even as the incident was reported at around 5 p.m., rescue operations commenced an hour later at around 8 p.m. The bodies of the victims were removed from the cabins of the vehicles at around 11 p.m, locals alleged. Anakapalle Town police inspector L. Bhaskar Rao said that cases have been booked under relevant sections of the IPC against the construction manager and general manager of the private contracting firm Dilip Buildcon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/negligence-led-to-anakapalle-flyover-mishap-allege-locals/article35204689.ece

The membes said it is the responsibility of the municipal corporation to collect garbage from every household and transport it to the dumping yard and dispose of it. The members also criticised corporators who voted in favour of the proposal at the council meeting. VARWA general secretary B.B. Ganesh said that collection of user charges on garbage collection is a step towards commercialisation of civic services. The notification also includes levying of penalties. The GVMC is meting out stepmotherly treatment to the people of the city, he alleged. Meanwhile, CPI(M) leader and Ward 78 corporator B. Ganga Rao said that at a time when people are under financial pressure due to the increase in prices of fuel, essential commodities and the COVID-19 situation, the State government is trying to add even more burden by levying taxes on basic civic services. He added that the State government is failing to collect funds from the Centre, due to which it is depending on commoners to meet its financial needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/resident-associations-up-in-arms-over-garbage-tax/article35205296.ece
08 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Webinars helped doctors to understand pandemic better||In March 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was detected in the district, it threw up a challenge to the medical fraternity. The disease was new, and the treatment protocols too were evolving with every passing day, and it was not something that could be learnt about from a textbook. At that juncture, District Collector V. Vinay Chand and Principal of Andhra Medical College and district COVID Special Officer P.V. Sudhakar evolved an innovative learning process. They decided to conduct a series of webinars in collaboration with doctors from the United States. Till date, over 75 webinars were conducted and each of them was a learning experience for the participants, as they shared their knowledge about the latest treatment protocols and discussed critical case studies, to evolve effective methods of treatment. There were a number of learning experiences such as when to administer steroids, how to administer them and in how much quantity, said Dr. Sudhakar. The seminars were open to all in the medical fraternity, especially those engaged in COVID treatment, and experts from the USA, UK and India were roped in to share their knowledge about the pandemic. Alumni of Andhra Medical College, now in top positions in the USA, such as Dr. Sridhar Chilimuri, physician-in-chief and chairman of the department of medicine at Bronx Care Hospital in New York, and Dr. Ram Mohan Kairam, paediatric neurologist in Texas, played a leading role in disseminating relevant information through the webinars, he said. Key issues, such as how and when to administer oxygen, were discussed in detail and it was during these webinars that the plasma therapy was negated. “Initially, plasma was said to be a critical treatment protocol. In the beginning it was thought that plasma should be given just before the patient required ventilator treatment. Then it was said it should be administered within the first five days of being infected, and finally, after taking into account evidence-based data, it was said that plasma therapy was of no use,” said Dr. Sudhakar. “Apart from discussing clinical management, importance was given to evidence-based studies and peer reviews were conducted in the webinars. We learnt by discussing how cases were handled by respective doctors and this gave us a window not only to rectify flaws, but also evolve treatment protocol and clinical management,” said Dr. Sudhakar. The webinars were held every Sunday at a time convenient for all and the practice is still being continued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/webinars-helped-doctors-understand-pandemic-better/article35205279.ece

Luckily, no casualties were reported. The accident occurred at 4.30 a.m., barely an hour before morning walkers teem the stretch of road. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ch, Adinarayana said that the incident occurred when the lorry driver was heading towards Port Road from Anandapuram. The driver, who escaped with minor injuries, claimed that the vehicle’s brakes failed while coming down the steep slope. An investigation would reveal the actual cause, Mr. Adinarayana said. The road adjoining Hotel Novotel has seen similar accidents in the past. On August 6, 2006, a water tanker rammed the parapet wall, killing three and injuring many. On June 4, 2014, one person was killed and eight injured in an auto-rickshaw accident at the same junction. On April 30, 2017, a private school bus rammed into the parapet wall, killing a person and injuring four. On February 7, 2019, a sand lorry crashed at the same spot. A year later, on October 12, 2020, a lorry came crashing down the road into the parapet wall. Fortunately, no casualties were reported in these two incidents. Walkers expressed concern over the unfailing regularity of accidents in the area. Mr. Adinarayana said caution boards had been erected and speedbreakers laid on the road to prevent accidents. Traffic police would man the area from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/truck-carrying-boulders-tips-over-in-front-of-hotel-novotel/article35205300.ece

08 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Opening bank accounts helped the poor: BJP MP||BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Arun Singh said that the country’s GDP will increase only with the provision of basic amenities, and India can become a $5 trillion economy only through development of human resources. Mr. Singh was speaking at an ‘intellectual meet’ organised by the party, here on Wednesday. “While the allocation for the health sector was a mere Rs. 34,000 crore in the 2013-14 budget, it was increased to Rs. 2,23,000 crore in the present budget. An amount of Rs. 5 lakh crore was allocated to provision of basic amenities in the health sector,” he said. Mr. Singh said that the agriculture sector’s supply chain management was being strengthened and farmers were given freedom to sell their produce without any restrictions. An amount of Rs. 1 lakh crore was being spent on improvement of basic amenities in rural areas. He felt that farmers would be able to grow better crops only if their income is increased. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had initiated inclusive growth after 70 years of Independence by directing the banks to open accounts in the names of those who did not even have a bank account. Accounts were opened in the names of 40 crore poor beneficiaries who had no accounts till then. The money being given to them under various welfare schemes was being directly transferred to their accounts, thereby eliminating middlemen, who were earlier siphoning off the funds,” he said. The opening of bank accounts proved to be a boon during the COVID-19 pandemic for transfer of funds, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/opening-bank-accounts-helped-the-poor-bjp-mp/article35205287.ece

It called upon all eligible agencies and bidders to preview and download the RFP document from the websites of DIPAM and submit their tenders online. Commenting on the development, Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee chairman Ch. Narasinga Rao alleged that the move to engage a Legal Adviser, without following the established procedure of preparing a detailed report on the assets and liabilities of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP)-RINL, would be opposed by the VSP Protection Struggle Committee. “We won’t allow any legal adviser to enter the plant.

08 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Rally for Revanth halts traffic||Traffic was thrown out of gear as a marching procession was taken up by supporters of newly- appointed TPCC president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, who took charge at Gandhi Bhavan on Wednesday. Prayers The TPCC chief offered prayers at Peddamma Talli Temple at Jubilee Hills in the morning and proceeded to Nampally Dargah and from there to Gandhi Bhavan. The entire stretch was chock-a-block with vehicles proceeding bumper-to-bumper. Off-guard Commuters were off-guard as there was no prior advisory from Hyderabad Traffic Police. The swelling vehicular traffic had even spilled over to the lanes and bylanes with criss-crossing of two-wheelers, cars, and other utility vehicles. The impact of the traffic jam due to the procession was such that all the main arterial roads in Begumpet, SR Nagar, Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, Punjagutta, Himayath Nagar, Abids, Vijay Nagar colony, Koti and other busy routes, were also jammed. A commuter said that it took more than 30 minutes to reach Koti from Abids, which during normal traffic can be completed in less than 10 minutes. Similar was the situation between Jubilee Hills checkpost and TDP Bhavan. “My car was going at a speed of less than 5 km per hour from Jubilee Hills to Banjara Hills. The traffic was mad, bumper-to-bumper,” said P Sai Kiran, who works at a VFX company. Not anticipating this traffic jam, the Hyderabad Traffic police did not alert commuters in advance. Though it issued an advisory on Wednesday afternoon, it had no consequential effect on the traffic as many commuters were already stuck on the roads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rally-for-revanth-halts-traffic/article35204981.ece
08 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Road brings doom to lake||Bird paradise of the city, Ameenpur lake, presents an ugly picture these days. A road in the process of construction cuts across the lake, dividing the water mass into two irreconcilable parts. To a casual onlooker, the road appears a brazen encroachment into the lake, as there is no drain connecting the two parts. Heaps of earth still lay on both sides of the freshly-laid road which connects Ameenpur to a private layout on the other side. The privately constructed road, however, has got legal sanction from the High Court recently, which penalised the Irrigation officials for damaging the road reportedly when repairs were underway. If used as a precedent, the judgment would put into question the full tank levels of several lakes in and around the city, leading to a plethora of petitions and reduced extent of water bodies. Irrigation officials claim that the road was a recent development, and a clear encroachment into the lake. Traditionally in Telangana, it had been a practice to give land titles within the lake bed, for agriculture during summer months when water receded. Ameenpur lake too, has a sizeable chunk of patta land inside, which as per the rule book, should be used only for agriculture. The road is part of such land, claim officials, contending that it comes under the Full Tank Level. In their defence, the petitioners produced a copy of the Irrigation memoirs from the days before FTL was reckoned, which showed the lake’s extent as just a little over 93 acres. Further, they produced evidence of HMDA regularising a few plots in 2012, only to claim later that they were part of the lake’s FTL. The petitioners explained away the present water spread as the lake’s flood flows drowning the lands around, due to negligence of the Irrigation officials in ensuring proper drainage by keeping weirs and sluices operational. According to the joint FTL survey conducted in 2016-2017 by Revenue and Irrigation departments along with HMDA based on the guidelines of Lake Protection Committee, the Ameenpur lake’s FTL area has been determined as 465 acres, which is exactly five times the extent mentioned in Irrigation memoirs. “The FTL area was filled with water when heavy rains last October brought in flood flows,” an official recounted. While the officials say that sluices were meant only to release water for agriculture, and not to empty the lake, the court order asks them to keep sluices and weirs operational so that all flood water is drained. It would mean that any influx of water into the lake over and above 93 acres spread should be deemed as flood water, and released downstream. If implemented in letter and spirit, this order could raise the hopes of several other patta holders within the present water spread who could claim their lands back from the lake, drastically bringing down its extent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/road-brings-doom-to-ameenpur-lake/article35204976.ece
08 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||New Operation Theatre complex opened at OGH||A new Operation Theatre Complex at Osmania General Hospital (OGH), Afzalgunj, was inaugurated on Wednesday. The complex is located in a renovated GHMC building on the hospital’s premises. It has three Operation Theatres (OTs) with 10 operation tables. A 22-bed post-operative ward facility is also available there. Hospital superintendent B. Nagender who inaugurated the complex said that departments of general surgery, orthopaedics, and surgical gastroenterology, will conduct operations in the complex. The hospital was in dire need of the OTs after the heritage block (in-patient) block was closed last year. Doctors from multiple departments were taking turns to perform surgeries in the existing OTs. OGH is one among the two largest government tertiary care facilities in Telangana with various specialist doctors. A majority of the patients who seek admission at this hospital hail from a disadvantaged economic background. People from far-away districts and neighbouring States also opt for services here. ‘Improve infra’ While doctors at OGH are happy about the new OT complex, they said the hospital needs more such resources, especially since the number of patients in need of elective surgeries has been increasing with the decline in COVID-19 cases. “Patient numbers will pick up further in the coming weeks. What we need is more ward beds to accommodate pre and post-operative patients,” said a doctor who performs surgeries at the hospital. “The number of post graduates has increased at our hospital, which means we can attend more patients. Since most patients who get admitted at OGH are poor, additional infrastructure would help us take care of them,” said a senior doctor at the hospital. The doctors and nurses have been demanding a new building for the hospital for the past several years. This demand came to the fore a few weeks ago when Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi demanded the State government build a new hospital on the same area at a cost of Rs. 1,000 crore. OGH doctors said issues with infrastructure and discomfort of patients can be addressed if a new structure is built for the hospital.  The number of post graduates has increased at our hospital, which means we can attend more patients. Additional infrastructure would help us take care of them.

08 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||What is govt. doing to fill posts in Health dept., asks HC||Telangana High Court on Wednesday instructed the State government to file an affidavit on the steps taken to fill up nearly 35,000 vacancies in Medical and Health department. Expressing concern over the response of the State government to COVID-19 pandemic situation, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy passed the direction to Health Secretary while hearing a batch of PIL pleas connected to COVID-19 issues. The bench also wanted Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao to file an affidavit on a gamut of subjects, including the details of sero surveillance connected to coronavirus conducted by the State government. The bench observed that class IV employees in Medical and Health department (most of whom were reportedly appointed on contractual basis or outsourced) would have rendered committed services if they were regularised. “What steps had the government taken to regularise these contractual or outsourced employees,” the CJ sought to know from Mr. Srinivasa Rao. Referring to teachers who had lost their lives due to COVID-19, the bench asked the government what financial assistance and benefits were extended to the families of teachers who died of the virus. The bench also wanted to know if the government had any strategy to help COVID-19 patients, who were discharged from hospitals, to improve their mental status having faced serious ailments. Mr. Rao explained that the State government had put in place a system of health workers who would continuously monitor condition of persons affected by COVID-19. Even after being sent home from hospitals, these workers were going and meeting them to ascertain their condition, he told the bench. Taking on record the status reports submitted by the DGP, Director General of Prisons and Public Health Director, the bench expressed concern over RT-PCR tests being far less compared to Rapid Antigen Tests conducted to diagnose coronavirus. The bench instructed Mr. Srinivasa Rao give details of the districts where incidence of COVID-19 pandemic was still high. Mr. Rao explained to the court that though actions of cancelling licenses of private hospitals indulging in excessive bills were being taken, the law did not permit imposition of heavy fines on them. As per the Acts related to the subject, the fine amount prescribed were less. Changes had to be made to the provisions of the Act in this regard, he told the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/what-is-the-govt-doing-to-fill-up-posts-in-health-dept-asks-hc/article35204969.ece

08 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TELANGANA||Fresh summons to Surendran likely||The police are reportedly poised to issue a second summons to BJP State president K. Surendran for questioning in connection with the theft of unaccounted cash from a car at Kodakara in Thrissur on April 3. Mr. Surendran was earlier asked to appear before the investigating officer at the Thrissur Police Club on July 6. The leader had pleaded inability to ensure personal appearance given the BJP State office-bearers’ meeting in Kasaragod. Moreover, the BJP had alleged that Mr. Surendran was the victim of a political witch-hunt. The party reportedly felt that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government hoped to score a propaganda win by making a political spectacle out of Mr. Surendran’s arrival at the Police Club. The politically touchy case has its provenance in a complaint filed by a person that anonymous persons had ambushed his car and stolen Rs. 25 lakh on April 3, three days before the 2021 Assembly elections in the State. The complainant later moved the court stating that the cash was accounted for and was the proceeds from his business transactions. 23 arrested so far So far, the police have arrested 23 persons and recovered Rs. 1.75 crore out of the estimated Rs. 3 crore actually lost in the highway robbery. They have recorded the statement of 96 witnesses. On June 1, the police passed on the details of the crime to the Enforcement Directorate (ED).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-may-issue-summons-again-to-surendran-in-kerala-heist-case/article35204617.ece
08 July 2021||Mumbai,||Won’t arrest Param Bir till July 29: State to HC||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that it would not arrest former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh till July 29 in a case registered against him. The statement was made before a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar. The court was hearing a petition filed by Mr. Singh seeking to quash an FIR filed against him at Bazzar Peth police station in Kalyan and also registered at Akola. The plea said, “The FIR refers to an event of 2015 and is belatedly registered after having failed to pressure him to withdraw his complaint against former Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.” On March 20 last, Mr. Singh wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleging that Mr. Deshmukh directed suspended police officer Sachin Vaze to collect Rs. 100 crore from bars and restaurants over a month. The FIR was registered on April 24, 2021, by police inspector Bhimraj Ghadge against Mr. Singh under several sections of the Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the Civil Rights Protection Act, the Indian Penal Code, and the Maharashtra Police Act, at Akola.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/wont-arrest-param-bir-till-july-29-state-to-hc/article35204871.ece
08 July 2021||Mumbai,||Soon, a special cell to protect doctors from complaints by patients’ relatives||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that it was in the process of constituting a special cell by next week to protect doctors against unnecessary police complaints by kin of patients. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by one Dr. Rajeev Joshi, seeking orders from the court to protect doctors from being attacked by families of patients. The PIL alleged that Maharashtra witnessed the maximum number of such instances of violence. According to the plea, the State government had failed to implement the Maharashtra Medicare Service, Persons and Medicare Institutions (Prevention of violence and damage or loss of property) Act, 2010, to curb such instances. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the special cell would consist of experts from the medical field, senior police officers, and stakeholders. He said that the duty of the cell would be to examine complaints of medical negligence against doctors and hospitals and only after verifying how genuine the complaint was, the police station concerned would register an FIR. With respect to complaints of vandalism and attack on doctors and hospitals, the Indian Penal Code was sufficient to deal with them, Mr. Kumbhakoni said. The Chief Justice said there was a similar committee in West Bengal that comprised nine members, including IPS officers and doctors, and suggested that the cell here could be formed on similar lines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/soon-a-special-cell-to-protect-doctors-from-complaints-by-patients-relatives/article35204868.ece
08 July 2021||Mumbai,||State land appears paternal property of executive, says Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said it appears that the ‘State’s property was the paternal property of the executive’ while commenting on the rampant illegal constructions in Mumbai. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation following the collapse of a building in Bhiwandi last year. While 41 people, including three toddlers and 18 children, were killed in the incident, the National Disaster Response Force rescued 25 people. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, along with advocate Joel Carlos, representing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), informed the court that the civic body could not act against encroachers as the State government’s slum rehabilitation policy protected them. Mr. Chinoy said that the BMC had a limited role to play as an external authority. ‘Statutory protection’ State Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said that the government’s slum rehabilitation policy granted statutory protection against the demolition of structures constructed before January 1, 2000, and not higher than 14 feet. He said the structures of slum dwellers with valid photo identity cards were protected and could not be demolished. Mr. Kumbhakoni added that successive governments had extended the cut-off date for protecting tenements in notified slum areas till 2000. The court said, “The moment you [State] bring them under a beneficial scheme, State land and corporation lands are written off. It seems like the State’s property is the paternal property of the executive.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/state-land-appears-paternal-property-of-executive-says-bombay-hc/article35204869.ece

The active case tally rose to 1,14,625. A total of 326 deaths have been added to the progressive death toll, with 98 of those occurring in the last 48 hours and 49 being from the past week. A further 179 fatalities have been added as per the ongoing ‘reconciliation’ process. The State’s total death toll has climbed to 1,23,857 with the State’s case fatality rate standing at 2.01%. The State’s total cases have reached 61,22,893 while its cumulative recoveries have gone up to 58,81,167 with the recovery rate standing at 96.05%. “Of a total 4,31,24,800 laboratory samples tested thus far, 61,22,893 (with the average case positivity falling incrementally to 14.2%) have returned positive with over 2.16 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said. Pune reported 1,533 new cases taking its total case tally to 10,63,678. Seven deaths were reported as the fatality toll rose to 17,034.

08 July 2021||Pune,||Pune fire: flagrant violation of safety norms, labour laws at chemical unit, reveals report||A fact-finding team, probing the horrific Pune chemical factory blaze last month in which 17 workers, most of them women, were killed, has found that the factory owners flagrantly violated safety and labour laws and that the authorities from the State Industrial Safety and Health Department connived with the factory owners in granting the firm a licence in the absence of all safety norms. A fire erupted on June 7 on the premises of SVS Aqua Technologies in Mulshi taluk. The blaze, which sounded like a bomb explosion to 37 workers trapped inside the cramped working space, spread with such rapid intensity that 17 of them were charred to death. The team, organised by the Trade Union Action Committee, comprised Nitish Nawsagaray, a professor at the city-based ILS Law College; Vivek Patwardhan, a senior HR professional; advocate Vishal Jadhav; health and safety expert Prahlad Malvadkar; and social researcher Roma Makati. It held detailed interviews with the survivors, the kin of the deceased, and the Pune division and district authorities. No training for workers The report revealed that the factory had been in operation since 2012 but had neither obtained a licence under the Factories Act, 1948, nor even bothered to acquire one till 2020. Contrary to the line given out by the factory owners, the workers were not given any training on the safety precautions or made aware of the enormous risk of handling chemicals, it said. “Since commencement of its operations in 2012, no officer of the Industrial Safety and Health Department had ever visited the factory nor sent any notice even once till December last year regarding norms flouted by it. It was also learnt the visit [by an authority] was the result of an unrecorded fire that had occurred in the factory earlier,” Dr. Nawsagaray said. The officer’s report to the Industrial Safety and Health Department in December 14 last had raised objections regarding the process, safety and the layout of the factory even. The fact-finding team revealed that after the official’s visit, the plan of the existing factory building was filed with the authorities of the Industrial Safety and Health Department in February last and “hurriedly approved” by the Industrial Additional Director of Industrial Safety and Health. “The Director neither visited nor inspected the existing factory structure before approving the said plan which, he was legally duty bound to do. The factory plan itself reveals that it did not provide sufficient fire exits and doors. The windows shown in the plan were, in fact, sealed with grills right from the beginning. It showed many elements that never existed on the site, thus making it to be a fraudulent and fake submission,” said advocate Jadhav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pune-fire-flagrant-violation-of-safety-norms-labour-laws-at-chemical-unit-reveals-report/article35204872.ece
08 July 2021||PORT-AU-PRINCE,||Haiti President Jovenel Moïse assassinated, First Lady injured||Gunmen assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and wounded his wife in their home early on Wednesday, inflicting more chaos on the Caribbean country that was already enduring gang violence, soaring inflation and protests by Opposition supporters who accused the leader of increasing authoritarianism. Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, who confirmed the killing, said the police and the military were in control of security in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas where a history of dictatorship and political upheaval have long stymied the consolidation of democratic rule. Despite Mr. Joseph’s assurances that order would prevail, there was confusion about who should take control and widespread anxiety among Haitians. Authorities declared a “state of siege” in the country and closed the international airport. The normally bustling streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, were empty and quiet on Wednesday. Sporadic gunshots were heard in the distance, public transportation was scarce, and some people searched for businesses that were open to buy food and water. ‘Foreign mercenaries’ Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian Ambassador to the United States, said the attack on the 53-year-old Mr. Moïse was carried out by “well-trained professional commandos” and “foreign mercenaries” who were masquerading as agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Mr. Moïse’s wife, Martine, was in a stable but critical condition and efforts were under way to move her to Miami for treatment, Mr. Edmond said in Washington. Haiti has asked the U.S. government for assistance with the investigation, he said, adding that the assassins could have escaped over the land border to the Dominican Republic or by sea. Haiti appeared to be heading for fresh volatility ahead of general elections later this year. Mr. Moïse had been ruling by decree for more than a year after failing to hold elections, and the Opposition demanded that he step down in recent months, saying he was leading it toward yet another grim period of authoritarianism. Mr. Joseph said the heavily armed gunmen spoke Spanish or English, but he gave no details on the attack. The White House described the attack as “horrific” and “tragic”, and said it was still gathering information to brief President Joe Biden, spokesperson Jen Psaki said. “The message to the people of Haiti is this is a tragic tragedy,” she said. “And we stand ready and stand by them to provide any assistance that’s needed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/haiti-president-jovenel-mose-assassinated-first-lady-injured/article35204376.ece
08 July 2021||COLOMBO,||Lanka issues coin for CPC centenary||In a rare diplomatic gesture,  Sri Lanka has issued a commemorative coin marking the centenary of the Chinese Communist Party. The country’s Central Bank on Tuesday said it has minted two coins in gold and silver, in connection with the Party's 100th anniversary, and 65 years of Sri Lanka-China relations. “The coins have been issued at the request of the government of Sri Lanka as an accolade for long-standing friendship and mutual trust between the two countries,” a statement from the apex bank said. One of the coins, of LKR 1,000 denomination, bears the words ‘Communist Party of China’ in Sinhala, Tamil and English, and the years 1921-2021, along with the anniversary year 100, while the other has a view of the China-built Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre [located in Colombo], with national flags of Sri Lanka and China, and the words ‘Sri Lanka-China 65 Years’ and year 2022 inscribed, according to the statement. Central Bank Governor W.D. Lakshman presented the first coin to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Tuesday. Economic help The apex bank’s move comes amid substantial economic assistance from China to Sri Lanka. While Sri Lanka already owes China over $5 billion from past loans, Beijing sanctioned an additional $1 billion in loan and about $1.5 billion in a currency swap to help Colombo combat its economic crisis since the pandemic hit the island nation in March 2020. Speaking in a virtual conference to commemorate the Chinese Community Party’s centenary, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on Wednesday said China was one of Sri Lanka’s “most sincere friends”. “The Communist Party of China is currently the world’s largest political party, which has delivered a very important message to the world on foreign relations for the past 70 years,” he said, pointing to bilateral relations since 1957, and relations between the Communist parties of both countries since the 1940s. “I am aware that it was the foreign policy positions of the CPC that elevated China on the global stage. However, China has never tried to impose its own political views on the world,” PM Rajapaksa said. “China has also never felt the need to manipulate the affairs of other countries. China has helped the other countries, keeping them at the same level, which is a very important matter for a country’s independence as well as its sovereignty,” he said, even as sections within Sri Lanka, including political allies of the Rajapaksas, remain fiercely critical of Western and Indian “interference” that they see as a threat to the country’s sovereignty. Further, commending China on its poverty eradication programme, Mr. Rajapaksa said China always believed that improving infrastructure would “provide new ways and new strengths for the people.” “Therefore, we have constantly invited China to help develop the infrastructure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/lanka-issues-coin-for-cpc-centenary/article35204380.ece
08 July 2021||Afghanistan,||Taliban attack Afghan provincial capital||The Taliban launched a major assault on a provincial capital in Afghanistan on Wednesday, the first since the U.S. military began its final drawdown of troops from the country, as insurgents press on with a blistering offensive. Fierce fighting erupted in the western city of Qala-i-Naw, the capital of Badghis, with the militants seizing police headquarters and offices of the country’s spy agency. As news of the morning assault spread, social media was flooded with videos of clashes — with some showing armed Taliban fighters on motorbikes entering the city as onlookers cheered. Afghanistan’s Defence Minister Bismillah Mohammadi said government forces were in a “very sensitive military situation”, adding that “the war is raging” with the Taliban. The onslaught came hours after Washington announced that U.S. forces had completed more than 90% of their withdrawal from Afghanistan, and as the Kabul government held talks with Taliban representatives in neighbouring Iran. The militants have waged a dizzying campaign across Afghanistan since U.S. and NATO forces announced the final withdrawal from the country in early May, seizing dozens of districts and stirring fears that the government is in crisis. “The enemy has entered the city, all the districts have fallen,” Badghis Governor Hessamuddin Shams told reporters in a text message. He attempted to calm the residents later in another video message, appearing with a rifle — with gunfire rattling in the distance. “I assure you that we will, all of us, together defend the city,” he said.   Hours after the attack, the Defence Ministry said its troops had cleared “most parts” of the city. Afghan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh tweeted that the bodies of “tens” of Taliban fighters were lying in the streets. “I demand the respected ICRC (Red Cross) and other organisations to transfer the bodies... The weather is hot, and we do not support disrespecting the bodies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-attack-afghan-provincial-capital/article35204371.ece
08 July 2021||Washington,||Trump files suits against FB, Twitter and Google||Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he is filing suits against Facebook, Twitter and Google, as well as their CEOs. Mr. Trump said he was serving as lead plaintiff in the class-action suits, claiming he has been wrongfully censored by the companies. “We’re demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and cancelling that you know so well,” Mr. Trump said. The suits were filed in U.S. District Court for Florida’s southern district. Mr. Trump was suspended from Twitter and Facebook after his followers stormed the Capitol building on January 6. The companies cited concerns that he would incite further violence. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has continued to spread lies about the 2020 election, baselessly claiming that he won. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material that users post. The law, which provides a legal “safe harbour” for Internet companies, also allows social media platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in “good faith.” But Mr. Trump and other politicians have long argued that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-files-suits-against-fb-twitter-and-google/article35204373.ece
08 July 2021||Beijing,||China fines Internet giants in anti-monopoly cases||Companies, including Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent, were fined on Wednesday by anti-monopoly regulators in a new move to tighten control over their fast-developing industries. In 22 cases, companies were fined 5,00,000 yuan ($75,000) each for actions, including acquiring stakes in other companies that might improperly increase their market power, the State Administration for Market Regulation announced. It said violators include six companies owned by Alibaba Group and five by Tencent Holding Ltd. China’s leaders worry about the dominance of its biggest Internet companies, which are expanding into finance, health services and other sensitive areas. The ruling Communist Party says anti-monopoly enforcement, especially in tech, is a priority this year. In the biggest penalty to date, Alibaba was fined 18.3 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) in April on charges of suppressing competition. Other companies have been fined or reprimanded for violating competition, data protection, censorship and other rules. On Sunday, ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc. was ordered to overhaul its collection and handling of customer data.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-fines-internet-giants-in-anti-monopoly-cases/article35204374.ece
08 July 2021||ISMAILIA,||Megaship heads out of Suez after Egypt deal||Egyptian authorities announced the release on Wednesday of a hulking shipping vessel that had blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week in March after running aground. The Ever Given left the canal’s Great Bitter Lake, where it had been held for more than three months amid a financial dispute. The development came after its Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., reached a settlement with canal authorities over a compensation amount following weeks of negotiations and a court stand-off. The settlement deal was signed in a ceremony on Wednesday in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, after which the vessel was seen sailing to the Mediterranean Sea. The company said the vessel would undergo a dive survey in Egypt’s Mediterranean city of Port Said, before resuming her voyage to the next port where her cargo will be discharged.  Officials did not reveal details on the terms of the settlement. At first, the Suez Canal Authority had demanded $916 million in compensation, which was later lowered to $550 million. In addition to the money, local reports said the canal would also receive a tugboat. The money, according to canal authorities, would cover the salvage operation, costs of stalled canal traffic, and lost transit fees for the six days the Ever Given had blocked the crucial waterway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/megaship-heads-out-of-suez-after-egypt-deal/article35204378.ece

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Darkness at noon, felled by the judiciary||It has been 81 years since Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at Noon was first published. The novel is set in the backdrop of the Great Purge of the late 1930s in the Soviet Union under Stalin. This period was marked by, among other things, political repression, police surveillance, general suspicion of the opposition, imprisonment, and executions. Decades on, thousands of miles away, darkness fell at noon in India too, when Father Stan Swamy passed away at a private hospital in Mumbai on July 5. Ominously reminiscent of the macabre world Koestler had drawn, Fr. Swamy’s death is much more than the death of an activist accused of terrorist activities. It is the result of a systemic abuse of majoritarian authority and disregard for the rule of law. His life in a nutshell For many, Fr. Swamy will be remembered as an inspiration. A Jesuit priest, he chose to make the upliftment of marginalised communities in Jharkhand his life’s work. He lived and worked in a single room, prolifically writing (over 70 books are credited to him) on dispossessed people. He was an activist for most of his life, and used the legal system to fight for the rights of those who were being unfairly targeted, and thought that the Constitution would help in securing justice, even moving the Jharkhand High Court in a public interest litigation on undertrials. When doing all of this, surely, he would never have imagined that his fate would be decided by the very system he used and believed in. It started in August 2018, when the Pune police raided Fr. Swamy’s single-room home, seized his computer, cell phone, books and some classical music cassettes. Another raid took place in June 2019. Finally, on October 8, 2020, Fr. Swamy was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the 16th to join a roster of professors, activists, writers, and public intellectuals, as a suspect in the Bhima-Koregaon case. Fr. Swamy, aged over 80, remained an accused, in the custody of the state, till his death. Besides being arrested for what many believe to be improbable causes, and being possibly the oldest person ever accused of terrorism in India, the most tragic story is how his detention was handled by the state, by the police and worst of all, by the courts. Fr. Swamy was arrested on flimsy evidence of some propaganda material and communication with other activists in the field, such as Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao, who were also arrested for similar charges. The authenticity of some of the allegedly indicting documentation, including a key report, has been questioned by international forensic data experts. But the state defended its arrest arguing that these issues must be gone into only during trial, and that the accused — i.e., Fr. Swamy — should remain in jail until then. Pointer to judicial decline This is the outcome also of the problematic Watali judgment, which I discuss in subsequent paragraphs. Repeated pleas for medical assistance by Fr. Swamy were consistently ignored or dismissed. Medical reports taken on record clearly showed that Fr. Swamy had the degenerative Parkinson’s disease, and could not even do basic tasks, such as holding a spoon, writing, walking or bathing. Indeed, the court noted that he had a severe hearing problem, and was physically very weak. But even that did not move them. Every regular bail application that was filed by his lawyers was unequivocally rejected. When he applied for medical bail, the court kept adjourning the matter, and merely offered him the services of a private hospital. In my opinion, this demonstrates a lack of sensitivity on the part of the judges, which is deeply saddening. The series of events that led to Fr. Swamy’s eventual and tragic passing is testimony to the judicial decline that we have seen in recent years, which coincidentally or not, appears to be coterminous with the current political regime in India. Why is the political establishment, and the police, so emboldened to pursue cases under UAPA against individuals like Fr. Swamy? A key reason, undoubtedly, is the weak judiciary we have today. Indeed, our judiciary today suffers from a great many flaws besides mere weakness. In Fr. Swamy’s case, the judges displayed apathy of a shocking order. It is perplexing when, on the one hand, the Chief Justice of India grandiloquently states that personal liberties and fundamental rights must be protected, and courts do precisely the opposite. A weakened central principle It would not be too bold to suggest that the idea of the “presumption of innocence” — a central principle of criminal law and procedure — is on a terribly weak footing these days in our country, and this should worry all of us greatly. The source of this worry is the Supreme Court of India itself. Its April 2019 decision in National Investigation Agency vs Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali on the interpretation of the UAPA has affected all downstream decisions involving the statute. This decision has created a new doctrine, which is that effectively, an accused must remain in custody throughout the period of the trial, even if it is eventually proven that the evidence against the person was inadmissible, and the accused is finally acquitted. The illogic of this veers on the absurd: Why must an accused remain in jail only to be eventually acquitted? According to the decision, in considering bail applications under the UAPA, courts must presume every allegation made in the First Information Report to be correct. Further, bail can now be obtained only if the accused produces material to contradict the prosecution. In other words, the burden rests on the accused to disprove the allegations, which is virtually impossible in most cases. The decision has essentially excluded the admissibility of evidence at the stage of bail. By doing so, it has effectively excluded the Evidence Act itself, which arguably makes the decision unconstitutional. Bail hearings under the UAPA are now nothing more than mere farce. With such high barriers of proof, it is now impossible for an accused to obtain bail, and is in fact a convenient tool to put a person behind bars indefinitely. It is nothing short of a nightmare come true for arrestees. This is being abused by the government, police and prosecution liberally: now, all dissenters are routinely implicated under (wild and improbable) charges of sedition or criminal conspiracy and under the UAPA. Due to the Supreme Court judgment, High Courts have their hands tied, and must perforce refuse bail, as disproving the case is virtually impossible. As a result of this decision, for instance, a High Court judge can no longer really adjudicate and assess the evidence in a case. All cases must now follow this straitjacketed formula of refusing bail. The effect is nearly identical to the draconian preventive detention laws that existed during the Emergency, where courts deprived people access to judicial remedy. If we want to prevent the disasters of that era, this decision must be urgently reversed or diluted, otherwise we run the risk of personal liberties being compromised very easily. The most flagrant abuse of the UAPA, and constant rejection of bail applications of those accused as a means of silencing opposing voices, can be seen in the Bhima Koregaon cases, including Fr. Swamy’s case, as well as the cases pertaining to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), where mere thought is elevated to a crime. In multiple instances, evidence is untenable, sometimes even arguably planted, and generally weak overall. But as a consequence of UAPA being applied, the accused cannot even get bail. Courts cannot go into the merits of the case due to the Supreme Court judgment. An issue for the judiciary When courts do go into such matters, as in the instance of the Delhi High Court granting bail to three young activists accused in a conspiracy relating to the 2020 riots in Delhi, the Supreme Court uncharacteristically decides to weigh in. The Supreme Court reportedly expressed “surprise” and dissatisfaction at the High Court’s decision, giving the direction that the decision will “not to be treated as precedent by any court” to give similar reliefs. Specifically, the Supreme Court reportedly said that “in a bail application, a 100-page judgment discussing all laws is surprising us”, perhaps forgetting that the case that started it all, i.e., the Watali judgment of the Supreme Court, was itself a judgment in a bail matter! This seems to imply that only the Supreme Court can hold forth on matters of statutory interpretation, and that High Courts — which are constitutional courts in their own right — may not? By extension, if statutes ought not to be examined at all by High Courts, does this mean that individual arrestees must languish in jail till, say, the constitutional validity of the statutes under which they are arrested are decided? Surely, this would be completely irrational. Posterity will blame the judiciary for the incarceration and unfortunate death of Fr. Swamy, and the continued imprisonment of so many others like him. But voices will continue to rise in protest. As Fr. Swamy himself said, though, “we will still sing in the chorus. A caged bird can still sing.” Ajit Prakash Shah is Former Chief Justice, Delhi High Court and Former Chairperson, Law Commission of India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/darkness-at-noon-felled-by-the-judiciary/article35204354.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Challenging negative social norms||In these troubled times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Population Day on July 11 brings some positive news — India has entered a demographic sweet spot that will continue for another two to three decades. Half of India’s population is under 29 years of age, which means that in this period, a greater proportion of young people will drive India’s economic growth and social progress. So, they must not only be healthy, knowledgeable and skilled but must also be provided with the rights and choices to develop to their fullest potential, including, and especially, sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). The Guttmacher–Lancet Commission (Starrs et al, 2018) in looking at how to improve SRHR in populations formulated a comprehensive definition of SRHR that encompasses a broader range of issues. These include SRHR and issues such as violence, stigma and respect for bodily autonomy, which greatly impact the psychological, emotional and social well-being of individuals. Developmental goals India’s population growth is now stabilising. The decline in overall fertility notwithstanding, the population will continue to grow because of the effect of ‘population momentum’. It is like a Jumbo Jet that has started to descend but will take some distance to stop. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR), presently at 2.2 children, will soon reach replacement level (2.1). However, the TFR remains higher than the national average of 2.2 children among women who live in rural areas, have little formal education and are in the lowest income quintile — a majority of them live in the poorer States. Changing social norms is one of the biggest challenges for India to address the needs of the next generation. For example, India’s population stabilisation strategy must be adjusted keeping in mind the rights of women and girls. Women must have a greater say in choosing their family size. Prescriptive or coercive methods, such as one- or two-child norms, have rarely worked well anywhere for long. It goes without saying that for women and girls, the empowerment to make choices leads to better health outcomes, such as knowing how to prevent unintended pregnancy or giving birth with the help of a skilled birth attendant. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems and has led to serious gaps and challenges in the provision of information and services on sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Even before the pandemic, pervasive negative social norms, health system barriers and gender inequality hindered universal access to SRHR as envisioned under the Programme of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). On World Population Day this year, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) India recognises that even if health systems are understandably strained, the provision of these services cannot wait. Any further delays will curtail the health and well-being of women and girls, the consequences of which can last a lifetime. In the last two decades, India has made substantial gains with SRH indicators. Progressive policies for maternal health have resulted in improved rates of institutional delivery and a decline in maternal mortality ratio (MMR) from 327 in 1999-2001 to 113 per 100,000 live births in 2016-18, as per Sample Registration System (SRS) data. There have also been significant shifts in family planning in the past decade, and data from the National Health Family Survey 5 for the year 2019-20 (NFHS-5) show how contraceptive prevalence has improved in most States. We ought to celebrate India’s success, as it significantly contributes to global progress. The current government, with programmes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), has made some efforts to challenge existing social norms and has underlined that investments in social causes must go alongside economic progress. All sections of society must embrace this call for positive change, each doing their part, from the individual to the institution level. The UNFPA is keen to take India’s success models and strengthen the South-South Collaboration further. Poor indicators But success is hard-earned and never assured. There are many challenges on the path to 2030, the goalpost for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Two million adolescent girls (15-19 years) each year had a pregnancy, and of these, nearly 63% were unwanted or unintended (Guttmacher Institute, 2021). This points to inadequate information and access to SRH services for this age group. In girls aged 15-19 years, 22.2% had an unmet need for contraception, according to NFHS-4. Girls are still marrying too young — 26.8% of women aged 20-24 years are married before they turn 18, often having their first child within the first year of marriage. Far too many girls and women face gender-based violence and harmful practices that are socially sanctioned. All of these practices are rooted in social norms, beliefs and practices that deny women their bodily autonomy. India has slipped 28 places to rank 140th among 156 countries, becoming the third-worst performer in South Asia in The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report (2021). Time to achieve the ambitious targets of the SDGs is running out. India must hence choose its priorities carefully. Our analysis seems to suggest that placing youth, women and girls at the centre of policymaking and services could trigger a positive ripple effect. If young people, and adolescent girls in particular, have access to education, relevant skills, information and services to make healthy choices, including related to SRH, are empowered to exercise their rights, and have access to opportunities for employment, then India will be on a clear path to achieve its goals. What research and practical experience show is that when women can make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health, and when they have access to services to support their choices, societies are healthier and more productive. A woman who has control over her body gains not only in terms of autonomy but also through advances in health, education, income and safety. She is more likely to thrive, and so is her family. The UNFPA calls upon stakeholders to help build a new set of social norms to drive this mission.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Agents of change and a new chapter in Israel’s politics||Benjamin Netanyahu is out and Israel has got a government without him after 12 years. The new government has cobbled together a very unexpected coalition of eight political parties led by Naftali Bennett ( picture ) who is head of the smallest segment of the coalition. With only six seats of his far-right party, Yamina, Mr. Bennett has surprised all by preventing two things — Netanyahu’s hold on power and the fifth national election that most Israelis feared coming their way. It is Yair Lapid, Israel’s new Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister-in-waiting, who is the key architect of the coalition. Mr. Bennett acknowledged him in his first speech in the Knesset (https://bit.ly/3wmqVcG) by saying that Mr. Lapid “showed national responsibility, political generosity, and without whom we would not be here today”. Under the coalition deal, Mr. Bennett will be the Prime Minister for the first two years, followed by Mr. Lapid for the remaining two. While there are not many who predict that this coalition will last that long, the very strange union is still a welcome change in Israeli politics after the four national elections in less than two years. The eight parties do not have any ideological coherence but the single agenda to keep Mr. Netanyahu out of power, in the short run, and to uphold the democratic system based on consensus building, in the long run. Diverse team What makes this coalition unique as much as fragile is the fact they fight each other on the most essential matters of politics. Yet, the fight against Mr. Netanyahu has given the Israeli people the most representative government: the coalition has three right-wing parties, two centrist parties, two left-wing parties and one Arab party. Women leaders have done well too, comprising nine Ministers out of the total of 27 Ministers. It is remarkable from the gender point of view as Israel, like most other nation-states, is male-dominated. There is no religious party in the coalition, but Mr. Bennett is a religious individual unlike Mr. Netanyahu; he is also the first kippa (skull cap) wearing Prime Minister of Israel. The political stalemate is over for the time being, and Mr. Netanyahu is not the ‘King Bibi’ of Israel after all. He has been outdone by the far-right political leaders who were once his loyal aides; they include Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lapid and Avigdor Lieberman. What makes the new government unprecedented is the fact that the far-right, in order to fight its mentor Mr. Netanyahu, walked up to the left parties as well as an Arab-Islamist party of Mansour Abbas. While Israel is a strong and militarily capable state, it is also deeply divided as a society, with too many fundamental frictions among its Jewish population. Therefore, diverse and different ideological groups in this government can help in enabling political stability and inner-social-cohesion. The role of one Arab party in the government is much needed assurance for the otherwise marginalised and stigmatised Israeli Arabs minority. The challenge ahead is to satisfy each party’s core ideological interests but not at the cost of the other so that the fickle unity can last. It demands compromise, reconciliation and acceptance of the other. Anti-Netanyahu sentiment is pivotal thus far and this will be the glue but a constructive and long-lasting common minimum programme is what the Israeli democracy is striving for after a battered past. Change of leadership Mr. Bennett was born and raised by American immigrant parents who moved to Israel from the United States after the 1967 war. He is a former commando of the army’s most prestigious commando unit, Sayeret Matkal, the one that Netanyahu used to boast about himself. Mr. Bennett made his way to active politics in the aftermath of the Lebanon war in 2006. Though religious, he is not ultra-orthodox. He is a self-made millionaire who had a greatly successful high-tech career. In short, he is a poster boy for a Start-Up Nation. As a free-spirited entrepreneur, he has an astonishing ability to take risks and can be called a politically audacious leader. He was Mr. Netanyahu’s loyal man for long and served under him as Defence and Education Ministers, and in those years, he demonstrated his far-right inclinations without any qualms such as advocacy for settlements, annexation of major parts of West Bank, Jewish religion and its major role in Israeli society and politics. However, while he struggled to come out of the shadow of Mr. Netanyahu, he transformed himself as flexible and negotiable politician which was clear when he delivered his first speech and said, “Twice in history, we have lost our national home precisely because the leaders of the generation were not able to sit with one and another and compromise. Each was right, yet with all their being right, they burnt the house down on top of us. I am proud of the ability to sit together with people with very different views than mine.” It is going to be intriguing how he conducts himself with the others in the coalition and revisits some of his core ideological beliefs and assumptions. The world watches Israeli foreign policy is Prime Minister-driven, so the world awaits to see how the new leader will be outside Israel. He has not given many hints about his foreign policy agenda except that he will work to cement Israel’s special relationship with the United States, and that he is also well-prepared to deal with Iran firmly and aggressively like his mentor, Mr. Netanyahu. As far as Hamas is concerned, he is likely to leave that to the Defence Minister as he thinks it is a security issue and not a political question.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Haryana’s misplaced priorities||Haryana’s performance towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is disappointing. The NITI Aayog’s latest report on SDGs has put Haryana among the top three States in terms of unemployment and crime, with a dismal show in the fields of health and education and in industrial and economic growth as well. The results are the outcome of the current dispensation’s misplaced priorities. The report ranks Haryana 14th among all States with 67 composite points, just a notch above Tripura. Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, its neighbouring States, have done pretty well. However, Haryana could have done much better as the Congress government led by former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had handed over a robust State to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014. As per the NITI Aayog report, at 11.16%, there is no change since 2019 in the number of people living below the poverty line (BPL) in the State. Clearly, the government has failed to lift people from the vicious circle of poverty. Similarly, there is no change in the proportion of the children below five who continue to be underweight (28.80%) and stunted (34.90%). As many as 55% of pregnant women in the age group of 15-49 years continue to be anaemic. Crimes against women were 88.7 per one lakh female population in 2019, which went up to 108.5 in 2020. The State reported 3.90 murders per one lakh population in 2020 as compared to 3.74 in 2019. Instead of living in an ivory tower, the government must focus on adding resilience to education, which has suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the claims around ‘Digital Haryana’, the State failed to ensure seamless online classes for all students. The current State government had also promised to build a medical college in every district. Before 2005, there were only eight universities in the State, but the number went up to 43 during the Congress tenure from 2005 to 2014. Many technical education institutes, ITIs and new government colleges were opened during the Congress regime, but in the past seven years, only two universities have been set up. Bigger challenges such as improving gross enrolment ratio, checking dropouts, addressing poor student-teacher ratio and introducing enabling interventions for providing skill training in schools and colleges have taken a backseat. The government has not been able to implement a zero vacancy policy, due to which a large number of teaching posts are vacant. In schools, 31,232 posts of teachers were lying vacant as of last year. Compromised education has a direct relation to employability. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (2018-19) data pegged Haryana’s unemployment rate at 9.2%, which was significantly higher than the all-India figure of 5.8%. In February, data from the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy revealed a 26.4% unemployment rate, the highest among States; in 2012-13, the Department of Economics and Statistical Analysis had put the unemployment rate in Haryana at just 3%. But instead of providing jobs, the current regime’s focus is on ill-thought steps like providing reservation in private jobs. Worsening numbers Similarly, Haryana has failed to enhance the quality of health infrastructure. It was the first State in the country to give free medicines to OPD patients in government hospitals. Free referral transport service for expecting mothers for delivery, patients of BPL families, accident victims and freedom fighters, had attracted the attention of other States. The Congress had laid significant emphasis on the health sector. One State health university and four medical colleges were set up at Karnal, Faridabad, and Nuh in Mewat, including one for women in the rural area of Sonepat district. Also, AIIMS-II and the National Cancer Institute were set up at Badshah village in Jhajjar district. The State’s financial health, which is worsening due to mounting debt, huge funds deployed on various boards and corporations, and interest payments on borrowings, is also disturbing. Infrastructural development has come to a standstill — in the last seven years, not even a single new metro station was added, while during 2005-2014, four towns were linked to metro services through new lines. The fiscal situation is equally concerning. As per the Budget Estimate for 2021-22, the debt liability of the State is likely to go up to Rs. 2.30 lakh crore as of March 2022. It was Rs. 70,369 crore in 2013-14. Haryana is suffering on all counts due to the misplaced priorities of the current government. The State used to be one of the top performers in areas like per capita income, investment and agricultural productivity, but it has now slipped to the 14th position on the SDG index. The indicators suggest that governance has gone for a toss.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A long road for migrant workers||The Supreme Court on June 29 pronounced its judgment in the migrant labourers case. The case was initiated last year after the national lockdown was announced on March 24. Thousands of landless labourers had started walking towards their home States due to the loss of employment and income. The Supreme Court took cognisance of the matter on May 26 that year and acknowledged the plight of the workers in light of the strict lockdown. The court has laid down numerous guidelines to provide relief to workers and efficiently tackle the problem till the threat of COVID-19 subsides. Two of the most important components to protect the migrants during this time were the food and travel arrangements insisted on by the court. In the orders pronounced in May this year, it laid down that dry ration be provided to migrants who want to return to their homes. Further, the court said that identity proof should not be insisted upon by the governments since the labourers might not be able to furnish it. Secondly, the court called upon the State governments to arrange transportation for workers who need to return to their homes. These guidelines by the court are crucial to ensure the safety of workers. The Supreme Court fixed July 31 as the deadline for the States to implement the ‘One nation One Ration Card’ scheme. Under this scheme, the States are to complete the registration of migrant workers in order to provide dry ration to them. But it is unlikely that a standardised system can be developed within the deadline prescribed by the court. Apart from dry ration, the top court also directed the State governments to run community kitchens for migrant workers. However, there arise administrative problems in implementing these measures. First, migrant workers keep moving in search of employment and it is difficult to cover them all under the scheme. Second, many States do not have the necessary infrastructure to run and maintain community kitchens on such a large scale. Important directives Under the National Food Security Act, migrant workers are issued ration cards and they are entitled to dry ration under various government programmes, such as the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, during the pandemic. In the order passed on June 29, the court affirmed the Right to Food under Article 21 of the Constitution. In furtherance of this, the court asked the States to formulate their own schemes and issue food grains to migrants. This is an indispensable step to keep more than a fourth of the population of the country safe and healthy during the pandemic. However, there are no normative data that would allow the States to identify eligible migrants. The court took cognisance of the issue and directed the Ministry of Labour and Employment to ensure that the National Database for Unorganised Workers is updated by July 31. Finally, the top court recognised the need for direct cash benefit transfer to workers in the unorganised sector. But it did not issue any guidelines for the same as the workers need to be covered by the States themselves. The Supreme Court has given a purposive declaration in the case but the bulk of the judgment seems declaratory rather than mandatory. In order to efficaciously implement the orders of the court, the State governments need to work with the Centre closely. With the third wave of COVID-19 infections looming, it is imperative to ensure that government machinery works to its full potential and robust systems are developed to withstand the challenges.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Perfecting the test||Preparing for an uncertain academic year ahead during the pandemic, the Central Board of Secondary Education has decided on an assessment scheme for Classes 10 and 12 for 2021-22 under various scenarios, including the possibility that Board examinations can be conducted, should circumstances improve. The year gone by was extremely challenging for all Boards, and the CBSE had to hastily come up with a scheme to assess candidates in Class 12. It became clear that even with its high emphasis of academics, there was considerable deprivation for some students, and not all got the opportunity to complete their syllabus or attend online classes even in the national capital. The wide coverage of the Board, as of 2019, includes 1,138 Kendriya Vidyalayas, 2,727 government schools, 17,553 independent schools, 598 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and 14 Central Tibetan schools, and schools abroad. The diversity of students and their varied backgrounds was apparently reckoned to some degree while drafting the scheme for the coming year, which includes a mix of internal assessments for Classes 9-10 and 11-12, and term examinations in November-December and in March-April 2022. There will be a rationalised, compartmentalised syllabus split into two halves for each term. The scheme, which has the benefit of advance planning unlike the past year, must be responsive to the issues faced by all institutions in remote locations and the deprivation faced by less privileged students. The CBSE’s special scheme relies on syllabus rationalisation done through expert evaluation of interconnectivity of subjects, and a centralised protocol of question papers and marking scheme for the term examinations. In the case of term I, it will be a multiple-choice question (MCQ) type test stretching over 90 minutes, with machine-readable optical marking, and for term II, a short-and-long-answers model, if circumstances permit. Efficient as it may sound, the multiple-choice model is critiqued by some as inferior, with sometimes irrelevant and meaningless questions that add up to little in terms of assessment, helping only the marking process. An adjunct to the MCQ pattern could be a decentralised process, empowering regional CBSE units and external experts to consider the state of particular districts and come up with assessments tailored to specific situations. At the same time, the Board has done well to plan for different scenarios that could be imposed by the pandemic, where either of the term examinations or both cannot be held, or the second term has to be converted into the MCQ type. The fallback option in the worst-case scenario is a combination of internal assessments, practical and project work and theory examinations taken at home. The extreme uncertainty underscores the need to take online lessons to all classes of students, and factor in schools with special needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/perfecting-the-test/article35204348.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The surge||The rapid territorial gains made by the Taliban over the last two months should worry both the Afghan government and the regional powers who are invested in the country’s long-term stability. The Taliban started their latest offensive on May 1, the day the remaining U.S. troops started withdrawing as part of President Joe Biden’s plan. With 90% of U.S. withdrawal complete, the Taliban have taken control of 195 of Afghanistan’s 407 districts, and are contesting 129 others. Most of their recent victories are in the northern provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar, which had resisted Taliban rule in the 1990s. In several northern districts, Afghan troops have either surrendered or retreated. If the north, home to Afghanistan’s elite power brokers and leaders, is lost, the risk of a total collapse of the government in Kabul would increase. The government still controls most of the provincial capitals and cities but are practically surrounded by the Taliban. Given the pace of the Taliban’s advancement in the countryside, it is possible they could launch an offensive to take the population centres once the foreign troops are out. The Taliban’s strategy is still not clear. Their political office in Doha, which started peace talks with Afghan government representatives in September 2020, continues to say they are committed to the dialogue. But on the battlefield in Afghanistan, they continue a relentless campaign aimed at capturing more territories. Part of the problem was the total abdication of leadership and responsibility by the U.S., which invaded Afghanistan 20 years ago. When direct talks between the U.S. and the Taliban began, the U.S.’s focus was not on finding a peaceful settlement to the crisis that it partly created, but on exiting the war. Therefore, instead of putting pressure on the Taliban to extract concessions, the U.S. struck a deal with them, completely ignoring the concerns of Kabul. Now, the Taliban are much more powerful on the ground and even if the peace process is revived after American pullout, they would negotiate from a position of strength. But that should not stop Kabul and regional powers China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and India from seeking a political settlement. A violent takeover of the country by the Taliban, like in 1996, would not serve anybody’s interests. The Taliban would also not find international legitimacy if they capture Kabul through bloodshed. Afghan’s past experiences suggest that one-party regimes — the communist regime, Mujahideen or the Taliban — failed to stabilise the country or sustain themselves in the long term. Now that the invading troops are exiting Afghanistan, the warring parties’ focus should shift towards settlement and building lasting structures of power. Else, Afghanistan would fall into another cycle of violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-surge/article35204349.ece

The ratings agency also warned that banks’ asset quality challenges have increased and will remain under threat due to mobility restrictions, medical exigencies and rising job losses, with MSME and retail loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers most likely at risk. “Localised lockdowns during the second wave kept economic activity from stalling to levels similar to those during 2020 (Q1 2020-21 real GDP growth: -24.4%), but disruption in several key business centres has slowed the recovery and dented our expectations of a rebound to pre-pandemic levels by 2021-22,” the agency said in a note on Indian banks. “Our moderately worse 2021 outlook for Indian banks factors in muted prospects for new business due to our expectation of weak corporate and consumer confidence, banks' continuing high-risk aversion and below-trend credit demand,” it added. “Fitch expects banks’ exposure to stressed MSME and retail borrowers to rise further with the increasing relief outlay.... [and] impaired loans to peak after 2022-23 since stress is likely to manifest from this pool over a fairly protracted time frame,” the agency stressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fitch-cuts-gdp-growth-estimate-to-10-on-slower-recovery/article35204338.ece

08 July 2021||KOLKATA,||Olympic great Keshav Datt, 95, passes away||Two-time Olympics gold medallist Keshav Chandra Datt, the last surviving member of the Indian hockey team in the historic 1948 London Games, passed away here early on Wednesday, according to a Hockey Bengal (HB) statement. He was 95. An HB official said Datt’s last rites would be performed after the arrival of his daughter Anjali from abroad in a few days’ time. A product of the famous Government College, Lahore — which also produced Olympians like Syed Jaffar, Commander Nandy Singh and Munir Dar — Datt, born in Lahore on December 29, 1925, participated in the 1948 London and 1952 Helsinki Games respectively. Some claim that he could not take part in his third Olympics, in Melbourne in 1956, due to “professional commitments with Brooke Bond”. Datt — who migrated to India after the partition and played in Bombay and then in Bengal — was part of the Dhyan Chand-led Indian squad that toured East Africa in 1947. As a half-back, he played in 22 matches and scored two goals. In 1949, Datt had the honour of playing against hockey wizard Dhyan Chand, who led the Rest of India squad, in two exhibition matches here. First, Datt was part of the 1948 Olympics squad and in the second he was a member of the Bengal team. In his autobiography Goal , Dhyan Chand rated Datt as one of the finest half-backs of that time. Best moments Defeating host Great Britain 4-0 in the final at the Empire Stadium, Wembley, London, to win Independent India’s first gold in 1948 on the British soil and then thrashing the Netherlands 6-1 four years later in Helsinki to bag the second consecutive Olympic Games title were the finest moments of Datt’s career. By the age of 26, he had the prized possession of two Olympic gold medals. He was among the last ones to witness India’s monopoly in the Olympics as it faced some challenge in the 1956 Games where it experienced tight matches — including 1-0 wins over Germany and Pakistan in the semifinals and final respectively. Datt shone in his club career as well. “While playing for Calcutta Port Commissioners, he impressed famous actor and Mohun Bagan Hockey secretary of that time, Jahar Ganguly. He joined Mohun Bagan in 1951 to respect the wishes of Ganguly and played till 1960. “In 1952, Mohun Bagan achieved the first double in hockey when it lifted the Beighton Cup for the first time along with the Calcutta Hockey League (CHL),” the Bagan website said. Datt won CHL six times and the Beighton Cup three times in his 10-year Bagan career. He was the first non-football sportsperson to be conferred the Mohun Bagan Ratna, in 2019. Datt represented Punjab (in undivided India), Bombay and Bengal in the National championship. Badminton player He was also an accomplished badminton player and was Bengal No.1 of his times. Datt’s passing away snaps the only living link with Independent India’s first sporting glory.

08 July 2021||London,||Hurkacz torpedoes Federer’s quest for a ninth title at SW19||Eight-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer lost 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-0 to 14th-seeded Hubert Hurkacz of Poland in the quarterfinals at the All England Club on Wednesday, a surprisingly lopsided finish to his 22nd appearance in the tournament. Federer was given an ovation, but none quite like this one, which felt more like a “Thank you” or — just in case — a “Goodbye.” As he stepped up to the baseline to serve in the last game, he needed to wait while fans in the full-to-capacity stands applauded and cheered. Soon enough, it was over, only the third 6-0 set lost by Federer in his Grand Slam career and his 14th defeat in 119 matches at Wimbledon. “I don’t know what to say,” Hurkacz said. “It’s super special for me. Playing on this special court against Roger — it's always, when you’re a kid, it’s like a dream come true to play him.” This was not the Federer the world was used to watching. He simply never was able to summon the serving and shot-making that have carried him to 20 Grand Slam titles overall, tied with Nadal for the men’s record. “I barely made it for this year,” Federer said later. “It was a long hard road, but I actually kind of enjoyed it. It was always uphill, as slow as it was, but it was always moving forward." “I did not have any setbacks, but clearly there are things missing in my game,” the Swiss added. Quick off the blocks Hurkacz, boosted by having defeated World No.2 Daniil Medvedev in five sets in the last 16, was quickly up a break on a sluggish-looking Federer in the sixth game of the opening set and took it with ease. The Swiss star, who underwent two knee surgeries in 2020 and was bidding to be the oldest man in the Wimbledon last-four in over a half a century, carved out a break for 2-0 in the second set. But he couldn’t hang on, and Hurkacz was back on serve by the seventh game after being 1-4 down and went on to dominate the tiebreak. Federer appeared flat and was quickly down 0-2 in the third set before Hurkacz wrapped up the decider in just 29 minutes in front of a stunned Centre Court. Earlier in the day, Canada's Denis Shapovalov reached his first Wimbledon semifinal on Wednesday beating Russia's Karen Khachanov 6-4, 3-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 in an engrossing tussle that lasted 3 hours and 26 minutes. Shapovalov will next play defending champion Novak Djokovic after the World No.1 made short work of Hungarian Marton Fucsovics 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 on Centre Court. The 22-year-old Shapovalov took the first set after breaking Khachanov at 4-4. The latter, like Shapovalov appearing in his first Wimbledon quarterfinal, hit back by taking the next two sets. Whilst Khachanov was content to largely stay at the back, playing some delightful groundstrokes, especially on his backhand, Shapovalov varied his game more, with his drop shots highly effective. However, it was the Russian who wilted as Shapovalov romped through the fourth to take it into the deciding set. The decider looked a tight affair but in reality Khachanov was hanging on, saving his service on a couple of occasions. Finally, the Russian, who had been involved in a record 13 breaks of serve in the fifth set of Monday's win over Sebastian Korda, was broken in the ninth game and Shapovalov served out the match with aplomb.  I don't know. I really don't know. I've got to regroup. My goal was always to try & play another Wimbledon. I was able to make it this year, which I'm really happy about. Everything that comes after we'll have to sit down and talk about it Federeron whether this is his last Wimbledon   Women's semifinals 1-Barty vs 25-Kerber 2-Sabalenka vs 8-Pliskova  6 p.m. IST       Matteo Berrettini reached his second Major singles semifinal with a 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Felix Auger-Aliassime.

08 July 2021||London,||Ice-cool Italy shades Spain on penalties||Italy reached the Euro 2020 final after keeping its nerve from the penalty spot to edge Spain 4-2 in a shootout following a compelling 1-1 draw after extra time on Tuesday. Jorginho coolly rolled the decisive kick past Spain keeper Unai Simon after Alvaro Morata had been thwarted by Gianluigi Donnarumma and Dani Olmo had blasted his effort over the bar. Spain’s twin misses bailed out Manuel Locatelli, who had his strike saved by Simon with the first kick of the shootout and Italy’s substitutes and coaching staff poured on to the pitch to celebrate in front of their jubilant supporters behind the goal. Italy, who will play in Sunday’s final in its first showpiece since being thrashed 4-0 by Spain in Euro 2012, is looking to win the tournament for the first time since 1968. Roberto Mancini’s side took the lead on the hour through a sensational curler from Federico Chiesa to complete a sweeping counter-attack which began with keeper Donnarumma catching a Spain cross and rolling the ball out. Morata levelled for Spain with 10 minutes left, calmly slotting into the bottom corner after bursting forward and exchanging a one-two with Olmo. Spain looked more likely to find a winner in the remaining minutes and in extra time but could not manage a second shootout victory after prevailing against Switzerland in the quarterfinals. Italy avenged its shootout defeat to Spain in the Euro 2008 quarterfinals and its resounding defeat in the Euro 2012 final, and completed a second straight European Championship victory over the Spaniards after its 2-0 win in the last 16 at Euro 2016.  The result: Semifinal: Italy 1 (Chiesa 60) drew with Spain 1 (Morata 80) (aet, Italy wins 4-2 on penalties).    By The Numbers   1 - Spain has failed to progress from a semifinal of a major tournament for the first time, having previously reached the final in each of its previous five semifinal appearances  3 – Morata is the second player in Euro history to score 3+ goals in two editions (2016 & 2020), after Cristiano Ronaldo (2012, 2016 & 2020)  6 - He has also scored more goals at the Euros than any other Spain player, overtaking Fernando Torres’ five goals  8 - Jorginho’s interceptions v Spain, a record in a single match in the last two editions  33 - Italy’s unbeaten run, and now just two away from equalling the all-time record held by Spain and Brazil  100 - Pedri after 90 minutes of regulation time completed all 55 passes that he attempted for a cent per cent passing accuracy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ice-cool-italy-shades-spain-on-penalties/article35204642.ece

08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Playing for an Olympic medal is part of my priorities: Lahiri||Anirban Lahiri opted for Olympics instead of looking for points to stay inside the top-125 of the FedExCup standing on the PGA Tour and retain his full playing rights for the next season. Lahiri revealed this while addressing a virtual press conference on the eve of the $6.20 million John Deere Classic on Wednesday. “It was a difficult decision and an easy one, too. I know it sounds contradictory but that’s the truth. “When I saw my name among the qualifiers, I was excited. But a decision had to be made. I sat with myself and asked, “Why do I play the game?” I saw that among my priorities is playing for a medal in the Olympics. I could not let go of this opportunity.” In 2016, when golf returned to the Olympic Games, Lahiri and S.S.P. Chowrasia represented India. This year, Lahri will be in the company of Udayan Mane. In the current PGA Tour season, Lahiri has made nine ‘cuts’ from 18 appearances. He has two top-10 finishes and four times ended in the top-25 bracket. With earnings of $706,101 this season, Lahiri is currently placed 119 in the FedExCup standings. Key differences Asked about the difference between playing in the Olympics and pro events, Lahiri said, “In Olympics, you have a smaller field with no ‘cut’ involved. You usually play on a course which you are not familiar with. On the Tour, if you come fourth it is a very good result and you draw confidence from it for the next week. Even a top-25 finish is considered a decent result. In the Olympics, coming fourth means nothing. In short, it is all or nothing. You play only to reach the podium.” Lahiri, who made a comeback on the PGA Tour in early May following a bout of Covid, revealed that Bengaluru-based golfer S. Chikkarangappa would caddie for him in Tokyo. “Chikka is a very good friend and knows what I do when I play well,” said Lahiri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/playing-for-an-olympic-medal-is-part-of-my-priorities-lahiri/article35204824.ece
08 July 2021||KOLKATA,||He was my hero, says Gurbux||Hockey Olympians recalled their association with two-time gold medallist Keshav Datt. Gurbux Singh, an Olympics gold medallist in 1964 and who was close to Datt, remembered the legend. “When I began my career in hockey, Datt was my hero. I came to Bengal in 1956 and was fortunate to see him turn out for Mohun Bagan. I played briefly against him as he was on the last leg of his career. “He was a tall and handsome person and had a simple game. He used to pass the ball to others or hit it hard. He did not dribble too much,” Gurbux told The Hindu . He fondly remembered Lahore-born Datt’s insistence on writing his surname correctly. “He loved to speak in Punjabi or Hindi. He was very particular in writing Datt as his surname. If you wrote Dutt, he used to get annoyed and said, ‘No, I am Datt’.” Bir Bahadur Chettri, a 1980 Olympics hockey gold medallist from Bengal, said Datt was a fine gentleman. “We used to call him Guruji. And he used to treat us like his children. He was a very friendly person and a thorough gentleman who never used any foul language. During my playing days, he used to encourage us and his words inspired us.” “Datt never found fault with anyone. He used to say, ‘mistakes happen. Just keep working hard”, said Chettri. Mamata’s tribute West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in a tweet, paid tributes to Datt, describing him as one of the “true legends” of hockey.  He loved to speak in Punjabi or Hindi. He was very particular in writing Datt as his surname. If you wrote Dutt, he used to get annoyed and said, ‘No, I am Datt’— Gurbux||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/he-was-my-hero-says-gurbux/article35204698.ece
08 July 2021||Brasilia,||Emiliano Martinez does the star turn for Argentina||Emiliano Martinez was the hero for Argentina as he saved three times in a shootout to take his team into a Copa America final against Brazil after Tuesday’s semifinal against Colombia finished 1-1 after 90 minutes. Martinez, who tried to distract Colombia’s players in the shootout with a barrage of trash talk, saved from Davinson Sanchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Cardona. Lionel Messi, Leandro Paredes and Lautaro Martinez scored for Argentina. “I’m speechless,” said Argentine keeper Martinez. “They took us to penalties and that’s a question of luck, today it was my turn for glory.” Intense match Both sides had chances to win in an intense, end-to-end match punctuated by 46 fouls and 10 yellow cards. Argentina is seeking to win its first major international title since lifting the Copa America in 1993 and once again Lionel Messi was the star man, notching up his fifth assist of the tournament to add to his four goals. Taking a superb pass from Giovani Lo Celso after six minutes, Messi rolled the ball to Lautaro Martinez to fire home a low shot and give Argentina the lead. Colombia found its feet soon after and hit the woodwork twice in a minute towards the end of the first half when Wilmar Barrio’s deflected shot struck the post and then Mina watched his header hit the bar from the resulting corner. Tight angle Its equaliser came on the hour mark when Luis Diaz finished from a tight angle to complete a surprise counter attack. Argentina is now unbeaten in 19 games, with its last loss coming to Brazil in the semifinal of the 2019 Copa America. It was also the last team to beat Brazil, in November 2019 when Messi got the only goal of the game in a friendly in Saudi Arabia.  The result: Semifinal: Argentina 1 (Lautaro Martinez 7) drew with Colombia 1 (Diaz 61) ( Argentina won 3-2 on penalties).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/emiliano-martinez-does-the-star-turn-for-argentina/article35204702.ece

08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||It hasn’t yet sunk in fully, says Udayan Mane||Udayan Mane can’t believe he has made it to the Tokyo Olympics. Ranked 356, Mane was almost certain of being among the 60 qualified golfers on June 24 when Argentina’s Emiliano Grillo withdrew. A reserve against Grillo’s name, Mane’s anxiety ended with an official confirmation on Tuesday evening. “In fact, I’m still pinching myself as it hasn’t yet sunk in fully. With a great 2020-21 season on the domestic PGTI, I felt that I had almost sealed my qualification but the lockdown in India this year put some doubts in my mind whether I could actually make the cut for Tokyo. “The only tours operational are the PGA Tour and European Tour and I thought the players from those Tours had a real chance of pushing through and qualifying for the Olympics,” said Mane, a member of Indian team in the 2014 Asian Games at Incheon, South Korea. Looking back, the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) Board’s decision to consider the PGTI performances for world rankings in 2019, came to Mane’s rescue. Winner of two titles in 2019 and three in succession during the 2020-21 season, saw Mane earn valuable OWGR points. Bonding with Lahiri Mane, 30, joined his friend Anirban Lahiri as the last two players among the qualifiers. Interestingly, they share the same coach, Vijay Divecha. Both grew up training under Divecha at the Eagleton Golf Resort, Bengaluru. “Anirban is not only a good friend but also a great golfer and a role-model. More than that, he is an amazing human being. He teaches us on and off the golf course. He’s the best person to emulate,” said Mane. Chennai-born Mane, who grew up in Bengaluru and now resides in Pune, has a connection with Japan, too. “I had played in Japan during the 2014 Eisenhower Trophy when I shot a 14-under for the week and finished 13th at the event. Until 2018 that was the best finish and score by an Indian at the event,” recalled Mane. Talking of his approach in Tokyo, Mane said, “It will be that I’m playing just another golf course. The key is not to let the scale of the event bother me but instead focus on how I prepare to do my best. I’m sure the Olympics are unique. So it’ll be something for me to experience first-hand and something that is well beyond my imagination.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-hasnt-yet-sunk-in-fully-says-udayan-mane/article35204826.ece

Martin was the rider who collided with a roadside fan brandishing a sign last week that caused a spectacular mass pile-up on stage one from the Atlantic port city of Brest. Wednesday's stage saw the Jumbo rider fall into a ditch just outside the Provence town of Sorgues, shortly after the departure for a double ascent of the Tour's most famous climb, the Mont Ventoux. Martin was also hurt on stage 1 and was vocal in calls for the hapless roadside fan that day to be severely punished, not for causing the crash, but for failing to stick around and help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tony-martin-out-of-tour-after-second-crash/article35204622.ece

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Fist of fury||Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is not a man in a hurry — he has made seven films in 20 years. His latest Toofaan is set for release next week; the same week which saw the release of his first directorial, Aks , two decades ago. Today, the filmmaker occupies an important place in contemporary Indian cinema as a progressive policymaker — whether it is the jaunty socio-political highs of Rang De Basanti or the immersive adrenaline rushes of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag . A conversation with the 58-year-old is always fascinating; his answers measured, his tone nuanced, and one can even sense his thoughts as he explains what drew him to a boxing drama and casting Farhan Akthar in it. Excerpts from an interview:  Toofaan is a refreshing departure from the spate of ‘sports biopics’ we have had over the last decade. Is the script a totally fictional story? Well, I have been blamed too for going the biopic route earlier, but Toofaan is a complete work of fiction indeed. However, it draws everything from real life, from anecdotes and people I have seen and heard about, from conflicts and struggles. It is a drama at a family and social level, and a lovely romance, set against the backdrop of boxing, a sport that has huge synergy with the protagonist.  Why did you pick boxing as the backdrop?  Boxing is a lonely sport; not a team sport. In it, what is most important is not to hit, but how to take a hit. The person who stands till the end without getting knocked out wins. I see that as a metaphor for life. Life will slap and surprise you in different ways, but you have to stand, deal with it, and make yourself a better human being with the choices you make. Right from the inception, the script was lending itself to boxing too. The main character is like a bhai in a locality, from the Bhendi Bazaar and Dongri area in Mumbai. His life so far has taught him how to fight, but his talent and mind can go either way. One’s power can be used to better society or it can be misused...that is the story I wanted to tell. Often, the right path is the difficult one to choose. Tell us about your relationship with Farhan...was it like catching up with an old friend to work on this film?  Our relationship has evolved since Bhaag Milkha Bhaag . We have always had a sense of mutual respect, and when we came out of our first film together, we felt extremely embraced. When you collaborate with someone like Farhan, the energy grows manifold. The important thing is the like-mindedness in what we are doing. When I heard Toofaan for the first time — it was narrated to me by writer Anjum Rajabali — I immediately understood its voice, and wanted to do it with Farhan. I feel both of us have grown a lot since Bhaag… and it is exciting to tell a story that dwells deeper into human relationships. This film is not plot-driven, it is character-driven. Which is why I am sure audiences will see their own struggles on screen and be able to empathise. Toofaan will stream on Amazon Prime from July 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fist-of-fury/article35204525.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A watershed moment||A year-and-a-half ago, Sajan Prakash, 27, thought he would not make it to the Tokyo Olympics 2020. The swimmer suffered a slipped disc, which also hurt his neck. As he recovered, the pandemic forced pools to close in Thailand, where he was training at the Thanyapura Aquatic Centre in Phuket on a scholarship. Confined to his hostel, he contemplated returning to India. But the situation here was worse. Then, last August, a reprieve came in the form of a 50-day camp in Dubai organised for top Indian swimmers with national coach Pradeep Kumar. After the camp, Sajan was in a quandary again. He wanted to stay back in Dubai, but that was going to be expensive. That is when coach Pradeep and his wife, Gowri, came to Sajan’s rescue. The couple invited him to stay with them in Dubai and ensured he got better in the pool. On June 26, Sajan clocked 1:56:38 seconds in the men’s 200-metre butterfly event at the Sette Colli Trophy in Rome. In doing so, he became the first Indian swimmer to make the Olympic Qualifying Time (also known as FINA ‘A’ cut), which ensures automatic qualification for the Olympics. Unable to make the ‘A’ cut hitherto, Indian swimmers had to count on the Olympic Selection Time (also known as ‘B’ time) or the universality quota — less certain ways — to get to the Olympics. Three days later, Sajan’s compatriot Srihari Nataraj, 20, joined him in securing the ‘A’ cut after his time of 53.77s in a 100-metre backstroke time trial in the Rome event was ratified by international swimming’s governing body, FINA. Srihari, like Sajan, had to overcome obstacles before breaching the qualifying mark. For over six months, he could not swim due to the lockdown. Then, this January, his father passed away. It took about seven months of relentless training to shave half a second off, which determined his entry to the Tokyo Games. An Olympic medal still remains a distant dream for Indian swimming. But Sajan and Srihari’s ‘A’ cuts could be a defining moment. Long way to go Ever since the 1951 Asian Games in which India won six swimming medals, including its only gold, there has been very little success. The country has added just three more medals at the Asian Games and one (in para-swimming) at the Commonwealth Games . In bigger meets — the World Aquatics Championships and the Olympics — qualification itself has been a big deal. Can the medal drought be attributed to genes? Sports science expert Genadijus Sokolovas, who has worked with the world’s top swimmers like Michael Phelps, says, “Genes matter very little. If this is about size, then, the fastest fish is not the biggest.” According to him, a swimmer’s success depends on their training, technique and motivation. The US swimmers, he says, win medals because they have access to good coaches, excellent training facilities and a supportive ecosystem; not because they are superhumans. Srihari and Sajan say they are happy with the coaching and training facilities. India’s senior coaches Nihar Ameen and Pradeep are winners of the Dronacharya award (given to honour sports coaches in India) and have decades of experience. The top Indian swimmers had the chance to interact with Sokolovas in February during a six-day workshop organised by the Swimming Federation of India (SFI). They also have access to world-class facilities at the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence. “A lot more professionals are involved now. In our days, we never had dieticians, biomechanics experts and physiotherapists at our disposal,” says former Olympic swimmer Nisha Millet. Things seem to be improving for Indian swimmers at the elite level. The problem, Nisha points out, is at the grassroots. “Once you reach the top-level, you get support from the Government, federation and private institutions. But when you are lower down the rung, there is no one to guide you properly,” she says. Girls, for instance, have to deal with cultural taboo as some parents, Pradeep says, don’t want them to wear swimsuits after puberty. And, according to Nisha, they get fewer job opportunities through swimming than boys. These reasons probably explain why no Indian female swimmer since 2004 has made even the ‘B’ time; they have only gone to the Olympics via the universality quota. Coach Pradeep says the Government, private institutions and clubs should promote swimming. The road ahead Srihari and Sajan’s ‘A’ cut is important because it has lifted a mental block among Indian swimmers. “We used to think ‘A’ cut was impossible. Now, two people have made it at the same event,” says Srihari. Pradeep believes this will trigger more ‘A’ cuts in the next Olympics. At the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, he says, India should aim for a podium finish. For these long-term goals to materialise, there is a lot to be done, says SFI’s general secretary Monal Chokshi. One of the immediate goals is to ensure each State has at least three swimming academies under the Khelo India programme. Indian swimming, he explains, follows a two-tier system. The top-tier swimmers have access to high-performance centres like the one in Bengaluru. The junior swimmers — about 130 (“a very small number” according to Chokshi) — are supposed to make use of the Khelo India academies. These academies, however, are not easily accessible. “Srihari’s 53.77 would have won him a medal 15-20 years ago,” says Sokolavas, “There will be a time, 10-20 years from now when Indian swimmers will be swimming faster than current world records. But we can try to do it much before that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-watershed-moment/article35204564.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Forget pictures. Show me your vaccine certificate||What is your idea of an ideal first date? Martinis at a beach bar? Dinner and a movie? Game night? Well, for some who just met their partners on dating apps, it is heading to the nearest vaccination centre and getting a jab together. #jabwemet. With new variants of COVID-19 rearing their ugly heads, an increasing number of people are opting for the vaccine. And, they want to ensure potential dates are vaccinated too. Now, dating apps are adding features that educate users, busting myths and allaying fears. Popular sites like Tinder, Ok Cupid and Woo allow users to display a badge (usually an image of a syringe or plaster) to state they are vaccinated. It does not matter if they have received just one shot or both. Last November, when vaccines were on the verge of being launched, OK Cupid, a dating app that been in India since 2018 and has over a million members, introduced a set of questions to gauge the mood of users. “Back then, a lot of them said they were not entirely sure if they would opt for it,” says Sitara Menon, senior marketing manager, OK Cupid. She adds that, since then answers have changed to yes, with a substantial number opining that a non-vaccinated person is a deal breaker. The pandemic has led to a change in conversation patterns. New features, including stickers, are conversation starters, says Papri Dev, senior director, APAC communications, Tinder. She adds, “In May 2021 we noticed the reference to vaccines in bios went up by 42 times in members’ profiles,” she says. Sample this: ‘Will you hold my hand while I take my vaccine?’ Or, ‘Let’s get the COVID Vaccine together ;)’. When the pandemic began, the team at OK Cupid noticed the word COVID came up a lot in users’ self summaries on the app. Following that, over the last three months, ‘vaccination’ became the most used term. There has been a 763% increase in the mention of the word vaccine in bios,” says Sitara. She adds that Indians users now want to know if potential partners are vaccinated or want to get vaccinated. Badges on profiles help the others know if the person has taken their jab or not. “People who believe in vaccines, or got theirs, get 25% more matches,” she adds. In a survey conducted in the major metros in the country, Woo, a home-grown dating app with more than 12 million users worldwide, found that 70% of its audience wants to meet people who are vaccinated. “The survey was based on answers given by 10,000 people in the 24-35 age group, says Ritesh Bhatnagar, chief marketing officer-WOO. “That’s why we decided to go on this route and incorporate vaccine-related features like badges on our app last week.” Tinder launched what they call a ‘vaccine centre’ last week, on the app. This is an educational resource with quizzes and questions, and we have a link to CoWin,” says Papri. OK Cupid and Bumble have similar features, with explainers and answers from science and healthcare officials. Tinder has partnered with India Vaccine Project. “Through this partnership, our aim is to offer opportunities to our user base to volunteer and help verify information about COVID Vaccine Centers (CVCs) in India,” says Papri. Members with relevant skill sets can join the project’s tech team or choose from opportunities on indiavaccine.in, helping with creating content, verifying vaccine stocks and reducing vaccine hesitancy, among others. The trust factor “There is a lot of data being shared about the vaccine between users,” says Rahul Namdev, co-founder of Betterhalf.ai, an Artificial Intelligence-driven Indian matrimonial app. While he believes adding badges is a good idea, he says his app has taken a different approach: “We send a lot of notifications, emails and pop up messages to drive awareness.” Rahul says around 40%-50% of his users are vaccinated. He has noticed that women are adamant not to talk to people who do not believe in vaccines. “If a guy says he will be taking his vaccine maybe after three months, then that conversation is not going anywhere,” says Rahul. Sitara agrees that women are a lot more particular. “At this point, on our app, 69% of men and 71% women are vaccinated and sporting badges,” she says. A word of caution: Although users are putting up their vaccine status, the apps are operating on trust alone, and not asking for evidence right now. Woo offers a feature where users can upload their vaccine certificates, but it is not mandatory. Nevertheless, out of 19% of its vaccinated users, 50% have so far uploaded their certificates. On Betterhalf.ai, the team keeps reminding the users to take necessary precautions if they are meeting other daters. Says Rahul, “We are encouraging them to request other users to show their vaccination certificate, that way they can be sure and, hopefully, safe.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/forget-pictures-show-me-your-vaccine-certificate/article35204558.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Not just a bag of tricks||Siblings Nanditha D, 15, and Niveditha D, 11, recently led online sessions on Vedic Maths for students of classes VI-X, of their school, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Kottayam. Prior to it, they had presented a paper and held a workshop on the subject at an online conference organised by the Institute for the Advancement of Vedic Mathematics, based in the UK. During lockdown in 2020, from March to May, they took classes via Skype for over 300 students. In 2021, around 1,000 students had registered for their online sessions. A month ago, they launched a YouTube channel, Maths Made Easy by Nanditha and Niveditha. The inspiration came from their father, P Devaraj, an automobile engineer and Vedic Maths teacher. “When we started our sessions it was meant to help a few of our friends. We didn’t expect it to go this far,” says Nanditha. Meanwhile, in Chennai, Muthuselvi Prabhu, “works round the clock”, teaching Vedic Maths to students from the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and West Asia on a one-to-one basis; she also has training sessions for teachers in India. Indore-based 50-year-old Ravi Asrani, is busy on weekends with students joining from across India and abroad for his Vedic Maths classes. Trainers such as Delhi-based Saurabh Jain and Kota-based Rekha Gupta too have many students attending their sessions these days. Teachers are happy to observe that there has been an increase in the number of people learning Vedic Maths over the last few months. The subject got a boost when learning went digital during the lockdown. The subject consists of 16 sutras or formulae and 13 sub- sutras to solve mathematical problems. While some saw it as a new subject to explore while at home, for most, it was to get over the fear of mathematics. “It is an age-old fear! Several parents, on their part, make it worse by constantly reminding their children about it. So when you come across a technique that promises an easy way of doing calculations, it was natural for many people to try it. For parents, it was also about keeping their children engaged during the lockdown,” says Devaraj. Saurabh, who calls himself a “maths magician”, points out that not many people were aware of Vedic Maths until schooling shifted to the digital mode. “Earlier there were live classes once a week and the fee was high. But that scenario has changed now,” says Saurabh, adding, “We try to make it entertaining.” For instance, instead of paying Rs. 3,500 per month for just three or four classes, they need to pay between Rs. 100-Rs. 500 per hour for an online class. Devaraj adds that he charges Rs. 1,800 for a three-week, 15-hour class. Rekha takes classes for four or five batches with 12-15 students each on a daily basis. “I have been teaching Abacus and Vedic Maths for 15 years now. While online teaching may not give the desired result in the case of Abacus, it works in the case of Vedic Maths. That was probably one reason why many got hooked to it when learning became digital. It is all about making mathematics fun to learn, with what many call ‘tricks’,” she says. Muthuselvi says that the interest is more among students who live abroad. “Here, in India, we have mark-based evaluation and so we stick to the syllabus whereas in many countries all they look at is the students’ understanding of the concepts of mathematics,” she adds. Student becomes master There has also been a rise in the number of people training to become Vedic Maths teachers. Vidhya Vikram from Coimbatore, for instance, has trained over 3,200 people from across the country since September 2020. “While 50% of these trainers are Maths teachers, the rest comprise college students, retired professionals exploring new careers, women looking for flexible career options, parents, grandparents…. I have trained those in the age group of 23 to 78,” says Vidhya. She adds that but for the pandemic and the lockdown, she herself would not have explored online teaching. “When I had live classes, only Maths teachers attended the sessions, that too very few. Now I have a webinar-based training model, where I give a demonstration and take it to more people. Over 50,000 people have attended the webinars,” she says. A flipside is that those with elementary knowledge in Vedic Maths are also conducting classes. “Some of my students who have completed only their first-level sessions are now trainers. While I take Rs. 500 for 12 one-hour classes, they charge Rs. 2,000 or more,” adds Ravi. Meanwhile, mathematicians continue to be divided in their opinion over the origin and efficacy of Vedic Maths. However, according to Devaraj, “We never say that it is the only way to solve a problem. What we trainers stress on is that it is a creative, systematic way of approaching mathematics and not just a bag of tricks. ” Nanditha seconds it, saying: “The first thing that we tell those who attend our sessions is that Maths is not a monster. Make it your best friend and Vedic Maths can help you in that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/not-just-a-bag-of-tricks/article35204566.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||‘A film with honest emotion will cross borders’||Fahadh Faasil is a restless actor. He constantly thinks of ways to play different characters; resulting in an impressive filmography over the last few years. “I tend of get bored of what I am doing very quickly,” he admits, in a quick virtual conversation from Kochi, “I set out on long drives and a few hours into it, I change my destination.” So when the pandemic put a break on his projects, Fahadh quickly changed gears and tried an experiment. With CU Soon, director Mahesh Narayan and Fahadh tried telling an entire story through virtual communication devices. Their upcoming film Malik , however, is not an experiment on those lines. A film originally made for theatres and releasing on Amazon Prime now, Malik , is set in a fishing village in Kerala between 1965 and 2018, and features Fahadh in an author-backed role; he plays Sulaiman, the chieftain of the fisherfolk. Fahadh’s cinematic oeuvre has been fascinating, with him playing a wide range of characters from genial thief ( Thondimuthalum Drikshashiyum ) to a cunning pastor ( Trance ), roles that other actors might have been hesitant to accept. When he chooses them, it is primarily because he does not relate to them. “I do not look at relatability to the character as a factor. In fact, I would like to perform characters I’m not familiar with. This gives me the chance to do research and then approach it.” Is this the same with Malik ? “I thought about the old men in the family, like my grandfather and my dad's brothers. It's my understanding of how gracefully people age.”  Malik has Fahadh’s character ageing from 21 to 58; for this, the actor reportedly lost about 15 kilos over a period of time. Prod him about the process, and Fahadh just shrugs, “I don't physically strain myself to do any of the roles; for instance, I do not promise a six-pack! I try to look the character; if I achieve that, it is 50% less acting I need to do.” He believes that this film, like his earlier projects, will prompt conversation among audiences. “I have always wanted my films to address different issues, give different levels of entertainment; there should be discussions around my work. Staying within the kind of films I do, I have tried to grow.” The last 15 months or so have been huge for Fahadh, in terms of reach. Thanks to the soaring popularity of OTT platforms and the wonders of subtitling, Fahadh, and Malayalam films in general, made significant inroads into the rest of the country. “Any honest emotion gets there. I do films with emotion, and that, in turn, travels across borders and connects with people.” He already has tried that not just with Malayalam but also Tamil cinema, with Velaikaran and Super Deluxe. “Tamil cinema has been welcoming; I have so many good friends, like Kumar (Thiagarajan Kumararaja), Mohan Raja and Lokesh (Kanagaraj). It’s just a different language, but it’s all just the same. We all function the same way.” He’s looking forward to strengthening ties with Tamil audiences with Vikram , his upcoming biggie directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. This project gives him the opportunity to rub shoulders with co-star Kamal Haasan, of whom he is a big fan. “I am eagerly waiting to shoot with him.” What is the one thing he wants to ask Kamal on the first day on set? “I love all his films: Michael Madhana Kama Rajan , Kurudhi Punal , Guna .... I could go on. I just want to ask him one thing: How do you do it?”  Malik releases on Amazon Prime on July 15||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-film-with-honest-emotion-will-cross-borders/article35204528.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The birth of MMKR||A few weeks ago, Kamal Haasan took to Facebook to share a series of posts on what went into the making of Dasavatharam , his magnum opus which completed 13 years recently. In the comments section, Malayalam filmmaker Alphonse Puthren requested Haasan to give a similar “masterclass” on Michael Madhana Kama Rajan ( MMKR ), often regarded as one of the best comedies in Tamil cinema. In response, Haasan took to his social media page to share interesting anecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories from MMKR , directed by veteran Singeetam Srinivasa Rao. Recalling the meeting he had with Singeetam during the filming of the Malayalam film Chanakya , Haasan said that the seed of thought for MMKR came when the duo was making Pushpak , another classic from the Haasan-Rao combination. The plot, which revolves around quadruplets, was inspired by films such as Yaadon Ki Baaraat (Hindi), Sivaji Ganesan’s Deiva Magan and MGR’s Nadodi Mannan . “The idea was decades-old. I drew a diagram and explained the plot with a sketch, which was full of arrows and squares and a high point which we call the climax. Mr.Singeetam understood it and said ‘okay’ right away,” said Haasan. The screenplay was written by Haasan and Rao and it was only later that they roped in ‘Crazy’ Mohan for the dialogues. In another post, Haasan recalled how the now-popular Kameshwaran was initially conceived as a scientist. “I wanted Kameshwaran to be a genius. Then I came up with the character of a Palakkad Brahmin. My experience in Malayalam films and my friends from Kerala helped me understand the language better. That is how Kameshwaran was born,” he added. In the series, Haasan remembered and acknowledged the contribution of his star cast comprising Nagesh, Manorama, Kushboo, SN Lakshmi and Rupini to mention a few, and the crew including maestro Ilaiyaraaja, cinematographer BC Gowrishankar and stunt director Vikram Dharma.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Dinner for Bruno||Twenty-five-year-old Shyamal Thakker says he has been harassed for years by his housing society in Lokhandwala. It is because he regularly feeds strays and fosters animals in need of care and attention. “This is not just my story but that of a number of feeders or rescuers,” says Shyamal, over a call from Mumbai. Will the Delhi High Court’s recent, 86-page ruling make things easier for him, and the country’s many other volunteers? Among other points, it states that stray or street dogs have the right to food and citizens have the right to feed them. It also cautions that in exercising this right, care and caution should be taken to ensure that it does not impinge upon the rights of others. It has only been a few days since the ruling and in the meantime, Shyamal says, feeders continue to be challenged, sometimes aggressively, by housing societies and neighbours. “My society still serves us with fines for feeding strays,” he says, adding that, “Along with the ruling, there should be laws on protecting our rights too.” In Chennai, hotels and restaurants too chipped in when Blue Cross of India (BCI) started their feeding programme called Karuna 2 during the second wave of the pandemic. BCI facilitated 3,000 meals per day in March. “Hotel Green Park, Vadapalani, opened their kitchen and gave 700 meals a day, Park Hyatt in Guindy offered a similar quantity and Tail Tale, Pallikaranai, gave 300 meals a day. A number of volunteers joined, driving around delivering the food to street dogs,” says S Chinny Krishna, co-founder and chairman emeritus. Volunteers working with community dogs, also spend a lot of time, money and energy in not only feeding them, but also getting them sterilised, to control the population. Jayshree Ramesh, who has been looking after “streeties” around her home in Ambattur, Chennai, for the past 25 years, takes her job very seriously. She and her husband get busy cooking for their fur babies as soon as they are done with their own dinner. First, two 10-litre pressure cookers are filled with rice and chicken, and set to cook. Then the second batch goes in. By 9.30pm they are done. The next morning, at 4.30 am, they set out on their daily mission, with two big buckets of chicken rice. She is lucky to have found an empty plot near her house where she feeds around 62 dogs. “But it is a problem in gated communities. For those living in crowded cities, where will they find open spaces? Especially in cities like Delhi and Mumbai?” she says. In Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities there is no dispute, really, says Vikram Chandravanshi, legal consultant, Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). But in metropolitan cities, due to a lack of space and high rise buildings, he says, when animals are fed at the front door or in parking lots, they tend to stay around these spots. This is resisted by residents who are afraid of dogs. Reshma Shelatkar, Mumbai-based animal activist and social reformer insists there should be a designated space or feeding point in every area. “Just like humans have specific places marked for different things why not have something for this also?” she asks. “Earlier this year, the AWBI issued a letter to District Collectors all over India asking them to identify sufficient feeding spots in every region, RWA, colleges...,” says Vikram. They were asked to find spots that are also convenient for feeders so they don’t have to venture out too far late at night or in the wee hours of the morning. Though these are yet to be implemented in a majority of places, in a few cases in Faridabad, Vasant Kunj and Navi Mumbai, it has helped solve problems, he says. Reshma adds she has found a way around the issue, using animal management: the cats and and dogs she feeds have been trained to come to particular spots at meal time, eat and leave. This way they do not come in the way of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dinner-for-bruno/article35204542.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The many namesakes of Madras||Have you heard of the Madras spotted skink or chanced upon the lovely Madras pea flower? They are just two of a handful of flora and fauna that derive their monikers from this city. Thirupurasundari Sevvel, a Chennai-based architect and the woman behind Nam Veedu Nam Oor Nam Kadhai, an enterprise celebrating all things Madras, was intrigued by city-specific scientific nomenclature. Her latest project aims to shine a spotlight on the city’s natural history through illustrations and activities. “We were inspired by a book on the Madras hedgehog by ecologist Brawin Kumar, and further guided in our quest by Kalaimani, a research associate at Care Earth Trust,” says Thirupurasundari. With local illustrators Aafreen Fathima SK and Shrishti Prabakar, the project has taken on a life of its own, not only as a means to elucidate these rare species on social media, but to educate students as well. Thirupurasundari explains, “We have reached out to over 70 students in Aminjikarai and Naduvankarai, mapping out their local history, and using scientific names for local biodiversity. We found this really aroused interest, and helped them connect to the lessons, during our online workshops.” In addition to the Madras hedgehog, called mul / irmal eli in Tamil, there is the Madras spotted skink (Madras pulli aranai ), a rare limbless lizard discovered in 1916 by Scottish zoologist Thomas Nelson Annandale, in the northeastern corner of the Madras Presidency (now the area surrounding Chilka Lake). “This fossorial (burrowing animal) species is now only present in Odisha,” explains Kalaimani, who then leads us to the third species: the Madras tree shrew (Madras moongil anaththaan ). It is a tiny animal found scurrying in moist deciduous forests, South of the river Ganges. The fourth on the fauna list — the white-browed wagtail, locally called vari vaalaati kuruvi — has Madras in its scientific name,Motacilla maderaspatensis. The medium-sized birds are conspicuously patterned with a white brow, shoulder stripe and outer tail feathers. Native to South Asia, they can be found near small water bodies and have adapted to urban environments where they often nest on roof tops. The last amid the fauna, from a bird’s eye to a worm’s eye view, is the flatworm or /Lobotrema madrasi, a common parasite found in fish. A host of botanical species also derive their scientific name from the city.Ventilago maderaspatanaor red creeper is a creeper plant that matures with reddish leaves, whileBlepharis maderaspatensis or the creeping Blepharis ( naalilai naagam poo ) can be easily spotted by its arrangement of four leaves. A purple-white hooded flower,Phyllanthus maderaspatensisor Madras leaf-flower (Madras nelli/nila nelli ) is noted for its leaf arrangement similar to flowers, whileMukia maderaspatanaandCucumis maderaspatanus(the Madras pea pumpkin or Muchumuchukkai ) bears red berries when ripe, with thorny green fruit and yellow flowers. For all these species, “the Tamil or local names are very important, for they hold adjectives that can help envision the species even without a photograph,” explains Srishti Prabakar, who has illustrated the Madras- inspired flora. Another organisation prioritising using local names for native plants, understanding their location, and helping city-dwellers connect to their environment, is Madras Inherited, a Chennai-based initiative that focusses on cultural heritage tourism, with heritage walks and community outreach augmented by research. Ashmitha Athreya, the head of operations at Madras Inherited, explains their initiative Marupeyar: “We came up with the title to indicate that everything has another name or face to it. The primary aim is to share the Tamil names of vegetation found in the city, in the hope that they will be used at par with the English names. We want to provide information on how to easily identify this vegetation, with geographical markers, so that city dwellers can look for them on their morning walks or trips around the city.” Accuracy is key The group lists local vegetation, like the Indian almond wood, night blooming jasmine and Indian kino-vengai among others, collating content and creating illustrative posters. The poster on the Arjuna tree, for instance, lists distinguishing features of the tree, like its white bark, and the Tamil name vellai maradhu . Technical knowledge and fact-checking is provided by the Care Earth Trust. “Currently, the project is on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and our website, and would go on our monthly newsletter. We would be more than happy to share this with educational institutions and other interested parties in the future,” says Athreya, forging a green connection to a city that named its neighbouhoods by tree — Triplicane ( thiru-alli-keni or sacred lily pond), Purasawalkam (from the purasu or flame of the forest tree), Panayur ( panai maram or palm village) and Alandur (Ala mara or Banyan’s oor or village).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-many-namesakes-of-madras/article35204549.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Park here for dosas||Layers of flaky Kerala parotta soaked in spicy gravy are served in a thooku paathram (a traditional steel container with a handle) at Kaasa Kitchen. The restaurant, serving fusion food in Fort Kochi, is determined not to let the pandemic affect business. A week ago, it launched an in-car dining service that has been drawing a steady stream of customers, all pulling up in front of the restaurant to enjoy their favourite dishes. Kaasa is just one of a clutch of restaurants across the country that has formally launched an in-car dining service. Informally, through the last lockdown especially, an increasing number of customers — eager for a drive, change of scene and freshly made food — started eating in their cars as restaurants could only do takeaway. Even as restaurants reopen across the country, given the ongoing pandemic, some customers are likely to opt to continue to picnic in their cars, adding an interesting new twist to restaurant service. Kaasa, for instance, has designed an entire ceremony around it — offering finger bowls and a temporary car fumigator to prevent the smell of food from lingering inside. Food is served on specially-designed elongated trays, which fit in the car in such a way that allows passengers to roll up the windows and switch on the AC. “They can vibe to the music of their choice as they dig into their meal,” says Sharon Gafoor, the owner of Kaasa Kitchen. Classic drive-in With restrictions on dining-in still in effect, Kerala is reviving the age-old concept of the classic drive-in. With the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) launching in-car dining services in restaurants operating under it across the State on June 30, the trend is catching on. At KTDC restaurants set in scenic locations, the experience could feel like a micro vacation, says an official, adding that it is especially appreciated by those travelling with elderly people and children. Currently operational at KTDC’s restaurants at Kottarakkara, Kayamkulam, Alappuzha, Kuttippuram and Kannur from breakfast till dinner time, food is served on long trays that can be fitted across the front and back seats of the car. While restaurateurs maintain that in-car dining has its challenges, it has been a great way to tide over the tough phase, keeping jobs and livelihoods. Zaatar in Kochi, which serves typically Arabian fare, has also tweaked its menu to suit the car-dining experience. “We cut down on our gravy-heavy Indian dishes and are focussing more on our traditional Arabic fare,” says Mohammed Moosa, a founding members of the restaurant. “We cannot say that business is great, but it certainly has helped us stay afloat,” he adds. Parking facility The availability of parking space has been a huge factor in deciding the trend, say restaurateurs. Most of the places offering in-car dining have the provision to park at least 10 to 15 cars at a time. This could be a model to follow even in a post-COVID scenario, says Gunasekharan M, senior manager of TTDC Hotel on Azhagar Kovil Road, Madurai. One of the first restaurants in Madurai to adapt to the COVID situation by offering in-car dining, Gunasekharan says the idea eliminates fear of the disease spreading in a closed, air-conditioned space. “Even after COVID passes, people may prefer to be cautious,” he adds. With dining in set to restart in Tamil Nadu, the restaurant will offer both regular dine-in along with in-car dining. Here, instead of one elongated tray, each passenger is given a tray that is fixed to the door. A large screen placed in the outdoor dining area provides entertainment, too. Although the trend of in-car dining has not caught on formally in Chennai, despite the legacy of well-loved Woodlands Drive-In, over the past few months it became routine to see customers unfurling ghee roast dosas in the comfort of their cars. Restaurant dining has restarted in Chennai this week, but we expect to continue to see kerbside pickups, followed by kerbside dining now that people have discovered the joys of filter coffee to go.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/park-here-for-dosas/article35204569.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The eri invites all||Two corridors intersect at Siruseri: one a jigsaw of towering infrastructure, and the other, of trees. The second sits atop a bund running along the newly restored Twin Lakes. The bigger of the two, the periya eri , holds over 50 million cubic feet of water, nearly double of what it did in 2019. Multiple small islands inviting nesting water birds rise from the lake; trees of barringtonia (the pelican’s favourite), arjuna and nochi (medicinal) line the area; and the three-kilometre bund, which serves as a walkway around the lake, has wooden gazebos on either side. Behind this restoration project is Joss Brooks, the man who also restored Adyar Poonga and the Pitchandikulam forest in Auroville. In 2018, his company, Pitchandikulam Forest Consultants, was roped in when experts from IIT-Madras, on Tata Consultancy Services’ request, were studying how to increase the water level in the area, and more importantly, how to control those levels in case of flooding. “The water that fills the lake is almost pure. It comes out of a reserved forest of 300 acres above it, which forms its catchment,” says Brooks. The forest too needs to be restored in the long term; indigenous trees will need to replace the invasive acacia, to prevent soil erosion and silt being deposited in the lake. “If that isn’t done, in a few years we’ll have to dig the lake out again,” he warns. With the city ‘unlocking’ after the second wave of the pandemic, and its residents in need of open spaces, Brooks hopes that the lakes would be a good option. The consultancy’s larger aim, as suggested by IIT-Madras as well, is to create an eco-park or an environment centre. “We already have a plan in place for the environment centre, but we are looking for funds to maintain it,” says Brooks. He hopes that the recent push for ecoparks — Municipal Administration Minister KN Nehru recently announced Rs. 2,600 crores to increase the city’s green cover along its banks — will help. The message, he says, “is for people to get involved in nurturing and protecting their environment”. The locals at Siruseri have imbibed this lesson. “All through the pandemic, we were lucky to have a dedicated group of gardeners from the local community who would look after the lake,” he says. Maybe we too could follow in their footsteps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-eri-invites-all/article35204552.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Action films have a universal appeal: Akshaye Khanna on ‘State of Siege: Temple Attack’||This year marks the 20th anniversary of Dil Chahta Hai , a much-loved buddy movie that went on to become a cult classic in Hindi cinema. Among the many fine things in it, Akshaye Khanna’s portrayal of Sidharth Sinha — a sensitive, mild-mannered artist who falls in love with a divorcee much older than him — is especially endearing. Asked if it is one of his favourites, Khanna pauses for several seconds before saying yes. There is already a ton of trivia, interviews and long-form pieces on Dil Chahta Hai . But are there any anecdotes that the world does not know yet? “You are asking the wrong person,” he says, over a Zoom call from Mumbai, “My memory is not that great. But I can tell you it was a very happy time in my life and a very happy shoot.” A lot might have changed in Khanna’s career since the film’s release but one thing that has not is his feeling of fun when it comes to cinema. “It has always been an enjoyable experience.” Khanna’s filmography suggests he is genre-neutral. But he would have liked more action films. It is why he readily agreed to State of Siege: Temple Attack , in which he plays an NSG commando. The film, directed by Ken Ghosh, is inspired from the 2002 terrorist attack on Akshardham Temple in Gujarat. This is not the first time he is playing a role where he is required to wear a uniform and handle big guns. In his second film, Border , he was a second lieutenant. He later played a lieutenant in LOC Kargil . So, what is the fascination for uniforms and guns? “It is just something that captures your imagination,” he says, “Action movies are hugely popular all over the world. I love watching them repeatedly. Whether it is a police officer or an army officer or anyone in those kinds of professions are attractive on an aspirational level.” Khanna also likes films about real-life incidents. “It adds authenticity. When you’re watching it, in the back of your mind, you know that it’s something that has happened to real people,” he says. But he adds that State of Siege: Temple Attack is different from some of his other based-on-real-life-incident films like The Accidental Prime Minister or Gandhi, My Father . “In this film, we are not claiming to recreate the actual incident. It is a dramatised, fictional account of what unfolded.”  State of Siege: Temple Attackwill stream on Zee5 from July 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/action-films-have-a-universal-appeal-akshaye-khanna-on-state-of-siege-temple-attack/article35204532.ece

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The Madras Pantry, Mahalingapuram||Mother-daughter duo K Srilakshmi and K Keerthana started a small food delivery service in January 2020, serving homes and hostels in their locality. During the first wave, when their other businesses were shut, food delivery kept them going. It was challenging to run a food business during lockdown, says Keerthana. “When the meat shops were shut during lockdown, the menu had to be changed to completely vegetarian,” she says. Business took off when they started supplying food to doctors on duty; their combo packages were a huge hit. They have a standard menu one can pre-book, boasting chicken ghee roast deepened with Bydagi  chillies and prawn biryani, lush with saffron milk. Their elaborate non-vegetarian combo for two is priced at Rs. 699.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Fist of fury||Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is not a man in a hurry — he has made seven films in 20 years. His latest Toofaan is set for release next week; the same week which saw the release of his first directorial, Aks , two decades ago. Today, the filmmaker occupies an important place in contemporary Indian cinema as a progressive policymaker — whether it is the jaunty socio-political highs of Rang De Basanti or the immersive adrenaline rushes of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag . A conversation with the 58-year-old is always fascinating; his answers measured, his tone nuanced, and one can even sense his thoughts as he explains what drew him to a boxing drama and casting Farhan Akthar in it. Excerpts from an interview:  Toofaan is a refreshing departure from the spate of ‘sports biopics’ we have had over the last decade. Is the script a totally fictional story? Well, I have been blamed too for going the biopic route earlier, but Toofaan is a complete work of fiction indeed. However, it draws everything from real life, from anecdotes and people I have seen and heard about, from conflicts and struggles. It is a drama at a family and social level, and a lovely romance, set against the backdrop of boxing, a sport that has huge synergy with the protagonist.  Why did you pick boxing as the backdrop?  Boxing is a lonely sport; not a team sport. In it, what is most important is not to hit, but how to take a hit. The person who stands till the end without getting knocked out wins. I see that as a metaphor for life. Life will slap and surprise you in different ways, but you have to stand, deal with it, and make yourself a better human being with the choices you make. Right from the inception, the script was lending itself to boxing too. The main character is like a bhai in a locality, from the Bhendi Bazaar and Dongri area in Mumbai. His life so far has taught him how to fight, but his talent and mind can go either way. One’s power can be used to better society or it can be misused...that is the story I wanted to tell. Often, the right path is the difficult one to choose. Tell us about your relationship with Farhan...was it like catching up with an old friend to work on this film?  Our relationship has evolved since Bhaag Milkha Bhaag . We have always had a sense of mutual respect, and when we came out of our first film together, we felt extremely embraced. When you collaborate with someone like Farhan, the energy grows manifold. The important thing is the like-mindedness in what we are doing. When I heard Toofaan for the first time — it was narrated to me by writer Anjum Rajabali — I immediately understood its voice, and wanted to do it with Farhan. I feel both of us have grown a lot since Bhaag… and it is exciting to tell a story that dwells deeper into human relationships. This film is not plot-driven, it is character-driven. Which is why I am sure audiences will see their own struggles on screen and be able to empathise. Toofaan will stream on Amazon Prime from July 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fist-of-fury/article35205044.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A watershed moment||A year-and-a-half ago, Sajan Prakash, 27, thought he would not make it to the Tokyo Olympics 2020. The swimmer suffered a slipped disc, which also hurt his neck. As he recovered, the pandemic forced pools to close in Thailand, where he was training at the Thanyapura Aquatic Centre in Phuket on a scholarship. Confined to his hostel, he contemplated returning to India. But the situation here was worse. Then, last August, a reprieve came in the form of a 50-day camp in Dubai organised for top Indian swimmers with national coach Pradeep Kumar. After the camp, Sajan was in a quandary again. He wanted to stay back in Dubai, but that was going to be expensive. That is when coach Pradeep and his wife, Gowri, came to Sajan’s rescue. The couple invited him to stay with them in Dubai and ensured he got better in the pool. On June 26, Sajan clocked 1:56:38 seconds in the men’s 200-metre butterfly event at the Sette Colli Trophy in Rome. In doing so, he became the first Indian swimmer to make the Olympic Qualifying Time (also known as FINA ‘A’ cut), which ensures automatic qualification for the Olympics. Unable to make the ‘A’ cut hitherto, Indian swimmers had to count on the Olympic Selection Time (also known as ‘B’ time) or the universality quota — less certain ways — to get to the Olympics. Three days later, Sajan’s compatriot Srihari Nataraj, 20, joined him in securing the ‘A’ cut after his time of 53.77s in a 100-metre backstroke time trial in the Rome event was ratified by international swimming’s governing body, FINA. Srihari, like Sajan, had to overcome obstacles before breaching the qualifying mark. For over six months, he could not swim due to the lockdown. Then, this January, his father passed away. It took about seven months of relentless training to shave half a second off, which determined his entry to the Tokyo Games. An Olympic medal still remains a distant dream for Indian swimming. But Sajan and Srihari’s ‘A’ cuts could be a defining moment. Long way to go Ever since the 1951 Asian Games in which India won six swimming medals, including its only gold, there has been very little success. The country has added just three more medals at the Asian Games and one (in para-swimming) at the Commonwealth Games . In bigger meets — the World Aquatics Championships and the Olympics — qualification itself has been a big deal. Can the medal drought be attributed to genes? Sports science expert Genadijus Sokolovas, who has worked with the world’s top swimmers like Michael Phelps, says, “Genes matter very little. If this is about size, then, the fastest fish is not the biggest.” According to him, a swimmer’s success depends on their training, technique and motivation. The US swimmers, he says, win medals because they have access to good coaches, excellent training facilities and a supportive ecosystem; not because they are superhumans. Srihari and Sajan say they are happy with the coaching and training facilities. India’s senior coaches Nihar Ameen and Pradeep are winners of the Dronacharya award (given to honour sports coaches in India) and have decades of experience. The top Indian swimmers had the chance to interact with Sokolovas in February during a six-day workshop organised by the Swimming Federation of India (SFI). They also have access to world-class facilities at the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence. “A lot more professionals are involved now. In our days, we never had dieticians, biomechanics experts and physiotherapists at our disposal,” says former Olympic swimmer Nisha Millet. Things seem to be improving for Indian swimmers at the elite level. The problem, Nisha points out, is at the grassroots. “Once you reach the top-level, you get support from the Government, federation and private institutions. But when you are lower down the rung, there is no one to guide you properly,” she says. Girls, for instance, have to deal with cultural taboo as some parents, Pradeep says, don’t want them to wear swimsuits after puberty. And, according to Nisha, they get fewer job opportunities through swimming than boys. These reasons probably explain why no Indian female swimmer since 2004 has made even the ‘B’ time; they have only gone to the Olympics via the universality quota. Coach Pradeep says the Government, private institutions and clubs should promote swimming. The road ahead Srihari and Sajan’s ‘A’ cut is important because it has lifted a mental block among Indian swimmers. “We used to think ‘A’ cut was impossible. Now, two people have made it at the same event,” says Srihari. Pradeep believes this will trigger more ‘A’ cuts in the next Olympics. At the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, he says, India should aim for a podium finish. For these long-term goals to materialise, there is a lot to be done, says SFI’s general secretary Monal Chokshi. One of the immediate goals is to ensure each State has at least three swimming academies under the Khelo India programme. Indian swimming, he explains, follows a two-tier system. The top-tier swimmers have access to high-performance centres like the one in Bengaluru. The junior swimmers — about 130 (“a very small number” according to Chokshi) — are supposed to make use of the Khelo India academies. These academies, however, are not easily accessible. “Srihari’s 53.77 would have won him a medal 15-20 years ago,” says Sokolavas, “There will be a time, 10-20 years from now when Indian swimmers will be swimming faster than current world records. But we can try to do it much before that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-watershed-moment/article35205120.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Not just a bag of tricks||Siblings Nanditha D, 15, and Niveditha D, 11, recently led online sessions on Vedic Maths for students of classes VI-X, of their school, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Kottayam. Prior to it, they had presented a paper and held a workshop on the subject at an online conference organised by the Institute for the Advancement of Vedic Mathematics, based in the UK. During lockdown in 2020, from March to May, they took classes via Skype for over 300 students. In 2021, around 1,000 students had registered for their online sessions. A month ago, they launched a YouTube channel, Maths Made Easy by Nanditha and Niveditha. The inspiration came from their father, P Devaraj, an automobile engineer and Vedic Maths teacher. “When we started our sessions it was meant to help a few of our friends. We didn’t expect it to go this far,” says Nanditha. Meanwhile, in Chennai, Muthuselvi Prabhu, “works round the clock”, teaching Vedic Maths to students from the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and West Asia on a one-to-one basis; she also has training sessions for teachers in India. Indore-based 50-year-old Ravi Asrani, is busy on weekends with students joining from across India and abroad for his Vedic Maths classes. Trainers such as Delhi-based Saurabh Jain and Kota-based Rekha Gupta too have many students attending their sessions these days. Teachers are happy to observe that there has been an increase in the number of people learning Vedic Maths over the last few months. The subject got a boost when learning went digital during the lockdown. The subject consists of 16 sutras or formulae and 13 sub- sutras to solve mathematical problems. While some saw it as a new subject to explore while at home, for most, it was to get over the fear of mathematics. “It is an age-old fear! Several parents, on their part, make it worse by constantly reminding their children about it. So when you come across a technique that promises an easy way of doing calculations, it was natural for many people to try it. For parents, it was also about keeping their children engaged during the lockdown,” says Devaraj. Saurabh, who calls himself a “maths magician”, points out that not many people were aware of Vedic Maths until schooling shifted to the digital mode. “Earlier there were live classes once a week and the fee was high. But that scenario has changed now,” says Saurabh, adding, “We try to make it entertaining.” For instance, instead of paying Rs. 3,500 per month for just three or four classes, they need to pay between Rs. 100-Rs. 500 per hour for an online class. Devaraj adds that he charges Rs. 1,800 for a three-week, 15-hour class. Rekha takes classes for four or five batches with 12-15 students each on a daily basis. “I have been teaching Abacus and Vedic Maths for 15 years now. While online teaching may not give the desired result in the case of Abacus, it works in the case of Vedic Maths. That was probably one reason why many got hooked to it when learning became digital. It is all about making mathematics fun to learn, with what many call ‘tricks’,” she says. Muthuselvi says that the interest is more among students who live abroad. “Here, in India, we have mark-based evaluation and so we stick to the syllabus whereas in many countries all they look at is the students’ understanding of the concepts of mathematics,” she adds. Student becomes master There has also been a rise in the number of people training to become Vedic Maths teachers. Vidhya Vikram from Coimbatore, for instance, has trained over 3,200 people from across the country since September 2020. “While 50% of these trainers are Maths teachers, the rest comprise college students, retired professionals exploring new careers, women looking for flexible career options, parents, grandparents…. I have trained those in the age group of 23 to 78,” says Vidhya. She adds that but for the pandemic and the lockdown, she herself would not have explored online teaching. “When I had live classes, only Maths teachers attended the sessions, that too very few. Now I have a webinar-based training model, where I give a demonstration and take it to more people. Over 50,000 people have attended the webinars,” she says. A flipside is that those with elementary knowledge in Vedic Maths are also conducting classes. “Some of my students who have completed only their first-level sessions are now trainers. While I take Rs. 500 for 12 one-hour classes, they charge Rs. 2,000 or more,” adds Ravi. Meanwhile, mathematicians continue to be divided in their opinion over the origin and efficacy of Vedic Maths. However, according to Devaraj, “We never say that it is the only way to solve a problem. What we trainers stress on is that it is a creative, systematic way of approaching mathematics and not just a bag of tricks. ” Nanditha seconds it, saying: “The first thing that we tell those who attend our sessions is that Maths is not a monster. Make it your best friend and Vedic Maths can help you in that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/not-just-a-bag-of-tricks/article35205121.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Forget pictures. Show me your vaccine certificate||What is your idea of an ideal first date? Martinis at a beach bar? Dinner and a movie? Game night? Well, for some who just met their partners on dating apps, it is heading to the nearest vaccination centre and getting a jab together. #jabwemet. With new variants of COVID-19 rearing their ugly heads, an increasing number of people are opting for the vaccine. And, they want to ensure potential dates are vaccinated too. Now, dating apps are adding features that educate users, busting myths and allaying fears. Popular sites like Tinder, Ok Cupid and Woo allow users to display a badge (usually an image of a syringe or plaster) to state they are vaccinated. It does not matter if they have received just one shot or both. Last November, when vaccines were on the verge of being launched, OK Cupid, a dating app that been in India since 2018 and has over a million members, introduced a set of questions to gauge the mood of users. “Back then, a lot of them said they were not entirely sure if they would opt for it,” says Sitara Menon, senior marketing manager, OK Cupid. She adds that, since then answers have changed to yes, with a substantial number opining that a non-vaccinated person is a deal breaker. The pandemic has led to a change in conversation patterns. New features, including stickers, are conversation starters, says Papri Dev, senior director, APAC communications, Tinder. She adds, “In May 2021 we noticed the reference to vaccines in bios went up by 42 times in members’ profiles,” she says. Sample this: ‘Will you hold my hand while I take my vaccine?’ Or, ‘Let’s get the COVID Vaccine together ;)’. When the pandemic began, the team at OK Cupid noticed the word COVID came up a lot in users’ self summaries on the app. Following that, over the last three months, ‘vaccination’ became the most used term. There has been a 763% increase in the mention of the word vaccine in bios,” says Sitara. She adds that Indians users now want to know if potential partners are vaccinated or want to get vaccinated. Badges on profiles help the others know if the person has taken their jab or not. “People who believe in vaccines, or got theirs, get 25% more matches,” she adds. In a survey conducted in the major metros in the country, Woo, a home-grown dating app with more than 12 million users worldwide, found that 70% of its audience wants to meet people who are vaccinated. “The survey was based on answers given by 10,000 people in the 24-35 age group, says Ritesh Bhatnagar, chief marketing officer-WOO. “That’s why we decided to go on this route and incorporate vaccine-related features like badges on our app last week.” Tinder launched what they call a ‘vaccine centre’ last week, on the app. This is an educational resource with quizzes and questions, and we have a link to CoWin,” says Papri. OK Cupid and Bumble have similar features, with explainers and answers from science and healthcare officials. Tinder has partnered with India Vaccine Project. “Through this partnership, our aim is to offer opportunities to our user base to volunteer and help verify information about COVID Vaccine Centers (CVCs) in India,” says Papri. Members with relevant skill sets can join the project’s tech team or choose from opportunities on indiavaccine.in, helping with creating content, verifying vaccine stocks and reducing vaccine hesitancy, among others. The trust factor “There is a lot of data being shared about the vaccine between users,” says Rahul Namdev, co-founder of Betterhalf.ai, an Artificial Intelligence-driven Indian matrimonial app. While he believes adding badges is a good idea, he says his app has taken a different approach: “We send a lot of notifications, emails and pop up messages to drive awareness.” Rahul says around 40%-50% of his users are vaccinated. He has noticed that women are adamant not to talk to people who do not believe in vaccines. “If a guy says he will be taking his vaccine maybe after three months, then that conversation is not going anywhere,” says Rahul. Sitara agrees that women are a lot more particular. “At this point, on our app, 69% of men and 71% women are vaccinated and sporting badges,” she says. A word of caution: Although users are putting up their vaccine status, the apps are operating on trust alone, and not asking for evidence right now. Woo offers a feature where users can upload their vaccine certificates, but it is not mandatory. Nevertheless, out of 19% of its vaccinated users, 50% have so far uploaded their certificates. On Betterhalf.ai, the team keeps reminding the users to take necessary precautions if they are meeting other daters. Says Rahul, “We are encouraging them to request other users to show their vaccination certificate, that way they can be sure and, hopefully, safe.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/forget-pictures-show-me-your-vaccine-certificate/article35205124.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||‘A film with honest emotion will cross borders’||Fahadh Faasil is a restless actor. He constantly thinks of ways to play different characters; resulting in an impressive filmography over the last few years. “I tend of get bored of what I am doing very quickly,” he admits, in a quick virtual conversation from Kochi, “I set out on long drives and a few hours into it, I change my destination.” So when the pandemic put a break on his projects, Fahadh quickly changed gears and tried an experiment. With CU Soon, director Mahesh Narayan and Fahadh tried telling an entire story through virtual communication devices. Their upcoming film Malik , however, is not an experiment on those lines. A film originally made for theatres and releasing on Amazon Prime now, Malik , is set in a fishing village in Kerala between 1965 and 2018, and features Fahadh in an author-backed role; he plays Sulaiman, the chieftain of the fisherfolk. Fahadh’s cinematic oeuvre has been fascinating, with him playing a wide range of characters from genial thief ( Thondimuthalum Drikshashiyum ) to a cunning pastor ( Trance ), roles that other actors might have been hesitant to accept. When he chooses them, it is primarily because he does not relate to them. “I do not look at relatability to the character as a factor. In fact, I would like to perform characters I’m not familiar with. This gives me the chance to do research and then approach it.” Is this the same with Malik ? “I thought about the old men in the family, like my grandfather and my dad's brothers. It's my understanding of how gracefully people age.”  Malik has Fahadh’s character ageing from 21 to 58; for this, the actor reportedly lost about 15 kilos over a period of time. Prod him about the process, and Fahadh just shrugs, “I don't physically strain myself to do any of the roles; for instance, I do not promise a six-pack! I try to look the character; if I achieve that, it is 50% less acting I need to do.” He believes that this film, like his earlier projects, will prompt conversation among audiences. “I have always wanted my films to address different issues, give different levels of entertainment; there should be discussions around my work. Staying within the kind of films I do, I have tried to grow.” The last 15 months or so have been huge for Fahadh, in terms of reach. Thanks to the soaring popularity of OTT platforms and the wonders of subtitling, Fahadh, and Malayalam films in general, made significant inroads into the rest of the country. “Any honest emotion gets there. I do films with emotion, and that, in turn, travels across borders and connects with people.” He already has tried that not just with Malayalam but also Tamil cinema, with Velaikaran and Super Deluxe. “Tamil cinema has been welcoming; I have so many good friends, like Kumar (Thiagarajan Kumararaja), Mohan Raja and Lokesh (Kanagaraj). It’s just a different language, but it’s all just the same. We all function the same way.” He’s looking forward to strengthening ties with Tamil audiences with Vikram , his upcoming biggie directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. This project gives him the opportunity to rub shoulders with co-star Kamal Haasan, of whom he is a big fan. “I am eagerly waiting to shoot with him.” What is the one thing he wants to ask Kamal on the first day on set? “I love all his films: Michael Madhana Kama Rajan , Kurudhi Punal , Guna .... I could go on. I just want to ask him one thing: How do you do it?”  Malik releases on Amazon Prime on July 15||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-film-with-honest-emotion-will-cross-borders/article35205045.ece
08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The birth of MMKR||A few weeks ago, Kamal Haasan took to Facebook to share a series of posts on what went into the making of Dasavatharam , his magnum opus which completed 13 years recently. In the comments section, Malayalam filmmaker Alphonse Puthren requested Haasan to give a similar “masterclass” on Michael Madhana Kama Rajan ( MMKR ), often regarded as one of the best comedies in Tamil cinema. In response, Haasan took to his social media page to share interesting anecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories from MMKR , directed by veteran Singeetam Srinivasa Rao. Recalling the meeting he had with Singeetam during the filming of the Malayalam film Chanakya , Haasan said that the seed of thought for MMKR came when the duo was making Pushpak , another classic from the Haasan-Rao combination. The plot, which revolves around quadruplets, was inspired by films such as Yaadon Ki Baaraat (Hindi), Sivaji Ganesan’s Deiva Magan and MGR’s Nadodi Mannan . “The idea was decades-old. I drew a diagram and explained the plot with a sketch, which was full of arrows and squares and a high point which we call the climax. Mr. Singeetam understood it and said ‘okay’ right away,” said Haasan. The screenplay was written by Haasan and Rao and it was only later that they roped in ‘Crazy’ Mohan for the dialogues. In another post, Haasan recalled how the now-popular Kameshwaran was initially conceived as a scientist. “I wanted Kameshwaran to be a genius. Then I came up with the character of a Palakkad Brahmin. My experience in Malayalam films and my friends from Kerala helped me understand the language better. That is how Kameshwaran was born,” he added. In the series, Haasan remembered and acknowledged the contribution of his star cast comprising Nagesh, Manorama, Kushboo, S.N. Lakshmi and Rupini to mention a few, and the crew including maestro Ilaiyaraaja, cinematographer B.C. Gowrishankar and stunt director Vikram Dharma.

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Action films have a universal appeal: Akshaye Khanna on ‘State of Siege: Temple Attack’||This year marks the 20th anniversary of Dil Chahta Hai , a much-loved buddy movie that went on to become a cult classic in Hindi cinema. Among the many fine things in it, Akshaye Khanna’s portrayal of Sidharth Sinha — a sensitive, mild-mannered artist who falls in love with a divorcee much older than him — is especially endearing. Asked if it is one of his favourites, Khanna pauses for several seconds before saying yes. There is already a ton of trivia, interviews and long-form pieces on Dil Chahta Hai . But are there any anecdotes that the world does not know yet? “You are asking the wrong person,” he says, over a Zoom call from Mumbai, “My memory is not that great. But I can tell you it was a very happy time in my life and a very happy shoot.” A lot might have changed in Khanna’s career since the film’s release but one thing that has not is his feeling of fun when it comes to cinema. “It has always been an enjoyable experience.” Khanna’s filmography suggests he is genre-neutral. But he would have liked more action films. It is why he readily agreed to State of Siege: Temple Attack , in which he plays an NSG commando. The film, directed by Ken Ghosh, is inspired from the 2002 terrorist attack on Akshardham Temple in Gujarat. This is not the first time he is playing a role where he is required to wear a uniform and handle big guns. In his second film, Border , he was a second lieutenant. He later played a lieutenant in LOC Kargil . So, what is the fascination for uniforms and guns? “It is just something that captures your imagination,” he says, “Action movies are hugely popular all over the world. I love watching them repeatedly. Whether it is a police officer or an army officer or anyone in those kinds of professions are attractive on an aspirational level.” Khanna also likes films about real-life incidents. “It adds authenticity. When you’re watching it, in the back of your mind, you know that it’s something that has happened to real people,” he says. But he adds that State of Siege: Temple Attack is different from some of his other based-on-real-life-incident films like The Accidental Prime Minister or Gandhi, My Father . “In this film, we are not claiming to recreate the actual incident. It is a dramatised, fictional account of what unfolded.”  State of Siege: Temple Attackwill stream on Zee5 from July 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/action-films-have-a-universal-appeal-akshaye-khanna-on-state-of-siege-temple-attack/article35205126.ece

08 July 2021||July 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Park here for dosas||Layers of flaky Kerala parotta soaked in spicy gravy are served in a thooku paathram (a traditional steel container with a handle) at Kaasa Kitchen. The restaurant, serving fusion food in Fort Kochi, is determined not to let the pandemic affect business. A week ago, it launched an in-car dining service that has been drawing a steady stream of customers, all pulling up in front of the restaurant to enjoy their favourite dishes. Kaasa is just one of a clutch of restaurants across the country that has formally launched an in-car dining service. Informally, through the last lockdown especially, an increasing number of customers — eager for a drive, change of scene and freshly made food — started eating in their cars as restaurants could only do takeaway. Even as restaurants reopen across the country, given the ongoing pandemic, some customers are likely to opt to continue to picnic in their cars, adding an interesting new twist to restaurant service. Kaasa, for instance, has designed an entire ceremony around it — offering finger bowls and a temporary car fumigator to prevent the smell of food from lingering inside. Food is served on specially-designed elongated trays, which fit in the car in such a way that allows passengers to roll up the windows and switch on the AC. “They can vibe to the music of their choice as they dig into their meal,” says Sharon Gafoor, the owner of Kaasa Kitchen. Classic drive-in With restrictions on dining-in still in effect, Kerala is reviving the age-old concept of the classic drive-in. With the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) launching in-car dining services in restaurants operating under it across the State on June 30, the trend is catching on. At KTDC restaurants set in scenic locations, the experience could feel like a micro vacation, says an official, adding that it is especially appreciated by those travelling with elderly people and children. Currently operational at KTDC’s restaurants at Kottarakkara, Kayamkulam, Alappuzha, Kuttippuram and Kannur from breakfast till dinner time, food is served on long trays that can be fitted across the front and back seats of the car. While restaurateurs maintain that in-car dining has its challenges, it has been a great way to tide over the tough phase, keeping jobs and livelihoods. Zaatar in Kochi, which serves typically Arabian fare, has also tweaked its menu to suit the car-dining experience. “We cut down on our gravy-heavy Indian dishes and are focussing more on our traditional Arabic fare,” says Mohammed Moosa, a founding members of the restaurant. “We cannot say that business is great, but it certainly has helped us stay afloat,” he adds. Parking facility The availability of parking space has been a huge factor in deciding the trend, say restaurateurs. Most of the places offering in-car dining have the provision to park at least 10 to 15 cars at a time. This could be a model to follow even in a post-COVID scenario, says Gunasekharan M, senior manager of TTDC Hotel on Azhagar Kovil Road, Madurai. One of the first restaurants in Madurai to adapt to the COVID situation by offering in-car dining, Gunasekharan says the idea eliminates fear of the disease spreading in a closed, air-conditioned space. “Even after COVID passes, people may prefer to be cautious,” he adds. With dining in set to restart in Tamil Nadu, the restaurant will offer both regular dine-in along with in-car dining. Here, instead of one elongated tray, each passenger is given a tray that is fixed to the door. A large screen placed in the outdoor dining area provides entertainment, too. Although the trend of in-car dining has not caught on formally in Chennai, despite the legacy of well-loved Woodlands Drive-In, over the past few months it became routine to see customers unfurling ghee roast dosas in the comfort of their cars. Restaurant dining has restarted in Chennai this week, but we expect to continue to see kerbside pickups, followed by kerbside dining now that people have discovered the joys of filter coffee to go.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/park-here-for-dosas/article35205122.ece
08 July 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi gets own genome sequencing lab||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday inaugurated the SARS CoV-2 genome sequencing facility at Lok Nayak Hospital. It will help in timely identification of COVID-19 variants and aid strategies to counter them, he said, The third such facility in north India, Mr. Kejriwal stated that the machine will be able to identify and analyse all variants of COVID-19 for any future waves or spreads in the city. Until now, he added, Delhi was dependent on the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for this purpose. The machine will be able to sequence 5 to 7 samples in a day with a turnaround time of about 4 to 5 days. This facility will be used mainly for surveillance and public health purposes as identification of variants of concern in interest would be done. Follow precautions The Chief Minister also appealed to residents to follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and take requisite precautions to prevent the outbreak of another wave of infection. “We have been constantly reading in the newspapers that new variants and mutations of COVID-19 are emerging every day. So as to get our samples tested, we were dependent upon the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the lab of the Central government,” he said. “Through this machine, we will be able to analyse all the variants of COVID-19 and understand them for any future waves or spreads in Delhi, if at all they are witnessed. If we get to know the variant on time, we will be able to strategise our preparations well and it will be helpful in taking the right action,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal said the genome sequencer facility will be an asset not only for Delhi but for northern India. The COVID-19 pandemic was still ongoing and new viral variants were rapidly emerging leading to recurrent outbreaks. As the pandemic was notorious for undergoing mutations, he said, it was of paramount importance to identify the circulating viral strains so that contact tracing can be done to check the further spread of variants. Another facility soon The Delhi government is setting up another SARS CoV-2 genome sequencing facility at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Services to tackle a possible third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, he said. “I appeal to the public that while activities are being opened, the people of Delhi should follow social distancing and take the right precautions, else COVID-19 might spread again,” Mr. Kejriwal added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-gets-own-genome-sequencing-lab/article35204861.ece
08 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||Rewari farmers join protest in Rajasthan||A large number of farmers from Rewari under the aegis of Bawal Khap-84 reached the protest site at Rajasthan’s Shahjahanpur village on Wednesday to support the ongoing agitation against the three farm laws. Welcoming the farmers, Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav said the farmers movement was gaining strength with each passing day. He said that those who were claiming that the farmers’ movement had lost its steam must see the huge number of farmers reaching the protest site at Shahjahanpur in tractors and trolleys. Mr. Yadav said the farmers morale was high and they would soon emerge victorious. He said farmers from neighbouring villages in Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab were reaching the Shahjahanpur protest site every day despite blistering heat. Mr. Yadav added that the farmers movement had improved the self-respect of the farmers who had risen above caste and religion to unite and fight for their rights. ‘We stand united’ He said that 450 farmer organisations had joined the hands to spearhead the ongoing agitation and still stood united despite the efforts from the government to create division. The Swaraj India chief said the farmers were awakened and had learnt to peacefully continue with the agitation and their victory was confirmed. The farmer unions have given a call for nationwide protest against the rise in prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas on July 8. ‘Contest Punjab Polls’ Meanwhile, Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said on Wednesday said that outfits involved in farmers’ agitation against the new agriculture laws should contest the Punjab Assembly elections as it will “present a model on how the system can be changed.” Mr. Charuni, a key leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SMK) which is spearheading the farmers’ stir, said: “What I want to say is that we should not run ‘Mission U.P.’, but ‘Mission Punjab’.” SKM has planned a mahapanchayat in September and other activities in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to the polls next year. “Now, we are moving for Mission U.P. A Mahapanchayat will be organised on September 5. Other activities will happen. Then polls will come and we will work to defeat the BJP. If we assume BJP gets defeated, will the Centre then agree to our demands. Don’t take it otherwise,” asked Mr. Charuni in a video message, and cited the example of West Bengal, where the farmer bodies campaigned against the BJP. “The BJP was defeated there, but did the Centre then accept our demand,” he asked. Mr. Charuni said that the BJP and the Congress have not been able to change the system. “Then from whom should we expect to do this? If we have to change the system, then we will have to formulate a plan. And that plan should be ‘Mission Punjab’,” he said.

08 July 2021||New delhi,||Farmers gear up for stir against fuel price hike||Large contingents of farmers have started arriving at protest sites in preparation for their agitation on Thursday against fuel price hike, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Wednesday. “At the call of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, protests will be organised across India on Thursday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon for two hours against the hike in diesel, petrol and cooking gas prices,” the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions said. The protesters will reach designated public locations with any means of transport including scooters, motorcycles, tractors, cars, buses, trucks and also with empty gas cylinders, it said. On Wednesday, the petrol prices in Delhi as well as Kolkata crossed the Rs. 100 a litre mark. For peaceful march The SKM has demanded that the fuel prices be halved with immediate effect. It has also appealed to the protesters to keep the demonstration peaceful and on the roadside, without blocking any pathways. “This is an issue that affects every section of the society, and SKM appeals that farmers, labourers, youth, students, women, employees, shopkeepers, transporters, traders and others be part of these protests everywhere,” the body said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-gear-up-for-stir-against-fuel-price-hike/article35204847.ece
08 July 2021||GUWAHATI,||Only traditional food items to be served at Assam govt. events||Only traditional food items will be served at government programmes in Assam, the State Cabinet headed by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma decided on Wednesday. The decision has been taken in sync with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s credo of ‘vocal for local’ for promoting indigenous food products, a government spokesperson said. Assam has a variety of snacks, mostly on the sweeter side and made of powdered rice, coconut and other locally available ingredients. “Traditional snacks such as pitha and laaru will be served with tea at official functions from now on,” the spokesperson said. The Cabinet also decided to make it mandatory for handwoven gamosa — the traditional multipurpose scarf-towel — to be used at government programmes. Gifting an Assamese gamosa to visitors or dignitaries is a tradition in Assam. The tradition is similar for other indigenous communities with the Bodos, for one, using the arnai or a decorative scarf. But over the years, cheaper machine-made gamosas from Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have threatened to push Assam’s weavers out of business. According to a 2018 estimate by the State government, Assam has more than 13 lakh looms out of a total of 28 lakh looms in the country. Seizures of machine-made gamosas under the Handloom (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985, have had little impact. The Act reserves certain articles for exclusive production by handloom. These include the gamosa , angavastram and the Manipuri phanek.  Playing the State anthem ‘O mur apunar dekh’ at the beginning of all government programmes and meetings and the national anthem ‘Jana gana mana’ at the end was another decision taken by the Cabinet. Awards for govt. staff Among other decisions was an annual performance-based award for five non-gazetted employees at the district and 10 at the State level. Apart from citations on Karmachari Divas (August 5) to mark the death anniversary of the State’s first Chief Minister Gopinath Bardoloi, the award-winning employees will get a year’s extension of service, the spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/only-traditional-food-items-to-be-served-at-assam-govt-events/article35204838.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Petrol crosses Rs. 100/litre mark in Capital||The price of petrol crossed the Rs. 100/litre mark in the Capital for the first time fuelling protests from various sections. Petrol price was increased by 35 paise per litre while diesel rates were increased by 17 paise a litre, according to a price notification from State-owned fuel retailers. In Delhi, the price of petrol now stands at Rs. 100.21 per litre and diesel rates rose to Rs. 89.53 a litre. Demands rollback The Delhi Congress organised a flash protest outside the residence of Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Dharmendra Pradhan demanding his resignation for his failure to keep fuel prices in check. Congress workers held the BJP government at the Centre responsible for the prices of petrol and diesel and demanded a rollback of excise duty and VAT (value added tax) on these products to give relief to the common people. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that frequent petrol and diesel price hike, almost on a daily basis for the past many weeks, seems to have not affected the BJP government at the Centre, which is least concerned about the plight of the common people. “The common people have been financially distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and are in no position to bear the extra burden of oil price hikes,” Mr. Kumar said. He added that the seven BJP MPs from Delhi were not concerned with the people’s difficulties as their interaction with the residents remains confined to asking for votes during elections and fooling people with lies and falsehood. The protesters were stopped by the Delhi police as they moved towards the residence of the Union Minister. Mr. Kumar said that despite crude oil price in the international market slumping, retail prices of petrol and diesel continue to soar in the country without any checks and balance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is happy with his friends in the petroleum sector making enormous profits from the retail sale of oil products. “High cost of petrol and diesel has had an adverse impact in the prices of essential commodities as rising transportation costs get reflected when these products reach markets,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/petrol-crosses-rs-100litre-mark-in-capital/article35204845.ece
08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Relative arrested for killing wife, son of IAF employee in Palam||A day after wife and son of an Indian Air Force employee were found murdered at their residence in south-west Delhi’s Palam village, police have arrested their relative in connection with the case. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South West) Ingit Pratap Singh said that the accused has been identified as Abhishek Verma (33), a resident of Burari, who allegedly killed his paternal aunt Babita Verma (52) and her son Gaurav Verma (27). The accused was annoyed as his aunt used to allegedly “mentally torture and taunt” his family to return the money she had given for his sister’s marriage. Police said that on Tuesday evening, a PCR call was received by Krishan Swaroop Sudhir (55), who is employed as accountant in the IAF Palam station, stating that his wife and son have been murdered. When police reached the spot, they found that the two had been killed using dumbbells and almirahs were open. During investigation, police examined the CCTV footage and saw the accused taking an e-rickshaw to Dashrathpuri metro station where he stops near a coffee shop. When police tracked down the e-rickshaw driver, he told them that the man had blood on his face and the currency note he gave was torn, therefore, the driver returned it because of which the accused used e-wallet to pay the driver Rs. 30. The DCP said that when the said mobile number was examined, it was found to be in the name of Abhishek Verma. Family members of the victim were then asked if this name rings a bell after which it was revealed that Abhishek is Babita’s brother’s son. Abhishek was arrested on Wednesday. Police said that the accused was present during post-mortem and has been with the family since the murder to ensure that no one suspects him. During interrogation, it was revealed that Babita had given Rs. 50,000 to Abhishek’s family for his sister’s wedding and she used to allegedly “mentally torture and taunt” his family to return the money. Two days before the incident, the accused had come to the victim’s residence and an argument over the same issue ensued. Therefore, on Tuesday, Abhishek had allegedly come with a plan to kill his aunt but he killed the cousin as well because he was witness to the murder. Police said that Abhishek had come on his two-wheeler, which he parked at Dashrathpuri metro station, and took an e-rickshaw to the house. He was also carrying an extra pair of clothes to change after the incident. After killing the two, Abhishek allegedly opened the almirah to mislead police and make it look like a robbery, police said.

08 July 2021||New Delhi,||BJP accuses AAP leaders of siphoning off ration meant for poor||The BJP on Wednesday accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its leaders of siphoning off ration meant for distribution amongst poor in Delhi and selling them in the market. The BJP claimed to have caught AAP worker red-handed while trying to steal dry ration from a storage point in Trilokpuri and trying to sell it in the black market. It also staged a protest against the local AAP MLA, it said. “Ration meant for the poor had been stored in the Government Boys Senior Secondary School at New Ashok Nagar. However, the AAP workers with the connivance of the school management stole the ration and started selling them in the open market,” Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri alleged. Demands arrest “We demand that an FIR be lodged against the AAP MLA and he should be arrested immediately. The Delhi Food and Civil Supplies Minister should also resign,” he demanded. Mr. Bidhuri claimed that 516 food kits had already been stolen and this was the second time that AAP workers had come to pick up kits to sell in the open market, but we caught them red-handed. Stolen ration had also been recovered from the house of an AAP party worker which he offered to return to the school, he alleged. “What is most unfortunate is that action had been taken against the school principal in the matter, but no action had been taken against the AAP MLA or the party workers,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged. “We have sent all the evidence of the incident to L-G Anil Baijal for appropriate action,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-accuses-aap-leaders-of-siphoning-off-ration-meant-for-poor/article35204858.ece
08 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC: submit report on black fungus drug||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the Centre to submit a status report on availability of Liposomal Amphotericin B, used for treating patients of mucormycosis (black fungus), which primarily affects those who have recovered from COVID-19. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the Centre to also indicate the quantities of the drug imported and the outstanding supplies and also its domestic production. No shortage The court was informed that there was no shortage of the drug as of now as the number of patients had gone down. “If we are preparing for the third wave of COVID-19, we need to see the arrangement for it,” the Bench said. The court was informed by the Centre’s counsel that presently there are 17,000 cases of black fungus in the country, which have come down from 23,000-24,000. In May, the High Court had allowed duty-free import of Amphotericin B till the Central government took a final decision on waiving the customs and other duties on the drug. The court had also asked the Centre to come out with a policy on distribution of Amphotericin B due to its current scarcity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-submit-report-on-black-fungus-drug/article35204865.ece
08 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Compensate industry for huge losses: Akali Dal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday demanded the Congress government provide financial package to the industry for the losses suffered by it on account of forced shutdown amid the ongoing power crises. Mr. Badal said after suffering huge losses due to the COVID lockdown in the last one and a half years, the sector was presently in the grip of a “power lockdown” with the government imposing a three-day compulsory off, closing down large-scale industries for five days and reducing contracted power load of continuous supply to industry by 50%. “This has broken the back of the industry which is suffering losses of worth crores of rupees on a daily basis besides losing orders,” said Mr. Badal, holding Chief Minister (Retd.) Captain Amarinder Singh responsible for the state of affairs. He said collection of bills for the current cycle be deferred by two months for the sector. “Power should also be provided at a landing cost of Rs. 5 per unit as promised by the Chief Minister,” he said, adding that the industry was paying nearly Rs. 10 per unit. ‘PSPCL in a sad State’ Mr. Badal also demanded a special session of the Assembly to discuss the complete mismanagement of the situation. He said the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which had been declared as the best electricity utility in 2015 during the SAD government led tenure, was now finding it difficult to even supply adequate power to the consumers. “Mismanagement and the Congress government’s failure to add a single mega watt in the last four and a half years has led to a situation where farmers are not getting adequate supply for their paddy crop even as unscheduled power cuts are being imposed on domestic consumers. The Chief Minister owes an explanation as to how a power-surplus State during SAD tenure has become deficient and unable to even distribute power to consumers due to lack of maintenance of transmission and distribution system,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/compensate-industry-for-huge-losses-akali-dal/article35204840.ece

Wearing a white shirt and a pair of blue jeans, unable to contain tears at Vasant Vihar police station, he was joined by his mother’s family while completing police proceedings and last rites on Wednesday afternoon here. “It’s too uncanny that late P.

Talking about her sister, Ms. Chadha said she was the sweetest person on the planet. “She was the most helpful person who would go out of her way to help people. She was intolerant to wrongdoing. She was vocal and that was her personality. I am sure she would have put up a fight while they were smothering her because she was a warrior. I haven’t met a person who was more selfless than her,” the sister remembered of Kitty. It has been learnt that Kitty used to financially help the accused Raju, her washerman, because he wasn’t earning enough during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/son-loses-mother-on-his-birthday/article35204852.ece

08 July 2021||JAIPUR,||Health start-ups providing innovative solutions||Health start-ups coming up in Rajasthan during the COVID-19 pandemic have provided some innovative solutions to overcome the crisis amid the virus infection putting an excessive burden on the public health infrastructure. The start-ups have kicked off with the new concepts of hybrid pharmacy and diagnostics. Supported by a health research institution, the start-ups have conducted research and made intelligent planning with an out-of-box thinking to provide succour to those affected by the second wave of pandemic as well as other other patients whose health needs constant monitoring. The institution provided orientation to several of the entrepreneurs who launched the new units. CIIE support The Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) at the Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) University here has extended support to the nascent startups in the State and helped them with the entrepreneurial skills. Home healthcare for the elderly patients was a major area of intervention in the services of start-ups. CIIE chairperson Sheenu Jain said here on Wednesday that while one of the start-ups had come up for operating in the sphere of hybrid pharmacy, another had launched health-based devices for diabetes and other allied diseases. Technology and service-based start-ups had joined the centre to get connected with the right set of people, she said. The CIIE has worked on evolving the prototypes for start-ups and supported them through mentoring, legal assistance and company registration. Dr. Jain said the CIIE would shortly become the first purely health-based incubator in Rajasthan and get the State government’s support for laying a strong foundation for the units adding value to the healthcare services. A women's entrepreneurship development programme launched by the CIIE has helped out women entrepreneurs to take up the startup projects with profitable outcomes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/health-start-ups-providing-innovative-solutions/article35204841.ece

08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two involved in international online cheating scam arrested||Two persons, allegedly hired by Chinese nationals, have been arrested in connection with an international online cheating scam. They used to allegedly induce people to invest online in wine and spice market and cheated people of Rs. 25 crore, police said on Wednesday. DCP (South-East) R.P. Meena said that the accused have been identified as Nagaraju Karmanchi (31), a resident of Gurugram, and Kondala Subash (31), a resident of Secunderabad. Police said that a complaint was received wherein the complainant stated that he met one of the accused persons Soo Yeon Park, allegedly a South Korean national, on a dating app and he was promised huge returns on his investment.

08 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘North body hasn’t given ration to 3.5L children’||Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj on Wednesday alleged that the BJP-ruled North Corporation has failed to distribute mid-day meal ration for a year due to which over 3.5 lakh children from 700 schools are yet to receive their dry ration. Mr. Bharadwaj said that due to COVID-19, all schools have remained shut. The Delhi government took the initiative to give the children their due share in the form of dry ration by calling and giving it to their parents. However, in North Corporation schools, not even a single child has been given the dry ration, he said. “It is very shameful that about 3.5 lakh students in about 700 schools are not receiving ration. The North body that was supposed to distribute 2,924 tonnes of ration has failed to distribute even 1 kg of it,” he alleged. “It is July now and not even a single child has received the ration since the last year.” Mr. Bharadwaj said. Responding to it, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the North body had already dispatched dry ration to most of its schools and within the next 4 to 5 days ration distribution will start.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/north-body-hasnt-given-ration-to-35l-children/article35204863.ece
