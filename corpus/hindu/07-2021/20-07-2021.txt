20 July 2021||Chennai,||Rahul, Prashant Kishor, ex-EC Lavasa on list of spyware targets||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa, election strategist Prashant Kishor, Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee and Union Ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Patel appeared on a leaked list of “potential” or actual targets for spying by the Israeli company NSO’s Pegasus spyware, news website The Wire and other international publications reported on Monday. Two mobile phones used by Mr. Gandhi appeared on the list — one was added in 2018 when he was the president of the Congress and the other after the 2019 Lok Sabha election, according to the reports. Numbers belonging to at least five of Mr. Gandhi’s close friends and other Congress officials, including Sachin Rao and Alankar Sawai, also figured on the list, which has the names of dozens of journalists, activists and healthcare experts. At least one number once used by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as hundreds of others in the country also appeared on the list. The phones targeted were infiltrated by a malicious software called Pegasus, which is sold by the NSO Group. The spyware can secretly unlock the target’s phone, computer or other devices, collect information and transfer it to another device without the permission of the user. The Israeli company has said it sells Pegasus only to government agencies to fight terrorism and other serious crimes and that it does not operate the spyware licensed to its clients. Those who were targeted in India included The Wire’s editors Siddharth Varadarajan and M.K. Venu, journalist Sushant Singh and Mr. Kishor, a forensic analysis found. The phone of Mr. Kishor, who worked with the Trinamool in West Bengal and the DMK in Tamil Nadu that went to the polls in April, was found to have been compromised as recently as July 14. Investigations confirmed the Pegasus attack, or signs of potential targeting, on phones linked to 10 Indian numbers and 27 phones around the world, according to The Guardian .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rahul-prashant-kishor-ex-ec-lavasa-on-list-of-spyware-targets/article35417368.ece

Kerala filed a 29-page affidavit late on Monday after a Bench of Justices Rohinton F. Nariman and B.R. Gavai asked the State to do so by evening and posted the case as the first to be heard on Tuesday. The affidavit said the State’s strategy was to achieve “a rational balance between life and livelihood”.

As soon as the Lok Sabha convened and Mr. Modi rose to speak, Opposition members protested, carrying placards on fuel price hike and raising slogans demanding the repeal of the three farm laws. Mr. Modi responded by pointing out the diversity in his new Ministry and the “disrespect” shown to them by Opposition members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/parliament-off-to-a-turbulent-start-amid-opposition-protests/article35417370.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC orders Manipur activist’s immediate release||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the release of Manipur-based activist Erendra Leichongbom, detained under the National Security Act (NSA) for his social media posts allegedly on the efficacy of cow dung and urine as cures for COVID-19 in the context of the death of a BJP leader. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah said the activist could not be detained in jail even for one night and ordered his release by 5 p.m. on Monday. The court said his continued detention would be a violation of his fundamental right to life and the due process of law. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said the government would file a response but did not pose any objections. Advocate Shadan Farasat, for Mr. Leichongbom’s father L. Raghumani Singh, said the government was using preventive detention in cases where even ordinary penal sections did not apply. Mr. Farasat submitted that the Facebook posts were criticism against the advocacy of cow dung and urine as cure. He said that stringent NSA provisions had been slapped against the activist to chill his free speech.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-orders-manipur-activists-immediate-release/article35417376.ece
20 July 2021||GUWAHATI,||Villagers string ropeway across missing highway||Villagers on either side of a missing 30-metre stretch of the strategic Trans-Arunachal Highway (TAH) waited 15 days for the government to start work. Thereafter, they took turns for a week to string a ropeway across the gap and reconnect parts of four districts — Siang, West Siang, Upper Siang and Shi Yomi. Two of these districts border Tibet. Many villages and towns in these districts were cut off as heavy rainfall washed away 30 metres of TAH, also National Highway 13, at Lelek in Siang district. More than a week ago, the people in Pangin, Kebang and adjoining villages decided they could not wait for the State’s Highway Department to start work. Pangin is the circle headquarters about 30 km downhill of the damaged portion of the TAH and Kebang about 20 km uphill. “People of 10 villages nearest the damaged portion got together to collect local materials and about 50-60 volunteers took turns to string the suspension bridge with bamboo, ropes and aluminium wires over seven days,” Lelek Bridge Construction Committee chairman Tagum Sitang told The Hindu . The Power Department provided high-tension wires to be used temporarily for the bridge that was completed on July 18. The “temporary” period, villagers said, could stretch to six months because of rain and soggy conditions and the repair was unlikely to take place soon. “For 21 days, people were forced to climb a steep 50-metre rocky mound near the damaged portion to bring in essentials or carry patients to the only major hospital in Pasighat (headquarters of East Siang district),” Mr. Sitang said. “Vehicles are now coming to the safest point near the damaged portion for people to cross over and goods to be transhipped,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/villagers-string-ropeway-across-missing-highway/article35417548.ece

Sixty-six deaths pushed the State’s toll to 1,27,097, with the case fatality rate at 2.04%. The dip in cases has to be viewed in the context of less samples being tested in the last 24 hours — 1.67 lakh against the average of 2.30 lakh. The tally has reached 62,20,207, while total recoveries have risen to 59,93,401, with the recovery rate at 96.35%. Pune reported over 800 new cases, taking its tally to 10,76,599. Six deaths took the cumulative toll to 17,655. As per district authorities, active cases crossed 10,000, while the toll rose to 18,170. Mumbai reported 403 new cases to take its tally to 7,31,561, while active cases dipped to 10,422, while 14 deaths took the toll to 15,716. Kolhapur reported more than 1,100 new cases, taking its total case tally to 1,85,371. The active cases declined to 10,538. Thirteen deaths saw the cumulative toll rise to 5,221.

Stalin on Monday said the State would face the issue legally. Mr. Stalin, who was in New Delhi to invite President Ram Nath Kovind to various events in Tamil Nadu, told the media that he had already met the Prime Minister and expressed his opposition to Karnataka’s move to build the dam. When asked about Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s statement that his State would construct the dam, irrespective of the opposition from Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, Mr. Stalin said, “The Prime Minister has given an assurance. Moreover, the Union Minister for Jal Shakti, too, has given his word. We are hopeful. The case is already in court. So, we will face it legally.” To a query whether Tamil Nadu would accept an invitation from Karnataka for talks on the Mekedatu issue, Mr. Stalin cited Minister for Water Resources Duraimurugan’s statement that there was no scope for talks. On the possibility of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry holding talks [to take on Karnataka], he said, “There is no need for it at this point in time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-will-face-mekedatu-issue-legally/article35417468.ece

20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘TV channels, TDP, MP Raju conspired against govt.’||The Andhra Pradesh government has accused the Opposition Telugu Desam Party and its chief N. Chandrababu Naidu in the Supreme Court of “pulling the strings” in a “deep-rooted conspiracy” hatched with TV channels and YSRCP MP K. Raghurama Krishnam Raju to “revolt” against the democratically elected Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy government. The State government, in an affidavit, said in one instance an amount of €1 million was transferred by TV5 channel chairman to Mr. Raju. The State said Mr. Raju, considered a vocal critic of his party that is in power, was surreptitiously working on a design with the TDP, using certain sections of the media, including TV5, to incite communal violence, spur hatred and contempt against the government and hurl personal abuses at the Chief Minister. “The speeches that were made and interviews given by RRKR [Mr. Raju] were completely premeditated/coordinated and were aired only after detailed discussions between the petitioners [TV channels], RRKR and the members of Telugu Desam Party. Such speeches also resulted in actual violence on the ground,” the State government, represented by advocate Mahfooz A. Nazki, justified slapping sedition charges against the MP and the two channels. “It is clear that all the strings were being pulled by TDP and its chief, Shri Chandrababu Naidu. The timing of the calls, the chats and the documents shared between RRKR and Shri Chandrababu Naidu as well as Shri Nara Lokesh [vice-president of TDP], clearly point to a bigger conspiracy against the elected government formed by the YSRCP party,” the affidavit said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tdp-tv-channels-mp-raju-plotted-against-jagan-govt/article35417338.ece

The proposed legislation that will replace the extant Emigration Act of 1983 will be crucial for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), especially those from Kerala as the provisions cover labour migration and exploitation, remittances, student mobility and human trafficking.

He also repeated his invitation to floor leaders of all parties for a meeting with him on July 20 evening to discuss the vaccination policy and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Modi had made the same offer at the all party meeting on Sunday, which had been rebuffed by opposition leaders who demanded a discussion in Parliament rather than a “power point presentation.” The remarks by Prime Minister Modi to the media were made just before the session got underway, which had a stormy start with both Houses of Parliament being repeatedly adjourned and adjourned for the day without the customary introduction of newly sworn ministers in the council of ministers. “I would like to urge all the MPs and all the parties to ask the most difficult and sharpest questions in the Houses but they should also allow the government to respond in a disciplined environment. This will boost democracy, strengthen people’s trust and improve the pace of development,” Mr. Modi said. “I hope every issue related to the pandemic and our fight against it would be discussed. I would like all floor leaders to attend a session tomorrow evening to have a presentation on the pandemic situation. It can be discussed on the floor of the House too,” he added. The Prime Minister also made an appeal that everyone should be vaccinated against COVID-19 and follow protocols related to it strictly. “Vaccine is given in the ‘ baahu’ (arm) and those who take it become ‘ bahubalis ’ (strongmen) in the fight against COVID-19. It’s being taken forward,” he said. The offer for a meeting over COVID-19 comes despite opposition leaders terming it “highly irregular” and not according to norms of a Parliament session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/raise-issues-but-allow-govt-to-respond-modi-tells-opposition/article35417153.ece
20 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘Protecting children is a priority’||The Centre has informed the Delhi High Court that it has asked the States to ensure immediate action for rehabilitation of children orphaned due to COVlD-19, in accordance with the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and leveraging the facilities under child protection services. The Ministry of Woman and Child Development, in an affidavit, said children in distress situations, such as those affected by the pandemic, are mandated care and protection under the JJ Act, 2015. “The Act provides a safety net of statutory service delivery structures, along with provisions of Institutional and Non-Institutional care and protection of children in need of care and protection of Children in conflict with law,” the Ministry said. It added that “implementation of the Act is the primary responsibility of the States and Union Territories”. The Ministry’s affidavit came in response to a petition before the High Court seeking directions to safeguard the interests of the children who lost their parents to COVID-19 and who do not have any one else to take care of them and face the risk of being trafficked. The petition also sought grant of appropriate financial compensation to the family members of those citizens who lost their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic after being denied access to adequate health care infrastructure in terms of hospital admission, oxygen cylinders, injections and medications. Mental health care The Ministry acknowledged that the second wave of the pandemic, “given its spread and severity, has created much anxiety and panic across the country”. “As it is a matter of fact, children have been particularly vulnerable to the psychosocial and mental health impacts of the pandemic. Under these circumstances, service providers might also be finding it challenging to support children with their psychosocial and mental health care needs, along with other decisions about placement and safety,” the Ministry admitted. The Ministry said it had decided that calls from women and girls seeking psychological counselling or showing aggravated behaviors landing on ‘181-WHL’ may be diverted to the National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS) on helpline number 080-46110007 for them to provide psychological support to the affected persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/protecting-children-is-a-priority/article35417305.ece
20 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘Illegal surveillance is not possible in India’||Information Technology (IT) and Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Monday told the Lok Sabha that illegal surveillance was not possible in India, given its laws and robust institutions. He alleged that news reports about the Pegasus software being used to illegally tap phones was “an attempt to malign the Indian democracy”. In a suo motu statement, he said there was no factual basis to the reports, as multiple checks and balances in India did not allow any unauthorised person to snoop on people. The Minister’s statement followed Opposition protests on the first day of the monsoon session over reports that several prominent personalities, including Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, were potential targets of surveillance. In a collaborative investigation by an international media consortium, more than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including two serving Ministers, over 40 journalists, three Opposition leaders, one sitting judge, and several business persons and activists in India, were identified as potential targets of hacking. News portal The Wire carried reports about possible hacking using Pegasus, the Israeli software that is sold only to government agencies to tackle terror and crime. “A highly sensational story was published by a web portal last night. Many over-the-top allegations were made around this story. The press reports appeared a day before the monsoon session of Parliament. This can’t be a coincidence,” Mr. Vaishnaw said. “In the past, similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp. Those reports had no factual basis and were denied by all parties, including in the Supreme Court. The press reports of July 18 also appear to be an attempt to malign the Indian democracy and its well-established institutions,” he observed. The only basis of these reports was the fact that the media consortium had access to a leaked database of 50,000 numbers and the individuals linked to these phone numbers were taken as people who were being spied upon, he noted. The news portal’s report admitted that the mere presence of the phone in the list did not indicate spying unless the devices were put through technical analysis, he asserted. The Minister quoted the Israeli company NSO, rubbishing the claims and pointing out factual inaccuracies in their report. He explained the “well-established procedure” for lawful interception of electronic communication for the purpose of national security by agencies at the Centre and the States. “When we look at this issue through the prism of logic, it clearly emerges that there is no substance behind this sensationalism,” Mr. Vaishnaw stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/illegal-surveillance-is-not-possible-in-india/article35417302.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rain deficit may hit oilseed farmers||The lull in the monsoon post June 23 has resulted in a 32% rainfall deficit during that period, and is likely to push farmers into changing their kharif crop patterns, according to an analysis by CRISIL research issued on Monday. Especially in northwest and central India, which are seeing rainfall deficits as high as 55%, farmers may be forced to move from oilseeds such as soybean and groundnut to crops which have lower water requirements, such as cotton and maize. Overall, sowing was slower than last year, with the total sown acreage lagging behind 12%. The southwest monsoon arrived in the country on June 3 this year, and had covered almost 93% of kharif acreage by June 23, a week before its usual onset. Until that point, there had been a 28% surplus rainfall. After that point though, the monsoon played truant, resulting in a 32% deficit compared with the long period average, between June 23 and July 12. The highest deficit of 55% was in the northwest region, with Punjab and Haryana recording 70% and 80% deficits respectively. However, CRISIL noted that this may not have too much of an impact on sowing as these States have high levels of irrigation. It’s a different story in Rajasthan, which saw a 58% deficit during that period. “If not recovered within the next 10 days, [this] may effectuate a shift from soybean to maize in key deficit areas,” said the report. Central India saw a 39% rainfall deficit, with Gujarat hit particularly hard. “A continued dry spell in the State this marketing year could effectuate a major crop shift from groundnut to cotton,” said CRISIL. By July 16, Maharashtra’s total kharif acreage was down 11% in comparison to the previous year, and farmers may shift from soybean to cotton if the rainfall deficit does not recover. Similarly, Karnataka farmers, facing a 37% deficit during this period, are likely to opt for cotton and maize.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rain-deficit-may-hit-oilseed-farmers/article35417310.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi conveys ‘best wishes’ to new Nepal PM Deuba||Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a telephonic conversation with the newly appointed Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on Monday. The call has established a communication line between Mr. Modi and Mr. Deuba, who won a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Sunday night. “Spoke with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to convey my congratulations and best wishes. We will work together to further enhance the wide-ranging cooperation between India and Nepal, including in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mr. Modi in a social media message after the conversation. Taking over Mr. Deuba was appointed as Prime Minister on July 12 by a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court of Nepal, which observed that his predecessor, K.P. Sharma Oli, had violated constitutional norms and had to step down. Mr. Modi had congratulated Mr. Deuba after he won the vote of confidence. In a message to Mr. Deuba, he said both sides should work on “all sectors”. The Ministry of External Affairs said the two leaders focused primarily on battling the pandemic. Mr. Oli had been criticised for his alleged failure to contain COVID-19, which has left at least 9582 people dead. Vaccine challenge Nepal’s main challenge is its inability to access COVID-19 vaccine, for which it had initially depended on the Serum Institute of India. Supply of Indian vaccines was interrupted during March-May when the second wave peaked in India. Subsequently, the U.S. stepped up efforts and Nepal will receive 1.5 million vaccine doses from it. Bilateral interaction between the two neighbours turned cold last year owing to the Kalapani territorial dispute and top- level visits were blocked because of the pandemic and diplomatic spat. However, in January last, Oli’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali visited India. Mr. Deuba has appointed a five-member Cabinet but he is yet to appoint a foreign minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-conveys-best-wishes-to-new-nepal-pm-deuba/article35417160.ece

Speedy trial is a fundamental right.” The court was hearing a petition, filed through senior advocate Mihir Desai, seeking a judicial probe into the death of tribal rights activist Stan Swamy on July 5. Mr. Desai told the court that he was not looking for the cause of the death, but an inquiry into what happened in jail that ultimately led to his death. Filing of report He also sought the filing of a report in court and that the next of kin of Father Frazer Mascarenhas be allowed to participate in the inquiry. He said, “I want the probe to follow the guidelines issued by the National Human Rights Commission and the report should be filed in the High Court.” Justice Shinde said, “We have every respect for his work to society. We watched his funeral online and that it was done in a very dignified and gracious manner.” The matter would be heard on July 23. Swamy, 84, was the last of the 16 to be arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case and sent to prison.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/speedy-trial-a-fundamental-right-hc/article35417320.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pakistan accuses India of ‘using’ FATF for political ends||India is “using” the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for political designs against Pakistan, said the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, criticising External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar for a statement claiming credit for Pakistan’s continuance on the world body’s watchlist. According to a Pakistan MFA statement on Monday, Mr. Jaishankar’s reported comments made to a group of BJP members as part of a training workshop, “vindicated” Pakistan’s repeated accusation that India had pushed for Pakistan’s grey listing in 2018 for “political” rather than “technical” reasons, which continues to date. “India’s credentials for assessing Pakistan in FATF as co-chair of the Joint Group or for that matter any other country are subject to questions, which we urge FATF to look into,” the MFA in Islamabad said, adding that the Pakistani government is also considering contacting the FATF President for “appropriate action”, although it is unclear what that action would be. On Sunday, news agency ANI had reported that Mr. Jaishankar had addressed ruling party members as part of a series of “e-Chintan” workshops on Indian foreign policy achievement's under the Modi government. According to the report, Pakistan’s grey listing for the past three years, including the most recent decision of the FATF plenary session to keep Pakistan on its “increased monitoring” list, were cited as the outcome of Indian efforts by the Minister. “Due to us (government), Pakistan is under the lens of FATF and it was kept in the grey list. We have been successful in pressurizing Pakistan and the fact that Pakistan’s behaviour has changed is because of pressure put by India by various measures,” Mr. Jaishankar was quoted as saying.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pakistan-accuses-india-of-using-fatf-for-political-ends/article35417313.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Oxfam report highlights sharp inequalities in health indicators||Sharp inequalities exist across different caste, religious, class and gender categories on various health indicators, according to a report by Oxfam India. The report titled “India Inequality Report 2021: India’s Unequal Healthcare Story” shows that the “general category is better off than the SCs and STs, Hindus are better off than Muslims, the rich are better off than the poor, men are better off than women, and the urban population is better off than the rural population” on most health determinants, interventions and indicators. The findings are primarily based on secondary analysis from rounds 3 and 4 of the National Family Health Survey and various rounds of National Sample Survey. The report shows that while women’s literacy has improved across social groups over the years, SC and ST women lag behind the general category by 18.6% and 27.9%, respectively. There exists a gap of 55.1% between the top and bottom 20% of the population in 2015-16. Though the female literacy rate among Muslims (64.3%) is lower than all religious groups, inequality has reduced over time. As far as sanitation is concerned, 65.7% households have access to improved, non-shared sanitation facilities in the general category while SC households are 28.5% behind them and ST are 39.8% behind them. An examination of health interventions too shows disparities. The share of institutional deliveries in India has increased from 38.7% in 2005-06 to 78.9% in 2015-16, but inequalities persist with ST households 15% below the general category, Muslims 12% behind Hindus and a 35% gap between the poorest and richest 20% of the population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oxfam-report-highlights-sharp-inequalities-in-health-indicators/article35417307.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Convene Labour Conference’||The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to convene the Indian Labour Conference (ILC), the most recent session of which was held in 2015, at the earliest. In a letter, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated Central trade union said the ILC was “required to uphold the noble tradition of tripartism in the country” and that India being a founding member of the International Labour Organisation had traditionally “upheld the high ideals of tripartism”. The letter, written by BMS general secretary Binoy Kumar Sinha, said the ILC was held every year or after two years in exceptional circumstances. The BMS added that it was only during the Emergency that the ILC was not held. “On every issue related to labour, the government used to sit with labour representatives and employer representatives regularly and chalk out solutions. India also has a legal obligation to do so since the Parliament has ratified Convention No. 144 of the ILO related to strengthening tripartite mechanism,” the letter stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/convene-labour-conference/article35417157.ece
20 July 2021||New Delhi,||A wake-up call for security on the Internet: WhatsApp CEO||Following revelations that the NSO group’s Pegasus software may have been used to snoop on journalists, politicians and activists worldwide, including holders of 300 Indian phone numbers, WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart has called on governments and companies to take steps to hold the Israeli technology firm accountable. In a tweet, Mr. Cathcart said, “This is a wake-up call for security on the Internet. The mobile phone is the primary computer for billions of people. Governments and companies must do everything they can to make it as secure as possible. Our security and freedom depend on it.” WhatsApp in 2019 sued the NSO group, accusing it of using the former’s messaging service to conduct cyber-espionage on roughly 1,400 user accounts, including those of journalists and human rights activists. Mr. Cathcart added that there was a need for more companies and governments to take steps to hold the NSO group accountable. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in a jibe aimed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, tweeted, “We know what he’s been reading — everything on your phone! #Pegasus”. In a statement, the CPI(M) said the Union government must answer and come clean on using the software for the surveillance of Indian citizens in an illegal and unauthorised manner. “Use of a cyber spy software to hack smartphones even by the government is prohibited under Indian laws. Under what law has the government undertaken such surveillance activities over citizens?” the CPI(M) asked. CPI general secretary D. Raja said, “It seems this government is very close to the Israeli administration. The revelations are extremely shocking.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-wake-up-call-for-security-on-the-internet-whatsapp-ceo/article35417296.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Several Delhi-based envoys, staff of NGOs on Pegasus list||While reports of Indian politicians and journalists being targets of surveillance operations carried out with the help of the Pegasus spyware took centrestage on Monday, French newspaper Le Monde reported that several Delhi-based diplomats were also on the list of potential targets for phone hacking from 2017-2021, along with a phone associated with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. On Monday, media organisations in the 17-member consortium published more details of the leaked database allegedly belonging to Israeli technology company, the NSO group, that developed Pegasus. U.S.-based Washington Post , U.K.-based The Guardian and The Wire in India reported that the telephone numbers of a British High Commission official and two officials of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and employees of international NGOs like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were also in the database of those targeted. New Delhi has hostile relations with China and Pakistan at present, and their diplomats are under close watch, but it is significant that the list included several countries that India has very friendly ties with as well. “The numbers of [Pakistan Prime Minister] Imran Khan and several of his ambassadors in India appear on the list as potential targets. Dozens of other Delhi-based diplomats and ambassadors are also included, from Iran, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Saudi Arabia,” the report published on Monday in Le Monde said, adding that the number of Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India was on the list too.  The Hindu requested responses from each of the embassies and high commissions listed in the reports, but did not receive any. Officials in the Ministry of External Affairs said they were unaware of the issue being raised by the diplomatic missions with the government thus far. Both the Gates Foundation and the CDC have had some run-ins over Foreign Contribution Act (FCRA) regulations with the Modi government in the last few years. While a Gates-backed NGO was barred from receiving any foreign funds in 2017, the CDC was placed on a “prior permissions” watch list for foreign funding in December 2019. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has no comment,” the CDC said in a statement to The Hindu  According to the report in the Le Monde , the use of the Pegasus software began “just after” Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Israel in July 2017, a visit that was marked by his close interactions with then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In responses to the media stories, the NSO group had made it clear that the Israel government had to approve all exports of technology like Pegasus, and that it was sold “solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments”. More than 50,000 phone numbers of citizens clustered mainly in Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been studied as a part of the international collaboration by NGOs and media organisations investigating phone surveillance using the software.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/several-delhi-based-envoys-staff-of-ngos-on-pegasus-list/article35417300.ece

20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women’s groups want U.P. draft population Bill nixed||The Uttar Pradesh government’s proposed law on population control is “unconstitutional” as it violates the right to equality and should be “immediately withdrawn”, demanded women’s organisations, health networks, academics in a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday. The Draft Uttar Pradesh Population Control, Stabilisation and Welfare Bill, 2021, proposes a two-child policy and those violating it would be barred from contesting local body elections, applying for government jobs and getting subsidies under government welfare schemes. According to the memorandum, the Bill will result in people not registering their marriages because of the disincentives mooted by the government, which is likely to make women and children in situations of domestic violence or abusive relationship vulnerable and could result in denial of maintenance and support as well as right to property. The signatories of the memorandum include All India Democratic Women’s Association, Sama, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Saheli, National Federation for Indian Women (NFIW), AIDWA, former Union Health Secretary Sujatha Rao, Dr. Mira Shiva of Initiative for Health & Equity in Society and Aruna Roy of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan among others. The prevailing gap in abortion services will further result in violence and abandonment of women and children, the memorandum said. “The Bill is geared to control [and reduce] women’s fertility rather than improving women’s health and promoting women’s reproductive rights. The proposed Bill should be deemed unconstitutional since it violates the right to equality.” The Bill contradicted the Supreme Court ruling of 2017 which held the right to privacy as a constitutionally protected right emerging from the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/womens-organisations-want-up-draft-population-bill-nixed/article35417149.ece
20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Rahul, Kishor, Lavasa on list of spyware targets||Investigations confirmed the Pegasus attack, or signs of potential targeting, on phones linked to 10 Indian numbers and 27 phones around the world, according to The Guardian . The family members of a Supreme Court employee who had accused the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in 2019 are on the list. Mr. Lavasa, who is on the list, served as an Election Commissioner between January 2018 and August 2020, and had expressed dissenting views on the three-member election panel’s ruling that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not violated the Model Code of Conduct in 2019. Others on the list include Gagandeep Kang, a well-known virologist, M. Hari Menon, the India country head for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and two employees of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in Delhi. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based non-profit organisation, and Amnesty International got access to the list of thousands of potential targets worldwide and shared it with 17 media publications, including The Wire, The Guardian and The Washington Post . Amnesty’s International’s Security Lab provided forensic analyses and technical support, while Forbidden and the media houses conducted the investigation, called the Pegasus Project. Responding to the reports, Mr. Gandhi called targeted surveillance “illegal and deplorable”. “If your information is correct, the scale and nature of surveillance you describe goes beyond an attack on the privacy of individuals. It is an attack on the democratic foundations of our country. It must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible be identified and punished,” he said in a statement. India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, according to The Washington Post , said the claim of government surveillance of specific people “has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever.” However, the government refused to answer to a question on whether it is a client of NSO, The Post reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-kishor-lavasa-on-list-of-spyware-targets/article35417150.ece
20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Why were curbs relaxed for Bakrid, SC asks Kerala||The traders had stocked up goods early. They had started to agitate against the stringent curbs. The Opposition had also raised the traders’ issue in the public domain. The State, while relaxing restrictions for Bakrid, had specifically ordered that “as far as possible”, customers should have had at least one shot of the COVID vaccine and must strictly follow the protocol. Earlier, the Bench took into consideration “the situation and the celebrations going on in the State of Kerala”. Kerala counsel G. Prakash, said only some shops had been opened in a controlled manner. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for P.K.D Nambiar, intervened to say that while Uttar Pradesh had stopped the Kanwar Yatra, Kerala had displayed a “casual” attitude to lockdown restrictions owing to Bakrid. “Kerala relaxed lockdown curbs on the occasion of Eid on the day the Prime Minister called for caution… Kerala has continued to throw up alarming numbers [of COVID cases] even while many other States have improved their situation,” Mr. Nambiar said in his plea. The court closed its suo motu case on the conduct of the Kanwar Yatra, after U.P. informed on Monday that “there will be no Kanwar Yatra at all, it has been completely postponed” in 2021. Justice Nariman said the authorities needed to know that “any untoward incidents which directly affect lives will be looked upon sternly and prompt action taken immediately”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-were-curbs-relaxed-for-bakrid-sc-asks-kerala/article35417285.ece
20 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||SP slams BSP’s Brahmin outreach programme||A day after Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati announced a new outreach campaign to woo the Brahmin community, the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Monday said the community still remembered the “oppression” it faced under her rule through the registration of “false” cases under the SC/ST Act. SP national secretary Abhishek Mishra accused Ms. Mayawati of remembering Brahmins only when polls approached. “The oppression meted out to Brahmins under her rule, the false cases lodged under the SC/ST (Act), the entire State, every section and every community remembers that,” he said. Every community, especially the Brahmins, was with the SP and saw their future in Akhilesh Yadav, asserted Mr. Mishra. A Brahmin himself and a former Minister in the previous SP government in 2012-2017, Mr. Mishra said Mr. Yadav gave respect to the community at every step and added to their strength and progress. On Sunday, Ms. Mayawati appealed to Brahmins to take “inspiration” from Dalits and remain “firm” in not falling for any lure or gimmicks deployed by other parties, especially the ruling BJP. She said she was “proud” that the Dalit community, to which she belongs, did not fall for any amount of lure from other parties, especially the BJP, in the past few elections. To attract the community to her party and build consensus among them that their interests were secure only under a BSP government, Ms. Mayawati deputed Satish Chandra Mishra, Rajya Sabha member and a Brahmin face of the BSP, to start a campaign with special meetings with the community, starting July 23. The campaign will start from the politically sensitive town of Ayodhya, which has religious significance for Hindus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sp-slams-bsps-brahmin-outreach-programme/article35417286.ece
20 July 2021||New Delhi,||Multiple adjournments mar RS proceedings||Vehement protests from the Opposition parties on repeated fuel price hikes, ongoing farmers’ agitation and the alleged mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic among other issues led to multiple adjournments in the Rajya Sabha on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament. The protests also prevented Prime Minister Narendra Modi from introducing his new Ministers. The Congress, TMC, AAP, YSR Congress and Left members were in the well of the House, protesting about different issues when Mr. Modi rose to speak. Mr. Modi said it should make everyone proud that several women, several people belonging to the SC and ST communities, have taken oath as Ministers. Many new Ministers were children of farmers and belonged to OBC communities. “It seems some people cannot digest that more women, SC, ST and OBC community members are becoming Ministers,” he stated. 17 notices The Opposition was up in arms after House Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu disallowed 17 notices by different Opposition parties to suspend the scheduled business. He said it was not feasible to take 17 issues in one go, and assured the members that all the important matters would be taken up in due course of time.  But the Opposition continued the protests, forcing Mr. Naidu to adjourn the House first till 2 p.m. and then till 3 p.m. As soon as the House reassembled at 3 p.m., Opposition members entered the well of the House. The House was adjourned within 20 minutes, for the final time with the Opposition continuing the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/multiple-adjournments-mar-rs-proceedings/article35417287.ece

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Parliament session off to a turbulent start||Mr. Modi responded by pointing out the diversity in his new Ministry and the “disrespect” shown to them by Opposition members. “I thought there would be an atmosphere of excitement in the House today, because women, Dalits, Adivasis have been made Ministers in large numbers… I would have been happy to introduce them,” he said. “It should make everyone proud that several women, several people belonging to the SC/ST community have taken oath as Ministers. Several new Ministers are children of farmers and also belong to OBC communities. It seems some people cannot digest more women, SC, ST, and OBC community members becoming Ministers,” he added. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that in his 24-year career as a parliamentarian he had never witnessed such a disruption of the customary introduction of Ministers, while Congress MP Manickam Tagore asserted that the BJP had done the same when Manmohan Singh, as Prime Minister, had sought to introduce his Ministers in the House. “In my last 24 years of parliamentary life, I have not seen a single instance where the Prime Minister could not introduce his Council of Ministers, even if it’s one. It is sad, unfortunate and not a healthy trend,” Mr. Singh said. The House was then adjourned till 2 p.m. and when the din did not subside, it was adjourned again till 3.30 p.m., when Minister for Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw read out a statement on the allegations of snooping of journalists and other public figures.After the statement, the House was adjourned for the day. Later speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Tagore said: “The BJP had also done the same to Dr. Manmohan Singh when he tried to introduce his Ministers to the House.

20 July 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. compromised national security: Cong.||The Congress on Monday accused the Narendra Modi government of “treason” and compromising national security amid reports of the Pegasus software being used to spy on people. They demanded the dismissal of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and an inquiry into the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Following reports that former party chief Rahul Gandhi could have been a potential target of illegal hacking, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala addressed a joint press conference. Terming Information Technology Minister (IT) Ashwini Vaishnaw’s statement in the Lok Sabha as ambiguous and roundabout, the Congress leaders said they would demand a debate on the floor and jointly formulate a strategy with other Opposition parties. “The person responsible for the deployment of this illegal spyware Pegasus is no less than the Home Minister, who must be sacked,” Mr. Surjewala said. “Our first demand is the immediate sacking of Amit Shah and a probe into the role of the Prime Minister in the matter,” he added. Targeting Mr. Shah, Mr. Kharge said, “If you can’t run the office you hold as per the rule of law, then you should not be occupying such an office.” The Congress posed a set of questions to the Prime Minister, including who — whether the Prime Minister or the Home Minister — ordered the purchase of Pegasus and how much money had been spent. “Is spying on India’s security forces, judiciary, Cabinet Ministers, Opposition leaders, journalists and other activists through a foreign entity’s spyware not treason and an inexcusable breach of national security?” asked Mr. Surjewala. The party also contended the IT Minister’s claim that illegal surveillance was not possible, adding that former IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on November 28, 2019, in a reply to a call attention motion in the Rajya Sabha, had admitted that there were 121 names where WhatsApp was possibly infected due to the software and that a notice had been issued to the NSO group, the company that produces the spyware. ‘Lies in tatters’ “The Constitution has been trampled upon, the rule of law has been murdered, and the oath of office that the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and this government took lies in tatters,” Mr. Surjewala said. Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on IT, Shashi Tharoor, tweeted, “If GOI did it that’s very bad; if somebody unauthorized did it, that’s worse. If a foreign govt say China or Pakistan did it, then national security demands that our govt should investigate and this is why an independent investigation is absolutely indispensable.” Targeting Mr. Vaishnaw for starting his innings on the wrong foot, former Union Minister P. Chidambaram tweeted, “The Minister should answer a simple question: Did the government acquire the Pegasus software/spyware?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-compromised-national-security-cong/article35417292.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Opposition trying to obstruct development’||Union Home Minister Amit Shah responded to disruptions in Parliament amid news reports on large-scale snooping on journalists and prominent public figures via the software Pegasus, terming them as attempts by the Opposition to obstruct “India’s development trajectory” through “conspiracies”. He wrote this in a blog on his website after both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for the day as the Opposition parties raised protests on fuel price hikes, the three controversial farm laws and the Pegasus snooping scandal. They demanded a Joint Parliamentary Commission (JPC) probe on the snooping and Mr. Shah’s resignation. The first day of the monsoon session left Prime Minister Narendra Modi unable to introduce his newly sworn in Ministers to both Houses of Parliament. Using a phrase often associated with him, Mr. Shah wrote, “People have often associated this phrase with me in a lighter vein but today I want to seriously say the timing of the selective leaks, the disruptions… Aap Chronology Samajhiye ! [please understand the chronology]. This is a report by the disruptors for the obstructors.” “Disruptors are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructors are political players in India who do not want India to progress. People of India are very good at understanding this chronology and connection,” he said. The BJP, which held a briefing by former Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, also alleged a conspiracy in the timing of the scandal. “The BJP strongly refutes and condemns the baseless and bereft of political propriety comments levelled by the Congress against the BJP,” said Mr. Prasad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-trying-to-obstruct-development/article35417299.ece

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The divine couple||Both Sivananda Lahari and Saundarya Lahari are excellent bhakti granthas of Adi Sankara that extol the innumerable facets of the boundless grace of the divine couple, Siva and Sakti. The acharya begins these two hymns by paying obeisance to their inseparableness. Kalidasa too, in his Kumarasambhava, propitiates Parvati and Parameswara as the parents of the jagat and compares their oneness to the organic unity of word and meaning. The first verse in Sivananda Lahari highlights the fact that Siva and Sakti are forever engaged in penance to help the jivatmas cope with the dangers of samsara and also to lead them out of it to salvation, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. Being united in their love and dedication to art, each sports the Chandra Kala on their head. Many have been inspired by the exceptional sincerity and commitment of their severe penance by which they attained each other. Kalidasa mentions how great rishis were impressed by the perfection in Parvati’s penance which she performed to attain Siva. Siva’s penance as Dakshinamurthy is to impart the highest jnana through the chin mudra in silence. Srishti, Stiti, Laya and all other activities are under their control. They are the very essence of all auspiciousness. They are always ready to grant fruits and benefits such as wisdom, knowledge, prosperity, worthy children, good conduct, etc, on those devotees who worship them with love and devotion in the heart. Even the highest Purushartha, salvation is attainable by those who bow down to them in all humility. The true devotee will soon realise the enormous value of their grace. A strong feeling of contentment settles down in his inner being and he has nothing to fear, not even death. He knows that at the end of this lifetime, he is sure to reach their feet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-divine-couple/article35417306.ece
20 July 2021||Kolkata,||Negative RT-PCR report must for flyers to Kolkata||The West Bengal government on Monday made it mandatory for flyers to Kolkata to either produce proof of full vaccination or a negative RT-PCR test report even as the city recorded zero COVID-19 deaths for the second time in three days. “As per latest guidelines of West Bengal Govt, all in bound flight passengers(commercial & non-commercial flight)shall produce at time of boarding either proof of full vaccination or RT-PCR negative test report for test conducted within 72hrs of such flight departure,” Kolkata airport tweeted. The State recorded 12 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking its toll to 18,001, but Kolkata did not record a single death. While no deaths were reported on Saturday too, the city recorded one death due to COVID-19 on Sunday. This is the first time over the past few months that zero fatalities have been recorded. The city reported less than 100 new cases over the past three days. Shortage of vaccines Though cases and deaths are on the decline, vaccines are in short supply in Kolkata and the rest of the State. Minister and Chairman of Board of Administrators Firhad Hakim said Kolkata was getting only half of its quota of vaccines. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had visited a vaccination centre earlier in the day. Last week, Ms. Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to ensure adequate supply of vaccines so that the State’s population can be vaccinated before the onset of the third wave. The letter dated July 15 said, “As per the intimation received from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, the State has been allocated 73 lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the month of July 2021. But unfortunately, 25 lakh doses have been received till date in the current month.” The letter added, “We have a capacity to vaccinate more than 10 lakh people every day, provided sufficient quantity of vaccine is made available.” The Chief Minister pointed out that from January 16, 2021, to July 15, the State administered 2.5 crore doses (1.81 crore first doses and 0.70 crore second doses). In the letter, Ms. Banerjee said that the Centre had supplied 2.12 crore doses, while the State government procured 18 lakh doses and the remaining was provided by the private sector. Protest over fake jabs Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged protests over the fake vaccination scam. BJP leaders, including ex-State president Rahul Sinha, were arrested for organising the protests. The Enforcement Directorate has written to the Kolkata police seeking details of the documents seized from the custody of Debanjan Deb, the prime accused in the fake vaccination scam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/negative-rt-pcr-report-must-for-flyers-to-kolkata/article35417551.ece

20 July 2021||JAIPUR,||Gehlot seeks SC probe in snooping case||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday sought the Supreme Court’s intervention in the Pegasus spying case, adding that suo motu action and an order for an investigation from the apex court would bring out the truth and set all allegations and counter-allegations to rest. “It is the most appropriate case for judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court,” Mr. Gehlot said. He said the reports on the hacking of mobile phones and spying using the Pegasus software were “very shocking and worrisome”. “Now the list of people who were snooped includes former Congress president Rahul Gandhi [as well]. It is not yet clear where the list will end,” he tweeted. The senior Congress leader pointed out that if the Union government had been honest, it would have taken the issue seriously and had it investigated when former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh raised it in the Rajya Sabha in 2019. “This is a very serious matter whose truth should be brought out before the public,” Mr. Gehlot said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gehlot-seeks-sc-probe-in-snooping-case/article35417290.ece

Advocate Shrikant Shivade, representing Mr. Purohit, said the special National Investigation Agency court conducting the trial said the issue of sanction would be decided at the end of the trial. However, the Supreme Court had ruled that it should be decided at the time of framing of charges. Mr. Shivade argued that prior sanction should be sought under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (prosecution of judges and public servants). He went on to say that Mr. Purohit was playing his role and discharging his official duty by gathering information and that he was an “unsung hero” of the Army. Stating that the trial was going on and 181 witnesses had been examined, NIA counsel Sandesh Patil said approximately 150 more witnesses were left. Hence the issue of sanction could be considered at the end of the trial, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-sanction-must-for-prosecution-says-purohit/article35417311.ece

In an online press conference, party leader Derek O’Brien said, “It would have been our pleasure to let Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduce his new Council of Ministers.

20 July 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Gang of loan fraudsters based in Delhi busted, four arrested||The Anti-Bank Fraud Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB), Chennai, has busted a Delhi-based gang, which duped people with offers of hassle-free and low interest loans. A special team, headed by Assistant Commissioner of Police S. Prabakaran and inspector R. Pushparaj of the Anti-Bank Fraud Wing, constituted on the directions of Commissioner of Police Shankar Jiwal, camped in New Delhi and arrested four of the accused. The gang allegedly conned people in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala by collecting fees after promising them loans in the names of firms such as Tamilar Finance, Varalakshmi Finance and Bajaj Finance. The CCB had registered a case on a complaint from Kanakalakshmi, of Pallikaranai, who lost Rs. 82,000. During the investigation, they stumbled upon more such complaints and the special team, after analysing call records and mobile phone tower locations, zeroed in on the accused in Delhi. After camping in the national capital for the last 10 days, during which they searched in Dabri, Vikas Puri, Virender Nagar and surrounding areas, the team arrested M. Ashok Kumar, 28, A. Kamatchi, 30, of Dabri Main Extension, D. Rajavel, 25, of Palam, and Abhishek Pal, 24, of Mohan Garden. Mobile phones, SIM cards and records relating to bank transactions and other documents were seized from them. The four were produced before a court and brought to the city. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, a senior police officer said they would randomly call people and introduce themselves as representatives of finance firms before making them a special loan offer. They would promise them hassle-free loans at very low interest rates. If the victim agreed, the call would be transferred to a person dubbed ‘master’. The gang would then ask the victims to send documents over WhatsApp or e-mail, and then send them a fake loan approval letter. They would then ask them to deposit a fee in a particular bank account under file charges, refundable security amount and processing fees. They would switch off their mobile phones after collecting the money. Police sources said the gang procured SIM cards through agents using the identity proof of daily wage labourers at liquor shops and platform dwellers for Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000, which they used to call their targets. They also opened bank accounts and obtained cheque books, credit/debit cards and SIM cards in the name of shelterless persons. The gang mostly operated online. They had only one room in Virender Nagar, where they rarely met. The police also suspect that the gang cheated people after receiving processing fees by posing as leading telecom service providers to lease out their land to set up mobile communication towers.

20 July 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||T.N. to develop SOP for capture and release of wild elephants||The Tamil Nadu Forest Department will shortly develop a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the capture and release of wild elephants based on science and best practices, said Shekhar Kumar Niraj, PCCF and Chief Wildlife Warden. In the proceedings on the release of wild male elephant Rivaldo from Vaazhaihottam check-post of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve back into the wild, he has made an elaborate note after visiting 28 camp elephants housed in two camps at MTR and interacting with the mahouts and cavadies. It appeared that the decision of capturing Rivaldo was taken after demands by some sections of the public. Keeping fully adult elephants in a small kraal and attempts to train a fully mature, healthy, and hefty adult elephant could be at times defeating the science of elephant ecology, he noted. Despite his disabilities, Rivaldo appeared to be in a healthy condition and very intelligent. And it is to be noted that there is not even a solitary instance of it attacking humans or indulging in crop-raiding, he said. ‘Not a valid argument’ The argument that this male elephant would be vulnerable to poaching because of its high visibility and close proximity is not valid as this is not the only tusker in the area. There are several other tuskers in its home ranges and they too forage in close proximity to the same villages. Although they are not habituated to people or taking food from people, they are as easily accessible as Rivaldo is to local people who know these tuskers and the area, he pointed out. “It is very important that the genetic diversity of the older males are preserved in the population by protecting them and allowing them to breed freely. As such it is very important that Rivaldo, which is in the 35-40 age class, be retained in the breeding population and not be removed from it and brought into captivity,” Mr. Niraj noted. The Asian elephant species in Tamil Nadu has shown signs of population decline to an alarming level in the decades 2000s to 2010s and beyond, which is another reason why Rivaldo should be sent back to the breeding population in the wild, he said. Compared to the costs to be incurred in capturing, training and maintaining this elephant in captivity, managing it in the wild will be far less expensive and also conservation and ecology friendly, he noted. Another reason for ordering the release of Rivaldo is that the process of kraaling and training an adult into captivity could be generally tortuous and scientifically not well established, and ecologically damaging. At 36-40 years, Rivaldo may not be the right candidate for any kind of training or taming exercises that may not be successful and could make the animal very aggressive, he said. Detailing these points and a few more, the T.N. Chief Wildlife Warden has emphasised the need for an SOP for the capture and release of wild elephants, which will be done shortly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-to-develop-sop-for-capture-release-of-wild-elephants/article35417516.ece
20 July 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Over 300 kg of ganja seized||Officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Chennai zone, seized 327.87 kg of marijuana and arrested two, including a main peddler from Vizhinjam, Kerala. Acting on a specific intelligence input, a team of NCB officers on Saturday intercepted a goods carrier at Tiruvallur Road, Uthukottai. The vehicle was being driven by Dubash Sankar, of Kodungiyur. The entire vehicle was empty, but sleuths found ganja concealed in a specially built compartment. The seized contraband was sourced from Annavaram, Andhra Pradesh, and was destined for Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. A total of 327.87 kg of the banned substance was found in 150 packets. Immediate follow up action by officials of the NCB, Cochin sub-zone, resulted in the apprehension of Sreenath M., a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, at Kalaikavala on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border on Sunday. He was the intended recipient of the consignment, and had been engaged in drug peddling at Vizhinjam for the past four years. Both Sankar and Sreenath were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985, said the NCB in a press release. Amit Ghawate, Zonal Director, Chennai, said illegal ganja cultivation in India was largely concentrated around the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border. Ganja from the region finds its way all over the country, including Delhi, Mumbai, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal, and is even smuggled to Sri Lanka. Difficult terrain and inaccessibility make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to conduct raids in these areas. “A major ganja cultivation region in India is the hilly terrain of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Further, northeastern States are also vulnerable due to their favourable climatic conditions and inaccessible area,” he added. This is the second seizure involving substantial quantities of ganja by the NCB, Chennai, in the last two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-300-kg-of-ganja-seized/article35417495.ece

20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. will soon finalise SWD plans in city’s southern parts||The Greater Chennai Corporation will finalise the alignment of stormwater drains(SWD) in the southern parts of the city next month, sources said. Senior officials said the stormwater drain alignment would be finalised based on demands from residents in zones such as Alandur, Perungudi and Sholinganallur. The work on stormwater drains was expected to begin before the onset of the northeast monsoon. Residential areas around the Pallikaranai marshland are expected to get better drains, improving flood preparedness in the area. Residents have demanded that the Corporation provide information about drains in each of the neighbourhoods before the alignment is finalised. Geetha Ganesh, of the AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association, said stormwater from more than 25 colonies in the area flow towards Veerangal Odai and then to the Pallikaranai marshland via three major disposal points, the important one being AGS Colony-Kalki Nagar disposal. “We requested a permanent pump house and that was constructed with a state-of-the-art pump, which started operation in December,” she said. The fact that floodwater from over 25 localities flows via this disposal point along was a major cause of concern, she added. “The last stretch of 330 m of the drain from AGS Colony-Kalki Nagar Main Road needs to be reconstructed as it has sunk in many places, obstructing the flow of stormwater,” a resident said. Residents also demanded that Chennai Corporation and the PWD prevent dumping of waste in waterways, such as Veerangal Odai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-will-soon-finalise-swd-plans-in-citys-southern-parts/article35417487.ece
20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Principals anticipate heavy rush for some programmes||Admission to some of the preferred programmes in colleges will be tougher this year. In some engineering programmes and B.Com streams, the cut-off could rise by as much as 20 marks, say college principals. On Monday, following the announcement of Class XII results, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said around 30,600 students from the science group had scored between the 551-600 marks range this year, a huge increase compared to the previous year when 1,867 students were placed in that range. In Commerce, 8,909 students had scored between the same marks range as compared to 4,437 students last year. Though the computation, up to two decimal points, has brought relief to colleges, making it easy to develop the merit list for students, the competition has become that much tougher. But some school heads say students may hesitate to pursue engineering. Bridge courses “Students mostly had only online schooling for a good part of Class XII. It will impact college admission. Higher secondary classes are an important stepping stone to college education,” said N. Vijayan, chairman, Zion Group of Schools. Colleges should consider implementing a bridge course to strengthen the students’ knowledge in the basics, he suggested. Santhosh Baboo, principal of D.G. Vaishnav College, anticipated a 10%-15% hike in the cut-off for all programmes. “There will be a good rush for Commerce, BCA and B.Sc Computer Science programmes. We offer programmes such as B.Com Honours and B.Com Finance and Taxation. We will get a good number of applications for these programmes,” he said. The rush for science programmes is not as high as that for commerce streams as students would consider professional programmes, he added. Lalitha Balakrishnan, principal of MOP Vaishnav College, said the stacking up of more students in the 550-600 mark range as compared to last year would make competition tougher. “Commerce is more of interest to us. Usually the cut-off is high. We should wait for CBSE students also to file applications. By early August we will have a better idea,” she said. More top scorers This year, in science stream there is a 16-fold increase in the number of students with higher scores, pushing up the cut-off for the engineering programmes such as Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, said independent education consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi.

20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Announcement of results brings relief to T.N. schools||For a majority of Class XII students and teachers in the State,the announcement of the results on Mondaymeant an end to a year which was fraught with uncertainty owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students of Class XII spent a large part of the 2020-21 academic year at home owing to the closure of schools and only had around two months in school. The Board exams too, were clouded in uncertainty after the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu after February. “The results overall are better than expected for a majority of the students. Students whose marks were low in the Class XI public exams are the ones who are a bit disappointed,” said Patric Raymond, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation. B. Purushothaman, principal, Everwin Group of Schools said that while he would usually see top performers unhappy with some aspect of their results, most of the students this year were relieved with their marks. “The students have been quite anxious with regard to how they would be assessed and the early declaration of the results has been welcomed. As it stands, we doubt if there will be many students opting to take up the board exams to be conducted later this year for students who are unhappy with their results,” he said. While the School Education Department has said that those students unhappy with the results can opt to write the exams later this year, they have also said that the marks scored in that written exam would be considered final. “If the Board had said the best of the two results would be chosen, we probably would have had more students opting to take this up,” Mr. Purushothaman added. For the coming academic year, the CBSE has said that Class XII will have two terms and a board exam at the end of each term — in two different formats. “A semester system is something that should be considered for State board schools as well. There is a lot riding on the final board exam and this semester system would take the burden off students at a time of uncertainty,” said K.R. Nandhakumar, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Nursery, Primary, Matriculation, Higher Secondary and CBSE schools Association. He welcomed the early announcement of the results by the School Education Department. The Tamil Nadu Teachers Association, in a statement, welcomed the evaluation method followed to calculate the results and thanked the State government for the timely announcement of the results. Students can download their provisional mark sheets from July 22 fromwww.dge.tn.gov.inandwww.dge.tn.nic.in, the Directorate of Government Examinations has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/announcement-of-results-brings-relief-to-tn-schools/article35417499.ece

20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘T.N. can vaccinate 6 cr. people in 5 months’||Tamil Nadu will be able to complete the vaccination of six crore eligible people in five months if the Union government provides 12 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said. “During my recent meeting with the Union Health Minister, I raised the need for 12 crore doses to vaccinate the eligible population of six crore people above the age of 18 with two doses of the vaccines. As of now, we have received nearly 1.8 crore doses, and need at least 10 crore more. We have adequate infrastructure to administer two crore doses a month, and will complete vaccination in five months in the State,” he told The Hindu on Monday. He said the State’s population had crossed eight crore, of which six crore people were eligible for vaccination. There is widespread awareness of vaccination among the people of the State, he said, adding, “Unlike in other parts of the country, where frontline workers were threatened with the sack if they didn’t get the jab, or were offered 20 kg of wheat to get vaccinated, people in Tamil Nadu are ready to get vaccinated due to better awareness.” Mr. Subramanian said the Union Health Minister had assured him that the supply would improve after a month, as there were certain issues at the manufacturing centres at present. “I also reiterated the need for the Union government to procure 90% instead of 75% of the vaccines produced, as the 25% allocation for private hospitals is largely underutilised. Not even 10% of the vaccines are utilised in the private sector,” he said. To promote vaccination, the Minister is set to hold meetings with some major private hospitals. “I am holding a meeting with major hospitals in the western belt in Coimbatore tomorrow. This will be with hospitals in Coimbatore, Karur and Erode. We are going to ask them to administer more vaccines to the people. Our other request is for Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. Vaccines can be procured and given to private hospitals so that more people could be covered,” the Minister said. He charged the former AIADMK government with ignoring the warnings of a second wave, which resulted in largescale impact. “But we went on to ramp up infrastructure,” he said. ‘Infrastructure intact’ Through the Union government, about 20 of the 70 proposed oxygen generator plants were opened, while another 10 were started through CSR initiatives. Besides, the government got thousands of oxygen concentrators and distributed them to hospitals, he said. “All these infrastructure facilities will not be dismantled. They will remain intact for another six months, till we ascertain whether there is a third wave,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-can-vaccinate-6-cr-people-in-5-months/article35417483.ece

Sources said the foundation stone for 9 projects would be laid by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on the occasion, besides the inauguration of five other projects. This will be the first series of MoUs to be inked by the two-month-old DMK government. In all, 49 projects would take off in various locations across Tamil Nadu, either through the signing of MoUs, laying of foundation or inauguration. “Some of the firms that would be part of the MoU signing event are real estate firm CapitaLand, French firm Cryolor, Avary, Cheyyar SEZ, TCS, JSW Energy and Vikram Solar,” a senior government official said. He added that sanction orders would be given for a few start-ups too. On Monday evening, Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu posted a tweet: “47 projects, Rs. 28,664 crore, 82,400 employment”. [Officials said this included completed/new projects]. While JSW Energy would sign an MoU for setting up renewable energy power plants in Thoothukudi, Tiruppur and Tirunelveli districts on an investment of Rs. 3,000 crore, the MoU with CapitaLand would pave the way for establishing a data centre at Ambattur on an investment of Rs. 1,500 crore. TCS would set up an IT/ITES unit on an investment of Rs. 900 crore. The event would also witness the laying of the foundation for a liquid oxygen production unit by INOX Air products at Hosur. It would entail an investment of Rs. 150 crore, with a capacity of 200 MT a day. Among the projects that would be inaugurated are of Vikram Solar at Oradagam; DP World - Integrated Chennai Business Park (I) Pvt Ltd; Danish auto component manufacturer Dinex’s unit in Mahindra World City; and Coral Manufacturing Works’ unit in Erode. Some of the projects that will go live were initiated during the former AIADMK regime, which had conducted Global Investors Meet in 2015 and 2019. Many of the MoUs signed during these two events are yet to fructify while some are in various stages of work in progress.  This will be the first series of MoUs to be inked by the two-month-old DMK government||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-government-to-sign-mous-for-35-projects-today/article35417485.ece
20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Come up with plan to restore Sholinganallur tank: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the State government to appoint an expert body to come up with the best possible solution to rejuvenate Periya Eri, a mosaic of tanks, consisting of Velaleri tank, Velalkani tank and Thamaraikani tank at Sholinganallur. Since two faculty members from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras reported largescale encroachments by the government as well, the court wanted to know if the restoration work could be undertaken now by displacing or dislodging the least number of people. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy called for a preliminary report from the expert body within six weeks. The Chief Justice requested Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram to bestow personal attention to the issue, since it could be replicated for protecting all waterbodies spread across the State. The interim order was passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by Arappor Iyakkam, a non-governmental organisation, represented by its managing trustee Jayaram Venkatesan, complaining about the construction of the Semmenchery police station on Thamaraikani tank in 2019. Taking a serious note of the allegation, the judges had, in April, ordered for a study by IIT-M faculty. Accordingly, professor Balaji Narasimhan and Soumendra Nath Kuiry from the Department of Civil Engineering were assigned the task. They informed the court on Monday that the water spread area of Thamaraikani tank alone was 13.47 hectare as per the Public Works Department’s tank memoir and that it had been irrigating around 250 acres. “However, there had been blatant and complete encroachment within the entire extent of Periya Eri… The encroachment is nearly complete on the middle portion, while the encroachment is nearly 60% to 70% on the southern side. On the northern side, in the Thamaraikani tank, the encroachment is by a Tangedco sub-station and the new Semmenchery police station,” the faculty said. “For any meaningful and significant hydrological impact, and complete restoration of the waterbody, the removal of encroachments should be in total and without any exceptions,” the faculty members said. The first Division Bench ordered that no new construction should be permitted on the waterbody, and the police station should also not be made functional until the expert body submits a report on restoration work with minimum damage to existing encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/come-up-with-plan-to-restore-sholinganallur-tank-hc/article35417489.ece
20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No decision on scrapping reservation policy for IIT faculty recruitment, says Union Minister||The Union Minister for Education, Dharmendra Pradhan, said on Monday, through a reply submitted in the Lok Sabha, that no decision has been made yet on the recommendations of the Prof. V. Ramgopal Rao Committee to scrap reservation policies in the recruitment of faculty in the IITs. He was responding to a question raised by DMK MP T.R. Baalu, enquiring about the committee’s report and the steps taken by the Centre for effective implementation of reservation policies for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in IITs and other Central universities. A committee constituted by the Ministry of Education, with IIT-Delhi Director V. Ramgopal Rao as its head, to study ways to effectively implement reservation policies in institutions had recommended that the IITs be exempted from reservation policies in faculty recruitment. In his reply, Mr. Pradhan said the committee’s report had been referred to the Standing Committee of the IIT Council after receiving responses from various Ministries. “No decision has been taken on the recommendations yet,” he said. Mr. Baalu also raised another set of questions regarding the alleged discriminatory practices against students and faculty on the basis of caste and religion. He pointed out the recent allegation by an IIT-M faculty member. Responding to this, Mr. Pradhan said IIT-Madras did not discriminate on the basis of caste or religion. He pointed out a number of initiatives being implemented by the institution, which included students’ outreach programmes to ensure the mental well-being of every student and research scholars, round-the-clock counselling service, a hospital on the campus and orientation programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-decision-on-scrapping-reservation-policy-for-iit-faculty-recruitment-says-union-minister/article35417492.ece
20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘No non-farming activity on wetlands’||With the rapid conversion of paddy fields and wetlands into housing plots in Kanniyakumari district posing a threat to the environment and resulting in water depletion, Collector M. Arvind has issued an order against non-agricultural activity on wet agriculture lands. “A no-objection certificate (NOC) should be obtained from the Collector for non-agricultural activities and construction of houses and buildings. Only after obtaining an NOC from the Collector’s office should applications be submitted to local bodies for permission,” Mr. Arvind said in an order on Sunday. A helpline, 1077, has been created for people to lodge complaints against violations on wetlands. Mr. Arvind told The Hindu that the district administration had started a survey, and in two weeks, notices would be issued to violators.  The Hindu, on July 18, published a report, “ Kanniyakumari’s paddy fields fall prey to real-estate development” . Warning of action against those who construct buildings on wetlands, he said buildings constructed without NOCs from the Collector would not get water and electricity connections. He said officials had been directed to give permissions to non-agricultural activities only after ensuring that the proposed area had no irrigation facilities, and there was no scope for agriculture in the future. This will apply to canals, channels, lakes, tanks, rivers, poromboke lands, temple and Wakf board lands, lands of trusts, public roads and streets. Mr. Arvind said a circular had been issued to all local bodies to verify whether people had NOCs and construction was undertaken as per the requirements of the town and local planning authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-non-farming-activity-on-wetlands/article35417470.ece

20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Actor Vijay’s appeal referred to Tax Bench||The Madras High Court Registry on Monday wrongly listed a petition filed by actor C. Joseph Vijay before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and C. Saravanan, though it should have actually been listed before Justices M. Duraiswamy and R. Hemalatha, who handle the portfolio of dealing with writ appeals against orders passed by single judges of the court in tax cases. Justice Sundresh told the petitioner’s counsel S. Kumaresan that the case had been listed wrongly before his Division Bench and directed the Registry to list it before the Tax Bench. When the counsel requested that the case might be ordered to be listed before the Tax Bench on Tuesday, the judge said he could not issue such a direction and that it was for the Registry to take a call. Mr. Vijay had filed the petition to dispense with the production of a certified copy of a scathing order passed against him by Justice S.M. Subramaniam recently. The judge had dismissed his 2012 plea against demand of entry tax by the State government for his Rolls Royce Ghost car imported from England. Though the actor wanted to appeal against the order, he was not in possession of a certified copy. Therefore, he had filed a petition urging the court to dispense with the production of the certified copy and instead hear his writ appeal on the basis of a web copy of the single judge’s order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/actor-vijays-appeal-referred-to-tax-bench/article35417512.ece

A release from the hospital said the woman, a diabetic who underwent treatment at a hospital in Pollachi for about two weeks after testing positive for COVID-19, developed pain in her right leg. When she was referred to the hospital after the pain increased, she lacked sensation and pulse on her leg and her toes had turned dark, indicating imminent onset of gangrene. Diagnosis revealed that she had developed thrombosis on the vessels supplying blood to her right leg. A team led by I. Rajkumar, senior consultant vascular surgeon at the hospital, surgically removed the clots through incisions in the right groin and behind the knee, the statement said. Warning signs Dr. Rajkumar said the timely intervention saved the woman’s limb. He said that there had been a significant spike in such cases due to COVID-19. The senior surgeon said it was important to treat such conditions at the earliest to prevent amputation of limbs. “Discolouration, leg pain and loss of sensation are the red flags that need immediate clinical intervention,” he added. Alok Khullar, CEO of the hospital, congratulated the team for the effective intervention, without which he said that the woman would have lost her leg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-survivor-treated-for-thrombosis/article35417896.ece
20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Spare no effort in probing irregularities: HC||The State government on Monday informed the Madras High Court that it would revisit a probe into the alleged irregularities in the award of contracts by the Greater Chennai and Coimbatore corporations during the previous AIADMK regime. “The State should spare no effort in getting to the bottom of the matter and in proceeding against those responsible for the irregularities,” the court observed following the submission. Appearing before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram said the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) latest report highlighted that some contractors had quoted absurdly low rates. The CAG’s report further stated that the injudicious analysis of tenders had resulted in undue benefit to the contractors. Therefore, the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) would revisit the issue in the light of the CAG report and register an FIR if necessary, the A-G said. He said there was a need to revisit the preliminary inquiry, already conducted by the DVAC during the AIADMK regime, since some officials had not been interrogated. The submission was made during the hearing of cases filed by Arappor Iyakkam, a non-governmental organisation represented by its managing trustee Jayaram Venkatesan, and DMK MP R.S. Bharathi in 2018, insisting upon the registration of an FIR against the then Municipal Administration Minister, S.P. Velumani, and a host of Corporation officials for the alleged irregularities. Mr. Velumani’s counsel V. Elangovan on Monday opposed the government’s move to revisit the whole issue and sought time to file his counter affidavit to an additional affidavit filed by the NGO on the basis of the CAG’s report. After accepting a request made by the NGO’s counsel, V. Suresh, to take the additional counter affidavit on file, the judges granted time till October 20 for the State government to investigate the matter and take to task all those involved in the alleged irregularities. The former Minister was permitted to file his counter affidavit to the additional affidavit filed by the NGO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-spare-no-effort-in-probing-aiadmk-regime-irregularities/article35417477.ece

20 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Implement OBC quota in AIQ seats this year: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday made it clear that the Centre cannot delay indefinitely the implementation of reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in medical and dental seats contributed to the all India quota (AIQ) by State government-run medical and dental colleges every year. The court said the Centre was bound to implement the reservation from the 2021-22 academic year, and granted it a week’s time to indicate the mode and manner of implementation. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy agreed with senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the DMK, that it would be contumacious on the part of the Centre if it did not provide reservation to OBCs during the 2021-22 academic year, as ordered by the High Court on July 27, 2020, and continued to claim that the reservation would have to await the Supreme Court’s decision in Saloni Kumari’s case. Filing a contempt of court petition against top Central officials, the DMK pointed out that the High Court had ruled that OBCs were entitled to reservation in AIQ seats. The court ordered the constitution of a committee to decide the quantum of reservation to be provided to OBCs and other modalities to be followed. Such an order was passed by the High Court only after the Supreme Court gave the green signal for doing so without awaiting the verdict in Saloni Kumari’s case. Subsequently, the Centre did not challenge the High Court’s decision before the Supreme Court. “It now appears that the Union seeks to keep the implementation of OBC reservation in suspension till the Saloni Kumari case is decided. Prima facie it is unacceptable that the Union would not implement the reservation on the specious ruse that the Saloni Kumari matter had first to be decided by the Supreme Court,” the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/implement-obc-quota-in-aiq-seats-this-year-hc/article35417482.ece

According to Forest Department officials, the incident took place at Kurumbanoor near Mettupalayam on July 11 while driving the elephant out from the village. While accepting that the frontline workers of the Department hurled rocket crackers at the elephant, an official said that people from the locality also threw crackers at the tusker. The Department conducted awareness rallies at three locations near Mettupalayam on July 14 after the video of firecrackers being hurled at the tusker went viral and many including biologists criticised the method. A volunteer of a non-governmental organisation that is into conservation activities said the frontline staff use around 200 rocket crackers on some days to drive out wild elephants in forest ranges like Mettupalayam where human-elephant conflicts were high. Mohan Kumar, a wildlife biologist with the environmental organisation ‘Osai’, felt that negative conditioning would work only when the animal associates the method with danger. “If an animal gets relentlessly tormented through negative conditioning such as crackers, they will eventually get habituated to it and will quickly learn it is not dangerous to them. This is what is happening now. Most males and some female elephants in Coimbatore do not respond to cracker noise any more. This was not the case a decade ago,” he said. According to him, eventually this would push the Department to use more cruel methods like rubber bullets and pepper bullets, which would cause more harm to the animal. The incident occurred when the Department took a break in its efforts to tranquillise and radio-collar Baahubali for study purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hurling-firecrackers-at-wild-elephant-baahubali-draws-criticism/article35417521.ece

Manikoondu area is one of the busiest areas in the city as textile showrooms and shops, grocery stores and other commercial establishments are present in large numbers. Also, vehicles from Pallipalayam pass through R.K.V. Road to reach Panneerselvam Park junction. Hence, the roads are busy round-the-clock. After the Corporation-appointed contractor began work in the area recently, traffic was diverted. However, motorists and traders said works were being carried out at a slow pace. “Besides covering additional distance to reach the destination, traffic congestion on narrow streets is a major issue,” said P. Madhan Kumar of Kumalankuttai. Traders and vendors also said their business was affected for over a week as works were yet to be completed. “We see little business as the road is closed for the work,” said a trader in the locality. “A pit was dug making it difficult for pedestrians to even cross the road,” said V.

Raju on social media. The court was hearing the petition filed by M.

Justice G. Chandrasekharan granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner with conditions. Earlier, the court had dismissed the anticipatory bail petition filed by the first accused, Sankarasubbu of Thoothukudi district. Dismissing the petition of the first accused, Justice Chandrasekharan observed that claiming that a person was dead when he was alive, is a serious offence. It affected the near and dear ones of that person. Even if it was just a forwarded message, the veracity of the same must have been verified, the judge said. It was alleged that when the complainant had questioned the accused for having posted the morphed image of the former Minister on social media, he was verbally abused and criminally intimidated.

20 July 2021||MAYILADUTHURAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishers’ protest enters third day||Fishers in Poompuhar-Tranquebar belt continued their relay fast against the ban on use of purse seine nets for the third day on Monday. At Tranquebar, over 600 families of fishermen belonging to Chandrapadi surrendered their family and Aadhaar cards at the office of Tahsildar. They walked for five km from their village to surrender their family and Aadhaar cards. Senior police and revenue officials held talks with the fishers who insisted that the government should either permit them to utilise purse seine nets or implement the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act 1983 in toto. The Act stipulated that mechanised vessels would not be permitted to undertake fishing operation in the sea within five nautical miles from the coast line in the State. Likewise, motorised country craft with single or multiple engines having capacity of eight horse power and above must not operate within three nautical miles from the coastline. However, fishers from Akkaraipettai and other fishing centres in Nagapattinam district were supportive of the ban on purse seine nets under Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Rules, 2020, but were critical of other regulations for operation of motorised crafts and mechanised vessels. Minister for Fisheries, Fishermen Welfare and Animal Husbandry Anitha R. Radhakrishnan, who was on an official visit to Nagapattinam, urged fishers to comply with the government’s rules on the issue of ban on purse seine nets. District authorities would hold talks with fisher representatives for resolving the issue, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishers-protest-enters-third-day/article35417584.ece

Bharathi under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for a speech he made last year. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao allowed an appeal filed by Mr. Bharathi, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Amit Anand Tiwari, against a Madras High Court judgment on February 22. The High Court refused to quash the final report and proceedings against the parliamentarian. In his petition, the MP reasoned that his statements were not intended to promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will against members of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. Advocate Joseph S. Aristotle appeared for the State government. Mr. Bharathi said he was merely stating a historical fact that the Dravidian progressive movement, with which he was involved since the 1960s, had improved and uplifted the lives of members of SC, ST and downtrodden communities in Tamil Nadu. The case relates to a meeting organised by the leaders of DMK in the name of ‘ Kalaignar Vasagar Vattam ’ to share the ideals of the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sc-quashes-case-against-rs-bharathi/article35417474.ece

20 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry’s inclusion in finance panel ruled out||The Centre has no plan to include the Union Territory of Puducherry within the purview of the 15th Finance Commission, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s response to a question raised by Congress MP V.Vaithilingam on the opening day of the monsoon session of Parliament on Monday. Mr. Vaithilingam, had, in a starred question, sought to know whether the Union Territory of Puducherry was yet to be included under the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, despite repeated requests from the Government of Puducherry and whether the Union government would come forward to do. Ms. Sitharaman, while replying in the negative to both questions, stated that the terms of reference of the Finance Commission were framed under Art 280 (3) of the Constitution. It envisages that the Commission make recommendations on sharing of taxes, grants-in aid of revenue in respect of States. Puducherry being a Union Territory, therefore, does not fall under the ambit of Art 280(3). The 15th Finance Commission as per its terms of reference has submitted its report pertaining to Financial Years 2021-22 to 2025-26 to the President of India on November 9, 2020. An explanatory memorandum as to the action taken on the recommendations made by the Commission was laid in Parliament on February 1, she said. In a press note later, Mr. Vaithilingam said the failure to provide means to allot additional funds for the Union Territory exposed the false promises in the BJP manifesto released by Ms. Sitharaman in Puducherry during the election. The Congress MP said one of the promises in the manifesto was that the Central government's financial allocation for Puducherry would be increased from 25% to 45% as for the State of Jammu and Kashmir. According to Mr. Vaithilingam, the Minister’s answer to the contrary showed that the BJP had made false promises to influence the voters and come to power. Many more would soon come out, he said. The Finance Minister’s response was in the negative to Mr. Vaithilingam’s query on whether the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir had been included under the ambit of the 15th Finance Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherrys-inclusion-in-finance-panel-ruled-out/article35417907.ece

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Monday said every riparian State depending on the Cauvery river should get their due share. Inaugurating the commencement of restoration work of the 200th village pond in Pudukuppam, Embalam constituency, under an NGO-led ‘Neerum Oorum’ campaign, the Lt. Governor said: “Each of the riparian States depending on the Cauvery river for irrigation should get their due share in the water according to evolved guidelines”. Ms. Soundararajan's remarks come amid widespread opposition to Karnataka's proposal to build the Mekedatu reservoir across the Cauvery river that is feared to adversely affect farming in regions in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.  Hailing the initiative of the Eeeram Foundation, the Lt. Governor said the much-needed water rejuvenation initiative would greatly help conserve groundwater and store rainwater run-off. Such renovation work would be continuously held in all regions of Puducherry, she said. The Lt. Governor also appealed to the public not to waste water and keep water sources clean. Contaminated water sources cause transmission of dengue, malaria and other such diseases. The administration is planning to plant 75,000 saplings across Puducherry to mark the 75th Independence Day of India. She said she has expressed her views to the Chief Minister in this regard.

20 July 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||‘Elite school’ students make their mark||Plus Two students of the government’s ‘elite school,’ wherein bright students from poor families are given special coaching, have scored good marks in the board examinations, the results of which were released on Monday. S. Manoj Kumar was the topper with 558.44 out of 600 marks, K. Vigneshwaran came second with 550.46 marks and S Abinash secured 549.67 marks. Teachers and education officials are happy with the results. Speaking to The Hindu , school coordinator V. Thava Ramkumar said that after surmounting many odds, these students had scored good marks. The ‘elite school’ had 36 students, including nine boys. Fourteen among them have secured 540 and above, while the 22 others scored above 500. Thanking his teachers and parents, Vigneshwaran, the topper, said that he focused on studying what was taught on that day on that very day instead of procrastinating. This, he said, helped much in while sitting for the board examinations, he said. Though the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns affected the regular exam schedule, one cannot find fault with the weightage method, he said. A teacher said that despite Vigneshwaran’s father being physically challenged and his mother working as a daily wager in the 100-day job scheme, the boy had secured high marks. Abinash's father Subramani, a fisherman from Moorpannai and his mother Pancharani, thanked the teachers for their encouragement. Chief Educational Officer S. Satyamurthy, who had been a major force in helping the students and teachers in giving the required infrastructure, said that the ‘elite school concept’ introduced by the then Collector Nandakumar had brought in desired results. All the 36 students from the school had applied for NEET and were preparing well for the same, Mr Thava Ramkumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elite-school-students-make-their-mark/article35417616.ece
20 July 2021||Rameswaram,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen seek withdrawal of Indian Marine Fisheries Bill||The Central government should not table the Indian Marine Fisheries Bill, 2021, in the monsoon session of the Parliament, said fishermen leader association members here on Monday. Participating in the one-day strike, the fishermen hoisted black flags on their boats and stayed off the sea to express their displeasure against the Union government. “It seems that the leaders in New Delhi are not interested in protecting the welfare of the fishermen and this is reflected in the Bill,” they claimed. A fishermen leader N. Devadas said that they would even march to New Delhi and resort to agitations there until the Centre gave an assurance that they would protect the fishermen. Another fishermen leader Sesu Raja said that the next course of action would be to mobilise fishermen from all the coastal districts in Tamil Nadu. At a time, when fishermen were looking for assistance from the governments, such Bills were anti-fishermen. “Why should the fishermen be imposed a penalty or directed to remit a fee for fishing. It's our right to venture into the sea. When fishermen have asked for subsidies in diesel and better infrastructure including fair price for the catch, the governments have done nothing tangible”, he charged. However, an official clarified that the Centre had proposed in the Bill to impose a fine on crossing the IMBL with the intention to protect the fishermen. The fishermen are expected to go for fishing tomorrow (Tuesday).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-seek-withdrawal-of-indian-marine-fisheries-bill/article35417599.ece
20 July 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||DMK gave false promises on NEET to gain votes, says Palaniswami||Opposition leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday said the DMK gave false promises during the recent Assembly elections claiming that NEET will not be conducted in Tamil Nadu for medical course admissions. Distributing welfare aids at Jalagandapuram in Salem, he told journalists that though he repeatedly asked the State government to announce whether NEET would be held in the State, neither the Chief Minister nor the Health Minister had provided a clear reply. The public feel that the DMK has cheated them by making false announcements claiming that NEET would be cancelled in the State when they come to power, he said. On the Mekedatu issue, Mr.Palaniswami said that the previous AIADMK government got Cauvery water for the State after a 50-year long battle through a Supreme Court judgment. The court ruled that at no place should Cauvery water be stopped, stored and diverted. The Karnataka government is deliberately trying to stop Cauvery water coming to Tamil Nadu and is making announcements that a dam would be constructed in Mekedatu, and this was condemnable. Tamil Nadu is facing a water scarcity and if a dam is constructed at Mekedatu, the Delta region would turn into a desert and drinking water resources to 16 districts would be affected, he said. On charges of wastage of COVID-19 vaccine doses during the previous regime, Mr. Palaniswami said that Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan has clarified on this. During the initial phase of vaccination, the public feared to take vaccines and the government then created awareness among the public. The doses were not deliberately wasted and wastage occurred due to low turnout of the public. He charged that the Opposition then created fear among the public about vaccination by raising questions on why the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister had not taken the vaccine. Mr Palaniswami said he has urged the Prime Minister to provide maximum doses to Tamil Nadu and the State government should put pressure on the Centre in this regard. The State government should regularise vaccine administration as the public are wasting long hours waiting for vaccination at vaccination centres, he said. Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK was ready to face local body elections whenever they were held. He added that AIADMK has made it clear that the party has no relationship with V.K. Sasikala, aide to former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and said she was deliberately spreading lies. Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK lost in the 1996 and 2006 Assembly elections while she was there (in the party).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-made-false-promises-on-neet-eps/article35417471.ece
20 July 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||DMK government lacks integrity: Annamalai||BJP State president K. Annamalai on Monday criticised the DMK government for failing to implement its electoral promise of reducing the prices of petrol and diesel and said he could not find “integrity” in this government. Admitting that the BJP too wanted fuel prices to be reduced, and claiming that the Centre was taking measures towards this, he told journalists in Salem that the State Finance Minister’s reported remarks that he was waiting for an “auspicious day” to reduce the prices was unacceptable. Mr.Annamalai also reiterated his support for NEET and accused the DMK of confusing people by claiming that it would get the entrance test cancelled. According to him, following the revision of Classes XI and XII syllabus, Tamil Nadu was one of the best performing States in NEET. With 7.5% reservation quota for government school students, it was a boon to rural students, as 430 students had got medical admission. The BJP leader reiterated that the party State Unit was opposed to the Mekedatu dam. There was no confusion over the continuation of his party’s alliance with the AIADMK. The political scenario in Tamil Nadu was shifting to a DMK versus BJP field, and his party was not against Christianity and Islam. Mr.Annamalai said he would also request the Centre for higher allocation of vaccines to Tamil Nadu. Mr.Annamalai said that the report of Sachar Committee constituted during the erstwhile Congress regime showed how backward the Muslim community was in various social indices. It was the BJP government that introduced minority concentration cluster and provided funds for development at places where they resided. He felt that the Congress had not done even 40% of what the BJP had done. After paying homage to former BJP general secretary V. Ramesh, who was killed in 2013, Mr.Annamalai said he would take steps to ensure some progress was made in the case before the next death anniversary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-government-lacks-integrity-annamalai/article35417620.ece

20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘No registration of unapproved plots’||Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy on Monday said that unapproved plots would not be registered in the offices of sub-registrars in the State. Addressing reporters after chairing a consultative meeting with traders of Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Thanjavur and other central districts, he said people, who purchased unapproved plots, realised their mistake only when they approached banks and other financial institutions for loans. They were invariably denied credit. Moreover, the government was committed to preventing illegal conversion of waterbodies and watercourses into layouts and house sites. Hence, it had been decided to register only approved plots. Departmental action would be taken against officials violating registration rules. Mr. Moorthy said he was visiting various parts of the State to understand the problems and issues faced by the people while registering their plots or landholdings. Action would be taken to eradicate the role of intermediaries at registration offices. Token system would be introduced to serve customers on first come, first served basis at registration offices. Keeping the interest of the people, the State government was contemplating changes in land registration. To a question, the Minister said steps had been taken to remove anomalies in goods and services taxes and filing of returns. The process would be simplified. The views expressed by traders would be considered while simplifying the process. Mr. Moorthy said the Tamil Nadu Traders Welfare Board, which was constituted in 1989, would be revived with enrolment of new members. Interested traders could apply for membership. K.N. Nehru, Minister for Municipal Administration, N. Reghupathy, Minister for Law, S.S. Sivasankar, Minister for Backward Classes, and senior officials participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-registration-of-unapproved-plots-in-state-says-minister/article35417509.ece
20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Turf football comes to Tiruchi||To serve the growing interest of youngsters in football, a synthetic turf has come up at K.K. Nagar in the city. Unlike the usual football ground, which requires a huge space, the turf has been established on a 5,000 square feet area, besides facilities for players’ lounge, dressing room, lawns and sanitary arena. The synthetic turf, which resembles a naturally-grown grass ground, was imported from Thailand. The aesthetically designed turf, promoters of the game say, meets the guidelines of Federation of International Football Association (FIFA). The turf is designed to host five players per team. Proportionate to the measurement of the turf, the size of goalposts too has been reduced. The enclosed structure along with shade nets has also been provided with a 60-seater gallery. It can engage players round the clock with the provision of floodlights. A team of four youngsters, who are into different professions, have joined hands to launch the turf. “Turf football is so popular in metro cities like Chennai and Bengaluru. Being ardent football fans from our school days, we thought of creating a sporting infrastructure for the city. It has become a reality. We hope people in Tiruchi will cherish it,” says K. Rahul, one of the promoters. Even before the turf was launched officially on Friday, the football enthusiasts began testing their skills on the surface. Besides peak hours on weekdays, the slots are filled up on Saturdays and Sundays. “It is quite interesting to play on the turf. A small turf with five players a side makes the competition intense. We feel it makes us emotionally and physically fit,” says V. Thirumaran, 25, of Karumandapam. Sathya Parthasarathy, who played a key role on the project, said that infrastructure like this would boost the image of the city. It would surely bring back the attention of the youngsters towards physical activities. There was also a proposal to teach yoga on the turf, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/turf-football-comes-to-tiruchi/article35417578.ece
20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Residents of panchayats on Tiruchi outskirts protest merger move||Residents of various village panchayats situated on the city’s outskirts have urged the district administration not to merge their panchayats with Tiruchi Corporation as it would eventually affect their livelihood and deprive them of government schemes. Holding placards, several women from four panchayats assembled at the District Collectorate here on Monday to register their opposition to the reported move to bring some of the panchayats under the Corporation jurisdiction. Police sources said the residents were from Mutharasanallur, Biskshandarkoil, Malliyampathu and Marthuthandakurichi village panchayats. The contention of the villagers was that many of the residents were farm labourers who were dependent on the 100-day Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to eke out their livelihood. In separate memorandums submitted to the Collector, the villagers said they had heard of the proposed move to extend the jurisdiction of Tiruchi Corporation by bringing some panchayats under it through media reports. Residents of the panchayats said they were dependent on agriculture which was their main income generation activity. Inclusion of the panchayats in Tiruchi Corporation would snatch away the 100-day Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which would render majority of the families jobless, thereby severely affecting their very livelihood, the villagers further said in the memorandum. Inclusion of the panchayats in Tiruchi Corporation would lead to farm lands turning into real estate plots leading to destruction of agriculture, they further contended. “The proposed move to bring the panchayats under Corporation limits would also lead to sharp increase in property tax and drinking water tax which would further affect the public,” said U. Vigneswaran, president of the Malliyampathu panchayat in Andhanallur union. The panchayats would also be deprived of central government schemes once they were brought under Corporation, he further said. The villagers in the memorandums urged the district to drop the proposed move and allow villages to function as panchayats and ensure their livelihood thereby.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-of-panchayats-on-tiruchi-outskirts-protest-merger-move/article35417582.ece
20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Central districts report 334 fresh positive cases, 10 fatalities||The central districts reported 334 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Monday.

20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Siruvachur underpass expected to be completed in six months||Work on construction of vehicular underpasses at Siruvachur near Perambalur on Tiruchi-Chennai national highway has gathered pace after the return of labourers following relaxation of lockdown norms. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) took up construction of the underpass on the highway following popular demand. The absence of a proper provision for crossing the highway at Siruvachur, where the popular Madurakaliamman Temple is located, has posed a threat to visitors and locals alike. The temple is located about 50 km from Tiruchi and about nine km away from Perambalur in the district. It is open on Mondays and Fridays besides New Moon and Full Moon days and annual occasions such as brahmothsavam and Navarathiri . Ever since the Tiruchi-Chennai national highway section was converted into a four-lane highway some years ago, visitors and locals have been facing a problem in crossing the highway. Motorists, including local buses, have also been facing problem as they had to criss-cross the highway often amid speeding vehicles . Siruvachur junction is a major bus-stop for mofussil buses operating between Tiruchi and Perambalur and some long-distance buses too stop here. A few educational institutions have also come up in recent years near the junction. The spot has turned accident-prone in recent years, leading to a public outcry and the subsequent sanction of a vehicular underpass. Construction of the underpass had slowed down due to labour shortage during the intense COVID-19 lockdown period. “One side of the work was completed earlier. Following relaxation of lockdown norms, labourers have returned and work has gathered pace over the past month or so,” a NHAI official said indicating that the work is likely to be completed in about six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/siruvachur-underpass-expected-to-be-completed-in-six-months/article35417594.ece
20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine at the doorstep||Tiruchi Corporation has begun a drive to conduct inoculation of physically challenged and bedridden patients at their door-step . A special helpline has also been set up. The move would help them and their family members protect themselves from the ill-effects of the viral infection, health officials said. The District Differently Abled Welfare Office has been mobilising special vaccination camps for persons with disabilities and of the 21,000 people registered with the office in the district, around 1,500 have been inoculated. However, a large section of them is unable to attend the camps for various reasons including severe ill-health, no means of transport. “Many reached out to officials of the Health Department for help and so we decided to begin this as a full-fledged initiative,” a senior official said. Speaking to The Hindu, City Health Officer M. Yazhini said the focus would be on patients who are bedridden, recovering after surgery, suffering from a chronic illness and for persons with disabilities who have no means to reach a vaccination centre. “We have received a list from the Differently Abled Welfare Office and individually contact them to seek their consent in getting inoculated. For those who are willing, we will send the vaccine to their homes,” she said. A special helpline number, 63852-69208, has also been set up. “While we are reaching out to people individually, there are many who do not know whom to go for help. A team has been deployed to guide Persons with Disabilities and others who are unable to visit our daily vaccination camps and get the jab," she added. Vaccine doses will be reserved for these special groups. A total of 20 persons with disabilities received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at their doorstep.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-at-the-doorstep/article35417580.ece
20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||TABU seeks level-playing field for choice of VCs in arts, science varsities||Teachers’ Association of Bharathidasan University (TABU) has appealed to the Chancellor and Governor for ensuring a level-playing field while appointing Vice-Chancellors of 11 Arts and Science State universities. In a memorandum to the Governor, president of TABU M. Selvam said the existing system wherein candidates of any discipline were appointed as VC in 11 out of 21 State universities demoralised eminent persons from arts and science faculty. For the remaining 10 State universities for professional programmes, the essential qualification for the post of Vice-Chancellor had been fixed as specialised degrees with Ph.D. But in arts and science Universities, candidates from any discipline could apply. “This system will indirectly affect the growth of arts and science universities in the long run,” Mr. Selvam said. The academic environment of arts and science universities was entirely different from universities for professional programmes. The problems and difficulties faced by the students, scholars and faculty members of Arts and Science discipline can be well understood only by the Vice- Chancellors, drawn from the Arts and Science discipline, Mr. Selvam said. Even within arts and science universities, UGC had set two different criteria for Career Advancement Scheme promotion: one for arts faculty and another for science faculty. This indicates the different level playing fields, prevailing even between Arts and Science University and Technical University. This being the case, there was no logic in evaluating the candidates belonging to engineering, agriculture, medicine, arts and science, with the same yardstick. Invariably, the faculty members of Arts discipline cannot effectively compete with Engineering, Agriculture and Medical Faculty Members. Hence, necessary orders must be passed for modification in the bye-laws of State Arts and Science Universities for considering competent faculty members from Arts and Science background alone for the post of VC in those 11 State Arts and Science Universities, as in the case with the rest of the State universities. Also, leverage must be given between Arts and Science Faculty Members in their evaluation criteria for Vice-Chancellor post. An equal opportunity by means of selecting the five competent Science Faculty members and five competent Arts Faculty members may be invited for the next stage of final interview for the post of Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Selvam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tabu-seeks-level-playing-field-for-choice-of-vcs-in-arts-science-varsities/article35417585.ece
20 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Cyber clubs to be set up in villages in central zone||Amid growing instances of gullible public falling victims to internet fraudsters, police have decided to form cyber clubs at the village level across nine districts in central zone. The latest initiative will rope in youth with engineering and computer background to operate village police cyber clubs set up int mother villages. The selected youth at each club will be made members of Telegram, a popular and cross-platform messaging app, thus ensuring online connectivity for them. Telegram groups are being created in all districts falling under the central zone. The convenor of the cyber clubs will be connected to the cyber crime wing created by police in all districts. The wing is headed by a senior officer in the rank of Additional Superintendent of Police in each district. The idea is to form one club in each mother village, which comprises several hamlets under its fold, says Inspector General of Police, Central Zone, V. Balakrishnan. The central zone accounts for more than 3,000 mother villages, according to police data. Whenever there is a spike in cyber crimes, the State Cyber Crime Unit periodically sends alerts to districts to caution the general public not to get duped by online fraudsters. The awareness messages will be shared with the Telegram groups so that they can spread it at the grassroots and advise people to remain cautious and not fall victims to online criminals operating from unknown destinations, says Mr. Balakrishnan. The plan is have cyber club members conduct awareness meetings at a common venue in the villages every Saturday, Mr. Balakrishnan said. The members will talk about the different types of online fraud and crimes and appeal to the gathering to desist from sharing vital personal details to unknown persons calling over the phone or sending messages through social media platforms. They will also touch upon contemporary cyber crimes and modus operandi of the fraudsters to cheat the public and the need to remain extremely cautious while dealing with phone calls and online messages. The idea behind the initiative is to have two-way exchange of information — from the people about phoney calls and messages received by them and the other to drive home awareness messages about online fraud, Mr. Balakrishnan said. Police sources say about 40 cases have been registered in cyber crime police stations in different districts in the zone. Twelve cases have been booked in Tiruchi district and eight in Thanjavur. Cyber crimes that have come to the attention of law enforcers through petitions received from the general public include vishing — a fraudulent practice of making phone call claiming to be from reputed firms and inducing individuals to divulge personal information such as debit and credit card details — phishing, crypto currency fraud; internet banking/UPI fraud and fake websites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cyber-clubs-to-be-set-up-in-villages-in-central-zone/article35417586.ece

The marks have been calculated without holding public examinations due to lockdown enforced in view of the second wave of COVID-19. As elsewhere in the State, Tiruchi has registered cent per cent results, calculated on 50:20:30 ratio of the students’ scores in SSLC, Plus One and Plus Two.

20 July 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Minister hints at formation of new revenue divisions||Minister for Revenue K. K. S. S. R. Ramachandran has hinted at the formation of new revenue divisions following the bifurcation of larger districts for effective management. “After consulting with the Department of Finance, the decision on formation of new revenue divisions and taluks will be announced by the Chief Minister,” Mr. Ramachandran said while speaking to reporters here on Monday after reviewing the performance of his department with top officials from Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari districts. Speaker M. Appavu, who was chairing the review meeting, appealed to the Revenue Minister to form Valliyoor Revenue Division as people from the southern and eastern parts of the district now had to travel more than 75 Km to reach Cheranmahadevi to reach the Sub-Collector’s office (Revenue Division Office). “The petitioners from Kuttam, Michael Nagar or George Nagar, who have to start their journey around 6 a.m. can reach the revenue division office in Cheranmahadevi only after noon as they have to take three buses to reach this place. If a new revenue division is formed with Valliyoor as its headquarters, it will be of great help to the people,” Mr. Appavu requested. Mr. Ramachandran, without giving any direct reply to this plea, said new revenue divisions had to be formed in the newly formed districts and hence any announcement in this connection would be made by the Chief Minister after consulting it with the Department of Finance. Mr. Appavu also appealed to the Revenue Minister to form a new taluk with Panagudi near Valliyoor as its headquarters. Mr. Ramachandran informed that of the 41,803 petitions received from these three districts under ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Muthalvar’ (Chief Minister in Your Constituency) programme, 13,462 petitions had been cleared. He said the Revenue Divisional Officers and the Sub-Collectors have been instructed to hold monthly meetings in each taluk to clear the petitions from the public. Survey of lands When Mr. Appavu and Tirunelveli MLA Nainar Nagenthran, after raising the issue of inordinate delay in surveying the lands for getting sub-divisions and separate pattas, appealed to the Minister to appoint surveyors in sufficient numbers to avoid delay, Mr. Ramachandran assured that the issue would be sorted out. “The survey of lands will be done within three weeks from the date of submitting the application as per law in the presence of licensed surveyors. Moreover, the surveyors have been instructed to inform well in advance the applicants about the survey of land on a particular date,” he said adding that the free house sites would hereafter be done only after creating proper plots by the officials. The Minister said the government, while acquiring lands for government projects, was giving attractive compensation as per the market value to avoid delay in commencement or completion of the projects. On the Farmers’ Security Scheme, which had not registered the anticipated progress, he said the officials had been urged to create awareness among the farmers about the scheme. The Minister announced that the vacancies in the lower level positions in the revenue department would be filled-up shortly. Commissioner for Land Administration Nagarajan, Collector V. Vishnu, MLAs M. Abdul Wahab of Palayamkottai, Palani Nadar of Tenkasi, E. Raja of Sankarankovil and T. Sadan Thirumalaikumar of Vasudevanallur were present. Earlier, Mr. Ramachandran handed over community certificate to ten persons belonging to Kaattu Naicken community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-hints-at-formation-of-new-revenue-divisions/article35417604.ece

20 July 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||VIT researchers’ team wins big at pan-India event||A team of researchers from the Centre for Biomaterials, Cellular & Molecular Theranostics (CBCMT) at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, has been declared the winner of MaterialNEXT 2.0 in its second edition that was hosted by TATA Steel recently. According to a press release, the Tata Steel Advanced Materials Research Centres (TSAMRC) has been actively associating with young college talents through their ‘Campus Connect’ programme and MaterialNEXT, which is an open innovation Pan-Indian event to identify budding research talents and materialise potential ideas. Team ‘Titans’ from VIT, Vellore, mentored by the Director and Senior Professor Geetha Manivasgam of CBCMT, comprises of interdisciplinary research scholars Pearlin Hameed, Ansheed Raheem, G. Aswin and R. Jishita. They had bagged a cash prize of Rs. 5 lakh after marking a prolific win in the grand finale. After four screening levels, the team secured their final spot, competing against 250 teams from across India over six months amid the pandemic restrictions. In the finale, they were challenged by runner-up ‘Team Changemakers’ from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, and three other teams from IISc-Bangalore, IIT-Guwahati, and IIT-Gandhinagar. The VIT team innovated by designing and developing a novel 3D printed porous Titanium alloy that nearly mimics the properties of natural bone in contrast to conventional titanium alloys that are currently used. This would significantly alleviate many post-surgical complications, which otherwise contributed to implant failure. Currently, the Indian medical sector uses imported implants for bone repair, which is a cross to bear for an average Indian and a near-to-impossible luxury for the underprivileged. This innovation is expected to churn out indigenous porous bone grafts, plates, fixtures, screws, and dental implants, with superior bio compatibility and an affordable price tag, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vit-researchers-team-wins-big-at-pan-india-event/article35417938.ece

20 July 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Villupuram man designs battery bicycle||S. Baskaran, 33, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering from Valavanur near Villupuram, has designed a battery-powered bicycle capable of carrying a load of 100 kg. After three attempts since 2010, Mr. Baskaran succeeded in designing the bicycle powered by a 24 volt and 12 AH battery. The bicycle, which weighs 25 kg, can run for 50 km per each full charging. The batteries take six hours to charge to the full level and can attain a top speed of 30 kmph. Should the battery be exhausted, the user can pedal it like a conventional bicycle. Mr. Baskaran has been working on the concept for the past 11 years. “When I came up with the concept as part of my project in a polytechnic in Villupuram in 2010, the head of the department virtually discouraged me on the grounds that this was not an innovative concept and there was no point in going ahead with it,” he said. Although Mr. Baskaran was devastated by this, he did not lose heart. He continued to work on the concept and designed three bicycles, all of which failed. Encouraged by his mother and sister, Mr. Baskaran analysed the causes for failure and kept researching on different models to come up with the present design. “I managed to procure the parts and battery and finish the model. The lithium ferro phosphate battery weighs 3 kg and has 24 cells arranged in three rows. I made a few modifications to the bicycle to finish it now. The bicycle has a load-carrying capacity of 100 kg and costs Rs. 25,000,” he said. He tested the bicycle by riding it from Villupuram to Puducherry and Panruti. The battery lasts 2,000 cycles of charging, he said. YouTube channel Mr. Baskaran runs a YouTube channel BBN Tamil and has been offering tips for designing bicycles with alternative sources of energy. He has several ideas up his sleeve. “Once the bicycle becomes popular, I plan to design battery-powered tricycles for differently-abled persons. I plan to approach the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for certification,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villupuram-man-designs-battery-bicycle/article35417899.ece
20 July 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Selection of Chairman for Auroville under way: Centre||The Centre on Monday said that the process of selection of a chairman to the Governing Board of the Auroville Foundation was underway. In the Lok Sabha, replying to an unstarred question from D. Ravikumar of the VCK, on the reason for the delay in appointing a chairman to the Auroville Foundation, Union Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan said the process of selection of chairman of the Governing Board of Auroville Foundation, was on. The amount allocated to Auroville Foundation as the Budget Estimate (BE) for 2020-21 was Rs. 18.20 crores and the BE for 2021-22 is also Rs. 18.20 crore. However, the Revised Estimate was Rs. 4.58 crores in 2020-21 Replying to a question on the reason for reduction in the allocation, Mr. Pradhan said that as informed by the Auroville Foundation, the pandemic had halted most of the projects. Hence, there was no expenditure under the capital head and less expenditure in general, he said. For the development of Auroville Foundation, the Ministry provides guidance, advice and financial support in terms of grants to meet recurring and non-recurring liabilities. The financial support from the Ministry along with the income generated by Auroville Foundation is used for meeting the objectives of strengthening the foundation, Mr. Pradhan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/selection-of-chairman-for-auroville-under-way-centre/article35417908.ece

"The Union Minister for Jal Shakti, too, assured us that they [the Centre] will not give their approval [to the project]," he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Stalin called on the President at the Rashtrapati Bhavan and invited him to several events planned in Chennai, including one celebrating the completion of 100 years of the first meeting of the then Madras Legislative Council, which was set up in 1921. He also invited the President to unveil a portrait of late DMK leader and former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in the Assembly hall and to the foundation laying ceremony for a library in Madurai, which would be named after Karunanidhi. He requested the President to lay the foundation stone for a State-run multi-super speciality hospital at Guindy in Chennai, and a structure commemorating 75 years of Independence, which would also come up in the city. "He has given his acceptance. He has promised to give the dates within the next couple of days," Mr. Stalin said. This was Mr. Stalin’s first meeting with the President after assuming charge as Chief Minister in May. When asked if he had placed any demand before the President on the release of seven life convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case or on NEET, Mr. Stalin recalled that he wrote to Mr. Kovind earlier, seeking the release of the convicts. “You would be aware that the issue is in court. The situation warrants us to approach it legally,” he said. When asked whether DMK MPs would raise the issue of the rise in fuel prices during the ongoing session of Parliament, Mr. Stalin said the MPs had discussed the issues to be raised in both Houses during a meeting, and they would raise them, on the directions of the Leader of the Parliamentary Party, in both Houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-will-face-mekedatu-issue-legally-says-stalin/article35417472.ece

20 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Tourist entry banned at several places in Belagavi||Due to the rise in COVID-19 Delta variant cases in Maharashtra, the Belagavi administration has banned the entry of visitors at tourist spots in the district. Places where tourists are banned include waterfalls in and around Gokak and Khanapur taluk. On the order of Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath, tahsildars have banned tourist entry at waterfalls in Gokak, Godachinmalki and Dhupdal. Tahsildar of Khanapur has banned entry of tourists at Chikkale, Chigule, Kanakumbi, Paravad, Man, Jamboti and other waterfalls and tourist places in Khanapur taluk. The order follows a trend of “revenge” tourism where city dwellers, stuck indoors for months, are going on tours in hordes on weekends. Some places have also seen huge crowds even on weekdays. “But we have a responsibility to contain the spread of the epidemic. Hence the order,” the Deputy Commissioner said. Meanwhile, the police continued strict vigil on inter-State border check-posts. All vehicles carrying passengers without RT-PCR or vaccination certificates were sent back. Buses between Belagavi and Maharashtra districts of Kolhapur and Sangli were stopped. A travel protocol remains in place for Maharashtra and Goa. To enter Karnataka, a RT-PCR negative certificate not older than 72 hours or vaccination certificate of at least one dose is compulsory. This applies to those who travel by flight, bus, train, taxi, personal transport and other means. However, vaccination of both doses is necessary to enter Maharashtra. Only those who have been vaccinated with both doses of vaccine [15 days since the administration of the second dose] and are in possession of the final vaccination certificate issued through the Co-WIN portal are allowed. If a person has received only one dose, he should carry a RT-PCR negative certificate not older than 72 hours. All other persons should carry a RT-PCR negative certificate. To enter Goa, one should have a RT-PCR certificate not older than 48 hours. For those going to work in Goa or those seeking treatment for medical emergencies should have have had both doses of vaccine two weeks prior to travel and should be asymptomatic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourist-entry-banned-at-several-places-in-belagavi/article35417645.ece
20 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||An honest person will become Chief Minister soon: Yatnal||Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, dissident leader and BJP MLA, on Monday said an honest person with Hindutva ideology would become the next Chief Minister soon. Mr. Yatnal told reporters in Vijayapura that a BJP leader was making trips to New Delhi, with a demand that he be made Chief Minister. “He has also tried to bribe the party’s central leadership. The party leadership is very honest and they will not tolerate such things,” he said. He demanded an inquiry into the audio clip in which Nalin Kumar Kateel, BJP State unit president, has purportedly hinted at the party replacing the Chief Minister with his loyalist. Mr. Yatnal said that he stood by Mr. Kateel. “Crime branch police should investigate the veracity of the clip and the allegations. However, the police should also investigate how such clips are leaked,” he said. “Even if Mr. Kateel had made some remarks about change in leadership in the State, it should not be taken seriously. Everyone makes some statements within their close circle of friends. That is not an offence. We should try and find out which person recorded such statements and shared them on social media. That is an offence as it affects the privacy of individuals. The crime branch police do not investigate such serious issues. They don’t go after corrupt people like the princelings or drug dealers. They waste their time solving minor crimes,” Mr. Yatnal said. He added, “Anyway, B.Y. Vijayendra, son of Yediyurappa, has many friends in the Police Department. How did he not come to know about the existence of such a clip?” Mr. Yatnal said Mr. Kateel has said that the voice in the leaked audio clip is not his. “I think we should believe him,” he said. He remarked that the party would want to choose such a CM candidate who would ensure a BJP victory in the next elections. “I am not in any race,” he said. He also said he had no idea about the Chief Minister convening a legislature party meeting. “I have not got a notice till now. If I am invited, I will go. I will say whatever I have to say,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/an-honest-person-will-become-chief-minister-soon-yatnal/article35417456.ece

20 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. has ignored SC order, law on posting of IAS officers: HC||Observing that the State government has given the go-by to the apex court’s order as well as the law enacted way back in 2014 governing the posting of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, the High Court of Karnataka has set a deadline of two months for the government to set up a Civil Service Board (CSB) for recommending transfer and posting of IAS officers. “The directions issued by apex court in the T.S.R. Subramaniam case, rather than being implemented, have been made to vanish into thin air, though not directly but indirectly...,” the court observed. The Supreme Court had directed the setting up of an CSB and the fixing of minimum tenure to curb political and other considerations in the transfer and posting of IAS officers. A Division Bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda issued the direction while disposing of petitions filed by IAS officer Sharath B. and the government questioning the March 29 order of the Central Administrative Tribunal. Mr. Sharath had sought directions to post him as Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru district as the tribunal had declined to issue such a direction despite finding that his transfer was done sans recommendation from the CSB. The government had questioned the tribunal’s order of declaring as invalid the government’s March 12, 2014, notification through which it had kept in abeyance an earlier notification, dated January 31, 2014, of constituting the CSB and fixing a minimum tenure of two years, except in certain circumstances, at a cadre post for IAS officers, as per the apex court’s order. Amendment While noting that the Union government itself, based on the apex court’s verdict, had amended the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, with effect from January 28, 2014, creating the CSB and fixing minimum tenure for IAS officers, the Bench noted that the State Cabinet had, on March 3, 2014, decided to keep the January 2014 notification in abeyance and “to continue the conventions being followed previously” on the posting of IAS officers. “What was the previous convention that was followed, whether by way of any extant rules, Government Orders, circulars or notifications, is not forthcoming and it has remained a mystery,” the Bench noted. Though a Cabinet sub-committee was set up six years ago to examine implementation of apex court’s direction, the sub-committee has not submitted any report but the committee itself was dissolved, the Court noted. In this manner, the Bench said the State government itself had “given quietus to its January 31, 2014, notification and in effect nullified the mandate of the judgment passed by the apex court”. The Bench found no fault in the tribunal’s finding that the government had no power in law to keep the CSB in abeyance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-has-ignored-sc-order-law-on-posting-of-ias-officers-hc/article35417448.ece
20 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mynvax to get funding for ‘warm’ COVID-19 vaccine||Mynvax, a vaccine technology startup, incubated by the Society for Innovation and Development (SID) at the Indian Institute of Science, has signed an agreement to raise $4.2 million (Rs. 31 crore) in its Series A round of financing led by Accel to bring a thermotolerant COVID-19 vaccine to the market. The company was developing novel recombinant vaccines for COVID-19 and human influenza and would use the proceeds to further clinical development for the same, it said on Monday. LetsVenture and a few early stage angel investors also participated in this round, which received the backing of its pre-Series A investors such as 1Crowd, Kotak Investment Advisors and other angel investors. The company said that with the support of BIRAC, Government of India, early-stage investors and SID, IISc, it was able to rapidly demonstrate its ability to develop novel vaccine candidates which have been rigorously tested for performance and unique attributes such as heat tolerance, to increase access to the vaccine across the country. Dr. Gautham Nadig, co-founder and Executive Director of Mynvax said that in addition to expeditiously advancing its existing vaccine candidates, both in India and overseas, the company would also invest in developing new vaccine modalities. Mynvax would begin to build partnerships with large vaccine manufacturers to hasten the deployment of much needed vaccines, he added. Mahendran Balachandran, Partner, Accel said, “We strongly believe that Mynvax's platform has the potential to make a huge positive change in the Global vaccine landscape for major respiratory illnesses.” Mynvax was founded in 2017 by Dr. Raghavan Varadarajan, Professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and Dr. Nadig, an alumnus of the Institute, with the aim of advancing innovative and broadly protective influenza vaccine technologies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mynvax-to-get-funding-for-warm-covid-19-vaccine/article35417445.ece
20 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Leadership: Community factor to the fore||In a clear indication that the BJP high command would have to deal with the community factor if it wanted to dislodge Lingayat leader and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, on Monday, amid speculation of leadership change in the State, the Veerashaiva Mahasabha and heads of Lingayat mutts opposed any moves to replace the Chief Minister. President of the prominent community body All-India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, Shamanur Shivashankarappa, threw the weight of the Mahasabha behind the Chief Minister. Senior Congress leader from the community, M.B. Patil, also warned the BJP of the community’s wrath if Mr Yediyurappa were to be removed. Mr. Shivashankarappa, also a senior Congressman, met Mr. Yediyurappa at his residence on Monday evening and was closeted with him for nearly an hour. He told media persons later that the Veerashaiva community was firmly with Mr. Yediyurappa and any efforts to dislodge him would not go down well with the community. “If they dislodge Yediyurappa, the BJP will suffer what happened when Nijalingappa and Veerendra Patil were removed. The BJP must think about this history before venturing into any adventures. It is B.B. Shivappa and B.S. Yediyurappa who toiled hard and built this party. If they remove him, they will be ruined,” he said. Mr. Patil, describing Mr. Yediyurappa as a “tall leader of the Lingayat community”, said, “The BJP may face the wrath of Lingayats if they ill-treat a tall leader such as B.S. Yediyurappa. The BJP should value his contribution and treat him with dignity. This is my personal opinion, understanding that the proposed changes may be internal matters of the BJP,” he tweeted. The Lingayat community, which has a dominant presence in Karnataka, is considered a vote base of the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/leadership-community-factor-to-the-fore/article35417450.ece
20 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||There was a 22.6% increase in lightning in 2020, says report||There was a 22.6% increase in lightning in India last year compared to 2019, according to the ‘2020 India Lightning Report’ released by Earth Networks, which operates the largest global hyperlocal weather network. Karnataka was among the top 10 States with the highest lightning pulse counts in 2020. Over 39.5 million pulses were detected in India last year by the company’s Total Lightning Network. Of these, 12,022,402 were dangerous cloud-to-ground strikes. Most lightning pulses were in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, and Karnataka. According to a release issued in Bengaluru on Monday, there were 7,447 dangerous thunderstorm alerts issued in India, most of them in Tamil Nadu. “In 2020, India saw the highest concentration of lightning in May, June, and September because of the monsoon season. Although the rainfall average across India reached 109% (just 1% less than the 2019 average of 110%), the lightning increased by 22.6%,” the release said. Severe weather and lightning pose a great threat to the Indian population. India experiences extreme amounts of heat and moisture due to the country’s proximity to the Equator and the Indian Ocean, contributing to severe and sudden thunderstorms throughout South Asia. According to a study by the National Crime Records Bureau, since 2001, as many as 2,360 people die in India every year due to lightning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/there-was-a-226-increase-in-lightning-in-2020-says-report/article35417454.ece
20 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||It’s still not showtime||It is not yet showtime, though the State government has permitted the opening of cinemas with 50% occupancy from Monday. Theatre owners are buying more time to resume business and say it will take at least a week or 10 days to screen films. While they are waiting for new releases, sanitisation and other maintenance works will be done as the theatres were closed for over three months after the second wave of the pandemic hit the State, they said. K.V. Chandrashekar, chairperson of Karnataka Film Exhibitors’ Association, said, “Theatres have been allowed to open after several months. Owners are waiting for new releases. Once people are informed about new releases, they will come to the theatres. In a couple of days, we will get clarity on the new releases in Kannada as well as other languages. The release of old films does not interest people.” Even multiplexes are waiting for the dates of new releases. An official of Inox said, “As auditoriums were shut for months, we have taken up sanitisation, deep cleaning, and maintenance works of the equipment. It is likely to take one week to 10 days for the resumption of screening.” Theatres hit hard The outbreak of the pandemic has hit theatre owners hard.

Many theatres that have a long legacy have also shut down and owners are looking for other business for survival,” said D.R.

20 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pvt. players get ready to provide e-bike taxis||The Society Of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) has welcomed the State government’s move to allow e-bike taxis in cities across Karnataka. “It will trigger contemporary debate over pollutant thresholds and make cities pollution-free,” said SMEV. The State government on July 14 brought out the The Karnataka Electric Bike Taxi Scheme, 2021, allowing private players and individuals to offer the service for up to 10 kilometres. Sohinder Gill, Director-General, SMEV, said, “Fostering a climate-smart mobility strategy will help achieve Karnataka’s zero-emission goals. E-bike taxis offer an economical and ecological solution for last-mile delivery with climate-friendly transport. This move will galvanise the growth engine towards green mobility as the systematic shift unfolds across the Indian ecosystem.” The guidelines offer detailed provisions for both taxi aggregator giants like Uber, Rapido, and Ola as well as individuals to register an e-bike taxi. Private operators are gearing up to provide the service which is expected to see much demand. “We appreciate the State government’s decision to allow electric two-wheelers [e2W] to register as commercial bike taxis. This is a long-awaited step in the right direction and will help people utilise their well-earned assets to earn a livelihood,” said Aravind Sanka, co-founder, Rapido, the country’s largest bike taxi platform that has a presence in nearly 100 cities and has over 1.5 million driver-partners on its platform. “We also should not forget that most of Bengaluru’s citizens currently own a fuel-based two-wheeler, which can help us solve the challenges of traffic congestion and the impact on income due to the pandemic,” Mr. Sanka added. Vivekananda Hallekere, CEO & co-founder, Bounce, hailed the State’s decision to provide legal provisions to operate electric bike taxis. “Bounce will be deploying approximately 50,000 e-bikes in the city, which can be operated as taxis. Our existing model of self-driven shared scooters will continue, as we feel they both cater to very different audiences and solve different problems,” he said. Bounce claims to be the largest electric moped operator in the country, having done over 8 million EV km. “It’s time to reimagine public transport beyond theexisting modes and prevent private ownership of vehicles,” added Mr. Hallekere.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pvt-players-get-ready-to-provide-e-bike-taxis/article35417429.ece

The court said that he had not only refrained from reporting to the new post till April 1, 2021, on “so-called health grounds”, but also not submitted any representation to the competent authority on the matter. “This conduct of Mr. Sharath would also indicate that if he had continued at the same place [as DC of Mysuru], he would not have been in a position to attend to his duties due to health reasons, as he has claimed.” The High Court said that Mr. Sharath, being a civil servant, “ought to have reported to the place of new posting and could have submitted a representation to the competent authority for reconsideration of transfer”. The government had then appointed another IAS officer, Rohini Sindhuri, as Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru in his place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-relief-for-officer/article35417459.ece

20 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Auto drivers oppose e-bike taxis scheme||The State government’s decision to allow e-bike taxi services in Karnataka has not gone down well with autorickshaw drivers, who have expressed strong reservations, saying it will eat into their business. A few days ago, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa released ‘The Karnataka Electric Bike Taxi Scheme, 2021,’ allowing private companies and aggregators as well as individuals to offer e-bike services up to 10 km. The Transport Department plans to introduce fares in two slabs — first 5 km and 5 to 10 km. The department is working on the fare structure and it is said that likely to be lower than autorickshaw fares. T. Somashekar, president of Namma Chalakara Trade Union, opposed the decision and said that auto and taxi drivers have already started a campaign by sending postcards to government heads, such as the Chief Minister and the Transport Minister. “If they introduce e-bike taxis, auto and taxi drivers who have already registered vehicles will suffer a lot financially. At present, autos and taxis are picking up or dropping passengers near bus stands, metro station, or railway stations. When e-bike taxis come, these drivers will not be in a position to compete with big companies or aggregators providing e-bike services and end up losing business,” he said. C.N. Sreenivas, of Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union attached to CITU, added, “After the outbreak of the pandemic, auto drivers have suffered a lot. We are struggling to earn even Rs. 200 a day. Introduction of e-bike taxis will do more harm. On the other hand, new metro lines are getting operational, which is also resulting in loss of business for the autos. We want the government to drop the proposal of introducing bike taxis in the interest of autorickshaw drivers.” Mr. Sreenivas said that there are 2 lakh autorickshaws registered in Bengaluru alone. However, Commissioner of Transport N. Shivakumar defended the new scheme by saying that e-bike taxis will give an economical and alternative mode of transport for people and is aimed at addressing last- and first-mile connectivity to public transport . “E-bike taxis are aimed at complementing the public transport system. People who are relying on public transport such as metro or buses will use the service to reach the bus stop or metro stations. Service of the e-bike taxis is restricted only to 10 km and only one person can book the service, whereas autos and taxis are allowed to run long distances. E-bike taxis may have some impact on autorickshaws or even on city buses, but it is being introduced with the greater objective of providing an alternative and economical mode travelling for shorter distance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/auto-drivers-oppose-e-bike-taxis-start-postcard-campaign-against-it/article35417425.ece

20 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Verification ordered into Rs. 15-crore estimate to level land for substation||District in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari and senior officials were in for a surprise on Monday when officials from Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (MESCOM) informed them that Rs. 15 crore was required to level the land meant to construct a power substation in Bantwal taluk. Chairing a meeting on issues related to power substations and power lines here, Mr. Poojari said that the administration will recommend stringent action against officials concerned if it was found that the cost is exaggerated. He directed engineers from the Public Works and Panchayat Raj departments and Nirmithi Kendra to inspect the proposed land and submit a report after verifying the claim. MESCOM had in 2014 proposed to construct a 110 kV substation at Siddakatte in Bantwal taluk and prepared an estimate. The company had said that Rs. 15 crore was required to level the land before constructing the substation. Mr. Poojari said that if the estimate is found to be exaggerated during inspection, the government will be asked to initiate action against MESCOM officials concerned. Meanwhile, the Minister directed the revenue officials to identify three to five acres of alternative land in Siddakatte to facilitate construction of the substation. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that MESCOM itself had identified the land at Siddakatte in 2014 and did not look for alternative land. After the proposal was accepted, officials have claimed that Rs. 15 crore was needed to level the land. Prima facie , the claim has no substance as the power distributor should have identified alternative land either belonging to the government or private persons. They did not discuss the issue with the revenue authorities either. Dr. Rajendra directed Bantwal Tahsildar Rashmi to identify alternative land either at Siddakatte or nearby villages. He asked the Tahsildar to immediately conduct a Gram Sabha in the village to get details about available land from villagers. The meeting discussed in detail other issues related to substations and power lines in the district. MLAs Rajesh U. Naik and K. Umanath Kotian, MLC Prathapsimha Nayak, senior MESCOM officials and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/verification-ordered-into-rs-15-crore-estimate-to-level-land-for-substation/article35417841.ece

Minister for Welfare of Backward Classes and in-charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivasa Poojary, speaking to reporters at Kalavara, near Kundapur, said that the clip has been released in the name of Mr. Kateel and he had already doubted its authenticity.

20 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Portion of the wall of pedestrian ramp collapses at KRS reservoir||A portion of the pedestrian ramp’s wall at KRS dam was found collapsed. Situated a couple of metres away from the main structure of KRS reservoir, the sloping pedestrian ramp leading to the Brindavan Gardens is separated from the body of the dam by another ramp for vehicles. Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited (CNNL) officials, who were at the spot, sought to allay fears over the safety of the dam due to the collapse, which incidentally comes in the wake of a raging debate over threat to KRS reservoir from illegal stone quarrying in the vicinity. A senior CNNL official said the pedestrian ramp was in no way connected to the main structure of the dam. “It is 11.5 metres away from the body of the dam,” the official said, emphasizing that the collapsed portion of the wall would have no impact on the dam. The pedestrian ramp as well as the vehicle ramp had been built around the same time as KRS reservoir, whose construction was completed about 90 years ago in 1932. The pedestrian ramp has not been in much use ever since the authorities barred public entry from the main gate at the southern end. While the main dam’s structure had been built in lime mortar, the pedestrian and vehicle ramps had been constructed using mud mortar, an official explained. About 25 to 30 stone blocks that comprised the wall of the pedestrian wall had come apart. Senior officials of CNNL supervised the repair work of the damaged wall with workers restoring the collapsed stone blocks with cement. The collapse has been attributed to wear and tear, but the rains lashing the region over the last four to five days may have contributed to weakening the strength of the mud mortar used in the masonry work, said the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/part-of-wall-of-ramp-collapses-at-krs/article35417457.ece
20 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Minister moots Gangothsava festival at Talakad||The government will conduct Gangothsava at Talakad near T. Narsipura from this year in a bid to develop the historical place as a major tourist destination. This was stated by the Minister for Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar after visiting Somanathpur and Talakad, on Monday. Talakad was the capital of the Gangas who ruled for more than six centuries from the 4th to the 10th century CE and contributed immensely to art and culture of the region. The Gangothsava is to celebrate their contribution and revive public memory about a dynasty. The Minister said Talakad is known for Panchalinga Darshana which takes places based on the astrological and astronomical calculations once in a few years. But if Gangothsava was celebrated every year to coincide with Dasara in Mysuru, it would not only increase the tourist traffic but will help shore up the infrastructure of the region, said the minister. Talakad is a renowned pilgrim centre but it was necessary to develop it as a tourist centre laying emphasis on its history and archaeology, he added. The Minister said a detailed project report will be ready within 15 to 20 days. Mr. Yogeshwar said for tourists visiting Mysuru, it was necessary to market Talakad as well so that they visit the place. “I will discuss the feasibility of conducting Gangothsava with different departments so as to ensure comprehensive development of the infrastructure. Similar to Mysuru circuit the ministry is keen to develop a Talakad circuit so as to draw more tourists,” he added. The Minister said in a bid to encourage rural students to visit places of tourist areas in the State the department would also rope in the education department. The objective is to create hostels for the benefit of rural students across 10 districts so that they can stay in such places. In reply to a question, Mr. Yogeshwar said heli-tourism will kickstart from the existing airports and would soon take off in Mysuru as well with a revised plan. However, he did not elaborate. There was opposition to the proposed helipad - mooted for promoting heli-tourism - opposite the Lalith Mahal Palace as it entailed felling hundreds of trees. But the Minister said the Centre has given its clearance for helitourism from the existing airports. On the proposed Disneyland project, the Minister said it was a project of the CNNL and Irrigation Department and the Tourism Department wants to make use of the backwaters in the KRS to promote tourism. The government will promote water sports in the KRS backwaters and similar activity is mooted at 10 dams across the State, he added. It will also take up the ropeway project at Chamundi Hills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minister-moots-gangothsava-festival-at-talakad/article35417657.ece
20 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Most single screens put off reopening||Most single-screen theatres remained shut in Mysuru in spite of the government allowing them to reopen with 50% seating capacity, complying with the mandatory SOPs. However, multiplexes here reopened after a long gap but the response on day one was lukewarm. Barring a few, the majority of single-screen theratres did not run the shows as exhibitors said they would wait for the new releases. M.R. Rajaram, Secretary, Mysuru Film Exhibitors’ Association, said the single screens have put off shows until new releases. “We had talks with the producers and distributors on this. There is no point in keeping the theatres open with no new film to screen. We cannot rerun films released in the past as there won’t be audience to watch them,” he said. “With Maharashtra yet to permit theatres there to reopen, release of Hindi movies might get delayed. Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have also not eased curbs. Unless they cater to local markets, movies from those States will not be released in our State. All these factors prompted us to put off the reopening,” he said As per the guidelines, the theatres are supposed to issue tickets only for 50% of their seating capacity. The SOPs have to be strictly complied with as each seat has to be kept vacant to maintain social distancing. Face masks, hand sanitization and hand washing at the restrooms are a must. As more new movies are being released on OTT platforms, exclusive releases for theatres might take time, sources in the business said. Moreover, some exhibitors are reluctant to run shows for 50% audience as it is unviable with the returns from each show not even covering overheads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/most-single-screens-put-off-reopening/article35417854.ece
20 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||37,339 students write SSLC exam||Amidst COVID-19 concerns, the SSLC examination in Mysuru district went on smoothly on Monday with 37,339 students attending. It was held at 237 centres, including 77 in Mysuru city alone. As many as 197 students were absent. As the examination, like last year, is being held under unprecedented circumstances, the schools took all necessary precautionary measures. Some had decorated their campuses with flowers, buntings and balloons. A few greeted students with roses while volunteers of some NGOs welcomed them with masks. Due to the pandemic, this year’s examination had been shortened and is being conducted for two days (July 19 and 22) in an objective-type pattern. The first paper on core subjects was held from 10.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. The exam on July 22 will be on languages. The exam halls were sanitized. Only 12 students – one per desk – were allowed. Every student underwent thermal scanning and hand sanitization before entering the halls. The Health Department had roped in ASHAs and health workers to screen the students. Students showing symptoms like fever, cold, were sent to rooms reserved for this. Mysuru Deputy Director of Public Instruction Panduranga, who supervised the examination, said, “The examination went off smoothly and successfully. We had made elaborate arrangements for the safety of students. We had schooled them about the new exam pattern. Many confidence-building measures were planned at the school-level by teachers.” A 40-year-old private candidate was the lone COVID-19 infected to write the exam in the district. He wrote it at the COVID-19 Care Centre in the KSOU administrative building in Mandakalli on the outskirts of Mysuru. Nine students who had some health issues like cold, cough or fever, appeared for the exam conducted in special rooms at the centres. At each centre, a special room was kept ready to facilitate such students to write the exam individually. Five students had opted to stay in hostels to write the examination. As many as 242 students migrated to Mysuru from other districts to write examination. Some schools in the taluks too had specially decorated the exam centres to inspire students and oust fears. The government girl’s high school at Nanjangud was specially decorated with balloons and flower buntings to welcome the students. The school head and the teachers greeted the students and wished them all success.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/37339-students-write-sslc-exam/article35417852.ece
20 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||CIIL told to preserve indigenous languages||G. Hemantha Kumar, Vice-Chancellor, University of Mysore (UoM), on Monday said indigenous languages of Karnataka must be preserved so that a significant part of the State heritage is protected. There are 50 tribal languages in the State and it is important to document and describe them before they vanish, he said. Speaking as the guest of honour at the valedictory of 53rd Foundation Day celebrations of Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) held here virtually, Prof. Kumar said the CIIL through its ‘Scheme for Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages (SPPEL)’ has undertaken projects on Siddi, HakkiPikki and Soliga in the State that have less than 10,000 speakers with a goal of preparing dictionaries, grammars and ethnolinguistic sketches. Lesser-known languages “I have learnt that the dictionaries are about to be published. The institute should consider orthography development for some of the lesser-known languages of Karnataka,” he suggested. The V-C said India is a linguistic paradise and a treasure trove of languages. It is a nation widely acknowledged for its linguistic and cultural diversity. The contribution of CIIL in sustaining the diversity and promoting the languages of India has been commendable. It was one of the first institutions to document tribal and border languages, and bring out dictionaries of many languages that were not known to the rest of the world. He said the institute has played an active role towards the development of Indian languages besides regularly advising and assisting the Union ad State governments in all language matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ciil-told-to-preserve-indigenous-languages/article35417441.ece

Adding fuel to speculation, Mr. Yediyurappa huddled with his confidants, which included Ministers Basavaraj Bommai and R. Ashok, over lunch at a star hotel in Bengaluru on Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Eshwarappa, while saying he believed Mr. Kateel when he said the clip was fake, also said that being a loyal party worker he would abide by any decision that the party takes. “It would not even pain me. I will be a Minister until the organisation asks me to. I am 72 years old now and it is evident that the organisation is giving opportunities to youngsters both in the party and in administration. If that is the party’s call, I will go,” he said, appealing against making Mr. Kateel a “scapegoat” on this issue. Amidst speculations and intense lobbying over alternative leadership if Mr. Yediyurappa is replaced, the person in the audio clip claiming the new Chief Minister will come from Delhi, has unsettled many “aspirants” in the State, sources said. Meanwhile, several Ministers, especially those who defected from the Congress and JD (S), are also anxious of their positions, if leadership change is effected in the State. The visit of Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot to New Delhi amidst these developments has further added to speculations of leadership change.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/clip-rips-apart-confidence-in-bsy-camp/article35417451.ece
20 July 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Technology to make biogas from water hyacinth||The Centre for Research on Aquatic Resources (CRAR) of Sanatana Dharma (SD) College here has joined hands with two social entrepreneurs to popularise a technology used to produce biogas from water hyacinth. A demonstration titled Paayal Jwaala showcasing water hyacinth based biogas production was recently inaugurated by Agriculture Minister P. Prasad at Cherthala. “Water hyacinth is considered as one of the most troublesome aquatic plants. However, several economic benefits could be derived from the invasive weed. Biogas generation utilising water hyacinth is one among them. We can generate around two hours of biogas from 2.5 kg of water hyacinth. A water hyacinth based biogas plant for households can be set up at a cost between Rs. 11,000 and Rs. 15,000,” said Anuroop G., a Thanneermukkom-based social entrepreneur. He is joined by Vinod Viverra Kanjirathinkal of Cherthala and EichhoTech, a student start-up based at SD College in popularising the concept. G. Nagendra Prabhu, principal investigator, CRAR, who suggested the idea and technologies said that even existing or defunct biogas plants could be utilised for generating biogas and slurry using water hyacinth. Other products Apart from biogas, briquettes made of the aquatic weed, for everyday household cooking, were also demonstrated. Other products showcased include two floating beds made of water hyacinth and other aquatic weeds for cultivating Amaranth and similar edible plants; a mechanical shredder for cutting and chopping water hyacinth; digester for producing biogas; and a briquetting machine for compacting dried weeds into blocks of fuel. Mr. Prabhu said the slurry produced from the digester was a valuable byproduct, which could also be marketed. The slurry is currently being tested in the fields of Sanumon, a young farmer from Kanjikuzhi. The shredder and briquetting machine were developed under the Rural Technology Project sanctioned to Mr. Prabhu by the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment. Support promised The Agriculture Minister who lauded the efforts of researchers, social entrepreneurs, students and farmers said that they would be provided all support. He promised to bring the technologies to the notice of the appropriate authorities in the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/from-menace-to-fuel-the-turnaround-story-of-water-hyacinth/article35417787.ece

20 July 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||When lotus blooms bring spring to the rooftop||Lotuses in full bloom in ponds and other waterbodies are not rare, but a sight to behold. Away from waterbodies, the floating beauties bloom on the rooftop too! Vinayachandran, a 29-year-old technician at the Cochin Shipyard, has transformed the terrace of his home at Mannarasala, near Haripad, into an aquatic garden, growing 46 hybrid lotus varieties. The youth, who rarely sells the flowers, says that it gives him an opportunity to understand the lotus and its diversity, which is a symbol of purity and spiritual enlightenment. The pick among his collection is Sahasradala Padmam (Ultimate Thousand Petal Lotus), which recently bloomed. The other varieties that adorn his terrace include Ranee Red, Bucha, Red Peony, Affection - 16, White Peony, and Feather Skirt. The price of tubers of these varieties range between Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 4,000. Still wants more Mr. Vinayachandran, who started setting up the garden more than a year ago, says he wants to expand it by growing as many varieties as possible. “My sheer love for lotus drove me to aquatic gardening. It all started by growing a local variety in a nearby pond. After it blossomed, I started buying seeds and tubers, some of them from North India, and planted them in plastic containers,” he says, adding that the flowering of Sahasradala Padmam was the biggest joy. As the water in the area contains relatively high levels of iron concentration, he uses purified water to grow the plants. A mixture of fertilizers is applied to assist the plants’ growth. “Lotus requires good sunlight, at least six hours a day. As I grow the plants in containers, it need to be filled with fresh water every two weeks. Once the plants are adapted to the environment they will easily survive,” says Mr. Vinayachandran.

20 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kumbalangi may lose sheen due to poor govt. support||At a time when the State government has expressed its keenness to have a tourism locale in every panchayat, fear is rife that Kumbalangi, India’s first model tourism village located in the suburbs of Kochi, may lose its sheen due to inadequate governmental support. The innumerable ethnic and sustainable tourism activities launched in the fishing hamlet, which helped it attain global fame, might fade into oblivion if the poor support continued, said K. Muralee Menon, former director of Hydrel Tourism, who readied an action plan and helped implement it in Kumbalangi. Shortly after it was declared a model tourism village in 2003, surviving competition from 37 village tourism initiatives from across India, tourists began thronging the locale surrounded by backwaters, where the iconic Chinese fishing nets come alive after dusk, to participate in experiential-tourism activities and to savour the ethnic seafood cuisine. They included backpackers and high-end tourists who arrived in cruise ships that called at Kochi. Panchayat’s support Mr. Menon, who is the first doctorate holder in tourism from Kerala, was appointed project manager of the locale at a time when few in India knew what a model tourism village was. “The project became a romping success back then, due to the wholehearted support extended by the Kumbalangi panchayat,” he said. He recalled how efforts were taken about 20 years ago to take the village “back by a few decades”, in order to ready a typical village experience for tourists. “I told the panchayat and stakeholders concerned to tidy the locale, since considerable waste was being dumped into the backwaters. On coming to know that a few hundred families there did not have toilets, bio-toilets were supplied to 150 of them. About 900 biogas units were distributed to families, wherein energy from kitchen waste supplied fuel for cooking. Its slurry was used for kitchen gardens. “A few years after the model tourism village project kicked off, a new coalition came to power in the State. Rather than help sustain a national award-winning project, it began to be ignored, and the locale’s downfall began,” said Mr. Menon, adding that the State government must revisit Kumbalangi. ‘Project incomplete’ Former president of Kumbalangi panchayat M.P. Sivadattan said that only 15% of the project’s components was over 18 years since its launch. “This is mainly due to inadequate government support and changing of project managers,” he said. Referring to the effort that went into the initiative, he spoke of how elderly Chavittunatakam artistes were roped in to train youth in the dying art form. “Likewise, elderly women trained others in making delicacies unique to the area, in weaving coconut fronds, a practice that was on the verge of extinction, and in making coir from coconut husk. Toddy tapping and fishing practices too were revived, while women dressed in rouka , a traditional dress, welcomed guests. All these became an instant hit with tourists. Around 15% of the people were carpenters who built boats and also houses in the nalukettu style. All this furthered the cause of integrated and sustainable tourism,” said Mr. Sivadattan.

The service, operated by Round the Coast Private Limited, resumes short sea container shipping services connecting Vallaraparam International Container Transshipment Terminal, Beypore, and Azhikkal ports on the Malabar coast. Forty containers were delivered at the port by the service flagged off from Kochi terminal. It carried tiles, textile items, sanitary wares and plywood. The resumption of the container service comes after a gap of more than two-and-a-half years and was reintroduced after persistent demand from exporters and trade and business community as they felt the movement of containers on road was costly and took too much time. Talks to be held The Kerala Exporters’ Forum will hold a discussion on the prospects of coastal shipping in the background of the “Green Freight Corridor Short Sea Shipping”, which links minor ports in the State with the Vallarpadam international terminal on August 6. State Port Secretary Tinku Biswal, CEO of Cochin Port Trust M. Beena, and CEO of the Maritime Board, Salim Kumar, are among those expected to participate in the dicussions. The Exporters’ Forum sources said that around 10,000 containers were headed for the Malabar area from States like Gujarat while wheat and other grains were transported to Mundra port and then shipped to Kerala ports. The forum feels that the working of the minor ports in the State should be upgraded and the cost of labour reduced to increase the movement of coastal cargo. In a recent memorandum to State Ports Minister Ahammed Devarkovil, the forum said that Beypore could develop into a satellite port for Kochi and that work on dredging the Beypore and Azheekkal ports for obtaining eight metre of draft should be carried out and work on extension of the wharf completed at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/short-sea-shipping-gets-fillip/article35417756.ece

20 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Existing self-financing courses in aided colleges can continue||The Higher Education Department has clarified that its position before the Supreme Court on not sanctioning self-financing courses in aided colleges will not affect the existing unaided programmes in such institutions. In its response to a petition by the Kerala Arts and Science Unaided College Managements Association, the government informed the Supreme Court recently that its policy was not to sanction new self-financing courses in aided colleges. Counsel for the government had stated that Bachelor of Vocational Courses were sanctioned in aided colleges as per the University Grants Commission guidelines, but the government policy is that no self-financing courses would be sanctioned in aided colleges. On whether the government’s stance would affect the existing self-financing programmes in aided colleges, Minister for Higher Education R. Bindu said the government had only stated its policy. “We have not said that the existing self-financing programmes should be discontinued,” she said. NOC renewal The government issues no-objection certificates (NOC) for the unaided programmes based on an undertaking by the higher educational institution that it would abide by the norms. It is renewed every year based on the application submitted by the institution. The universities appoint inspection commissions to check the academic and infrastructure facilities on the campus. The colleges get provisional affiliation for the unaided courses every academic year. High Court order The forum of unaided colleges had approached the Supreme Court against a High Court order in September 2014 that upheld the decision of the then government and the universities to allow unaided courses in aided colleges in the State. The High Court stated there was no restriction on the power of the universities and the government to sanction new courses in unaided stream in an existing college. The association said that the interest of students doing aided courses in the aided sector would be in peril if the facilities were shared by students enrolled in self-financing courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/existing-self-financing-courses-in-aided-colleges-can-continue/article35417816.ece

While exhorting the Youth Congress to shift its focus to combating the pandemic, office bearers of the Academy said the activists were unduly training their gun on the workshop organised to create awareness among children about COVID-19 prevention. Proud legacy That the incident occurred in a State from where cartoonist Shankar hailed was deplorable, said Academy chairman K. Unnikrishnan and camp coordinator Sudheer Nath. That the activists of an organisation that took pride in the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru who had once told Shankar not to spare him in his cartoons spoke volumes, they added. The Academy had organised ‘cartoon walls’ in all 14 districts of the State, jointly with the Social Security Mission. This was followed by shortlisting 12 cartoonists from Kerala to sketch cartoons to create awareness among children. The two-day event was organised in adherence with the COVID-19 protocol. The disruption by Youth Congress activists, comprising many who were not wearing masks, was a blot on the event. The police had registered a case, said Mr. Nath. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, General Education Principal Secretary Mohammed Hanish, and doctors were among those who had visited the cartoonists on Saturday and Sunday when the workshop was on. The allegation by the activists that the Academy did not extend support to the family of cartoonist Ibrahim Badusha, who died a month ago, was contrary to facts. A condolence meeting was held a few days after his death, said Mr. Nath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-cartoon-academy-flays-disruption-of-workshop/article35417743.ece

The agency gave an account of the suspected involvement of Ayanki in the smuggling operations in a statement filed before the Economic Offences court, Ernakulam, while opposing his bail plea on Monday. Investigations revealed that Ayanki was actively involved in the smuggling of gold through various airports across Kerala and also in abducting carriers of other smuggling gangs. He used to threaten the carriers by using the names of two convicts sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case. Probe on Investigation was progressing to verify the veracity of his claims regarding the role of the two convicts in the gold smuggling case, the Customs submitted. As most of the witnesses and other abettors were also from Kannur, there was a high chance of the accused hindering the smooth conduct of the investigation by influencing the witnesses and tampering of evidence, it submitted.

Rajeeve on Monday said the government was keen on promoting responsible investment and industries. If the existing rules and regulations were outdated, complicated or irrelevant, it could be brought to the notice of a three-member committee appointed by the government, said the Minister, in an interaction with the investors here on Monday. The committee, he said, had been directed to examine the issues plaguing the industrial sector and submit a report within three months. Mr. Rajeeve also promised to bring in all possible changes on the basis of the report. “This government responds positively to all the suggestions, comments and criticisms of the investor community. Although the key procedures in connection with the granting of licences to industrial ventures rest with other departments, it is the Industries Department that receives the complaints in this connection. It is in this context that the government has decided to implement a statutory grievance address mechanism,” said the Minister. Law reforms A Bill on the system, which would deal with the issue of permissions relating to the operation, modernisation and diversification of industries would soon be introduced in the Assembly. Plans were also afoot to introduce another Bill based on the recommendations of the Law Reforms Commission headed by jurist K.T. Thomas to decide on the outdated laws, he said.

Street drew the ire of a large number of local traders on the second day of relaxed lockdown regulations in Kozhikode city on Monday. Over 100 street traders gathered at the spot and collectively resisted the police move, claiming that the “illogical restrictions” would kill their livelihood. The police argued that the entry of street traders caused an unhealthy rush on the street and interrupted customers’ movement. They also claimed that there was no official order from the government permitting street vending during the pandemic. Meanwhile, representatives of Street Traders Association said only licensed traders were conducting business on S.M. Street, and that they were behind the current fame of the commercial centre. The association leaders accused the police of enforcing “unkind and one-sided rules” to suppress the ailing section. “We don’t know the logic behind the inhuman regulations. The police have been guarding every nook and cranny of the city to prevent street traders from conducting business. We are here after obtaining licence from the corporation authorities,” said V. Balan, a street vendor. However, mainstream traders organisations like the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti and the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Samiti declined to back street vendors. The functionaries of the two organisations endorsed the arguments of the police that the presence of street traders led to overcrowding. “We have been opposing the presence of street traders on S.M. Street right from the beginning. In the current situation, their entry to the street is sure to create unwanted gatherings flouting physical distancing norms,” said KVVES State secretary K. Sethumadhavan. He also made it clear that no support would be offered to the ongoing protest by street traders against the police.

District office-bearers of the Kerala State Chicken Merchants Committee affiliated to the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Samiti told reporters here on Monday that retailers were being “persecuted” by the public and officials for no mistake of theirs. They said poultry merchants procured chicken at a higher rate from farms in Tamil Nadu. “Since farms in Kerala are unable to meet the demand, we are forced to procure chicken from Tamil Nadu,” Mustafa Kinasseri, district secretary of the committee, said. Traders in Kozhikode procure broiler chicken at Rs. 130 or more per kg, while dressed chicken is sold at around Rs. 240, he added. Alleging conspiracy by the “Tamil Nadu lobby” to destroy poultry business in Kerala, the office-bearers said merchants were willing to cooperate with the government if it fixed a unified price. They also demanded that officials keep a check on those selling dressed chicken at a much lower price, claiming that the meat might be stale. Committee district president K.V. Rashid said the police and food safety officials were forcing them to sell chicken at a much lower rate, and that it would cause huge loss to merchants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poultry-merchants-likely-to-shut-shop-after-bakrid/article35417727.ece
20 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Medical stipend norm may give room for misuse||The provision on stipend in the draft regulations for compulsory rotating internship has been termed to be vague as it could give ample room for private medical college managements to deny payment to MBBS interns. According to sources, the regulations were published by the National Medical Commission (NMC) on April 21. The provision on stipend states that “all interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate fee fixation authority as applicable to the institution/university/State”. Compulsory rotating internship is the mandatory one-year-service for medical graduates in hospitals attached to a medical college or any other approved teaching hospital. Public health professionals pointed out that a public notice by the Medical Council of India (MCI) on January 25, 2019, on Graduate Medical Education regulations had stated that “all the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State government medical institution/Central government medical institution in the State/Union Territory where the institution is located.” It was, however, not gazetted till the Board of Governors of the MCI was dissolved. The NMC replaced the MCI in September last year. K.V. Babu, Kannur-based public health expert, said it was unfair to entrust the fee fixation authority with the payment of stipend. He said the Kerala High Court, in an order on October 29, 2015, had directed PMS College of Dental Science and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, to pay stipend to BDS interns at the rate of what was being paid at government dental colleges. In a mail to NMC Chairman Suresh Chandra Sharma, Dr. Babu said the provision could be rephrased as follows: “All the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State Government Medical Institution/Central Government Medical Institution in the State/Union Territory where the institution is located.”  Long-pending demand to have a uniform stipend for interns across medical colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medical-stipend-norm-may-give-room-for-misuse/article35417731.ece

But all those spots are now filled beyond capacity, as the stock is not cleared regularly. If the situation persists, the streets of Kozhikode will soon be filled with plastic waste,” S.K. Aboobakker, corporation councillor representing Valiyangadi division, said. The plant at West Hill is solely devoted to plastic swept up by the corporation’s cleaning staff from the streets, while waste collected from households and establishments by the Haritha Karma Sena is taken to the plant at Njeliyanparamba. “Both the plants are filled beyond capacity. We need a permanent solution to the issue,” Mr. Aboobakker said. He claimed that despite presenting the matter in the corporation council, he was yet to get a satisfactory reply. On the other hand, Corporation Health Officer R.S. Gopakumar said the collected waste was being cleared slowly but agreed that the plants were filled beyond capacity. Overloading “Ever since the pandemic began, the use of plastic has gone up. People have also started dumping plastic on roadsides. This has led to overloading at the recycling plants,” he said. The corporation has plans to open two other recycling plants in the city. A plot has been identified for one plant next to the existing plant at West Hill, while the second one is yet to be identified. However, the process is slow, Mr. Aboobakker said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-has-a-hard-time-managing-mounting-plastic-waste/article35417726.ece

The protesters alleged that the Revenue authorities and the district administration were indifferent to the concerns of the underprivileged families comprising around 25 members who had been accommodated in a temporary relief camp near West Hill. K. Shybu, a local action committee leader, said six out of the 12 families recently relocated themselves to their relatives’ houses due to poor facilities at the camp. The remaining six families had no such option, and that they were forced to stay back in the camp, he said. A few residents of the camp complained they were not getting proper food or medical treatment. “We were shifted to the camp nearly two months ago with an assurance that the damaged houses would be rebuilt, but nothing has happened till date,” they said.

Habeeb Rahman, 46, and Kalathingal Shajahan, 43, were nabbed after a week-long inquiry by Crime branch sleuths. According to the police, the plan of the Kozhikode natives was to pocket a huge sum in the name of a Maoist organisation for business purposes. Three cases had been registered at various city police stations on petitions filed by the targeted industrialists. The investigation team initially verified the source of the letters after examining CCTV footage from various locations. One of the vehicles used by the two was caught on camera which helped the squad crack the case. An anti-Naxal squad was also part of the investigation in the first phase. It was Habeeb Rahman, an accused in several financial irregularities, who reportedly prepared the letters in the name of Maoists. He had reportedly downloaded a number of Maoist posters to imitate the style in the letters. Some documents were recovered by the investigation team during surprise inspections in flats and apartment buildings owned by the two on Sunday. According to the police, he had posted four such letters from Wayanad district. The industrialists from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts were asked to pay Rs. 11 crore. He also contacted them over phone to confirm acknowledgement of the letters and prompt them to make the payment to avoid retaliatory actions. The case was investigated by a team of officials led by Crime Branch Assistant Commissioner T.P. Sreejith. Members of the Kozhikode city crime squad were also part of the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-held-for-bid-to-extort-money-in-maoists-name/article35417739.ece

A crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs. 18 crore to save the life of the little child is inching towards fulfilment from the halfway mark. The child’s parents are fervently seeking the kindness of philanthropists even as Imran is fighting the debilitating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disease affecting the central nervous system, with ventilator support at the Government Medical College, Kozhikode. Only a crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs. 18 crore to save the life of the little child is inching towards fulfilment from the can save Imran. But this rare medicine costs Rs. 18 crore. Crowdfunding remains the only way out to raise that amount to save a life. Philanthropists showed that it was no big deal when an 18-month-old boy from Kannur needed that amount to save his life from SMA a couple of weeks ago. The Kannur boy had got Rs. 18 crore in less than a week. Imran’s parents, Arif and Mariyumma from Valambur near Perinthalmanna, said they had got Rs. 9 crore so far and they needed as much amount to import Zolgensma, the life-saving injection manufactured by the Swiss firm Novartis. Arif and Mariyumma have been on a desperate drive knocking on many doors since Imran, their third child, began to show signs of SMA 17 days after his birth. Their second child Liana had succumbed to SMA on the 72nd day after her birth. Their first child Tiana is healthy and four years old. HC approached Imran’s parents’ cry for help was not heard by those in the echelons of power in the State. They approached the High Court for help. The government responded only when the 14th time the court took up Imran’s case for hearing. As per the court’s order, the government appointed a medical team to report the child’s condition. Armed with the court’s green signal, local people under the leadership of Manjalamkuzhi Ali, MLA, formed a committee and went about raising money through crowdfunding.  The crowdfunding account for Imran is with the Federal Bank, Mankada. The account number is 16320100118821, and the IFSC code is FDRLo001632.

20 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Pact for $125-million WB aid||The Centre, the State government and the World Bank (WB) on Monday inked an agreement for a $125-million assistance for supporting Kerala’s preparedness against natural disasters, climate change, disease outbreaks and pandemics. The Resilient Kerala programme focusses on two key areas — incorporating disaster risk planning in the master plans of local bodies, and making the health, water resources management, agriculture and road sectors more resilient to calamities. The $125-million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a final maturity of 14 years, including a grace period of six years. The World Bank Board of Executive Directors had cleared the proposal in June. Signatories The agreement was signed by Rajat Kumar Mishra, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, on behalf of the Government of India; Rajesh Kumar Singh, Additional Chief Secretary for the Government of Kerala; and Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, India, for the World Bank. The Resilient Kerala programme “will help institutionalise disaster preparedness across various sectors to ensure a resilient recovery and sustainable development pathway for the State,” the Department of Economic Affairs, Union Ministry of Finance, noted. “The objective is not to finance schemes but partner with the Government of Kerala to improve the State’s financial health; invest in sectors such as health, water resources, social protection and agriculture; and address the drivers of natural disasters, climate change, and pandemic risks,” Mr. Ahmad said. Supports to key sectors under the initiative include establishing a debt management unit in the Finance Department to support the State’s efforts to scale down its debt-to-GSDP ratio to a sustainable trajectory, developing a comprehensive disaster risk financing framework and disaster and climate-resilient urban development. Building resilient public health and food systems, an integrated and sustainable water resources management system and climate-resilient road infrastructure are other highlights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pact-for-125-million-wb-aid/article35417811.ece
20 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||IT tool helps KWA check site suitability||The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has come up with a tool for exploring suitable locations for large facilities such as sewage treatment plants (STP) by using the Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing technologies. The GIS-based Optimal Sites Selection for a sewage treatment plant is one of seven IT-based solutions of the KWA launched by Minister for Water Resources Roshy Augustine. The tool has been developed as part of the GIS-related initiatives launched by the water utility. As an IT-based tool, it has ‘acceptable accuracy’ in the planning stages of a project, saves time and money and requires considerably less human resources than conventional methods, according to the KWA. While it is not meant to entirely replace field inspections and validation, GIS-based site selection can be an effective tool in the planning stages and aids faster decision-making. In a nutshell, data available on open sources and satellite imagery are used to determine the suitability of a site by gauging the population density of a region and its topographical characteristics such as elevation, slope and distances from waterbodies, roads and buildings. This is applied to the stringent criteria for establishing STPs to determine if the site is suitable or not. Cheaper method The KWA's GIS-based tool uses latest data available on open-source platforms. It was tried out successfully at Elamkulam in Ernakulam district where the State-run water utility has an STP, according to officials. Conventional methods of site selection involve collection of topographical, environmental, economic and sociopolitical data and its analysis, which can be time-consuming, laborious and expensive. The present innovation incurs just 6% of the time and 4% of the cost when compared to conventional site exploration methods, the KWA said. ''Though field validation is a must, GIS-based STP site selection is an innovative tool in the arsenal of planners for creating better sustainable development solutions,'' notes the KWA.  It uses open-sources data, satellite imagery to explore sites||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kwas-digital-tool-aids-project-planning/article35417930.ece

Though the mills were re-opened on March 31 this year, after a year of remaining shuttered due to COVID-19, these were closed again on June 15. The management has now informed that the apprentice workers who enjoy the same benefits as permanent workers will no longer receive their salary from June. Even when the mill reopened temporarily, the contract workers were not asked to return to work. Many of them, who have worked in the mills for decades, survive now doing odd jobs. “The NTC has not taken any efforts to supply raw materials(cotton and polyester) to the mill continuously. The management informed all the workers on June 15 that they need not come to the mill and that they will get only half of the remuneration during the period, due to shortage of raw material. We have been receiving only a percentage of our salaries since the outbreak of the pandemic. Now, we haven’t received the salary of June at all,” says M.T. Antony, Secretary, Trivandrum Textile Workers' Union (CITU) The 23 spinning mills of the NTC, under the Union Textile Ministry, remained closed over a year since March 2020, with no steps being taken to make them functional even after the Centre gave permission for factories and industries to open in May. The Corporation has been maintaining that the mills will function normally once the large pile of unsold yarn stock is sold off. Post the lockdown last year, the salary was first cut by 25%, by 40% the next month and by 60% in May. The Vijayamohini mill here was reopened in March following 203 days of indefinite strike by employees. All the major trade unions, including CITU, INTUC and BMS, were part of the joint protest, demanding the reopening of the mills. The unions have been alleged that the Union government is planning to gradually shut down the mills by keeping them non-functional and by cutting their salaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/uncertainty-continues-at-ntcs-mills/article35417800.ece

The move followed inspections by senior officials including Chief Wildlife Warden Bennichen Thomas and a team of veterinarians led by Chief Forest Veterinary Officer Arun Zachariah last week. It was generally felt the hectic activities undertaken as part of the Rs. 105-crore project could possibly impact the recovery of the infected animals, sources said. Two calves, Sreekutty (one-and-a-half years) and Arjun (four-and-a-half years), had succumbed to elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus (EEHV) in the centre. Since the latter’s death around 10 days ago, forest veterinarians had managed to prevent more casualties despite three more contracting the infection. Among them, Amena and Podichi, two female calves, recently tested negative, while two-and-a-half-year-old Kannan continued to battle for life. Despite showing slight improvement, his condition remained critical. Forest veterinary officer Shiju S.V. said the calf had been anaemic after suffering much blood loss during the initial stages of the infection. However, cyanosis that indicated low levels of oxygen in the Central arterial blood was no longer seen. “Besides the anti-viral drug pamcyclovir, we have been administering antibiotics considering the possibility to infection. Iron supplements are also being provided to increase its red blood cell levels,” he said. Dr. Shiju added that food consumption had gradually increased over the last few days, but the animal remained sluggish. It consistently tested positive for EEHV during tests conducted recently. While the department has not carried out epidemiology studies to detect the source of transmission, there is strong possibility that the infection was transmitted by an adult elephant in the centre. The camp has been placed under strict protocol with mahouts being designated for each infected animals. Calves in the facility were also quarantined to prevent them from coming in close proximity with the other inmates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-suspends-rs-105-cr-works-in-herpes-hit-kottoor-camp/article35417944.ece

20 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Traders’ forum urges CM to convene SLBC||Retail traders have urged Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to convene the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) urgently. Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samathi (KVVES) State president Joby V. Chunkath said here on Monday that most retailers in the State had turned debtors due to the COVID-19 lockdown and consequent loss of business. Commercial banks now reckon retailers as defaulters with a dismal credit rating. They have turned their loan accounts into non-performing assets. Retailers seek financial assistance to put their pandemic-cratered businesses back on track. The retailers are at their wit’s end. They urge the government to negotiate with banks on their behalf. The KVVES requested the government to convince the banks not to declare their loan accounts as non-performing assets. The traders’ forum urged the government to convince the banks to restructure their loans and to distribute the loans promised in the State’s Rs. 20,000-crore COVID-19 relief package announced in the previous Budget. It also requested the government to consider only localities with an average test positivity rate above 30% as critical spread warranting lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-forum-urges-cm-to-convene-slbc/article35417956.ece

Protests against the Narendra Modi-led BJP government were organised outside 1,000 Central government institutions in the State including the Raj Bhavan, where a 11-point ‘chargesheet’ was read out. The protests were a prelude to the nationwide strike called by power sector organisations on August 10. The move to de-licence and open up power distribution would benefit the corporates alone, imperilling the ordinary consumer, NCCOEEE said. Inaugurating the protest organised in front of the Raj Bhavan, CITU State president Ananthalavattom Anandan urged the people to fight and defeat the proposed electricity reforms which, he said, was part of the broad privatisation policies followed by the BJP government. Higher tariffs Opening up the distribution business to private companies would lead to higher tariffs for the ordinary consumer, he said. “Private players will in no way be accountable to the people as the state-run Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is. One should remember that the KSEB employees managed to restore full supply in the state within weeks of the devastation wreaked by the 2018 and 2019 floods. Can you expect that from a private company? The people will not accept anti-people laws,” Mr. Anandan said. The chargesheet accused the Modi government of allowing corporate monopolies free rein over energy resources including coals. The amendment would enable private monopolies to take control of the power supply business. It would lead to private companies ‘cherrypicking’ the high-end consumers, leaving the public sector to cater to the low-end consumers. Further, the cross-subsidy system designed to support the BPL and low-end consumers would vanish. The chargesheet accused the Centre of ignoring the spirit of federalism and usurping the States’ rights in matters related to electricity. It further charged the Modi government to using divisive tactics and sedition laws to suppress dissent and failing to address price rise, unemployment, and the economic downturn in a constructive manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/power-sector-staff-protest-against-bill/article35417798.ece

Andhra Pradesh will receive 52.69 tmcft of water from Tungabhadra dam in the 2021-22 water season. Last year, water was released from August 1, but with good inflows this time, the Tungabhadra Board decided to release water for Karnataka from July 18 and for A.P. from July 20. The inflows into Tungabhadra reservoir increased significantly from Saturday with 46,054 cusecs recorded compared to 11,800 cusecs the previous day. On Sunday, the inflows increased to 57,127 cusecs and on Monday it came down slightly to 44,199 cusecs. Water was released on Sunday to the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal that caters to the irrigation needs of farmers in Karnataka, but the Tungabhadra Left Bank High-Level Canal too will get water from July 25. Out of the total entitlement of Andhra Pradesh, the Tungabhadra High-Level Canal will get 25.755 tmcft, the Lower Level Canal will get 19.019 tmcft and the KC Canal will receive 7.925 tmcft. While the HLC is likely to receive 2,000 cusecs, the irrigation officials were preparing canals for not getting breach, HLC Superintending Engineer Nayakanti Rajasekhar said. The LLC will take 600 cusecs to begin with, according to the Irrigation Superintendent Engineer, Kurnool. The Tungabhadra Dam had got filled to its brim on July 19 in 2018 and water was released into the river, but last year by this day the total yield in the reservoir was only 28.55 tmcft and the total yield this year is 52.53 tmcft out of the estimated 160 tmcft for the entire season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-likely-to-get-water-from-tungabhadra-from-july-25/article35417383.ece
20 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Clip rips apart confidence in Yediyurappa camp||A 47-second audio clip, allegedly of Karnataka BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, created ripples in the political circles on Monday as it hinted at leadership change. Though Mr. Kateel denied it was his voice and sought a probe into the ‘fake’ clip, many party legislators, cutting across camps, took the contents at face value, triggering further speculation, disappointment and intense lobbying. In the purported clip, the person speaking in Tulu indicates there will be leadership change, “three people are in the race and the next Chief Minister will come from Delhi”, and that “Jagadish Shettar and Eshwarappa’s teams will be removed from the Cabinet”. The audio clip created anxiety and panic in the Chief Minister’s camp, many of whom were confident till Sunday of Mr. B.S. Yediyurappa completing the full term. Some rushed to the Chief Minister’s residence. Adding fuel to speculation, Mr. Yediyurappa huddled with his confidants, which included Ministers Basavaraj Bommai and R. Ashok, over lunch at a star hotel in Bengaluru on Monday. Party’s call: Minister Mr. Eshwarappa, saying he believed Mr. Kateel’s claim, also said he would abide by the party decision. “It would not even pain me. I will be a Minister until the organisation asks me to. I am 72 years old now and it is evident that the organisation is giving opportunities to youngsters both in the party and in administration. If that is the party’s call, I will go,” he said. Meanwhile, several Ministers, especially those who defected from the Congress and the Janata Dal (S), are apprehensive of their future. They started questioning whether there was any truth in the clip and some rushed to the Chief Minister’s residence to clarify. Adding fuel to speculation, Mr. Yediyurappa huddled with his confidants, which included Ministers Basavaraj Bommai and R. Ashok, over lunch at a star hotel in Bengaluru on Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Eshwarappa, while saying he believed Mr. Kateel when he said the clip was fake, also said that being a loyal party worker he would abide by any decision that the party takes. “It would not even pain me. I will be a Minister until the organisation asks me to. I am 72 years old now and it is evident that the organisation is giving opportunities to youngsters both in the party and in administration. If that is the party’s call, I will go,” he said, appealing against making Mr. Kateel a “scapegoat” on this issue. Amidst speculations and intense lobbying over alternative leadership if Mr. Yediyurappa is replaced, the person in the audio clip claiming the new Chief Minister will come from Delhi, has unsettled many “aspirants” in the State, sources said. Meanwhile, several Ministers, especially those who defected from the Congress and Janata Dal (S), are also anxious of their positions, if leadership change is effected in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/clip-rips-apart-confidence-in-yediyurappa-camp/article35417329.ece
20 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||K’taka sees dip in mucor cases||With the second wave of COVID-19 subsiding, Karnataka is also witnessing a steady decline in mucormycosis cases. The State that added a total of 207 mucormycosis cases since July 5, has recorded only 51 cases in the last six days. Besides, there have been zero admissions in Bengaluru’s designated government hospitals in the last two days. As of Monday, the State has 3,588 cases of which 313 patients succumbed to the fungal infection. Bengaluru Urban, which contributes 31.8% (1,143) of the total caseload, reported 108 deaths. Kalaburagi, Dakshina Kannada, and Davangere follow Bengaluru Urban with 23, 21, and 20 deaths respectively. In terms of cases, Dharwad and Vijayapura are behind Bengaluru Urban with 281 and 220 cases respectively. Of the 1,143 cases in Bengaluru Urban, 589 are those being treated in designated government hospitals - 208 at Victoria Hospital, 375 at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, four at K.C. General, two at Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, and the remaining in private hospitals. Greater awareness Doctors, who attributed the fall in mucormycosis cases to the steady decline in new COVID-19 cases, said there is greater awareness about the post-COVID complication now. “Overuse, misuse and rampant use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is one of the main reasons for mucormycosis. With greater awareness, steroids are now being used judiciously. Moreover, patients are now reporting early and hence, the recovery rate of mucormycosis has also increased,” said K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman of Narayana Nethralaya, who is part of the State’s expert committee on mucormycosis. Bengaluru Urban district surgeon Ansar Ahmed, who is also the Medical Superintendent of Epidemic Diseases Hospital on Old Madras Road, said the designated government facilities for mucormycosis in Bengaluru had seen zero admissions and deaths in the last two days. “In June, mucormycosis patients were struggling to find beds due to the high number of cases reported on a daily basis. However, following intensified awareness by the Health Department, rampant use of steroids and antibiotics has reduced now,” he said. Sujatha B.L. Rathod, director of the State-run Minto Eye Hospital, who is also part of the expert committee, said the situation started stabilising since the beginning of July. “The number of new cases that had reduced to 2-3 a day then have now further reduced. Victoria Hospital that treats COVID-19 positive patients with mucormycosis has only nine in- patients now,” she said. Manoj Kumar H.V., Dean and Director of Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, which was the first designated hospital in the State for mucormycosis, said the number of in-patients had come down from 214 last week to 104. This hospital has been treating mucormycosis in post-COVID-19 patients. “We have shifted all the 104 to Charaka Hospital and have converted this ward for treatment of non-COVID-19 patients,” he added.    As of Monday, the State had 3,588 cases of which 313 patients succumbed to the fungal infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-sees-dip-in-mucormycosis-cases/article35417438.ece

All the women submitted the required testimonials and are eligible as per the conditions prescribed in the scheme documents. The government records that were obtained after a physical verification done by village volunteers say that three of them, M. Lakshmi Devi, M. Narayannamma, and M. Ramanjunamma, are dead. But this Correspondent found all three of them alive when he visited the viallge. Showing their Aadhaar cards, the three women told The Hindu that after they applied for the grant, volunteers had come for a physical verification. But the final report said they were dead and thus were ineligible for the assistance under the scheme. For M. Narayanamma, who is dependent on this grant and engages in daily labour for eking out her livelihood, the denial came as a shock. She argued her case at the village secretariat, but without any positive result. Two others, Nallabothula Rangamma and Chowdamma, were denied on the ground that they were paying GST and had 10 acres of land. “Let the volunteer show me the 10 acres of land registered in my name and I will not ask for assistance,” said Chowdamma, showing her passbook, which says the family has 2.1 acres of land. Local leader Kondapuram Divakar Reddy told The Hindu that he had brought this to the notice of the MPDO and DRDA Project Director also, but no solution was found so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-women-allege-denial-of-assistance-under-ysr-cheyutha/article35417379.ece

Karuna Kumar on Monday launched a poster campaign on COVID-19 awareness in rural areas, focusing on the remote and forest-fringe villages of Chittoor district. The Rural Organisation for Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES), with the support of an international NGO Children Believe, had brought in five sets of the campaign posters that highlight the importance of wearing facemasks, washing hands, using sanitisers, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated and maintaining physical distancing. Inaugurating the event at his chambers here, the DLSA secretary said the poster campaign was the need of the hour in the remote villages as the mood of relaxation was setting in, in the face of the threat of the COVID-19 third wave. Compared to the urban areas, there was a spurt in the COVID-19 cases in the rural areas in recent weeks. “Still, many in the rural pockets are reluctant to take the vaccination. The awareness campaigns would dispel fears among people, besides prompting them to adhere to the COVID protocols,” Mr. Karuna Kumar said. ROPES chairman K. Dhanasekharan said that the poster campaign would cover about 200 remote villages of Chittoor, Bangarupalem and Palamaner mandals. “In the coming weeks, the campaign would be extended to all over the district. The prime focus would be to display the posters at village secretariats, bus stops, government schools and hospitals,” he said, adding that pamphlets would also be distributed to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/poster-campaign-on-covid-guidelines-launched-in-villages/article35417386.ece

Jayaprakash Reddy, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, Mohammed Ali Shabbir and other senior leaders were placed under “house arrest”. “They were placed under house arrest to maintain law and order,” a senior police official told PTI. Mr. Reddy, in a letter addressed to the Lok Sabha Speaker, said he was ‘prevented’ from attending Parliament which violates the parliamentary privileges during the progress of the session. ‘Violation of rights’ According to him, he wanted to raise the issue in Parliament against the selling of government land at “throwaway prices to their relatives and TRS ruling party functionaries by the State government”.  “Despite knowing the fact that I have to attend the Parliament session which is scheduled from today and repeated requests to the officials concerned, the Telangana police at the instance of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao, Chief Secretary and the DGP have obstructed my discharge of duties as a parliamentarian to attend Parliament and voice the people’s concerns,” Mr. Reddy said in the letter. The TPCC chief also tweeted: “Fearing I will take up the Kokapet land sale scam in Parliament, the police at the instance of the CM and the DGP prevented me from attending the Parliament session. This is violation of my parliamentary privileges as an MP. No matter what @inctelangana will bring truth to light.” However, the ruling TRS had rejected the allegations made by Mr. Reddy and said the land auction was transparent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-cong-mp-under-house-arrest/article35417324.ece
20 July 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Civic staff cut through moat at Golconda Fort||The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation deployed an earthmover to cut through the Golconda Fort’s moat on its northern side Sunday. “We are creating a channel to drain the water from the Shahatam Cheruvu. The old channel is blocked due to which houses are flooded on the other side,” said a GHMC employee supervising the work. Chunks of the moat wall were strewn at the site on Monday after the earthmover was moved out of the site. The Golconda Fort is a nationally protected monument under the control of Archaeological Survey of India and no construction activity is permitted in the 100-metre radius from the monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act. “Please consider the humanitarian aspect. Many houses will get flooded if this is not cleared,” said Sanauddin, a GHMC official supervising work on Monday, who promised to show the No-Objection Certificate issued by ASI but did not. “We are cleaning the silt to restore the old channel,” said Mr. Sanauddin, but could not explain why an earthmover was required to clean silt in a clogged water channel. “They are saying they got the NOC from Delhi in March. I will have to check our documents,” said an ASI official. About 100 metres from the site of the old sluice gate, the GHMC has made another intervention by laying a pipeline to drain the water from the Shahatam Cheruvu and now water from the lake gushes into the Naya Qila raising froth and a foul odour. “Our houses will get flooded if this channel is not created. Our problem became worse after 2000. Every year our houses get flooded. In some areas the water rises to the second floor,” said a resident pointing to his house on the other side of the lake. Every monsoon is a trial by water for the residents of Nadeem Colony, Virasat Nagar, Raghava Colony, Vali Colony and other areas that have come up recently on the foreshore of the Shahatam Cheruvu. A big chunk of the land abutting the road has been reclaimed and is used by the Hyderabad Golf Club to park its vehicles. The lake has shrunk to nearly half the size from 70.8 acres to 40 acres in 2014. Many of the constructions are inside the full tank level. It is these constructions that get flooded whenever there is heavy rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/civic-staff-cut-through-moat-at-golconda-fort/article35417330.ece

20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka opposes river linking project by T.N.||Karnataka has approached the Supreme Court staking claim to 91 tmc ft of surplus water annually in the Cauvery Basin while opposing the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar (CVG) link project planned by Tamil Nadu for transferring 45 tmc ft of surplus water yearly. In an original suit, Karnataka averred that the Supreme Court, in a February 2016 judgment, had modified the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal decision to ensure 177.25 tmc ft of flows at the inter-State border, Biligundlu, in a normal water year for the benefit of Tamil Nadu. Karnataka, however, stated that after ensuring this share of 177.25 tmc ft and allowing Kerala to divert 21 tmc ft of flows in Kabini tributary, the remaining flows of 284.75 tmc ft and the surplus water of 91 tmc fell into its kitty. The State said the main reason for filing the suit was the CVG link planned by T.N. to transfer 45 tmc ft of surplus water. Karnataka said the project would compel an advance commitment of the surplus water, much to its own prejudice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-opposes-river-linking-project-by-tn/article35417322.ece

The report is being submitted to ensure that the disputes between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana over water sharing do not escalate again, Mr. Veerraju said. “The BJP is in favour of construction of irrigation projects that are non-controversial and by linking various rivers. Political parties should refrain from politicising the disputes over sharing of river waters, lest the people, particularly farmers, face problems in the future,” Mr. Veerraju said at a roundtable on ‘Water Resources and Challenges’ here on Monday. The BJP leader said the party would also constitute a working group to undertake a comprehensive study of the projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers so that it can offer suggestions on the sharing of water by upper and lower riparian States. He asserted that the gazette notification on KRMB and GRMB would facilitate an amicable settlement of the disputes between A.P. and Telangana and that it would do justice to Rayalaseema and the coastal districts. “Bringing of projects on the Krishna and Godavari under the purview of the respective boards would prevent illegal withdrawals of water,” Mr. Veerraju affirmed. Mr. Veerraju criticised the State government for allegedly neglecting the thousands of families facing displacement by the Polavaram project. Polavaram project He expressed regret that they were forced to live in unclean shelters without electricity and drinking water facilities due to the government’s alleged failure in implementing the Relief and Rehabilitation package. “The government is obsessed with the Polavaram project while projects like Handri-Neeva, Velugonda, Telugu Ganga, Vamsadhara, Thotapalli, Nagavali and Bahuda remain incomplete several decades after their commencement,” he alleged. Retired chief engineer U. Narayana Raju said the Polavaram project was crucial for meeting the drinking water requirements of the people of Visakhapatnam, and observed that Telangana was making wrong claims on the catchment areas of some rivers. Former MLA Byreddi Rajasekhara Reddy said Rayalaseema would be saved only if a minimum water level of 854 feet was maintained in the Srisailam project, and questioned how the government proceeded with the Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme without having a reservoir component in it. The Tungabhadra river was the lifeline of Rayalaseema, he added. BJP State party affairs co in-charge Sunil Deodhar, general secretary S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy, MLCs P.V.N.

The Rajya Sabha Chairman should, therefore, take up the issue for a debate, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy appealed. According to a press release by the YSRCP, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu acknowledged that the subject warranted a discussion, but he could not allow it at such a short notice, citing other important legislative business.

20 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||CSOs played stellar role in providing relief to migrant workers during lockdown: study||On March 25, 2020, a countrywide lockdown was declared by the Union government to curtail the chain of spread of COVID-19 virus. This resulted in a large-scale movement of informal migrant workers, who had been invisible so far, moving to their home town, braving all odds. This was the time, when the Civil Society Organisations (CSO), big or small, have come to the rescue of the migrants. Even the NITI Aayog had appealed to the CSOs to spread awareness about the disease and solicited support in providing necessary relief to the affected people. To study the role of the CSOs during the pandemic, Participatory Research in Asia (PRIA) and Voluntary Action Network India (VANI), along with other organisations such as Unnati, Centre for Youth and Social Development (CYSD), Samarthan and Sahbhagi Shikdhan Kendra, conducted a survey, across 26 States and collected data from over 570 CSOs, and have come to the conclusion that CSOs in India have lived up to their ideas and have played a stellar role in providing relief in multiple ways, despite being handicapped by severe fund crunch. In a document released to the government, Binoy Acharya, Executive Director, Unnati and Ahmedabad Chairperson of Voluntary Action Network India (VANI), stated that the Civil Society Organisations (CSO) in India, true to their values and principles came forward to provide food, water, temporary resting arrangement and first-aid to the migrant workers. In some places, they even provided footwear to the migrants, who were seen walking barefoot for miles on bitumen-topped NH roads, during peak summer. The study also revealed that the CSOs facilitated their passage across different State borders, so that they could reach their homes safely and reduce exposure to infection. The CSOs developed quarantine homes in the villages where these workers were provided the option of spending the first week or fortnight, after lockdown was imposed, with dignity, care and love, the study revealed. Second wave During the second wave that began from March 2021, the CSOs have played a different role by providing oximeter, facilitating vaccination and hospitalisation of the needy. As per the survey over 50 lakh families were benefited by the CSOs, across the country. As many as 78% of the respondent CSOs have distributed food; about 91% have provided personal hygiene materials such as masks, sanitisers, sanitary pads, and gloves and PPE kits both to the community as well as frontline workers. About 73% of the CSOs have provided various kinds of medical supplies, including medicines, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, and oximeters, and a few of them also arranged plasma and blood donors for the patients. Nearly 40% helped in hospitalisation of patients and arranged for COVID-19 tests. As per the survey report, the relief work was taken up and still continuing despite over 200 of the respondent CSO stating that their staff contracted the virus and at least 50 of them reporting occurrence of death among staff. The report also pointed out that the CSOs were hit badly by fund crunch, especially after the amendments to the Foreign Contribution Regulatory Act, 2020, had come into force. The report concludes urging Niti Aayog, which on behalf of the government had solicited support from the CSOs, needs to take a relook at financial and legal regulatory frameworks that constrict access to resources by the small and medium size organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/csos-played-stellar-role-in-providing-relief-to-migrant-workers-during-lockdown-study/article35417882.ece
20 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Proposed road network in draft plan flawed, say urban planners||The new draft Master Plan designed by the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) and hosted in the public domain for suggestions and objections, have been drawing mixed reactions from various senior architects, urban planners, public and Opposition parties. Apart from the main criticism that the plan was uploaded in the public domain in the online platform, which is cumbersome to download, and the time given for response during the COVID pandemic was very short, urban planners say that new road network proposed is flawed and needs a serious relook. A senior urban planner said that the road network appears to be superimposed on Google map without conducting a detailed field survey. Substantiating his claim, he pointed out that the road network was not aligned with the earlier master plan roads. “There are a few roads that cut across the existing master plan roads or overlap them or just run parallel to them. This indicates, that it lack adequate field survey,” he said. Another senior architect pointed out that a couple of roads run across water bodies and one such is found in Boyapalem area. He said that as per the new Master Plan, a road cuts across the campus of a prominent national institute, that is coming up on the city outskirts. “We do not understand whether these are mistakes or such things are planned. There are also roads, which have been widened beyond understanding, as the area through which the roads run, neither justify the population nor vehicle density,” they said. Former BJP MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju pointed out that zoning also has some issues, as hills have been designated as plain lands and plain lands have been shown as hillocks. The entire Rushikonda Hill is missing in the new plan, he said. The urban planners are also of the opinion that keeping in mind the density of already prevalent industries, including hazardous ones within the city limits, the plan should have focussed more on investment outside this ‘bowl’ area. But instead, projects have been indicated in this area, which would only add up to the already existing issues such as traffic congestion, pollution and further enhancing demographic density. Mixed use Both the major road network and proposed metro rail network should have been proposed to run on the city periphery, alongside the rail network, said Y. Narasimha Rao, a senior architect. On the brighter side, the urban planners and architects say that the idea of mixed use of land, was a welcome move and it should benefit the city and its residents. Referring to the issues, a senior officer from the planning and design department in the VMRDA said, “It is only a draft plan and there may be some discrepancies. That is why, we have asked for suggestions and objections from people and stakeholders. We have also extended the date till July 31, for people to raise their objections and accordingly we shall look into them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/proposed-road-network-in-draft-plan-flawed/article35417960.ece

20 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Delta variant a cause for concern: experts||The COVID-19 variant B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant that caused havoc in the country and in the district, is still the variant of concern and if COVID protocols are not followed, it can still hit back in the form of third wave, if there is no further mutation. This was the opinion of the experts who addressed the 78th webinar on review of variants, vaccines, infection prevention and treatment, organised by the Andhra Medical College here on Sunday. Speaking at the webinar, Prathit A. Kulkarni, infectious disease specialist at Baylor St. Lukes Medical Centre, Texas, USA, said there are three basic types of variants — Variants of Interest which includes strains such as B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.3 that were earlier found in India, Variants of Concern such as B.1. 617.2 or the Delta variant that are found in India and the USA and Variants of High Consequences. According to him, VOC, which includes the Delta variant, is an area of concern and much of it is still in research stage and VOHC so far have not been found in the world, but research is on. Clearing the air on vaccines, he said people can take the vaccine immediately after completing the isolation period or after three to four months. But for people who were on monoclonal antibody therapy or were given convalescent plasma, it is better to wait for three or four months. He said that the effect of COVID virus is more on ageing persons and on those with underlying diseases. There is no vaccine for children below 12 years and from 12 to 18 years, the effect is normally mild. The virus can be harsh on children with obesity or on those with underlying diseases, he said. Kalpalatha Guntupalli, pulmonologist at Baylor St. Lukes Medical Centre, Texas, and P.V. Sudhakar, Principal, Andhra Medical College, spoke. One death, 77 new cases Meanwhile, the district recorded 77 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours ending Monday morning. This takes the total count to 1,51,590.

Such speeches resulted in violence ,” the government, represented by advocate Mahfooz A. Nazki, justified slapping sedition charges against the MP and the two channels. The government said Mr. Naidu played a key role in the “conspiracy”. “It is clear that all the strings were being pulled by TDP and its chiefChandrababu Naidu. The timing of the calls, the chats and the documents shared between RRKR and Chandrababu Naidu as well as Nara Lokesh, clearly point to a conspiracy against the YSRCP government … WhatsApp chats between RRKR and Chandrababu Naidu show the issues are taken up by RRKR only after approval of Chandrababu Naidu,” the affidavit said. The government said it “came across” several conversations between the top echelons of the channels, Mr. Raju and TDP members on “electronic platforms” to demonstrate that the parliamentarian’s speeches were “indeed” made in furtherance of a “well-designed conspiracy”. The Supreme Court had granted bail to Mr. Raju in May. The MP said his comments on various digital platforms against the State government had irked the ruling party. He had urged the top court to protect his fundamental right to speech and expression.

20 July 2021||Bengaluru,TELANGANA||In schools-parents tussle, many miss SSLC exam||Many students missed the SSLC examination that kicked off on Monday. The reason being some school managements denying admission tickets to students who were unable to pay the fees during the pandemic-hit year. S. Suresh Kumar, Primary and Secondary Education Minister, has said that appropriate action will be initiated if complaints are received against school managements. He also said that students who missed the examination will be allowed to appear for the supplementary exam as fresh candidates. Mr. Kumar said students were unable to get admission tickets for two reasons. “The school would have registered students for the examination and the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board would have issued the hall ticket, but the school would have refused to give students the ticket as they may not have paid fees. In such instances, students can approach the Block Education Officers. Many BEOs have interviewed and issued admission tickets using their login id,” he said. However, in many instances, the school has not registered the students as they did not pay fees. “In such instances, students will have to appear for the supplementary examination,” he said. The Minister said it came to his notice that 30 students of Mahatma Gandhi High School in Haveri were not given hall tickets despite paying the school fees. These students will be allowed to write the supplementary examination and be considered as fresh candidates. The Department of Primary and Secondary Education has sought a report from officials after the student of a private school in Dakshina Kannada had complained that the school was refusing to give her admission ticket as she had not paid fees.  In all the three core subjects, the percentage of candidates who appeared for the examination was higher than last year. As many as 99.64% of the 8,52,191 candidates registered for mathematics appeared on Monday. Last year, the turnout was 98.3%. A total of 99.62% of 8,43,976 students attempted the science paper - an increase from 98.36% last year. The social science paper was attempted by 99.65% of the registered 8,24,689 candidates against last year’s 98.43%. In many centres across the State, the school managements had decorated the school giving it a festive look. At some places, students were provided breakfast and lunch. Out of the 770 students who registered for the exam from neighbouring States, all except one were present. Vehicles were arranged by officials to pick them up from the border.  A fire was reported in Heera Public School at Babbukatte in Ullal due to a short circuit in the biology laboratory room around 10.50 a.m. All 208 students were moved to the opposite degree college where they wrote the exam. Students were given additional time. No one was injured. In some centres, there was water logging due to rain and civic officials were roped in.  Elsewhere, while teachers ensured that there was adequate physical distance in the centre and only one student per bench, social distancing was absent outside the centres. Although some centre heads asked the students to disperse, not many heeded to their advice. Exam easy With the change in the SSLC exam pattern this year, students found the core subjects easy as they attempted multiple-choice questions this year. Each subject carries 40 marks and the duration has been reduced to two days from the earlier one week due to the second wave. The Department of Primary and Secondary Education has said that all students who appear for the examination will be deemed as pass, but the students will be assessed based on their performance.

20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||IMA voices concern about gatherings in closed spaces||Citing predictions of an imminent third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Telangana have expressed concerns about gatherings in closed-door settings such as cinema halls, air-conditioned dining halls, pubs and bars. They have requested the State government to focus on this aspect and intensify the vaccination drive to ensure a vast majority of the population gets vaccinated, within a time frame. The number of people targeted to be given the jab in Telangana is over 2.2 crore. From January 16, when the vaccination drive began, till July 17, a little over 1.08 crore persons had received first dose of vaccine and 23.98 lakh the second dose. Two days ago, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao had also appealed to people participating in festivals, celebrations and other occasions to maintain COVID-appropriate behavior such as wearing masks, frequent hand sanitisation, and physical distancing. Stating his personal observations I, A-Telangana State president D. Lavakumar Reddy, in a press release, said over 60 doctors of from the State, across age groups, have died since the outbreak of the pandemic. He has requested the government to restrict mass gatherings for a few more months to prevent further damage.

20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||There is a threat to my life, alleges Eatala Rajender||Former Health Minister Eatala Rajender has alleged he had received information about a threat to his life during his ‘padayatra’ with a Minister from the district conspiring to join hands with criminals for the job. “I am not afraid. I did not flinch when notorious gangster Nayeem was after me. My people will see to it that not a fly comes near me,” he said on Monday. Addressing a gathering on the first day of his 25-day, 270 km walkathon, Mr. Rajendra charged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of unveiling ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme only to defeat him in Huzurabad bypoll. “Mr. Rao is running a government of Razakars. He remembers new schemes only during elections and does not want to explain why three acres were not given to dalits or houses not built as promised. I welcome the 'Dalit Bandhu', I demand the scheme be implemented in all constituencies to at least 10,000 dalits,” he said. The former Minister, now with the BJP, challenged Mr. Rao saying: If you have guts, implement the scheme for all poor families. He has woken up from slumber in his farmhouse and this scheme has come about because of my resignation - so I am happy, same goes with pensions also. He starts schemes for selfish gains, not because of any real love for people. Who knows him better than me. ‘No to slavery’ My family has always fought against oppression and hence I quit TRS not willing to tolerate slavery any more, he said. "This is a fight for justice. Take whatever the TRS offers but lend your support to me," appealed Mr. Rajender. Accusing the State government of trying to put hurdles in his path by threatening his supporters, he said the walkathon began only after taking all necessary permissions, hence it is the responsibility of the administration to ensure a smooth path, he said. The TRS leaders prompted by Mr. Rao have been resorting to "cheap tricks" to sabotage my plans because of the fear of losing the byelection, he said. "We have put our faith in justice and fair play, people will surely teach a lesson to those causing fear in them. The beginning of the end of Mr. Rao's dictatorial rule has begun and we will soon get rid of this regime as Dubbak will be repeated," he said. Mr. Rajender began his ‘padayatra’ after praying at the Anjaneya Swamy Temple at Bathinavani in Kamalapur mandal and prior to that his wife Jamuna applied 'tilak' on his forehead at his residence and also for fellow BJP leaders like Vivek Venkatswamy, former legislator E. Ravinder Reddy and others. Amid slogan shouting, the walkathon began and for the nearly a month, Mr. Rajender is expected to visit 127 villages of his constituency. Dubbak legislator M. Raghunandan Rao and other senior party senior leaders like G. Premender Reddy, K. Vijayarama Rao, Jitender Reddy and so on were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/there-is-a-threat-to-my-life-alleges-eatala-rajender/article35417704.ece
20 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||A new digital destination for music lovers||The online learning mode brought hope for those seeking to acquire a new skill during the pandemic. Muzigal, an online music learning platform, has opened an avenue for aspirants to renew their interest in music. Founded by Hyderabad-based businessman Lakshminarayana Yeluri, Muzigal connects nearly 400 music teachers and trainers with more than 10,000 active learners from five countries in all age groups. Launched last year, it is now the fastest-growing online music platform, growing at 20 per cent month-on-month in revenue and new learners. A 20-year entrepreneurial journey notwithstanding, Yeluri’s passion for music outweighs his business acumen. “Even before I was an entrepreneur, I was a music lover,” says Yeluri who learnt the mandolin from U. Srinivas’ uncle at the age of 10 but failed to find a tutor later as the family moved places owing to his father’s transferable job. Even when he started playing the guitar at the age of 28 while living in Visakhapatnam, he hadn’t found the right teacher. “After moving to Hyderabad, my search for tutors for my children was still not successful. I understood the bottlenecks from the parents’ point of view. As an entrepreneur, I figured out a solution. The pandemic gave us the right opportunity to put it in motion,” he says. Being a digital enabler with a first-hand experience in using technology to scale businesses, Yeluri created a comprehensive learning platform that would enable music students to learn non-stop. His goal was also to empower music teachers and tap the potential music space in India wherein thousands and lakhs of Indians who have learnt classical music but haven’t had the opportunity to showcase or monetise their skill. “Only the top 1% or 2% musicians are able to make it a full-fledged career. The rest of them are unable to use any of these digital facilities. That’s when I thought why not create a platformwhich music teachers in some remote home of India could also use? Muzigal is an overnight success of 20 years of planningand hard work.” Music courses are offered in Carnatic, Hindustani and western classical — both vocal and instrumental — and Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 is charged per class of 45-minute duration. A free trial class can be booked on appointment and eligible students can choose to have Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced levels of training. The teachers on Muzigal earn more than Rs. 50,000 a month, and the amount is only going to go up, informs Yeluri, adding that they are selected after three to four levels of skill assessment. “They can choose to teach part-time or full time, depending on their commitments. Students can pick a class as per their convenience as tutors are teaching at different time slots, levels and languages,” he adds. Interestingly, apart from the NRIs, Muzigal has native Americans enrolling to learn western instruments from Indian tutors. “That’s probably because we offer classes at a more competitive price than their local counterparts,” says Yeluri. Currently, the platform facilitates the certification process through these standardised boards, where the teachers teach the curriculum that prepares learners for examination. In a step forward, Yeluri informs, Muzigal will design its own standardised curriculum and create an assessment certification programme. Yeluri, who hails from Nakkapalli in Visakhapatnam, found it befitting to acknowledge and pay tribute to the Tamilian community by naming his platform Muzigal. “Muzigal is ‘Global academic for music Learning (GAL). I added ‘Z’ because it represents the Tamilians’ contribution to Indian music. They are the front runners and torch-bearers of classical music,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-new-digital-destination-for-music-lovers/article35417678.ece
20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ROBs and RUBs proposed at several places in city||The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has proposed construction of Roads Over Bridges (ROBs) or Roads Under Bridges (RUBs) at several locations across the city in order to find a solution for the ubiquitous traffic problems. Majority of these structures have been proposed where railway level crossings are causing huge delays in traffic flow, due to pile-up of vehicles at the crossings. Though not problematic initially when they were installed, the level crossings have become major obstruction to traffic after the city has spread to newer areas. The idea is to close the level crossings once the structures come up at the respective locations arching over the railway lines. This will allow free passage of vehicles, officials from GHMC informed. The locations Locations of level crossings where ROBs have been proposed include Moula-Ali, Malkajgiri, Safilguda, Kakatiya Nagar, Vinayak Nagar, Moula-Ali station, Patigadda, between Bolarum and Gundla Pochampally stations, near Suchitra and Venkatapurram in Old Alwal, between Falaknuma and Budvel, and near Rajbhavan and Khairatabad. Besides, there are also proposals to widen the ROB at Mettuguda, and for construction of RUB at Chilkalguda, and a vehicle under pass at Manikeshwari Nagar. The locations have been identified in coordination with the Railway officials, and the proposals await finalisation before tenders could be called and works handed over, officials informed.  While cost estimates are yet to be prepared, it is expected that the total expenditure could be in the vicinity of Rs. 1,000 crore. Wherever ROBs are to come up in the place of level crossings, the portion flying over the railway lines will be taken up by the Railways, while GHMC will only construct the ramps on both sides, officials informed. All the bridge cannot be taken up at once due to logistical inconvenience they would cause. Once the proposals are finalised, a few structures will be taken up each year, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/robs-and-rubs-proposed-at-several-places-in-city/article35417692.ece
20 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Narappa’ movie review: Venkatesh, Priyamani and Karthik Rathnam show their mettle in this faithful remake of ‘Asuran’||To talk about the most obvious aspects of Narappa , now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, it’s a faithful and nearly a frame-to-frame remake of the Tamil film Asuran (2019). With its story inspired by Poomani’s Tamil novel Vekkai (heat), Asuran was adapted to the screen by director Vetri Maaran, and influenced by the Kilvenmani massacre in Tamil Nadu in the late 1960s. Director Sreekanth Addala and actor Venkatesh Daggubati take up the poignant and personal story of the protagonist’s fight for dignity and keep it as close as possible to the original material. If you’ve watched Asuran , you can recall each scene, down to the dialogues and even the similar placement and movement of the actors on screen. Narappa works better if you haven’t watched Asuran (also streaming on the same platform) or can look past these similarities. The story can ring true in the context of caste and class conflicts in any part of India. A flashback in Narappa harks back to a time when the lower caste wearing footwear was frowned upon and triggered humiliating punishments. Times might have changed in Ramasagaram village in Anantapur; Narappa (Venkatesh) can now buy a pair of new footwear for his son without thinking twice, but the caste and social divide continues. The upper class has now put up an electric fence and eyes a three-acre land owned by Narappa’s family. In a broad sense, Narappa is a story of revenge and the leading man’s transformation is reminiscent of Rajinikanth in Baasha . It’s the quintessential masala film template with a rousing pre-intermission clash, but Narappa revels in its rustic and raw setting. The terrain adds a lot of charm to the narrative. The vast forest, cliffs and arid land play a crucial role in the chase and escape. The template of the fight between the privileged and the non-privileged might be familiar, but the little comments and observations peppered throughout the film keep us invested. The older son Munikanna (Karthik Rathnam in a rooted and effective portrayal) comments that it takes time to build and a fraction of it to pull down something; Sundaramma (Priyamani is effortlessly fiery  ) stating that she would have been happy if an act of violence had been done by the two grown-up men of the house and not her younger son; Narappa stating matter-of-factly that the brother in law (Rajeev Kanakala) has been spared for a reason, and much later emphasising that education is the only thing that cannot be snatched away in their fight for survival. In a telling scene, the adolescent son is inconsolable after the demise of the family’s pet dog that gets caught in the electric fence. Narappa remarks that he’s relieved the loss stopped with the pet dog and not the family members. The performances work to Narappa’s favour. Venkatesh is credible as the meek middle-aged man keen to save his family, Rao Ramesh is in sync as a lawyer advocating social change, and there’s Nasser, dependable as usual. Ammu Abhirami and Aadukalam Naren reprise their parts from the original, both managing to evoke the same emotions as before.

20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Revanth Reddy cautions police against ‘overenthusiasm’||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy has cautioned the police against exhibiting overenthusiasm such as not allowing Congress leaders, including him, to come out of their residences on Monday morning, when they planned a visit to Kokapet lands auctioned by the State government recently. On a call given by the Rangareddy unit of the Congress party, senior leaders had planned to stage a dharna at the Kokapet lands, which were auctioned two days ago. Alleging that the lands were auctioned by the government below the market price to favour a few influential realtors and politicians, Mr. Revanth Reddy had smelt a ‘scam’. As a precautionary measure, the police in full strength were stationed outside the houses of the Congress leaders. Mr. Revanth Reddy’s house in Jubilee Hills was teeming with police personnel waiting outside. The TPCC president, who is also the Congress MP from Malkajgiri was expected to leave for New Delhi to attend the monsoon session of the Parliament, which commenced on Monday. Protesting against the police action, Mr. Revanth Reddy dashed off a letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker complaining about how he was prevented from leaving his house for New Delhi to participate in the Parliament session. The police arrested TPCC working president Mahesh Kumar Goud, Rangareddy DCC chief Challa Narasimha Reddy, Kisan Congress chairman M.Kodanda Reddy and others and whisked them away to Gachibowli police station. Mahila Congress president Sunita Rao and others staged a dharna at Gandhi Statue on Gandhi Bhavan, the party headquarters denouncing the police action. Responding to a letter addressed by the Banjara Hills police to him on Monday, stating that they would not restrict the movement of the MP, including proceeding to Delhi to attend Parliament session, Mr. Reddy sought to know on whose tunes they are dancing to. Meanwhile, in a letter, the Banjara Hills police said: Police has no intention to prevent him from proceeding to New Delhi to attend Parliament session. However, the police presence at his residence is with regard to the call given by Congress party for a protest organised at Kokapet in Cyberabad limits for which the Cyberabad police has not given permission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-reddy-cautions-police-against-overenthusiasm/article35417708.ece
20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Doctors minimise blood loss during liver transplantation||A team of doctors at Kamineni Hospitals performed liver transplantation on a 49-year-old man restricting blood loss to 500 ml. “The transplant was performed with intraoperative blood loss of less than 500 ml, while not transfusing any blood, which is a benchmark difficult to surpass. The patient has since recovered and is set for discharge,” informed a press release issued by the hospital. The transplantation was performed on July 14. The patient hailing from Durg, Chhattisgarh, suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer of the liver. The doctors said restricting blood loss during surgery enables least compromise of the organ being operated on, and the post-operative complications are minimal and patient recovery is speedy. They added that ventilator support was not needed post surgery. The doctors’ team included Hepato biliary and Liver Transplant specialist Rajashekar Perumalla, medical gastroenterologist Kishan Nunsavata, Liver Transplant ICU specialist Biswaroop Pal, and surgical gastroenterologist Satyanayana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/doctors-minimise-blood-loss-during-organ-transplantation/article35417671.ece

Solomon, who participated virtually in the inauguration. Mr. Rao said Hyderabad is emerging as a key investment destination for the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) industry and home to the facilities of several Fortune 500 firms, which is a pointer to the strength of the innovation ecosystem nurtured by the State government. Goldman Sachs not only decided on Hyderabad after evaluating multiple locations, but also opted to launch a bigger operation than with the 500 employees it initially planned, the Minister said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/goldman-sachs-opens-office-in-hyderabad/article35417688.ece
20 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Reaching out to the underserved in North Telangana||The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a bane for many people suffering from other ailments with hospitals focussing on the coronavirus. But people in three north Telangana districts have relatively been at comfort with diagnostics and doctors brought to their doorstep, thanks to a diagnostics bus introduced by the Pratima Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) in Karimnagar. As a part of the PIMS initiative ‘Aarogyam Mee Mungitlo’ through the Pratima Foundation, state-of-the-art Volvo medical bus equipped with the latest diagnostic equipment have been introduced in Karimnagar, Warangal and Adilabad districts to diagnose non-communicable chronic diseases like cardiac-related diseases and cancer, and to also address chronic health problems. “So far, 500 camps have been organised in the villages since the services were launched during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic last year,” says PIMS director Harini Boinapally. “The effort is to take best medical facilities to the doorstep of people who can’t afford specialised medicare or who don’t even realise they need a check-up, particularly women who are increasingly getting prone to breast cancer,” the doctor adds. Two more buses The bus has diagnostic facilities including X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac profile (2D Echo), pap smear, mammography and a mini laboratory. Two more buses are being launched soon, Dr Harini says. The initiative has touched the lives of thousands of patients in the rural areas of Karimnagar, Adilabad and Warangal districts. Statistics reveal that 41.9% of people above 70 years and 50.3% of people in the age group of 40 to 69 years suffer from non-communicable diseases. An astonishingly 20% of the young population between 15 to 39 years too fall prey to these diseases. Adilabad, a tribal-dominated district, has a high mortality rate as well. The vast number of doctors, medicos and para-medical staff of the PIMS are engaged in the work. PIMS has 320 doctors, 223 PG doctors, 185 paramedical staff and 500 nursing staff. Engaging them in the three districts becomes easy as they are all within 50 km distance of the medical college, says Dr Harini. Village sarpanches are involved to ensure wider participation of people. Basic health check-up is done in the village first and based on the reports, the diagnostic buses are brought with senior doctors and specialists offering their input. Patients requiring further treatment are taken to PIMS or the nearest hospital. If the patients are not covered under the State government’s Aarogyasri’ scheme, PIMS extends complete support for treatment. Earlier, Prathima Foundation had organised a free camp in association with Healing Little Hearts Foundation wherein 100 children went through life-saving heart surgeries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/reaching-out-to-the-underserved-in-north-telangana/article35417699.ece
20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘TRS govt. pushing TS towards bankruptcy by selling assets’||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government is pushing Telangana towards bankruptcy by disposing of heritage resources such as land in and around Hyderabad, instead of creating wealth with the help of it, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy alleged here on Monday. While the governments in combined Andhra Pradesh always feared public wrath while planning to sell land, the TRS government is trying to give away precious lands to relatives and friends of those at helm of affairs, Mr. Reddy said addressing a press conference here. He sought to know why the TRS was resorting to sale of lands when it had vehemently opposed such attempts during combined A.P. On the recent auction of 50 acres of land in Kokapet, the TPCC president said the State government had given away land for Rs. 2,000 crore to friends and relatives of the ruling party in quid-pro-quo arrangement against the market value of over Rs. 3,000 crore. He stated that the entire process was irregular and a sham. In fact, the lands also included the house sites allotted to 210 Dalit families in 2007-08. However, the officers from Seemandhra region who were at helm of affairs then did not show the sites to beneficiaries except giving survey numbers during the Statehood movement, Mr. Reddy explained. Similarly in 2017-18, the State government had resumed 164 acres of land allotted to Golden Mile and other companies in 2006-07 and doled it out to those in close contact of the family in power in the State, he alleged. Citing another example, the TPCC chief said 7,621 square yards of land near IKEA showroom was regularised to four persons, considered close to the power wielding family. Another 164 acres land allotted to Unitech in survey numbers 285 to 288 in Badvel near Rajendranagar was also transferred to Prestige illegally in spite of Supreme Court directions to distribute the proceeds of sale of land allotted to Unitech among investors of the company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-govt-pushing-ts-towards-bankruptcy-by-selling-assets/article35417702.ece
20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||IPS officer’s VRS move triggers rumours of political entry||TS Social Welfare and Tribal Welfare Residential Educational Institutions secretary and senior IPS officer R.S. Praveen Kumar has announced quitting government service by seeking voluntary retirement on Monday, all of a sudden setting off speculations about his imminent jump into politics. Mr. Kumar belonged to 1995 batch of IPS and currently in the rank of Additional Director General of Police. He pioneered SWAEROES movement with a network of thousands of social welfare hostel students. SW stands for social welfare and AEROES — Greek for sky. “Sky is the limit” is the theme of the movement. He holds a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University. The IPS officer announced his exit via a tweet in the afternoon: “After 26 years of serving the motherland as an IPS officer, I have applied today for voluntary retirement to pursue my passion for social justice and equality with more vigour at my own pace. I thank you all for standing by me throughout my career.” It was followed up with a post — ‘Infinite Thanks’ in Telugu and English — where he stated that he was sharing his decision to voluntarily retire from government service with a heavy heart and joy. “I have mailed my request to the Chief Secretary. It was not easy to arrive at this life-changing decision, given my humble beginning and the arduous journey to become an IPS officer. However, the pure pleasure of following my passion hereafter has helped me overcome this uncertainty,” he said. The officer, longest serving secretary of the welfare educational institutions and also transforming them, first expressed his gratitude to his family and the governments of undivided Andhra Pradesh and Telangana “for enabling him to serve the weak, voiceless and undeserved of the country”. Then, he thanked the police and welfare departments, staff of the institutions, urging them to live by the oath taken daily about loving students as their own children. Students were told not to give up. “Future generations will judge my contribution to society” as there were several conspiracies too. Mr. Kumar vowed to dedicate “the rest of his life to unfinished dreams of doyens of social justice, Mahatma Phule, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Kanshiram and many more torch bearers”. He was not available for comment even as political and bureaucratic circles plus the social media began to discuss his next move, which party he would be join and why.  I vow to dedicate the rest of his life to unfinished dreams of doyens of social justice, Mahatma Phule, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Kanshiram and many more torch bearers. R.S.

20 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CPI(M) alleges irregularities in GHMC||Allegations of irregularities have been levelled against GHMC officials with regard to employment of outsourced workers in sanitation wing, and of misuse of power against Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi. City central committee of CPI(M) issued a statement on Monday, seeking enquiry into the irregularities. According to the allegations, supported by documentary evidence, three persons — two sanitation workers and a sanitation field assistant — have been removed from their duties with the “devious motive of employing the kin of workers in the Mayor’s household”. Sanitation worker V. Bharathi and her daughter and co-worker Rama Devi could not attend duties for close to a month as the former had been hospitalised in April due to COVID-19 infection, the note said. When they tried to report back to duty, officials told them that they had been removed, along with the SFA Saibaba, the party’s city secretary M.Srinivas alleged, demanding their reinstatement. A circular from the Khairatabad Zonal office with regard to replacement of Sanitation workers on medical grounds, directed for replacement of all the three, who are alleged to be mother of the car driver of Mayor’s father and veteran leader K. Keshava Rao, wife of Ms. Vijayalakshmi’s driver, and another TRS worker and Mayor’s follower. A rebuttal from GHMC said the two workers were absent for four months since January this year, and yet their biometrics were recorded by the Sanitation Field Assistant, which led to the sacking of all the three outsourcing staff. The rejoinder further denied their replacement with any other workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpim-alleges-irregularities-in-ghmc/article35417696.ece

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Nashik resident Ratan Luth over the delay by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in deciding on the 12 names recommended for MLC posts by the Maharashtra government.

20 July 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Stranded revellers rescued at Kharghar Hills||As many as 116 revellers, who were stranded on Kharghar Hills in Navi Mumbai, have been rescued by the police and the fire brigade since Sunday evening. Senior police inspector Shatrughan Mali from Kharghar police station said they started the rescue operations after one of the tourists informed the control room. Entry to Kharghar Hills and Pandavkada Falls has been banned since last month owing to drowning incidents and other accidents. However, on Sunday, the tourists managed to reach the hills in Sector 5. Following heavy rain, the police said, the water level in a stream behind the golf course increased and the tourists could not return. The fire brigade and the police had to put ladders across the stream to bring the revellers to safety. “We have been warning people to not venture out into the hills and the waterfall during monsoon. We have put up boards and there are police bandobast, but people find ways to reach the places. We have not taken any legal action against the tourists, but will do so from next time if there is any violation,” Mr. Mali said. Police and fire brigade personnel continue to look around the hill area to confirm if there are any more people stranded. 100 rescued in Belapur In related incidents on late Sunday evening, nearly 100 people were rescued at Artist village in Belapur and 150 people were rescued at Adavali near Koparkhairane.

20 July 2021||Kabul,||Global call for ‘end’ to Taliban offensive||More than a dozen diplomatic missions in Afghanistan on Monday called for “an urgent end” to the Taliban’s ruthless military offensive, saying it was at odds with claims they want to secure a political deal to end the conflict. The statement — signed by the U.S., EU, and more than a dozen other missions in Kabul — follows another round of inconclusive talks in Doha over the weekend between the Afghan government and the Taliban that many hoped would kickstart the ailing peace process. “The Taliban’s offensive is in direct contradiction to their claim to support a negotiated settlement,” it read. “It has resulted in loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through continued targeted killings, displacement of the civilian population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital infrastructure, and damage to communication networks.” For months, the two sides have been meeting on and off in the Qatari capital, but have achieved little, if any, notable success — with the discussions appearing to have lost momentum as the militants made enormous battlefield gains. A joint statement released late on Sunday said little more than they had agreed on the need to reach a “just solution”, and to meet again next week. “We also agreed that there should be no pause in the negotiations,” Abdullah Abdullah, who oversees the Afghan government’s delegation, said on Monday. No talks on truce He noted, however, that neither side was currently pursuing a joint ceasefire during the talks, despite urgent calls from Afghan civil society and the international community to end the surge in fighting. Ahead of the second day of talks, Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had said “the Islamic Emirate strenuously favours a political settlement” despite the groups lightning victories on the ground. Akhundzada has said his group remained committed to forging a solution to end the war, but slammed the group's opponents for "wasting time". But the Qatari facilitator of the talks said at the end of the two days that the sides had merely agreed to “work to prevent civilian casualties”, far short of previously agreed ceasefires. “The two sides agreed to continue negotiations at a high level until a settlement is reached. For this purpose, they will meet again next week,” said Qatar’s counter-terrorism envoy Mutlaq al-Qahtani who oversees the talks for Doha. Fighting continues Despite the latest round of shuttle diplomacy, fighting continued to flare in Afghanistan with both the Taliban and government making claims of taking and re-taking territory in various areas across the country. Despite coming days ahead of the Id-al-Adha holiday, the statement notably made no mention of a formal call for a ceasefire. Over the years, the Taliban have announced a series of short truces during Islamic holidays. However, the group has been criticised for using them to resupply and reinforce their fighters, allowing them to launch devastating onslaughts on Afghanistan’s security forces once the truces expire. With foreign forces in the last stages of a withdrawal due to be complete by the end of August, the Taliban have cut a huge swath across Afghanistan, capturing hundreds of districts, seizing key border crossings and encircling provincial capitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/global-call-for-end-to-taliban-offensive/article35417138.ece
20 July 2021||Washington,||Microsoft hack caused by China: U.S., allies||The Biden administration and Western allies formally blamed China on Monday for a massive hack of Microsoft Exchange email server software and accused Beijing of working with criminal hackers in ransomware attacks and other cyber operations. The announcements, though not accompanied by sanctions against the Chinese government, were intended as a forceful condemnation of activities a senior Biden administration official described as part of a “pattern of irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace.” They highlighted the ongoing threat from Chinese government hackers even as the administration remains consumed with trying to curb ransomware attacks from Russia-based syndicates that have targeted critical infrastructure. The broad range of cyberthreats from Beijing disclosed on Monday included ransomware attacks from government-affiliated hackers that have targeted victims — including in the U.S. — with demands for millions of dollars. Meanwhile, the Justice Department on Monday announced charges against four Chinese nationals who prosecutors said were working with the Ministry of State Security in a hacking campaign that targeted dozens of computer systems, including companies, universities and government entities. The defendants are accused of stealing trade secrets and confidential business information. No sanctions announced Unlike in April, when public finger-pointing of Russian hacking was paired with a raft of sanctions against Moscow, the Biden administration did not announce any actions against Beijing. The European Union and Britain also called out China. The EU said malicious cyber activities with “significant effects” that targeted government institutions, political organisations and key industries in the bloc’s 27 member states could be linked to Chinese hacking groups. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre said the groups targeted maritime industries and naval defense contractors in the U.S. and Europe and the Finnish Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/microsoft-hack-caused-by-china-us-allies/article35417145.ece
20 July 2021||COLOMBO,||Gotabaya Rajapaksa to seek second term as President||Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Monday said he would seek a second term in office, shifting from his earlier position to serve only one term. Mr. Gotabaya, in a meeting with owners of local media institutions, spoke of having not just three years of his remaining term, but an additional five years, implying a second term, to fulfil his pledges, according to a tweet from the President’s spokesman Kingsly Rathnayaka. President Gotabaya’s announcement comes less than a fortnight after his younger brother Basil Rajapaksa was sworn in as Minister of Finance, a move that increased the first family’s presence in the Cabinet to five members. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa, known as the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna’s (SLPP or People’s Front) architect and chief strategist, has a growing support base within the party, setting off speculation about his probable presidential bid in 2024. “Looks like President Gotabaya wanted to set the record straight, by telling the people of the country and party workers who is really in charge,” said a senior government official, who requested not to be named. Mr. Gotabaya’s remarks coincide with growing criticism, including from his voters, of the government’s apparent inability to address the acute financial strain on ordinary families, amid an unprecedented economic crisis stifling the country. In a recent meeting with provincial officials, the newly-appointed Finance Minister Mr. Basil remarked that reducing prices of essential goods will be the government's immediate focus, as families were “struggling to have three meals”, Tamil daily Virakesari reported on Sunday. Mr. Gotabaya, 72, had promised a people-centred economy in his poll manifesto titled ‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour’, which was later adopted as his government’s policy framework following his big win in November 2019.

20 July 2021||Geneva,||Climate change has added over 1,000 lakes in Swiss Alps: study||Climate change has dramatically altered the Swiss Alp landscape — at a quicker pace than expected — as melting glaciers have created more than 1,000 new lakes across the mountains, a study published on Monday showed. The inventory of Swiss Glacial lakes showed that almost 1,200 new lakes have formed in formerly glaciated regions of the Swiss Alps since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850. Around 1,000 of them still exist today, according to the study published by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag). That is far more than the few hundreds the researchers had expected to find at the beginning of the project. “We were surprised by the sheer numbers,” Daniel Odermatt, head of the Eawag Remote Sensing Group that carried out the study, said in a statement. He said the “marked acceleration in formation” was also surprising, pointing out that “180 have been added in the last decade alone”. Glaciers in the Swiss Alps are in steady decline, losing a full 2% of their volume last year alone, according to an annual study by the Swiss Academies of Science. And even if the world were to fully implement the 2015 Paris Agreement two-thirds of the Alpine glaciers will likely be lost, according to a 2019 study by the ETH technical university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/climate-change-has-added-over-1000-lakes-in-swiss-alps-study/article35417143.ece
20 July 2021||London,||U.K. lifts curbs as scientists warn of pandemic surge||The British government on Monday lifted pandemic restrictions on daily life in England, scrapping all social distancing rules in a step slammed by scientists and opposition parties as a dangerous leap into the unknown. From midnight (2300 GMT Sunday), nighclubs reopened and other indoor venues were allowed to run at full capacity, while legal mandates covering the wearing of masks and working from home were scrapped. Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who is self-isolating after his health minister was infected — urged the public to remain prudent and for any laggards to join the two-thirds of U.K. adults who are now fully vaccinated. He defended the reopening — dubbed “freedom day” by some media — despite scientists’ grave misgivings after daily infection rates in Britain topped 50,000, behind only Indonesia and Brazil. “If we don’t do it now, then we’ll be opening up in the autumn, the winter months, when the virus has the advantage of the cold weather,” the Prime Minister said. This week’s start of summer school holidays offered a “precious firebreak”, he said. “If we don’t do it now, we’ve got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it? So this is the right moment, but we’ve got to do it cautiously.” In a bid to demonstrate a bit of caution, Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC he would continue to wear a mask in “crowded indoor places”. But Jonathan Ashworth, the opposition Labour Party’s health spokesman, said the government was being “reckless”, echoing experts who say the reopening endangers global health. “We are against opening up without any precautions in place,” Mr. Ashworth told BBC television, attacking in particular the government’s plan on masks. But professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London warned that Britain was on course for 1,00,000 cases a day, as the Delta variant runs out of control.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-lifts-curbs-as-scientists-warn-of-pandemic-surge/article35417144.ece
20 July 2021||Washington,||Guantanamo inmate sent back to Morocco||The Biden administration on Monday transferred a Guantanamo Bay detainee to his home country for the first time, a policy shift from the Trump presidency that sent a Moroccan man back home years after he was recommended for discharge. The prisoner, Abdullatif Nasser, who’s in his mid-50s, was cleared for repatriation by a review board in July 2016. A review board determined that Nasser’s detention was no longer necessary to protect U.S. national security, the Pentagon said on Monday. The board had recommended his repatriation, but that couldn’t be completed during Obama administration, it said. Nasser arrived on Monday in Morocco, where police arrested him and said they would investigate him on suspicion of committing terrorist acts — even though he was never charged while in Guantanamo. Nasser was a member of a Moroccan Sufi Islam group in the 1980s, according to his Pentagon file. In 1996, he was recruited to fight in Chechyna but ended up in Afghanistan, where he was captured and sent to Guantanamo in 2002.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-sends-guantanamo-detainee-back-to-morocco/article35417142.ece

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The crisis ahead, from learning loss to resumption||Since school closure has led to a great loss of nutrition and schooling for the poorest sections of our society, there is some urgency in the calls we hear to reopen schools. However, the important question remains this: if schools were to reopen tomorrow, are we prepared for their resumption? Will it be merely business as usual? The disruption In what has been perhaps an educational disruption in history without parallel since the mass education system took root in India, schools have been closed for 16 months now, with no clarity on or a timeline for their resumption as yet. The country has promoted online classes and e-connectivity as the solution, perhaps inevitably so, since physical contact between teachers and children has not been possible. The focus has been on secondary and higher secondary education, with most States ensuring some form or other of online classes for this segment. However, due to a lack of connectivity as well as a lack of access to e-devices, only a fraction of children even in this age group has had online education of any kind. When it comes to children in the primary and upper primary classes, even such access has been limited to a minuscule fraction. Children of the poor, studying in government schools, have been especially disadvantaged in this regard. Further aggravating the situation is the quality of online education — it is largely abysmal. As most studies show, the percentage of teachers in the country capable of handling digital platforms for pedagogic purposes is very small. The educational material provided by them has also been mere reproduction of what is used in a physical classroom. Hence, even where online classes have taken place regularly — as in the case of urban schools, with students largely from middle and high income groups — the teaching-learning processes have by and large been poor. As has been well documented by now, all this has resulted in what commentators have termed nutrition loss and learning loss. Worldwide, many studies in the last year have documented a loss of learning in children. In the Netherlands, despite a short lockdown, equitable school funding, and excellent broadband access, researchers found that among eight to 11 year olds, “students made little or no progress while learning from home” and that “learning loss was most pronounced among students from disadvantaged homes” (https://bit.ly/3hORC5N). A large multi-State study in the United States records that the pandemic “has also prompted some students to leave the public school system altogether”. According to a study by the Azim Premji Foundation (https://bit.ly/2UqW81h) in January 2021, covering more than 16,000 children in the age group six to 11 years, and across five States, 92% of children on average have lost at least one specific language ability from the previous year across all classes; the figure is 82% when it comes to mathematical ability. A question that looms large in the minds of teachers, parents and especially the children, is a basic one: will a child, who was in Class four in March 2020, and did not get to attend a single class during the academic year 2020-2021, be admitted into Class six now in (say) August 2021? In areas where this means admission to a different school, is this automatic? In some States this has already been addressed and answered this year. Age-appropriate enrolment, as guaranteed under the Right to Education Act, is being uniformly implemented. But this has not been ensured across India, with many States not taking up enrolment for this year as yet. Even assuming that enrolment is not an issue, if we return to the child in the illustration above, as the child enrols into Class six, will she start with Class five textbooks, or Class six textbooks, or some new “bridge” material? This is, of course, a decision to be taken by the State government, but what is the rationale to be used? And what are the implications? International experience ‘One way of addressing the learning crisis might be to repeat the entire academic year. The government in Kenya has decided to do just this’. Some countries, such as the Philippines, allow extended time for classes on resumption, both in duration of school hours and more calendar days of interaction. ‘Another approach is to reduce and synthesize the curriculum so that students are able to focus on a few subjects and learn them well’. This is followed, for instance, by the State of Ontario in Canada. One-to-one tutoring for the most disadvantaged learners has been taken up in many countries. Among the most prestigious such programmes is the National Tutoring Programme in the United Kingdom for which the government has announced funding to the tune of £350 million. Ghana has also announced a national programme of tutoring. There are several such programmes in different States in the U.S. In Italy, university students are volunteering to conduct one-one-one classes for middle school children from poor immigrant backgrounds. Accelerated education programmes or “bridge courses”, which condense several months (or even years of schooling) into a few weeks or months, are another option. This concept has been taken up in several countries. One strong voice emerging from all these experiences is: “Acceleration, not remediation”. The advice is to go with exposure to age-level grade-level content, and plug the holes where necessary. Many educators warn against a deficit model that starts with measuring “loss” and tries to “fill the void”, before returning to the “normal”. Such models tend to ignore the complexity of psychological preparedness in children, and reduce learning to a single dimension of achievement, which invariably works against children in low-resource contexts. Some have even asserted that “... there is no such thing as learning loss”, and that students have learned a great deal about life, home economy, health and much else during the pandemic that cannot be measured by standardised tests; that learning should begin with acknowledging this and building on such informal learning. In the words of Tony Cotton (https://bit.ly/3wRM0f0), a renowned mathematics educator from the U.K., “The curriculum should not be seen as a fixed list of content that must all be covered before the learner can leave school. If the curriculum can be seen as a map, as a landscape, there is always plenty of time to explore.” The agenda ahead Given the state of preparedness of our education system, and based on what we have seen during the last year, it is hard to see our schools taking up a curriculum based on where the children are, in terms of what they have learnt from life during the novel coronavirus pandemic. The most likely event is that schools will simply revert to business as usual, with a reduced syllabus, and no change whatsoever in the overall curriculum or pedagogy, and racing through the syllabus to “catch up”. Children who cannot keep up would simply be left behind. This would be a great disaster. It is very likely that children from the poorest sections will be the ones who are affected the most, by having to race in accelerated learning programmes with no support at home. Teachers, without preparation for handling such a new context, can only fall back on covering the syllabus, leading to the alienation of already marginalised students. What we need now is nothing less than a national rejuvenation programme for elementary education. The school system cannot do what is needed by itself. We need a vast body of volunteers engaging in small groups with children from the most disadvantaged sections, working in tandem with schools, which will need to focus on safety measures and average performance. It is critical that we should not reduce education to foundational literacy and numeracy, but treat children as they are, study the experiences they bring, and address their nutritional, emotional and intellectual well-being as a whole. This requires a flexible curriculum rooted in local reality, working with physical material, and pedagogy based on sound principles of psychology of learning. The country has already shown during the pandemic that it lacks the capability to re-imagine examinations, whether it be at the secondary school level, or at university. Now, with the education of small children, a similar lack of imagination in curriculum and pedagogy will be splendidly ironic: without ourselves learning any lesson from the pandemic, we would be demanding that the children learn their lessons.

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Surveillance reform is the need of the hour||It is worth asking why the government would need to hack phones and install spyware when existing laws already offer impunity for surveillance. This unsettling query arises on the basis of reports emerging from a collaborative investigation by journalists from around the world, including from India’s The Wire , titled the ‘Pegasus Project’. Reports say that over “300 verified Indian mobile telephone numbers, including those used by ministers, opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, government officials, scientists, rights activists and others”, were targeted using spyware made by the Israeli firm, NSO Group. Threat to press freedom Subsequent reporting showed that the Pegasus spyware had been used to target 37 phones, of which 10 belonged to Indians. Amnesty International’s Security Lab was then able to confirm that Pegasus was used to compromise the phones of former journalist of The Indian Express Sushant Singh, former editor of the Economic and Political Weekly Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, former Outlook journalist S.N.M. Abdi, and The Wire ’s two founding editors Siddharth Varadarajan and M.K. Venu. These revelations highlight a disturbing trend with regard to the use of hacking software against dissidents and adversaries. In 2019, similar allegations were made about the use of Pegasus against journalists and human rights activists. Most of them were situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima Koregaon case and Dalit activists, respectively. However, despite repeated calls for investigations, the relevant State governments failed to do so. A significant number of Indians reportedly affected by Pegasus this time are again journalists. This is not surprising since the World Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders has ranked India 142 out of 180 countries in 2021. What is shocking, however, is that the press requires (and in democracies is afforded) greater protections on speech and privacy. Privacy and free speech are what enable good reporting. They protect journalists against threats of private and governmental reprisals against legitimate reporting. This has been recognised in Supreme Court decisions. In the absence of privacy, the safety of journalists, especially those whose work criticises the government, and the personal safety of their sources is jeopardised. Such a lack of privacy, therefore, creates an aura of distrust around these journalists and effectively buries their credibility. Problematic provisions The government, in its purported undated and unsigned response, relied on existing provisions of law under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Information Technology (IT) Act of 2000. Even without the use of Pegasus or any other hacking software and surveillance, these provisions are problematic and offer the government total opacity in respect of its interception and monitoring activities. While the provisions of the Telegraph Act relate to telephone conversations, the IT Act relates to all communications undertaken using a computer resource. Section 69 of the IT Act and the Interception Rules of 2009 are even more opaque than the Telegraph Act, and offer even weaker protections to the surveilled. No provision, however, allows the government to hack the phones of any individual since hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is a criminal offence under the IT Act. Nonetheless, surveillance itself, whether under a provision of law or without it, is a gross violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. The very existence of a surveillance system impacts the right to privacy and the exercise of freedom of speech and personal liberty under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution, respectively. It prevents people from reading and exchanging unorthodox, controversial or provocative ideas. Regardless of whether a citizen knows that their email is being read by the government, the perceived danger, founded on reasonable suspicion that this may happen, itself impacts their ability to express, receive and discuss such ideas. There is also no scope for an individual subjected to surveillance to approach a court of law prior to or during or subsequent to acts of surveillance since the system itself is covert. In the absence of parliamentary or judicial oversight, electronic surveillance gives the executive the power to influence both the subject of surveillance and all classes of individuals, resulting in a chilling effect on free speech. Constitutional functionaries such as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court have reportedly been surveilled under Pegasus without any checks outside the executive wing of government. Vesting such disproportionate power with one wing of the government threatens the separation of powers of the government. In response to a Right to Information (RTI) request in 2013, the Central government had revealed that 7,500 to 9,000 orders for interception of telephones are issued by it every month. However, RTI requests for such information are now denied citing threats to national security and to the physical safety of persons. The government, in its purported response, stated that any surveillance which takes place happens through a “due process of law”. However, the existing provisions are insufficient to protect against the spread of authoritarianism since they allow the executive to exercise a disproportionate amount of power. Such surveillance, when carried out entirely by the executive, curtails Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (empowering the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, to issue certain writs) as it happens in secret. Thus, the affected person is unable to show a breach of their rights. This violates not only the ideals of due process and the separation of powers but also goes against the requirement of procedural safeguards as mandated in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union of India (2017). Role of judiciary Thus, in order to satisfy the ideal of “due process of law”, to maintain an effective separation of powers and to fulfill the requirements of procedural safeguards and natural justice, there needs to be oversight from another branch of the government. Only the judiciary can be competent to decide whether specific instances of surveillance are proportionate, whether less onerous alternatives are available, and to balance the necessity of the government’s objectives with the rights of the impacted individuals. The need for judicial oversight over surveillance systems in general, and judicial investigation into the Pegasus hacking in particular, is also essential because the leaked database of targeted numbers contained the phone number of a sitting Supreme Court judge, which further calls into question the independence of the judiciary in India. Surveillance reform is the need of the hour in India. Not only are existing protections weak but the proposed legislation related to the personal data protection of Indian citizens fails to consider surveillance while also providing wide exemptions to government authorities. When spyware is expensive and interception is inefficient, the individuals surveilled will be shortlisted by priority and perceived threat level to the existing regime. But as spyware becomes more affordable and interception becomes more efficient, there will no longer be a need to shortlist individuals. Everyone will be potentially subject to state-sponsored mass surveillance. The only solution is immediate and far-reaching surveillance reform.

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Egypt takes centre stage in West Asian affairs||Most important developments in West Asia are increasingly revealing an Egyptian fingerprint. Egypt’s diplomats and intelligence officers recently negotiated the end of the 11-day Israel-Palestine conflict, with the new Israeli government looking to Egypt to manage the turbulent cauldron of Gaza. Turkey, which has been hostile to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for the coup in July 2013, when he overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo headed by President Mohammed Morsi, is anxious to reopen relations. Egypt, after long years of neglect, has now become active in re-engaging with its neighbours in Africa, with substantial economic and defence partnership agreements. Finally, Egypt, with Iraq and Jordan, announced in Baghdad at the end of June that a new tripartite grouping of these West Asian States had been set up, proclaiming the advent of al-Sham al-Jadid , the “New Levant”. Political, economic changes Just a few years ago, after the overthrow of the country’s first democratically elected government, Egypt survived with a $12 billion aid package from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait. These West Asian deposits were supplemented by grants in 2013-14 for the import of petroleum products, valued at another $16 billion (https://bit.ly/3exXb6w). West Asian politics was also largely influenced by the active role of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Egypt found itself a reluctant partner in these ventures, though it was low key in Yemen and maintained ties with the Assad government in Damascus. In Libya, it was pushed into a more active role to confront the Tripoli-based administration, but here, too, it refused to deploy troops in the country. Egypt’s role in the blockade of Qatar from June 2017, initiated by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, was also relatively lukewarm. Egypt allowed Qatari LNG to pass through the Suez Canal, while Qatar made no effort to dilute its investments in Egypt or order the repatriation of 2,50,000 Egyptian workers in the country. The failure of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to achieve any success in their military interventions, or in the blockade of Qatar, has opened the space for Egypt to regain the influence it has traditionally enjoyed in Arab counsels. This has been greatly facilitated by the good management of its economy through difficult times. Economic reforms from 2015 finally provided foreign exchange reserves of $40 billion by 2018 and a growth rate of 5.6% in 2019 (https://bit.ly/3eAlfpb). The instrument that Egypt is using to assert its diverse interests in a complex and conflictual region is not military force, but diplomacy. Regional challenges The principal challenge that Egypt presently faces relates to Ethiopia’s plan to construct the “Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam” (GERD) on the Blue Nile. Egypt fears this project could restrict its access to the waters of the Nile, the source of 95% of its fresh water. Seeing the project as an “existential threat”, Egyptian officials have said that “all options” are on the table. However, Egypt has actually embarked on robust diplomatic engagements in its African neighbourhood, with defence agreements with the “ring countries” around Ethiopia — Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Kenya — to safeguard its interests. Ethiopia has initiated its own diplomatic effort in the Horn of Africa by firming up ties with Somalia, Eritrea and South Sudan. In response, Egypt has agreed to build a major dam and hydropower project in Tanzania, so that the latter will compete with Ethiopia in the export of power in the region. At the end of June, Egypt wrote to the UN Security Council seeking international intervention on the dam issue; it said that, with this effort, “we will have exhausted all the peaceful means”. Egypt’s other challenge is relations with Turkey. The two countries met at the deputy Foreign Minister level in Cairo in early May and discussed the issues that divide them: Libya and the East Mediterranean. In Libya, Turkey has deployed about 500 soldiers and another 2,000 fighters from its militia in Syria in support of the Tripoli-based authority. Egypt and the UAE have so far backed the Tobruk-based administration and supported the rival Libyan force, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, with weaponry and mercenaries. In March 2021, an interim government of National Unity was formed that brings together the two rival administrations in one national order until elections are held in December this year. But this arrangement is still fragile, and competitions for power between the Tripoli and Tobruk-based rivals are ongoing. Libya’s peace process demands that foreign troops leave the country. Though the Syrian militants have started leaving, Turkey asserts that its own soldiers have been invited by the government and is showing no signs of withdrawing them, while Russia insists that withdrawal of foreign troops will be a “step-by-step” process so that a power balance is maintained. In the East Mediterranean, Egypt, with other littoral partners, has delineated energy claims in the sea which conflict with Turkey’s claims. With neither side willing to compromise, there are serious fears of conflict. On July 3, Egypt affirmed its interest in Libya by inaugurating a new naval base close to the Libyan border. Coalition for cooperation The just-announced tripartite coalition of Egypt, Iraq and Jordan is clearly an attempt by the partners to broaden their regional engagements: Iraq would like to free itself from the Iranian grip and expand ties with its Arab neighbours. Jordan is unhappy with the recent Saudi role in trying to topple King Abdullah and replace him with a disgruntled half brother, Prince Hamza. Egypt views the partnership as an opportunity to move beyond its traditional dependence on Saudi Arabia and the UAE and assert its own leadership in the region. Together, the partners constitute a near-contiguous land mass, with a total population of 150 million (https://bit.ly/3kwy2g6) and considerable domestic agricultural and industrial capacity. They are looking at extensive cooperation in energy connectivity and reconstruction areas. Membership is open and, later, Syria and Lebanon could also join this group. The outlook While Egypt’s diplomacy has already placed it in the vanguard of regional affairs, it also faces serious challenges. As of now, Ethiopia is not budging on GERD, raising fears of a military confrontation. At home, due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, unemployment has increased, recovery has been slow, and the percentage of workers without adequate income has gone up from 55% to nearly 75%. The poverty rate is still 2% higher than in 2015, when reforms had started. Further deterioration in the economy could compel Egypt to seek assistance from the Gulf States, which would dilute its independent posture in regional affairs. Again, under the country’s stringent counterterrorism laws, tens of thousands of government critics are in detention. During the election campaign, Joe Biden, now U.S. President, had promised that there would be “no more blank checks for Trump’s ‘favourite dictator’”, a reference to al-Sisi. However, it remains to be seen if the U.S. will actually go through with this. As of now, Egypt is riding high. The Egyptian President recently revamped the museum of ancient history in Cairo and presided over parades of mummies of former Egyptian pharaohs as they moved to their new home. Perhaps, he feels a kinship with those old rulers who had brought Egypt so much glory all those centuries ago.

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Making India a sporting nation||Two econometricians, Bernard A.B. and Busse M.R., in a paper in The Review of Economics and Statistics (February 2004) tried to establish that “total GDP is the best predictor of the national Olympic performance”. They also claimed that host countries are “likely to win an additional 1.8% of the medals beyond what would be predicted by their GDP alone”. Since then, many studies have attempted to understand the factors that influence most the ability of a nation to win medals at the Olympics. One such work after the Rio Olympics showed that medals per hundred billion of dollars (based on purchasing power parity data of 2015) are highest in some Caribbean nations and lowest in some Asian and African nations. These results negate to a considerable extent the hypothesis that total GDP is the best predictor of the performance of a nation at the Olympics. Factors that determine performance There are many factors which are important in determining the performance of a nation in various sports. Beyond a threshold level, the average standard of living in a nation and the country’s population size may be important determinants for its performance at the Olympics. The size of total GDP is hardly important in countries like India where a sizable segment is fighting hunger. A person of poor health can never be a good sportsperson. In countries where there are high levels of stunted growth, malnutrition and anaemia, we cannot expect good athletes. Thus, South Asian countries and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa don’t fit in the econometric models built on total GDP. Genetic factors are also no less important. The U.S., Australia and the Netherlands are powerhouses in swimming, but not China. Perhaps, taller people have an advantage in swimming or basketball but height is not important in shooting or gymnastics. China excels in shooting along with the U.S. and Germany. East Asian nations do better at table tennis than Western nations. Russia, East European nations and Central Asian countries do well in amateur boxing whereas China and Central Asians countries do better in weightlifting and wrestling. Mobilising resources in world-class training provides an edge to sportspersons. Such infrastructure makes the U.S. the superpower in athletics and gymnastics, Germany in equestrian, and the U.K. in diving, sailing and cycling. For poor nations, creating such infrastructure is a luxury. During colonial rule, India got some exposure to international sporting events earlier than many Asian and African nations. The Calcutta Football League, for example, is the oldest football league in Asia. Durand Cup is the oldest existing football tournament in Asia. This exposure gave India an edge over other ‘Third World’ nations in the 1950s and early 1960s. Resources in India were spread thinly across sports disciplines. As more and more nations started coming into the international sports arena, India’s relative position started declining from the 1970s. Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, Singapore and Malaysia may stand below India in the medal’s tally at the Asian Games, but are ahead of it at the Olympics. This is primarily because India is moderately good at many sports but not good enough to be the best at any of them. In contrast, Jamaica does well at the Olympics in sprinting and Kenya gets medals in long-distance running. They perform better than India though they are not great sporting nations. In recent years, India has shown promise in shooting, amateur boxing, wrestling, gymnastics and badminton. We need to concentrate more on sports where the physical build of an average Indian will not stand as a disadvantage. One State, one sport States need to be integrated in a bigger way in India’s sports policy. Can we not develop different States as centres of excellence for different sports? People of different States have different food habits and build. It’s not impossible to develop training infrastructure for different sports in different parts of the country depending on the inclination of people of that area and their habits and build. Unless we start grooming our children, who show potential, for international sports, India can hardly succeed at the Olympics. Individual talent alone cannot take us ahead. The policy of “One State, One Sport” can be a game-changer in India. India’s best performance at the Olympics was in London (2012) where it won two silver medals and four bronzes and ranked 56th in the medal’s tally. At the Rio Olympics (2016), with one silver and one bronze, India’s rank came down to 67. Whatever the predictions of the econometricians, if India can find a place in the top 50 sporting nations in the medal’s tally of the rescheduled Summer Olympics at Tokyo commencing on July 23, that will be good enough to boost the nation’s morale.

Why do citizens fear going to a police station or dealing with the lower ranks of the police force? Custody-related deaths The answer lies in numbers. Between April 1 and November 30, 2015, 25,357 cases were registered under police category which included 111 deaths in police custody, 330 cases of custodial torture and 24,916 in others. These numbers were shared by the former Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, in the Lok Sabha in response to a question. In comparison, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology, from 1989-90 to 2010-11, the deaths in police custody and custody-related operations were 700. In the U.K., England and Wales, the total deaths in police custody or following contact with the police (1990 to 2015) was 1,542. In the U.S., according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of state prisoners’ deaths between 2001 and 2007 was 21,936 although one could argue that an unaccounted number of political prisoners from the U.S. disappear into privately maintained black holes called the supermax prisons both on and off U.S. soil. However, not considering the different time periods, an off-hand comparison would show that custody-related deaths in India are more than the sum total of the countries mentioned. One question on the minds of the common people is: how can a human being inflict so much pain on another without the slightest remorse? Two famous experiments provide an explanation. In the Stanford Prison Experiment, people who had applied to be a part of the experiment were randomly divided into two groups: prison guards and prisoners. Under duress, the participants who played the role of prison guards started exploiting and torturing the participants playing the role of prisoners. Milgrim’s experiment on obedience to authority showed that people obey if they are coerced. A staggering 65% of the participants applied the maximum level of pain on the “victim” while the remaining 35% remained in a range. Only a minuscule number refused to inflict any pain even under coercion. The results of Milgrim’s experiment were shown to be true even in variations of the experiment. Behaviour with the citizenry In the Indian police force, the lower ranks of police personnel are often verbally abused by their superiors. Many are not considered as individuals, are not shown compassion by the senior ranks, and work in inhuman conditions. While the alleged excesses of the police cannot be justified, it is important to look at how the treatment meted to police constables has affected the interaction of the police with the public. Many policemen deal with citizens in the manner that they do only because their work environments are not harmonious. Their relationship with their superior officers is stressful and sycophantic. There is no concept of welfare and this manifests in their improper behaviour with the citizenry. Several committees have made several recommendations on the issue of reforms for a healthy police system. The Supreme Court of India was forced to intervene as neither the Central government nor the State governments acted upon those recommendations. It is clear that the problem is with the political apparatus considering the history of the Police Act. The Police Act of 1861 was legislated by the British right after the revolt of 1857 to bring in efficient administration of police in the country and to prevent any future revolts. This meant that the police were to always comply with those in power. Considering the results of the privatisation of the prison system and militarisation of the police system in the U.S., it would be disastrous to even consider this as a solution in India. Thus, political will is seen as an essential component in bringing about any major reform in the Indian police force.

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Health above faith||It does not require any higher wisdom to know that there is considerable risk to public health during massive religious gatherings in the midst of a pandemic. Yet, it took some prodding by the Supreme Court for Uttar Pradesh to cancel the annual Kanwar Yatra. The yatra, in which Kanwarias, devotees of Shiva, make a pilgrimage to collect water from the Ganga, was not held last year due to COVID-19. This year, it was scheduled to start on July 25. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath appeared keen that the pilgrimage be held this year, and had convened a meeting on July 9 to discuss preparations and security arrangements, along with putting measures in place to avoid the spread of COVID-19 infection. However, the Court was perturbed by reports of the plan to conduct the yatra, resulting in the initiation of suo motu proceedings. Disagreeing with even the idea of a ‘symbolic yatra’ in deference to religious sentiment, the Court had reiterated a principle that is being observed in most places: the idea that the health of the public and their right to life are paramount. “All other sentiments, albeit religious, are subservient to this most basic fundamental right,” the Court had observed on July 16, while giving the State government time till July 19 to call off the gatherings on its own. The Uttarakhand government had earlier cancelled the yatra in its territory, rightly heeding warnings by experts that such large gatherings posed a major risk, amidst fears and expectations of a third wave. Uttar Pradesh was helped by the various Kanwar Sanghs that offered to avoid taking out the yatra this year too. Despite the fact that the organisation of the Kumbh Mela earlier this year was seen as responsible for a surge in infections in the run-up to the disastrous second wave that overpowered the country’s health system for weeks, there are sections that believe that rituals and gatherings associated with religious faith must be allowed with some restrictions. There may be a case for relaxations aimed at economic revival and restoration of normality in most parts of the country, but there really is none when it comes to choosing between religious rights and the right to life and safety. The easing of lockdown restrictions for three days in Kerala to help people celebrate Bakrid is a case in point. It has attracted justified criticism, as any relaxation after a long spell of severe curbs will have to be based on a scientific assessment of the number of daily infections, the rate of positivity and signs of abatement. Kerala is one of the States whose daily numbers are causing concern, and the easing of restrictions defies logic and flies in the face of science. The State government will be hard pressed to explain its decision to the top court, which will quite rightly demand much more than a routine clarification that the relaxations were accompanied by instructions for maintaining the COVID-19 protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/health-above-faith/article35417119.ece
20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Laughter challenge||Deciphering the political calculus of the Congress can be a tough task. The latest example is the appointment of Navjot Sidhu as the President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. After mounting a relentless public attack against CM Amarinder Singh and publicly praising other parties, Mr. Sidhu is now tasked with leading the Congress. He spent 13 years in the BJP, five in the Congress, while flirting with the idea of joining the AAP in between. He joined the Congress ahead of the 2017 Assembly election which the party won mostly on account of Mr. Singh’s skills. Mr. Sidhu got a cabinet berth but fell out with the CM soon enough. Mr. Singh opposed Mr. Sidhu’s visits to Pakistan, and a ticket for his wife in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The Congress won eight of the 13 Lok Sabha seats from Punjab. Punjab constitutes 15% of the Congress’s total Lok Sabha strength of 52. Mr. Sidhu had little support among MPs, MLAs or party workers until the Gandhis — Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka — tilted the scales in his favour. On the one hand there is strong evidence of his opportunism, lack of maturity, unprincipled greed for power that includes claiming a Lok Sabha seat for his wife within two years of defecting to the Congress, and inability to work as part of a team. On the other hand, he has absolutely no track record of any political activism, public service or being ideologically aligned to the Congress in any manner. Opportunists without any convictions might be used for particular roles in a party’s strategy, but handing over the command to such a turncoat shows the complete bankruptcy of the Congress and an insult to those who fight the long battle. The misplaced assertion of authority by the Gandhis in riding roughshod over the CM and MPs, is a repeat of the old mistakes that pushed regional satraps out of its fold. Mamata Banerjee, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy are outstanding political minds who command power in their respective States as CMs of West Bengal, Assam and Andhra Pradesh. They felt suffocated in the durbar politics of the Congress, in which Mr. Sidhu has flourished. Strong regional leaders deliver results but also behave in an assertive and even authoritarian manner, as it appears to be the case with Mr. Singh. But then, humiliating them is no way to rein them in. Now that the deed has been done, perhaps the Gandhis will explain to the party workers what their rationale is, and what they expect Mr. Sidhu to deliver. In the absence of a convincing explanation, the only message is that the high command would stoop low to promote any court jester to undercut a leader who builds any independent standing. If Mr. Sidhu is the future of the Congress, that future appears bleak at this point.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/laughter-challenge/article35417120.ece

They have brought about hectic branch banking and a distinct change in the pattern of lending. In the first 18 months, 2,900 new branches were opened, most of them in rural and semi-urban centres. Deposits with the 14 banks have increased by Rs. 882 crores to about Rs. 3,408 crores. There was also an increase in the number of accounts of small borrowers to 11.7 lakhs by March this year from only 2.8 lakhs in June 1969. These developments have no doubt great significance, especially as 30 to 40 per cent of fresh credit extended by all banks has been in favour of borrowers in the priority sectors. The pace of deposit growth has obviously been stimulated by the strengthening of the infrastructure and by a new class of people taking seriously to the banking habit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/eventful-years-from-an-editorial/article35417129.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘India on course for 11% growth this fiscal, to meet deficit goal’||Playing down concerns about high inflation and rising commodity prices, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian said on Monday that India was on course to grow at about 11% and meet the fiscal deficit target of 6.8% of gross domestic product this year. Asserting that the Union Budget’s plan to scale up capital spending by 35% in FY22 would boost construction activity and create jobs in the informal sector, Mr. Subramanian said this would boost demand and enable the country to get growth without high inflation. “I don’t foresee a problem at all in meeting those estimates for infrastructure spending,” the CEA said in an interaction with the Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association, before warning them against a potential risk of ‘irrational exuberance’ over the coming few years. “We should not repeat the mistakes of bank-led infra funding which led to this entire bad assets’ problem. The main lesson for all of you should be not to repeat the mistakes we had after the global financial crisis,” he said, asserting that a limited focus on revenue expenditure after the 2008 crisis had led to runaway inflation. Inflation, he contended, was a ‘touch higher’ due to temporary supply-side effects from recent economic restrictions. “I don’t anticipate inflation to be a problem when you create growth by working on the supply side,” he said, arguing that India’s failure to undertake supply-side reforms after the 2008 crisis led to a triple whammy of high fiscal and current account deficits with runaway inflation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-on-course-for-11-growth-this-fiscal-to-meet-deficit-goal/article35417102.ece
20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC reserves order on telcos’ pleas in AGR case||The Supreme Court on Monday reserved orders on pleas made by telecom majors such as Vodafone-Idea and Bharti Airtel for a chance to place their grievances about “arithmetical errors” in the calculation of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues before the Department of Telecom (DoT). A Special Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao, S. Abdul Nazeer and M.R. Shah, meanwhile, gave a fortnight to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the government to check the compliance reports filed by the companies on the payment of their first 10% instalment towards their AGR dues. In September 2020, the top court had ordered that the annual 10% instalments would commence from April 1, 2021 up to March 31, 2031. Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Tata were among some of the companies that assured the court on Monday that they have paid “more than” their expected instalment. At the beginning of the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Vodafone-Idea, complained about the “arithmetical errors” in the calculation of AGR dues. “If I have paid Rs. 1, only 50 paisa is reflected... In one entry, the actual payment made is Rs. 155 crore, payment shown in DOT is Rs. 153 crore,” Mr. Rohatgi submitted. However, the Bench reminded the firms about the express bar imposed by the Supreme Court on the reassessment of AGR dues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sc-reserves-order-on-telcos-pleas-in-agr-case/article35417096.ece

Worlds silver medallist and No.1 ranked Amit Panghal (52kg), Worlds bronze medallists Manish Kaushik (63kg) and Vikas Krishan (69kg), the talented Ashish Kumar (75kg) and the experienced Satish Kumar (+91kg) form the men’s squad. Six-time World champion and London Olympic bronze medallist M.C. Mary Kom (51kg), Worlds bronze medallists Simranjit Kaur (60kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), and two-time Asian champion Pooja Rani Bohra (75kg) are the women boxers in the fray. In top form Amit is in top form and has landed medals in recent international events. If he gets a chance, avenging his loss against World and Olympic champion Shakhobdin Zoirov will be on top of his agenda. Amit may also face leading competitors, such as double Worlds medallist Mohamed Flissi, former World champion Yosbany Veitia, Olympic light flyweight silver medallist Yuberjen Martínez and Olympic silver medallist Yoel Finol. Manish, who has recovered from surgery and COVID-19, and can pose problems for his opponents. Vikas is hungry for success in his third appearance. His weight has boxers like former World and Olympic champion Roniel Iglesias, Worlds silver medallist and Commonwealth Games champion Pat McCormack, Olympic silver medallist Lorenzo Sotomayor and World champion in welterweight and Olympic medallist Andrey Zamkovoy. Ashish and Satish can beat any opponent on their day.  Among the women, 38-year-old Mary will attract maximum attention. Olympics bronze medallist Ingrit Valencia, Worlds bronze medallist Virginia Fuchs, World champion Huang Hsiao-wen, Worlds silver medallist Buse Naz Cakiroglu and double Worlds silver medallist Stoyka Krasteva and others will look to hinder Mary’s gold quest. The fourth-ranked Simranjit is rated highly and will be no less than her competitors, including World champion Beatriz Ferreira, two-time Worlds medallist Sudaporn Seesondee, former World champion Kellie Harrington and World and Olympic bronze medallist Mira Potkonen. Lovlina, ranked fifth, has overcome hiccups to be fighting fit. She may have to take on elite rivals such as former World champion Chen Nien-chin, current World champion Busenaz Surmeneli, Worlds silver medallist Angela Carini and twice Worlds bronze medallist Nadine Apetz. Giant-killer  The fifth-placed Pooja will look to enhance her reputation as a giant-killer. She will have company in Worlds bronze medallists Khadija El Mardi and Tammara Thibeault, ex-World champion and Olympic medallist Li Qian, World champion Lauren Price and World and Olympic silver medallist Nouchka Fontijn.

Deepak’s weight division has leading wrestlers including World and Olympic champion Hassan Yazdani, Worlds bronze medallist Artur Naifonov, former World champion David Taylor, four-time Worlds medallist Ali Shabanau and ex-Worlds silver medallist Sosuke Takatani. Proving her worth Among the women, Vinesh, 26, is ranked number one and has proved her worth time and again. Vinesh, who exited the Rio Olympics after injuring her leg midway through a contest, fought back to win gold medals in the 2018 Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and a bronze in 2019 World championships. The determined Vinesh, who was infected with Covid last year, has collected four gold medals this year to exhibit her current form. In a world class field — including two-time World champion Mayu Mukaida, twice Worlds medallist Pang Qianyu, Individual World Cup gold medallist Maria Prevolaraki, World champion in 55kg Jacarra Winchester and World and Olympic medallist Sofia Mattsson — Vinesh will have to give her best to live her dream. The young Anshu and Sonam, who graduated to the elite level in a fast-forward manner, have underlined their potential by grabbing quota places in the Olympics. Late bloomer Seema has also hurdled over several obstacles to qualify. With no fear and nothing to lose, these lesser-known wrestlers will leave no stone unturned to achieve glory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/grapplers-hold-much-promise/article35417361.ece
20 July 2021||Colombo,||India’s young guns target series win||India’s young guns will get another opportunity to flaunt their exceptional talent and secure a series win against Sri Lankan in the second ODI here on Tuesday. Skipper Shikhar Dhawan was left in awe as Prithvi Shaw, Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav made batting look ridiculously easy in the first ODI. India wants to play more aggressively in the shorter formats, and the trio’s performance served as a perfect template. It also reinforced the might of India’s bench strength. India is unlikely to make changes as it would like to first pocket the series. It will take a special effort from the struggling Sri Lankan side to pull one back. The inexperienced team showed it has the talent to compete. Most of the batsmen got starts but could not convert. Both teams might be interested in chasing, with the slow pitch playing better in the evening.  The squads:   India: Shikhar Dhawan (captain), Prithvi Shaw, Devdutt Padikkal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Suryakumar Yadav, Manish Pandey, Nitish Rana, Ishan Kishan, Sanju Samson, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Krishnappa Gowtham, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Rahul Chahar, Deepak Chahar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Chetan Sakariya, and Navdeep Saini.   Sri Lanka: Dasun Shanaka (captain), Dhananjaya de Silva, Avishka Fernando, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Ashen Bandara, Minod Bhanuka, Lahiru Udara, Ramesh Mendis, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Lakshan Sandakan, Akila Dhananjaya, Shiran Fernando, Dhananjaya Lakshan, Ishan Jayaratne, Praveen Jayawickrema, Asitha Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, Lahiru Kumara, and Isuru Udana.

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Vijender, Mary Kom bring cheer||Indian boxing began its Olympics journey after Independence with representation in the 1948 and 1952 Games. However, there was no participation for the next 20 years owing to different issues. The country’s boxers competed in the mega event from 1972 onwards, but without any significant results for several decades. Heartbreak Gurcharan Singh’s controversial quarterfinal loss in the 2000 Sydney Games was the first instance of an Indian boxer getting close to an Olympic medal. In the 81kg last-eight bout, in which Gurcharan and his rival Andriy Fedtchouk were tied on 12 points, the Ukrainian was declared the winner based on a tie-break score of 60-42. Eight years down the line, Vijender Singh (75kg) claimed a bronze in Beijing to become the first Indian to land an Olympic medal. The creditable performance of Akhil Kumar (54kg) and Jitender Kumar (51kg), who reached the quarterfinals, also won hearts and made the sport popular. Four years later, eight boxers qualified for the London Olympics. Even as the men returned empty-handed, M.C. Mary Kom (51kg) — then a five-time World champion — secured a bronze medal on women’s boxing’s Olympics debut. After drawing a blank in Rio, the Indian boxers are keen to get back on the medals tally in Tokyo.

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Morikawa — taking the pro circuit by storm||In a year of firsts in the Majors, Collin Morikawa might have topped them all. His performance over four days at the British Open was unlike anything seen at Royal St. George’s. Confidence personified He played with the confidence of a Major champion, which he is from his PGA Championship title last year. “When you make history — and I’m 24 years old — it’s hard to grasp,” Morikawa said. The silver claret jug in his possession as he stood on the 18th green, Morikawa first paid tribute to Matthias Schmid of Germany, who won the silver medal as low amateur. “It feels like literally two years ago I was an amateur,” Morikawa told him. That is entirely literal. Two years ago, the ink was barely dry on his diploma from the University of California. He has won two of the eight Majors he has played since then. The last player to win two professional Majors in so few attempts was Bobby Jones nearly a century ago. Season of firsts The Major season began with Hideki Matsuyama becoming the first Japanese player to win the Masters. Phil Mickelson became the first player at age 50 to win a Major at the PGA Championship. No one had ever birdied the last two holes at the US Open to win by one shot until Jon Rahm at Torrey Pines. And then along came Morikawa, as pure an iron player as there is in the game today, making his own brand of history. He is the first to win two Majors that he played for the first time. Just under a year ago in his first time playing the only Major restricted to pros, he won the PGA Championship at Harding Park. And then he won the British Open on his debut with a four-under 66 to finish at 265, the second-lowest score in the history of golf’s oldest Major. Morikawa has moved to World No. 3. In his 52 individual events since he turned pro, his five victories include two Majors and a World Golf Championship. He is leading the points list on the PGA Tour and European Tour. He is atop the Ryder Cup standings. Elite company His status is better defined by the company he now keeps. In the last century of golf, only seven other players have won two Majors before turning 25 — Spieth, Jones, Gene Sarazen, Jack Nicklaus, Seve Ballesteros, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/morikawa-taking-the-pro-circuit-by-storm/article35417401.ece
20 July 2021||Durham,||Mayank on trial in warm-up||Mayank Agarwal’s fight to reclaim his place in the Indian Test XI starts on Tuesday when he walks out to open in a three-day game against County Select XI. Also, padding up to keep wickets will be K.L. Rahul in Rishabh Pant’s absence. The match has been accorded First Class status. According to BCCI sources, Pant, who had tested positive for COVID-19, has completed his stipulated 10-day isolation and is “recovering well” but he is yet to join the team bubble here. “In any case both Pant and Wriddhiman, who is isolated as a precautionary measure will be available for first Test.” As it had been reported earlier, KL Rahul, who has been doing keeping drills, will don the big gloves for the game. Mayank will be closely monitored as he is likely to partner Rohit Sharma in the first Test after Shubman Gill was ruled out of the series with shin splints. While Rahul has scored the bulk of his 2,000 runs opening the innings, it is understood that he is being considered as a middle-order batsman and may be used later in the series in case one of the senior batsmen (read Ajinkya Rahane) doesn’t find form.  In the bowling department, Mohammed Siraj will like to give a good account of himself and Jasprit Bumrah wouldn’t mind getting a few wickets under his belt just like R. Ashwin did last week for Surrey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mayank-on-trial-in-warm-up/article35417344.ece
20 July 2021||Chennai,||Sudharsan thunders before the rain||Sai Sudharsan is easy on the eye and clinical with his strokes. He has the grace, the flow, and a left-hander’s elegance. This loose-limbed batsman with footwork and timing, impressed on his TNPL debut, turning out for Lyca Kovai Kings against Salem Spartans in the TNPL opener at Chepauk here on Monday. The 19-year-old Sudharsan’s 43-ball 87 showcased his stroke-making skills apart from underlining his temperament. Barrage of shots Riding on Sudharsan’s barrage of shots — his scintillating straight hits, both along the ground and aerial, caught the eye — Lyca, inserted, progressed to 168 for five in 18 overs before rain intervened. The contest never resumed. Sudharsan’s runs came against a competent Salem attack, comprising Vijay Shankar’s seam, slinger G. Periaswamy’s toe-crushers, Ganesh Moorthi’s tidy left-arm spin, and leg-spinner Murugan Ashwin’s variety. He hammered Shankar through covers and swung him past the ropes to signal his intentions.  Then, he nonchalantly swept Moorthi for a six. And when off-spinner Daryl Ferrario tossed one up, he was driven over his head. This was an innings in which Sudharsan disdainfully punished deliveries lacking in length and employed the sweep effectively. The innings was dotted with delightful nuggets. When Shankar pitched up, he was driven straight with panache. And when M. Ashwin flighted, he danced down to loft him attractively over mid-on. The big hits were also sure strikes, not slogs. Sudharsan struck M. Ashwin straight for a six and whipped Moorthi over long-on for the maximum. Good batting surface Before being taken at long-on off the persistent Periasamy — skipper Shahrukh Khan was consumed by a slower ball the previous delivery — the smashing Sudharsan had given Lyca’s innings the thrust on a good batting surface. Providing momentum Ganga Sridhar Raju, a busy, little southpaw who impressed with his strokes down the ground, made a 20-ball 33 to provide momentum to the innings before falling to a cleverly flighted ball from Moorthi. R. Kavin, opening the innings, made a rather laborious 41-ball 33, often finding it hard to force the pace. Eventually, rain had the final say.  The scores: Lyca Kovai Kings 168 for five in 18 overs (Ganga Sridhar Raju 33, R, Kavin 33, Sai Sudharsan 87, G. Periasamy two for 18) vs Salem Spartans. Rain ended the contest. Points: Lyca 1; Spartans 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sudharsan-thunders-before-the-rain/article35417465.ece

The winner of this tie will join ATK Mohun Bagan FC, Maziya S&RC and Bashundhara Kings in Group D of the continental competition and these matches will also be played in Maldives on August 18, 21 and 24. The fixtures were originally scheduled for early May in Maldives, but were indefinitely postponed after reports had emerged of a breach of COVID-19 protocols by BFC squad members in Male. Ahead of the match against Eagles, BFC players have started training at their base in Ballari. The club has also announced the signing of 19-year-old winger Harmanpreet Singh from East Bengal on a free transfer.

20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vedant Mohan — a precocious talent||Vedant Mohan is a talented left-hander, very quick on his feet, training with good coaches in Spain, at the Soto Tennis Academy, Sotogrande. His parents Dhruv Mohan and Anisha Nair, were so impressed by the boy’s drive for tennis excellence that they left their jobs in Oman Airlines and Infosys to groom him in Spain. “They had options to train Vedant at the John McEnroe academy in the US, apart from academies in Australia and Spain. “They chose Spain as the boy got a considerable scholarship and Europe was viewed as the best place for tennis,” said the grandfather of Vedant, Air Commodore K.N.V. Nair, from Chennai. Even though the boy was nine years old, and entry was only for kids 12 years and above, McEnroe was willing to make an exception for Vedant after seeing his training / playing videos. It was, in fact, tennis ace Vijay Amritraj who had advised the parents after seeing the boy’s videos, to give him the best possible training. From the age of 7, Vedant — who started playing tennis in Muscat, where his father worked as a commercial pilot — has been winning matches and tournaments in the under-10 and under-12 age groups. As a 10-year-old he continues to win events above his age group in Spain. “The boy has technique equal to a 12-year-old. His maturity on court and mental strength are way above his age. “He is the most talented player I have ever coached. I see a bright future for him,” said coach Andrei Razwan of Romania, who has been coaching Vedant for a year. Two other coaches of the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) also believe that Vedant is ‘special’. “The tennis academy is in a village. So, the parents have no job opportunities there. They are spending from their savings to support the bright kid,” said the grandfather. The family hopes that Vedant would get matching support for his fledgling career, so that he can make a big mark in the game.  He is the most talented player I have ever coached.

20 July 2021||SILVERSTONE (UK),||Silverstone crash adds to escalating rivalry||It took a while for Max Verstappen’s Red Bull to be cleared off the Silverstone track at Sunday’s British Grand Prix, but the fallout from his crash with Lewis Hamilton will linger for the rest of the Formula One season. “It always takes two to tango, and these two are not giving each other an inch,” said Toto Wolff, Hamilton’s boss at Mercedes. The stewards agreed, judging Hamilton “predominantly” rather than “wholly” responsible and imposing a relatively light 10-second penalty. The delay to the race allowed Mercedes to repair Hamilton’s car. While he served his penalty in a pit stop and then hunted down leader Charles Leclerc to win the race, Verstappen went for checks. Hitting back From the hospital, Verstappen hit back on social media accusing Hamilton of “dangerous” and “disrespectful and unsportsmanlike” behaviour in his celebrations. Red Bull said their driver was given the all-clear to leave “without any major injuries” late on Sunday. Hamilton meanwhile told the pit-lane microphones Verstappen was the problem. “I don’t feel he needs to be aggressive as he is,” he said. “I would never back down from anyone. I will not be bullied into being less aggressive.”   While ‘Mad Max’ has been in Formula One since 2015, this is the first season he has threatened to wrest the crown from seven-time world champion ‘King Lewis’. Greatest vs upcoming “This is a championship where the greatest driver of all time, a seven-time world champion is fighting with a tool that is maybe not as good as the other car, driven by an up and coming star who is trying to make his mark,” said Wolff. “They collided and crashed. “We have seen that in days before and with all the great rivalries in history.” The victory ended a run of five Red Bull victories, four of them by Verstappen Horner accused Hamilton of putting “in jeopardy another driver’s safety” and said Hamilton’s victory was “hollow”. “The win doesn’t feel hollow,” replied Hamilton who had cut the Dutchman’s championship lead to eight points. There are 13 races still scheduled in a campaign in which the battle between the two heavyweights has been building since round one in Bahrain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/silverstone-crash-adds-to-escalating-rivalry/article35417399.ece
20 July 2021||Paris,||Tadej Pogacar —cycling’s boy next door||Tadej Pogacar rode into Paris in triumph on Sunday, celebrating a second successive Tour de France triumph in a victory for a ‘nice boy’ from Slovenia. Winning machine Off the bike, Pogacar is a smiling, polite and articulate 22-year-old who resembles the cartoon character Tintin, but morphs into an enthralling winning machine once in the saddle. With three stage wins on the 2021 Tour de France, Pogacar was fearless in the defence of his 2020 title, blowing away the old Sky-Ineos outfit that won seven titles in eight years. It is easy to see why the UAE Team Emirates made Pogacar one of the highest paid cyclists in the world.  Given the stage wins he has racked up on his three grand tours, three each on the 2019 Vuelta a Espana, and two consecutive Tours, Pogacar clearly has the will to win, the panache to launch ruthless attacks, the talent to make those attacks count, and the willpower to carry them through to fruition. In short he has a precious racing instinct that makes him dangerous once he’s in the saddle. Pogacar is one of four children from a small town 20km away from Ljubljana, his mother was a French teacher and his father an industrial designer. The initiation The double Tour de France champion’s elder brother Tilan initiated little ‘Tamau’ into cycling at age 9. He started on a bike that was too big for him, developing the handling skills that keep him in the saddle where others fall. As a boy cycling with his brother, his heroes were the Schleck brothers Andy and Frank from Luxembourg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tadej-pogacar-cyclings-boy-next-door/article35417414.ece

The diminutive 26-year-old, who came into prominence by securing the silver medal in 48kg with a total of 170kg at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, experienced ignominy in Rio as she recorded three ‘no lifts’ in clean and jerk following an 82kg effort in snatch. However, Mirabai bounced back to win the World title with an aggregate of 194kg in 2017 and improved her total (196kg) to take the 2018 Commonwealth Games gold in Gold Coast. Fighting back A lower back pain snatched away nearly a year from Mirabai, but the gritty lifter fought back to register 201kg in the revamped 49kg in the World championships in 2019. She bettered it (203kg) at the Nationals at Kolkata in 2020. Mirabai raised the bar further by aggregating 205kg, including a clean and jerk world record of 119kg, in the Asian championships in Tashkent this year. Notwithstanding the absence of North Korean Ri Song Gum, the second-ranked Mirabai is expected to be challenged by some rivals, including Hou Zhihui (China), Jourdan Elizabeth Dela Cruz (USA), and Beatriz Candelario (Dominican Republic). Mirabai, who has increased her performance by 35kg in the last seven years, is considered a strong medal prospect. She has been working on her snatch performance in order to give India its second weightlifting medal after 21 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mirabai-capable-of-a-podium-finish/article35417353.ece
20 July 2021||TOKYO,||Under-fire Olympic composer steps down||Keigo Oyamada, a Japanese composer working on the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony, resigned on Monday after coming under fire for bullying a classmate during his childhood. “I sincerely accept the opinions and advice I have received, express my gratitude, and will keep them in mind for my future actions and thoughts,” he said on his social media accounts. “I apologise from the bottom of my heart.” Reports of his past verbal abuse of a child with disabilities surfaced online recently, sparking a backlash on social media and demands for his resignation. The Tokyo Games organisers said on Sunday that he would stay on because he had shown remorse about his past actions. Oyamada, also known as Cornelius, apologised online last week. Some critics had said he should hold a news conference and apologise in person. Others also questioned why he hadn't apologized earlier. Oyamada, whose works have been compared to the American rock musician Beck, talked about the abuse in Japanese magazine interviews he gave in the 1990s. It was not immediately clear if the music for Friday's opening ceremony would be modified.

Hamilton was targeted following the Mercedes driver’s crash with rival Max Verstappen on the opening lap of Sunday’s British Grand Prix that sent the championship leader hurtling out of the race. “Formula One, the FIA and the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team condemn this behavior in the strongest possible terms,” the statement said. “These people have no place in our sport and we urge that those responsible should be held accountable for their actions. Diverse and inclusive “Formula One, the FIA, the drivers and the teams are working to build a more diverse and inclusive sport, and such unacceptable instances of online abuse must be highlighted and eliminated.” Verstappen’s team Red Bull also issued a statement criticising the attacks on Hamilton. “While we may be fierce rivals on-track, we are all united against racism,” the team said. “We condemn racist abuse of any kind towards our teams, our competitors and our fans. “As a team we are disgusted and saddened to witness the racist abuse Lewis endured yesterday on social media after the collision with Max. There is never any excuse for it. There is certainly no place for it in our sport and those responsible should be held accountable.” Dossier compiled It is understood that F1 is compiling a dossier of the offensive posts and will raise them directly with the platforms and call on them to take action.

Independent India’s first individual Olympics medal came from wrestling when K.D. Jadhav secured a flyweight bronze at Helsinki in 1952. Despite a rich wrestling tradition, India could not make an impression for several decades as some of its grapplers narrowly missed out on medals. Missing out Randhir Shindes (featherweight, 1920), Sudesh Kumar (flyweight, 1972), Prem Nath (bantamweight, 1972), Jagmender Singh (lightweight, 1980) and Rajinder Singh (welterweight, 1984) finished fourth when just the top three medals were awarded. Indian freestyle wrestlers began to shine in the quadrennial event after rules changed to give two bronze medals, via repechage rounds, in each weight division from the 2008 Games.

Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker who was awarded his Nobel in 2006 for pioneering micro-credit loans to impoverished people, has worked with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on a business program for athletes. “I think it has a very good case to establish itself as a candidate,” Yunus said in an online conference call ahead of receiving an Olympic award at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Games on Friday. Yunus cited North and South Korean athletes marching under one flag at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games as an example of the Olympics using sports to create peace. “If that is not peace-making I don’t know what it is,” Yunus said. “Definitely the Olympics has a tremendous reason to believe it can win the peace prize one day.”  Asked if sports should be rewarding or engaging with China, Yunus referred to the ancient tradition of the Olympic truce revived by the modern Olympics.

After Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan had failed to make the cut, the All India Tennis Association (AITA) had explored the possibility of pairing Bopanna with Sumit Nagal, after the latter earned a singles spot on Friday.

20 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protesting farmers refuse to budge||Their tents are broken and leaking, rotten vegetables are strewn all over the grounds, and the mattresses are soaking wet. Yet, nothing can budge the farmers protesting the Centre’s agriculture laws at Delhi’s borders. Protest sites at Tikri, Ghazipur and Singhu border witnessed heavy rain in the early hours of Monday. The farmers, however, said that no extreme weather can deter their will to continue the agitation. Jagseer Singh, the district president of Bharatiya Kisan Union from Barnala, who has been protesting at the Tikri border said that it started raining around 2 a.m. on Monday. “The tarpaulins, which protect the tents from the rains, were put up months ago. They are not equipped to hold rainwater, due to which most of them came down, resulting in water inside the tents,” he said. Sukhbir Singh from Patiala said, “Vegetables that were stored inside a trolley specially designed for them remained safe. But the rest along with the flour was destroyed. Cooking remained a big problem all through Monday.” He added that people spent the night on wet mattresses, “many protestors are lodging in wet trucks and trolleys”. Sukhwinder Singh Barwa from Ropar, who has been protesting at the Singhu border and is a member of Sanjhi Sathh – an initiative by protesters to help children study at the border – said water reached up to two feet on Monday. “It was impossible to walk. Many elderly people couldn’t get out of their trolleys for breakfast or lunch in the morning. We arranged food for them and delivered it in their trolleys,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/protesting-farmers-refuse-to-budge/article35417565.ece
20 July 2021||Gurugram,||Incessant rains wreak havoc in Gurugram||Incessant rains from the early hours of Monday up until the afternoon wreaked havoc on Millennium City. While water gushed inside houses and basements in several parts of the city, heavy waterlogging was reported from roads, intersections and underpasses on the highway. Meanwhile, water leakage through the roof of Ambience Mall forced the management to shut it down. One person drowned in an underpass for non-motorised transport at Rajiv Chowk, said Assistant Divisional Fire Officer Gulshan Kalra.

The Flood Control Room set up by the district administration received 127 complaints of waterlogging throughout the day.

Temple officer Yogdutt Sharma from Sector 4 said the rainwater had entered the temple premises and power supply to the shrine was cut to avoid any untoward incident. Hari Om, 70, a resident of Sector 7, said: “When I woke up at 5 a.m., I found my house inundated with two-three feet foul-smelling sewage water. I tried calling up the helplines, but there was no response,” said Hari Om, vice-president, BJP Zila Mandal. The underpasses on the National Highway at Rajiv Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Medanta and IFFCO Chowk were also inundated.

20 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks Centre’s reply on CHRI plea on registration suspension||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response from the Centre on a petition by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) challenging the suspension of its registration for 180 days for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA). The High Court also granted time to the Centre’s counsel to get instructions on permitting the CHRI to utilise 25% of the amount received as foreign funding till the suspension of its registration is revoked. The court also asked the Centre’s counsel to take instructions if it would allow CHRI to receive foreign fund in the future, subject to not utilising them without permission of the authorities or of the court. 180 days’ time During the hearing, Central government standing counsel Anil Soni said as per the rules, they have 180 days’ time to respond to the NGO seeking to revoke the suspension order. Justice Rekha Palli, however, said, “I am not going to give you this endless time of 180 days”. The CHRI had moved the court challenging a June 7 order passed by the Home Ministry, suspending its registration for 180 days. CHRI’s counsel said that the suspension order is contrary to the framework of the scheme set out under the Act and even the suspension was passed without initiating any inquiry and is liable to be set aside. The NGO said the suspension order has “completely paralysed” its functioning, “threatens the livelihood of its employees and casts a stigma on its reputation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-seeks-centres-reply-on-chri-plea-on-registration-suspension/article35417772.ece

Justice Mukta Gupta granted protection through the local police station and posted the case for further hearing on July 27.

The couple said they don’t want to apply for the solemnisation of marriage from their hometown. “As by doing it, both the families of the petitioner no. 1 and no. 2 will be informed by the police during the verification process,” the plea said. The couple said they are “scared of groups and individuals who are against interfaith marriage”. They said that the woman’s father has political influence and has many contacts in Lucknow, so they fear getting harmed. The couple said they want to solemnise their marriage under the Special Marriage Act as they want to practice their own respective religion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/interfaith-up-couple-gets-interim-protection/article35417552.ece

20 July 2021||July 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Tokyo drift: stadium to screen||It was August 2016. At the historic Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Japan promised to host an “innovative’’ Games in 2020, during the closing ceremony of the 31st Olympic Games. Shinzo Abe, the then Japanese Prime Minister, created a stir as he popped out of a green drainpipe, dressed as Super Mario, the star of the Nintendo video game series. To reach Rio in time, he was assisted by the beloved blue Doraemon cat with a pocket full of magic gadgets. Japan was optimistic about using technology to the hilt to host a memorable Games. And we felt lucky at the Maracanã to soak in the atmosphere. As athletes cheered and danced, and rain drenched the arena, Rio said, ‘ O brigado ’ and Japan said, “See you in Tokyo’’. Then came July 2020, when the coronavirus swept aside technology and human power. As the world stayed home and socially-distanced, the Olympics was postponed (pushing it closer to Paris 2024). And Japan got a new Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, to face the challenges. Now, a year on, even as we finish watching the Wimbledon on television in disbelief — shocked at spectators without masks, thanks to vaccinations and virus testing — Japan has rocked the world by announcing that it will host the Games without spectators. The novel coronavirus is causing havoc, triggering an emergency in Tokyo (only 15% of the Japanese have been fully vaccinated). In its attempt to deliver a “safe and secure Games”, Japan has wrenched the heart out of the Games.  Days of Games past  As a journalist who has attended four Olympics (starting with the 2004 Athens Games), I will miss the mood, the madness, and the camaraderie this year. When Usain Bolt ran in Beijing, London or Rio, the atmosphere was electric. Michael Phelps, the ‘Flying Fish’, may have won 23 gold medals (unmatched by any athlete in Olympic history), but it was ‘Lightning’ Bolt who captured the imagination of the world. His wins, and his most-imitated victory pose, always turned packed stadiums into melting pots of colour, noise and emotions. It is impossible to imagine a Bolt or Phelps performing in front of empty stands, with only television cameras to keep them company. For me, today’s virus-ruled virtual world triggers endless memories of the golden past. Of Bolt with his hand on my friend (former Deccan Herald sports editor) Rajeev Kolasseri’s shoulder, discussing cricket and Sachin Tendulkar, after a press conference in Beijing in 2008 — where the sprinter completed the 100 metres with a mind-blowing world record of 9.58 seconds. Or the day after when sport shooter Abhinav Bindra won India’s only individual gold in Beijing. We shared a taxi, going for lunch from the shooting range. Afterwards, Bindra had a photo shoot for Deccan Herald proprietor-photographer KN Shanth Kumar on the streets of Beijing — with the backdrop of the Bird’s Nest and the Water Cube, the iconic athletics and swimming venues. The Chinese people were happy to greet him and take photos with him. Such ease of interaction, between the athlete, the public and the media is impossible to imagine these days. The Olympic aura is unmatched. We had the privilege to watch the best of athletes, as we travelled to the various venues, and sent back reports while literally on the move. It was hard, but it was joyous. We often changed our plans too, in an instant. I remember when wrestler Sushil Kumar won the bronze in Beijing, it was unexpected. He had lost early, and we had lost interest. But then there was a repêchage, and when we learnt that he was fighting his way back to win a medal, we dropped everything, grabbed a taxi, and rushed to the venue. Now, journalists have been asked to list their entire plan even before they reach Tokyo, and no changes will be entertained.  Is it all worth it?  “In terms of organisation, Beijing was the best Games. But for sheer participation of sports-minded people, warm and friendly, Sydney [2000] was my favourite,” recalls Bindra, who has competed in the last five Games. “Competition and results are not the only thing at the Olympics. The community comes together, and the people of the host country create that atmosphere.’’ As a member of the athletes’ commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), he was scheduled to be in Tokyo, but he has opted out. “I won’t be going; I will attend the meetings remotely. I don’t want to burden the system,’’ says Bindra, perhaps equally wary of enduring four days of quarantine in Tokyo, apart from facing the numerous other restrictions. Hosting the Games leaves a financial blow on the city and country. Most of the money is spent on constructing the stadiums. Tokyo’s National Stadium (one of eight venues to be used) was completed at a cost of $1.25 billion! Of course, an Olympics without spectators could cost a lot less, if planned judiciously. But is an Olympics without people better than cancelling it, as was the case after World War II? For the athletes, who have waited five years to showcase their prowess, it is worth the trouble. For the people of Japan, whose tax money has played a significant role in putting the Games together, it is a sad blow to be kept out of the enthralling exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tokyo-drift-stadium-to-screen/article35417763.ece
