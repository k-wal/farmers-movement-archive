11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||As Taliban advance, India pulls out Kandahar consulate staff||As the Taliban’s claims about taking Afghan territory grow, India has decided to temporarily close its consulate in Kandahar, sending a special Indian Air Force flight to evacuate about 50 diplomats and security personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) back to Delhi, government sources confirmed to The Hindu . Officials said the move was purely precautionary, and stemmed from reports that if the Taliban continue to push on to the southern city of Kandahar, which was their headquarters in the 1990s, the fighting in the city with Afghan Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) could get fierce. “Our aim was to ensure that Indian personnel are safe, and we felt the risk of fighting within the city could endanger them,” an official told The Hindu , as a full security review of India’s missions in Afghanistan in the wake of the pull-out of American troops continues. At present, the Indian Embassy in Kabul and the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif in Balkh province remain operational. Evolving situation According to the officials, the personnel that returned to Delhi on Saturday would be transported back if the situation improves, while some may alternatively travel to Kabul to continue their consular operations from the Embassy, if required. In April last year, the government decided to suspend operations at the other two consulates in Jalalabad and Herat and pull all its personnel out from there as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amid-fighting-india-pulls-out-staff-from-kandahar-consulate/article35260307.ece

11 July 2021||NALGONDA,||Power generation stopped at Nagarjunasagar||With receding inflows from the upstream Srisailam Project, the TSGenco halted power generation at the Nagarjunasagar hydroelectric power plant on Saturday. According to officials, a total 140 million units of power was generated till Friday night since June 29, when the production first began. “About 16 million units were generated each day at the rate of 2.6 tmc water utilisation. As at closing of the production, 140 million units of power was generated,” Superintending Engineer (O&M) Raghu Ram told The Hindu . The Nagarjunasagar Project, a bone of contention between the Telugu States for respective Krishna water shares, had once again turned a ‘high tension zone’ on June 29 after TSGenco started early production of power. The last time the States faced off was in 2015, when police officials attacked each other in the Nagarjunasagar border town. However, the NSP soon evolved as a symbol of amity in August 2019, when the then State Education Minister G. Jagadish Reddy and AP Irrigation Minister Anil Kumar Yadav participated in the joint release of water to the left and right bank canals respectively. But the July power production proved that the unity was short-lived, evident in Mr. Reddy and Mr. Yadav’s heated statements, followed by the AP government passing a resolution, approaching the Centre and even its Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, against Telangana’s action. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, despite AP’s moves, had asserted that Telangana would put up an uncompromising fight for its rightful share of Krishna water. On Saturday, as per figures available till evening, the Nagarjunasagar Project was holding water at 529.20 feet as against its full reservoir level of 590 feet. The inflows from Srisailam Project were nil and the outflow was being maintained at 18,146 cusecs. At the K.L. Rao Sagar Pulichintala Project in the downstream of NSP, the water level stood at 171.25 feet and holding 40.16 tmcft water as against its full reservoir level of 175 feet and 45.77 tmcft capacity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/power-generation-stopped-at-nagarjunasagar/article35260860.ece

11 July 2021||ANANTAPUR,||Leopard cub rescued, dies on the way to Tirupati Zoo||A 45-day-old leopard cub got separated from its mother and fell into a farm pond in a mango plantation in Setturu village of Anantapur district on Friday and was rescued by Forest Department officials. The Kalyandurg, Rayadurg and Uravakonda forest areas (including unreserved revenue forests) are habitat for close to 40 leopards. It, however, died on Friday night while it was being taken to Tirupati Zoo. The cub apparently could not take the shock of human interaction and seven-hour journey to Tirupati. The carcass was brought back from Tirupati to Anantapur on Saturday and post-mortem conducted at the Nagara Vanam in Pampanur village. The carcass was consigned to flames in the presence of the DFO and other forest officials, said Rayadurg Forest Range Officer R. Ram Singh. After a farmer found the cub in the small pond on the farm on Friday, he informed the Forest Department officials, who kept the cub there till evening and sent it in a car to the Tirupati Zoo. The veterinary doctor, who conducted the post-mortem, said that though it was fed milk, it suffered shock and could not tolerate it. Its mother could not be traced and officials tried to keep it close to the nearby forest to help its mother claim her cub. But when it did not return for a long time, the officials sent the cub to the zoo. Minutes before reaching the destination, it died.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/leopard-cub-rescued-dies-on-the-way-to-zoo/article35260279.ece

Painted in blue and grey on the exterior, the coaches were the centre of attraction at Mangaluru Junction on Saturday. Officials and employees undertook a thorough inspection of the coaches. Dakshina Kannada district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and MP and State BJP President Nalin Kumar Kateel are scheduled to flag off the services at a small ceremony at 9 a.m. Both the coaches are fully booked for their maiden journey while 36 seats were available for their maiden journey from Yeshwantpur on Monday on Train No. 06211 Yeshwantpur-Karwar tri-weekly express special that short-terminates at Mangaluru Junction. While the coaches are fitted with state-of-the-art equipment including reclining and rotating seats, rotation of the seats involves both the seats. A single seat cannot be rotated, said an official. The seats could be rotated in a pair by 180 degrees, either facing the windows or facing the aisle. Reclining was available for individual seats. Apart from using the coaches to savour natural beauty during the journey, they could also be used for a gettogether or meetings when the seats are rotated facing the aisle, he felt.

11 July 2021||Belagavi,||Headmaster transforms school during COVID-19 lockdown||The chirping of birds greets visitors at the government lower primary school in Ambedkar Nagar in Nidagundi in Belagavi district. Sparrows have built their nests in the plastic pipes put up by the school. Veeranna Madiwalar, headmaster, is from Gadag district and he stayed back in the village during the COVID-19 lockdown and has been working to develop the school. He has used the extended lockdown to crowdfund development and has raised over Rs. 18.75 lakh. He and his team of students and parents have taken up several projects. The most important one was to double the size of the school premises. The school was built on a 10-gunta plot in a predominantly Dalit neighbourhood. Mr. Madiwalar decided to buy another patch of 10 guntas. The premises now has a full-fledged language laboratory, named in honour of writer K. Shivaram Karanth. Mr. Madiwalar, a Kendra Sahitya Akademi young poet award winner, wants to set up a full-fledged library, an online database, and a multi-media projector to help children learn multiple languages. “We have facilities to install around 20 computers. We have sent out requests to friends and well-wishers to donate new or used computers. Some people have promised help,” he says. The old school building has been cleaned up and repainted. The walls have paintings of landscapes, birds, flowers, fruits and animals, apart from illustrations based on subjects in textbooks. Most of them were painted by Mr. Madiwalar. “I have not only painted the walls, but also the windows, doors and grills,” he says. Mr. Madiwalar had plans to develop the school for many years, but they began taking share only after discussions with some friends and donors. “I met Ram Mohan Rao, a Bengaluru-based IT entrepreneur, in 2020. He listened to my plans and offered to help. He donated around Rs. 15 lakh. Then I requested P. Rajeev, MLA, who donated around Rs. 2.6 lakh from his personal funds. Some officers of the Education Department also donated money. We managed to raise some funds through appeals on social media,” he says. “With the funds, we not only bought some land, but also built the language laboratory,” he said. The land was bought in the name of the State government. He had observed that house sparrows, rarely seen in villages and towns, had built nests in the holes on walls and trees in the school premises. He put up some PVC pipes with holes for the sparrows to build nests. “In a few days, the sparrows and some other birds, began residing in our school. Now, we have increased the number of pipes. Our children are now growing up in the proverbial lap of nature. Our aim is not just to teach them to read and write. We should make sure that they don’t miss the simple joys of childhood. Coming to school should be joyful experience to them,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/headmaster-transforms-school-during-covid-19-lockdown/article35260585.ece
11 July 2021||GUNTUR,||A.P. to launch a campaign over water issue||The State government and the YSR Congress Party have decided to launch a campaign and step up pressure on Telangana over the drawal of water from Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala reservoirs. A virtual meeting held by Minister for Irrigation Anil Kumar Yadav and Adviser, Public Affairs, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, attended by MPs and MLAs, set the tone for an intense campaign which would voice the anguish of the lower riparian State of Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Anil Kumar said Telangana should abide by the meeting held after the bifurcation of the State and help in continuation of good relations between the two Telugu-speaking States. “Telangana should stop the illegal drawal of water and stick to the allotment of water by the Krishna River Water Management Board. Everyone in the party should condemn the chorus against Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme by Telangana Ministers,” he said. According to the agreement signed in the year 2015, Andhra Pradesh was allotted 512 tmcft of water and the State had been using it. Water was being drawn from Srisailam dam at 850 feet to the Pothireddypadu Lift Irrigation scheme at 44,000 cusecs, and when water level fell below 800 feet, it was not possible to draw water to the Pothireddypadu scheme, he said. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said it was difficult to believe that Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had been indulging in spreading falsehood against Andhra Pradesh. KCR had then supported the cause of Rayalaseema and now the party needed to expose his double speak, he said. “It is the intention of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy that we should explain to the people the reality and take the support of people in our fight. Telangana should stick to the agreement signed in 2015. We are again reiterating that we want cordial relations with Telangana. We do not want to take extra tmcft of water from the reservoirs,’’ said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy. Member of Parliament Lavu Srikrishnadevarayulu said he had met Union Minister for Jal Sakthi Gajendra Singh Shekawat and the latter had also agreed with their opinion. A meeting held between the then Chief Ministers KCR and N. Chandrababu Naidu ended in less than 90 seconds and the Minister said that he would ensure that the discussion ended on a fruitful note. MLA and Chief Whip G. Srikanth Reddy said that Mr. Jagan spoke of the distress of the people of the Rayalaseema region and also of the plight of Nalgonda and Mahaboobnagar region as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-to-launch-a-campaign-over-water-sharing-row/article35260280.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. infra spending dropped sharply in Q1||The second wave of COVID-19 and a steep decline in new investment projects from government agencies dented fresh investment plans in the economy by 18% in the first quarter of 2021-22, compared with the previous quarter. Despite the government’s stated push for capital spending to revive the economy, public infrastructure investments almost halved compared with the January-March quarter, bringing total outlays on new infrastructure plans down by nearly 39% over April to June this year. Almost 2,200 new projects entailing fresh investments of Rs. 3,34,572.5 crore were announced during the quarter, compared with 2,716 new projects worth Rs. 4,08,237 crore in the previous three-month period that had seen both private and public sector investments rebounding strongly for the first time since the pandemic hit India. Overall new investments from the Union and State governments fell 41.6% from nearly Rs. 1.67 lakh crore in Q4 of 2020-21 to Rs. 97,376 crore, as per Projects Today’s survey on project investments in India during Q1 of 2021-22. New public sector irrigation and manufacturing projects also fell off the cliff by 96% and 77% respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-infra-spending-sees-steep-fall-in-q1/article35260308.ece

Beef consumers Many in the Christian-majority States of Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland consume beef. While Mizoram and Nagaland have chosen not to react, the Meghalaya government said it would seek the Centre’s intervention if the Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, affects its people and economy. The Bill, approved by the Assam Cabinet on July 7, will be placed before the State Assembly in the upcoming session. It seeks to replace the existing Assam Cattle Preservation Act, 1950, that allows the slaughter of cattle above 14 years of age after approval from local veterinary officers. “We will raise the issue not only with the Assam government but also the Centre if the law affects transit of cattle to Meghalaya from other States,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/meghalaya-raises-concern-over-assam-cow-protection-bill/article35260309.ece

11 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Excise officials upset over promotions||There is deep discontent among several officials in the Telangana Prohibition and Excise department over long delays in promotions. While the officials have been eagerly waiting for it from the past several years, a recent development has agitated them — a Government Order promoting only 12 people. Sources said that the 12 people were juniors in their respective cadre and others who are senior to them have been sidelined. According to the GO number 184 issued on May 6, 2021, seven persons were promoted to the Superintendent posts, four to Assistant Commissioner, and one to Deputy Commissioner post. “Besides being unfair as seniority is not considered, this development can have huge impact in the future. The juniors who were promoted will become seniors. There is a chance they will have an advantage in the future promotions,” sources in the department said. “While there are seniors eligible for these posts, they were not promoted. Why were only a few selected for promotions?” sources questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/excise-officials-upset-over-promotions-to-few/article35260855.ece
11 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Weapons, phones seized in Bengaluru prison||In a massive operation, Bengaluru police, including the Central Crime Branch (CCB), conducted simultaneous raids on anti-social elements and habitual offenders across the city as well as at the central prison at Parappana Agrahara. As many as 2,144 houses in and around the city were raided early Saturday morning, and 1,514 anti-social elements and habitual offenders were detained and questioned as part of a special drive. At the same time, CCB teams and the dog squad raided the central prison around 5 a.m. and recovered weapons such as knives and daggers, marijuana, pendrives, mobile phones, and SIM cards from inmates. “The raids were carried out after we received credible information that several gangsters and rowdies were carrying out activities from inside the prison,” said a senior police official. Sources said the police were probing the possible involvement of prison officials who failed to check the narcotics. Another cause for concern is the number of mobile phones seized despite jammers in place. While refusing to comment on the security lapses at the prison, Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said the issue had been brought to the notice of the Director-General of Prisons and would be resolved. Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), said teams were analysing the pendrives, mobile phones, and SIM cards. Simultaneous raids were also conducted by the police at residences of history-sheeters and habitual offenders. The police seized 91 weapons such as daggers, knives, choppers, and machetes, and 12 kg of marijuana. “We recovered a huge number of lethal weapons and rounded up several habitual offenders. Enquiries are being conducted,” said a senior police officer. In Whitefield jurisdiction alone, the police conducted operations on the residences of 116 anti-social elements and recovered 2.5 kg of marijuana and weapons. By the end of the day, 409 cases were booked against anti-social elements and habitual offenders under the Arms Act and 48 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Mr. Pant said 561 anti-social elements had been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. “The operation was successful, and was carried out meticulously after working on information for many days,” he added. The police have also been cracking down on the sale of drugs in the city, increasing border checks, and inspecting premises of private courier firms that are often used to ship consignments of narcotics. According to Mr. Pant, in the last 12 months till June this year, the city police have arrested 31 anti-social elements under the Goonda Act while jurisdictional Deputy Commissioners of Police, using their special executive magistrate powers, registered 1,808 cases under various provisions of the Security Act. During this period, special drives were carried out from time to time and 1,571 habitual offenders were detained. They gave an undertaking not to be involved in any anti-social activities. “A total of Rs. 1.5 lakh was collected from four rowdies who violated the conditions of the undertaking and they were remanded in judicial custody, while some of them were externed for a year,” Mr. Pant said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/weapons-phones-and-marijuana-seized-in-bengaluru-central-prison-raid/article35260592.ece

However, the issue of mining and its impact on the dam, a lifeline of Old Mysore region and parts of Tamil Nadu, has been flagged several times earlier too. Activists point out that there is talk of “ban” on activity when the debate is hot, but it has only remained on paper, with multiple politicians having mining interests. Meanwhile, the Irrigation Department’s plans of having a study done on the impact of mining and quarrying on the dam, by a team of experts from Dhanbad-based Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), is yet to take off.

Nevertheless, the State could ill afford to extend the lockdown indefinitely. Kerala has to walk a tight rope between protecting life and livelihood. Hence, the government will ease restrictions in a phased manner. Further relaxations will be in lockstep with the average test positivity rate (TPR). Lesser the TPR, higher the relaxations. The weekend shutdown will continue until further notice. Public health experts warned the government against lifting lockdown regulations at a stroke. The State is nearing the goal of achieving herd immunity. It had ramped up vaccination. Mr. Vijayan said the 48-hour lockdown, night curfew, ban on social gatherings, indoor dining, inessential travel and group activities had yielded high dividends on the pandemic control front. The second COVID-19 wave had hit Kerala in May after it raged for two months in the northern States. On the crest of the wave, the TPR rate in Kerala was 29%.

Only laterite mining is being done. Even the mining of laterite is being done as per the judgment of the High Court and we are placing all the documents in public domain. The government has no intention to do bauxite mining in the Visakhapatnam region,” said Mr. Dwivedi. The GSI report had stated that laterite was available in 121 acres at Nathavaram village, he said and added that the previous government had given six leases and the High Court had given a judgment on August 18, 2018 denying permission to one such lease. The lease was revived on February 5, 2021 as per the guidelines of the Court, said Mr. Dwivedi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-illegal-bauxite-mining-in-visakha-agency/article35260301.ece

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Four brothers in one government||To track the Rajapaksa family tree is to track the most important positions in the Sri Lankan government. With the recent appointment of Basil Rajapaksa, the youngest of the Rajapaksa brothers, as the country’s new Minister of Finance, Sri Lanka’s first family has further fastened its clasp on power. The Cabinet has five Rajapaksas — President Gotabaya Rajapaksa (who is also Defence Minister), Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Irrigation Minister Chamal Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa, and PM’s son and Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa. The government has a few more, holding junior ministerial posts and key positions in state-run institutions. They remind sceptics of “family bandyism”, a term commonly used in Sri Lanka in the past, to refer to the Bandaranaike ruling clan. Together, the Rajapaksas in government control a substantial chunk of the budget and policy. For the near 22-million people of the country, this means being steered by one powerful family. One that derives political legitimacy from its core support base of Sinhala-Buddhist nationalists, with a known suspicion of Tamil and Muslim minorities and an unmistakable aversion to their rights. For the family, this means a seat at the country’s helm, even if it must navigate mounting challenges facing the administration — at a time when the country is still emerging out of its long civil war and into a fast-aggravating economic crisis — and preparing the ground for their respective bids to power in future. At the centre of Sri Lanka’s Rajapaksa brand of politics is Prime Minister and former two-time President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Though his father D.A. Rajapaksa was a prominent politician in the island’s southern region, it was Mr. Mahinda who elevated the family’s profile to the national and international arena. As the “war victor” under whose leadership the LTTE was decimated, he became the camp’s reliable political mascot with wide appeal in the country’s Sinhala majority south. Following a decade in office, he was defeated by his former colleague Maithripala Sirisena, who defected to form an unlikely coalition with the Opposition and became President in 2015. At that time, Mr. Mahinda may have taken a step back, just briefly, only to bounce back at the earliest opportunity. He saw one in October 2018, during Sri Lanka’s infamous “constitutional crisis”, when President Sirisena sacked then PM Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointed Mr. Mahinda to the post. However, with the Supreme Court ruling that the move was illegal, Mr. Mahinda was forced to resign, in less than eight weeks after his sudden appointment. A year later, the Rajapaksas did capture power with a resounding victory in the presidential polls. Except, it was a new Rajapaksa at the forefront. A two-term cap on Presidency, introduced by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration, barred Mr. Mahinda from contesting for the country’s highest office. ‘The doer’ With a class of professionals and elite businessmen propping him up as a fresh face and “doer”, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 72, hit the campaign trail promising “vistas of prosperity and splendour” that found wide resonance among Sinhala Buddhist voters. Monks supporting him likened the former military man to Adolf Hitler, and his brother Mr. Basil called him a “Terminator” who would end corruption. The remarks, obviously, were meant as compliments. But minorities feared him. Mr. Gotabaya is not only credited with helping defeat the LTTE but is also linked to several allegations of rights violations during and after the war. He is accused of having run “death squads” targeting dissidents, including journalists. He has denied the allegations, but is yet to inspire confidence among minorities as their emphatic vote against him showed. There is little indication that President Gotabaya worries about how minorities perceive him. While Mr. Mahinda and Mr. Gotabaya were prominent faces in public, Mr. Basil, relatively less visible, was working behind the scenes, building their new party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Front), enticing willing defectors from the Opposition, crafting its poll campaign and skilfully ensuring their return to and consolidation of power, in both the 2019 presidential and 2020 parliamentary elections. If Mr. Mahinda’s former terms in power, from 2005 to 2015, were marked by his powerful leadership, with Mr. Basil [then a Presidential Adviser and Economic Development Minister] and Mr. Gotabaya [then Secretary to the Ministry of Defence] reporting to him, 2019 brought out a different dynamic among the brothers. While Mr. Mahinda is still their repository of political capital, Mr. Gotabaya displaced him from the position of sole leader, and Mr. Basil commanded greater influence as a chief strategist. Appointed as Prime Minister after the August 2020 general elections, the 75-year-old Mr. Mahinda was relegated to the second spot, with younger brother Mr. Gotabaya wielding greater power as Executive President, only enhanced by the 20th Amendment passed by his government in October 2020. And last week, Mr. Basil, 70, took over the finance portfolio from Mr. Mahinda, who has, in turn, been given a newly created, but apparently less powerful Economic Policies and Planning Ministry. Economic challenges At one level, it may seem like a game of musical chairs played by members of the Rajapaksa clan, each with their own, distinct strength and baggage. But read within the larger context of the country’s economic crisis, the challenge of the pandemic’s third wave, and a growing disenchantment among people, including Rajapaksa voters, in the face of acute economic distress is bound to test the brothers’ collective political mettle. Ensuring smooth governance at such a time is only one of their problems, as political pressures surface periodically, even if not from the Opposition that is neither coherent nor formidable yet. The pressure often emerges from within the administration, manifesting in frequent clashes between different interest groups, their loyalties, and in their clamour for influence. President Gotabaya is under considerable pressure. He must prove to his supporters that he is the “doer” they backed. Whether the military men — over two dozen — he appointed to key administrative posts, or the bureaucracy, with sections reportedly feeling sidelined, will help him accomplish the urgent tasks ahead of him remain to be seen. He has not ruled out a second term. As for Mr. Basil, his supporters see him as the country’s leader in waiting. They are not perturbed by the fact that he is also an American citizen, or that he faced corruption allegations in the past. A 2007 U.S. Embassy cable published by WikiLeaks called him “Mr. Ten percent”, citing commissions he allegedly took from government contracts. In his backers’ view, he is the “saviour” the country needs. Meanwhile, the youngest Rajapaksa in the Cabinet, Mr. Namal, 35, and projected as Mr. Mahinda’s political heir, is seen to be working hard, both within the scope of his Ministries — he holds a state ministry too — and outside. Tapping the social media audience that he steadily built over the last few years, he communicates regularly and clearly, drawing many young supporters. Sporting the trademark maroon shawl worn by his father and two uncles, Mr. Namal too is said to have set his eyes on the country’s top office. Amid this apparent contest within the family, President Gotabaya, speaking at a public event in March, said the Rajapaksa siblings stand “firmly united”, and vowed they would take Sri Lanka forward. Despite differences and fissures, the brothers have indeed stood together so far.  In Focus At the centre of Sri Lanka’s Rajapaksa brand of politics is Prime Minister and former two-time President Mahinda Rajapaksa Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was the Defence Secretary in the Mahinda administra- tion, is now the President and Mahinda is the Prime Minister While Mahinda and Gotabaya are prominent faces in public, Basil is seen to be the organisation man, who played a key role in building their party, SLPP   While Mahinda is still their repository of political capital, Gotabaya has displaced him from being the sole leader even as Basil enjoys greater influence as a chief strategist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-brothers-in-one-government/article35260261.ece
11 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. law panel moots proposals to promote two-child norm||The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission has prepared a proposed draft Bill for population control, under which a two-child norm will be implemented and promoted. After the law comes into force, a person with more than two children will be debarred from several benefits such as government-sponsored welfare schemes and from contesting elections to the local authority or any body of the local self-government, the draft says. Ration card units will be limited to four persons. A person contravening the law will also become ineligible to apply for State government jobs and be barred from promotion in government services and any kind of subsidy. The provisions will come into force one year after the date of the publication of the gazette, the draft says. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will on July 11 launch the Uttar Pradesh Population Policy 2021-2030 on the occasion of World Population Day. Sops for sterilisation The Commission has uploaded the proposed draft Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021 and invited suggestions till July 19. As per the draft, several incentives have been provided to people, including public servants, if they adopt the norm by undergoing voluntary sterilisation. The incentives include a 3% increase in the employer’s contribution fund under national pension; two additional increments during the entire service; subsidy towards purchase of plot or house site or building a house; rebate on charges for utilities such as water, electricity and house tax; and soft loan for construction or purchasing a house at nominal rates of interest. A public servant or common citizen who adopts a one-child norm will receive additional benefits such as free health care facility and insurance coverage to the child till age 20; preference to the single child in admission in all education institutions, including but not limited to the Indian Institutes of Management and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences; free education up to the graduation level; scholarship for higher studies in case of a girl child and preference to a single child in government jobs. Cash incentive A couple living below the poverty line who have only one child and undergoes voluntary sterilisation, shall be eligible for payment of a one-time Rs. 80,000 if the single child is a boy and Rs. 1 lakh if it is a girl. Explaining the reasons for bringing out the draft Bill, the Commission headed by Justice Aditya Nath Mittal said there were limited ecological and economic resources at hand in Uttar Pradesh and it was necessary to control and stabilise the population for the promotion of sustainable development with more equitable distribution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-law-panel-moots-proposals-to-promote-two-child-norm/article35260228.ece
11 July 2021||new delhi,||Keen to empower co-ops: Shah||The Union government is determined to make cooperatives and all cooperative institutions more empowered, said Union Minister Amit Shah, who met some leading figures of the country’s cooperative sector on Saturday. The meeting came three days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reallocated the portfolios of his Ministers. Mr. Shah was given charge of the newly created Ministry of Cooperation. Those who met the Union Home Minister included National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI) chairman Dileep Sanghani; chairman and managing director of Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO) B.S. Nakai and U.S. Awasthi, respectively; and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) chairman Bijender Singh. “Today met @ncuicoop Chairman Shri Dileep Sanghani ji , @IFFCO_PR Chairman Shri B.S. Nakai ji , Managing Director Shri U.S. Awasthi ji and @nafedindia Chairman Dr. Bijendra Singh ji ... Under the leadership of Modi ji , we are determined to make cooperatives and all cooperative institutions more empowered,” Mr. Shah tweeted in Hindi. Officials added that even though Mr. Shah had not yet assumed charge of the Ministry of Cooperation, he had begun to meet people. In the meeting, the Minister asked cooperatives such as IFFCO and KRIBHCO to work in the field of seed production using vacant land of 38,000 hectares as well as in organic farming, the NCUI said in a separate statement. ‘Strengthening co-ops’ He also promised that the Union government was committed to strengthening the cooperative movement in the country, the benefits of which would go to the grassroots-level cooperatives, it said. Mr. Shah also assured the delegation that the same benefits and concessions given to Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) would be provided to primary agriculture cooperatives in the country for strengthening them, it added. In the meeting, the Minister desired that a conference with representatives of State-level cooperatives should be organised by NCUI, IFFCO and other cooperatives for discussing pertinent issues confronting the cooperative movement. The delegation apprised the Minister of the problems and challenges confronting the cooperative movement. The Union government had carved out the new Ministry for Cooperation, which earlier was a small department in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keen-to-empower-co-ops-shah/article35260234.ece
11 July 2021||New Delhi,||Calibrated opening up is key: Centre||The Union government has informed the Delhi High Court that it has asked all States and Union Territories (UTs) to ensure strict compliance with the national directives for COVID-19 management and take necessary measures under the Disaster Management Act. An order was also issued to them to consider the implementation of targeted and prompt actions for COVID-19 management until July 31, the Union government has said. The government also stated that while the opening of activities after a decline in COVID-19 cases was essential, States and UTs must ensure that “the whole process was carefully calibrated”. The statement was made in a status report filed by the Union government through its standing counsel, Anil Soni, in connection with the High Court’s suo motu proceedings on violation of COVID-19 protocols in various markets in the national capital. The Union government submitted that national directives for COVID-19 management included face masks, social distancing, not spitting in public places, working from home, staggering of work/business hours, screenings and frequent sanitisation. Clarifying that the decision to impose or ease restrictions had to be based on an assessment of the ground situation, the Union government added that State/UT authorities should ensure that there was “continuous focus on containment efforts” and “uniformity in implementing graded restrictions/relaxations”. The High Court was also informed that the “framework for implementation of prompt and target action” was also shared by the Union government with the States. The framework, the government said, had a “five-fold strategy for effective management of COVID-19”, — test, track, treat, vaccinate and adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour. The framework also emphasised that “COVID-19 management can succeed only through a whole of government and whole of society approach”. The States were nonetheless at liberty to plan additional public health measures based on their local situation, it said. The Union government also submitted that a letter was addressed to the Chief Secretaries of all States and Administrators of UTs, stressing effective management of COVID-19 by following advisories issued by the Home and Health Ministries. A Vacation Bench of the High Court had initiated a public interest litigation (PIL) petition last month after it took note of certain photographs sent to one of the High Court judges on WhatsApp by an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) doctor showing scant regard for COVID-19 protocols by street vendors in markets. The court had observed that such breaches would only hasten the third wave of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/calibrated-opening-up-is-key-centre/article35260248.ece
11 July 2021||Patna,||Chirag taunts Paras on Cabinet berth; says will reclaim party||Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan on Saturday paid a backhanded compliment to estranged uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras by congratulating him on joining the Union Cabinet, which, he said, was a goal the latter achieved by breaking up his own family. The beleaguered LJP leader, who has suffered a setback with the Delhi High Court rejecting his petition challenging the election of Mr. Paras as the party leader in the Lok Sabha, said: “I am not going to give up my fight to reclaim the party nurtured by my late father Ram Vilas Paswan’s blood and sweat.” In an oblique reference to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who he suspects of engineering the putsch in the LJP, Mr. Paswan said, “I cannot allow the party to be taken over by those who, because of personal ambitions, are sitting in the lap of people who did not deign to come out with even a tweet on my father’s birth anniversary recently.” The Jamui MP also hinted at his disillusionment with the BJP, which has kept silent over the crisis in the LJP despite his unreserved adulation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. When asked by reporters whether he still considered himself a Hanuman to Mr. Modi, akin to the relationship between the Lord Hanuman and Lord Ram, Mr. Paswan cryptically replied: “This is a question you need to ask when elections are round the corner.” Charm offensive The 38-year-old, who has been reaching out to the family of his late father from the first marriage, also said, “I feel overwhelmed by emotions. After the death of my father and the betrayal of my family members, many other dear relatives have come out in my support.” In Bihar since Monday as part of his ‘Ashirwad Yatra’, Mr. Paswan has paid visits to his step-sisters and stepmother in his native district of Khagaria, in a charm offensive to win over his close relations. The former Bollywood actor has in the past been accused of condescension towards them. “I am not a legal expert. So I will not comment much upon the Delhi High Court’s order until a meeting with my legal team in the national capital. But I am not going to give up,” he asserted. Mr. Paswan opened a front against the Bihar Chief Minister ahead of the Assembly polls last year, claiming that the people of the State wanted a change in leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chirag-taunts-paras-on-cabinet-berth-says-will-reclaim-party/article35260724.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A bump in the road||What was meant to be a moment of pride for one of China’s Internet giants turned, in a matter of days, into an epic car-crash. On June 30, the ride-hailing app Didi, which dominates the China market, raised $4.4 billion in its much anticipated listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest Chinese listing since Alibaba raised a record $25 billion in 2014. Didi’s IPO valued the company at $73 billion. Within a week, Didi would have not only lost more than one-fifth of its market value, but found itself facing the threat of lawsuits from angry U.S. investors as Chinese authorities, days after the IPO, said they were investigating the company over its use of data, citing privacy and national security concerns. On July 9, Chinese regulators then took an extraordinary step of banning the country’s biggest ride-hailing app from registering new users, as well as removing 25 of its apps from app stores. An uncertain fate now awaits Didi, which has pledged to cooperate with the authorities. The rise and sudden fall of Didi is the latest episode of a tug-of-war between the Communist Party and big tech companies, which burst into global attention in November when the IPO of Alipay, the financial payments arm of Alibaba, was suspended in Shanghai at the last minute. A number of investigations into tech companies then followed, with regulators taking aim at both monopolistic practices and the wealth of data that companies have accumulated. Didi’s story began in 2012, when founder Cheng Wei launched an app in Beijing for hailing taxis, called Didi Dache. In 2015, the company merged with another hailing app, Kuaidi Dache. Thus was born Didi Kuaidi, later renamed Didi Chuxing (or Didi, for short). Didi expanded beyond taxis to a range of services, from carpools to even luxury limos. Today, Didi corners a dominant share of the market in China — estimates range from 80 to 90% — along with an expanding global footprint in 16 countries, with a presence across Latin America, as well as in Australia, Japan and Russia. It has close to 500 million active users and around 15 million drivers, three times as many drivers as on Uber (although Uber is valued higher). After a bruising battle for the China market with Uber, Didi emerged on top, acquiring its rival Uber China in 2016. Uber is among its major investors today, along with SoftBank, Alibaba and Tencent. Roadblocks In 2018, Didi’s safety protocols became a matter of wide debate in China. A woman using its hitch-a-ride service was murdered by a driver in Shenzhen, and three months later that year another woman was raped and murdered by a driver in Zhejiang. Both drivers were sentenced to death, and the company suspended the hitch service. The company promised to tighten its safety protocols. It also rolled out a service the following year seen as aimed at pleasing the Communist Party, that allowed passengers to choose to be driven by “verified party members” as it identified which drivers were members of the Communist Party. Following the Didi IPO, authorities have said they will tighten oversight on how companies can list overseas. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which is leading the battle to tame tech companies citing their use of personal data, is now considering “a new regulation requiring companies with more than 1 million users’ data to apply for a cybersecurity review before seeking listing overseas”, the Party-run Global Times reported. “The government will not allow internet giants to become rules-makers of data collection and usage,” the newspaper said. China’s tech giants have seen “a combined $823 billion wiped from their market value since a February peak”, according to Bloomberg, coinciding with the raft of measures aimed at tightening control including anti-trust investigations. In the last 10 years, as tech companies grew rapidly, data regulation in particular has become a priority issue for President Xi Jinping and the Party, notes Santosh Pai, an honorary fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies in New Delhi who studies Chinese regulatory issues. “This is a pattern we have seen, from Alipay to Didi. Data, for the party, is becoming a national treasure.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-bump-in-the-road/article35260263.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Business and politics||Kitex Group, a Kerala-based business group with a market capitalisation of around Rs. 930 crore that makes a range of products from garments to curry powder, has run into a stand-off with the State government in recent weeks over raids at one of its factories. Kitex, which also founded a political organisation that won several seats in the 2015 and 2020 local body elections, has alleged harassment by government agencies. On Friday, Telangana Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao, after meeting a delegation from the company headed by managing director Sabu M. Jacob, announced that Kitex Group will invest Rs. 1,000 crore in Warangal. On June 29, Mr. Jacob said the group was withdrawing from a proposal to invest Rs. 3,500 crore to build an apparels park and three industrial parks (Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Palakkad) with a total job potential of 35,000. The proposal was submitted by the group at Ascent Kerala (investors’ conference) in January 2020. The group, based in Kizhakkambalam, about 25 km east of Kochi, has a string of enterprises with a total sales of around Rs. 1,700 crore. Kitex Group employs around 15,000 people, drawn from across India. Mr. Jacob said Kitex had invitations from other States as well as Bangladesh. Raids at factory He said he was “disappointed” with Kerala where it is hard to run businesses. In June, State agencies raided Kitex Garments factory premises 11 times. Most of the raids lasted three to four hours. The 26-year-old company was “being treated like a band of thieves and scoundrels”, he said, and pointed out that Kerala was almost at the bottom in the “ease of doing business” rankings in the country. Kitex Group was founded 53 years ago by M.C. Jacob, who passed away in June 2011, aged 78. His son Bobby M. Jacob heads the Anna Kitex group with domestic operations as well as exports to West Asia and Europe. The group manufactures aluminium products, including pressure cookers, curry powders and school bags. Kitex Garments, headed by Mr. Sabu, looks after exports to the U.S. The garments company is about a quarter century old. The company had complained of harassment from the government in the past as well. One notable incident in 2012 involved the Kizhakkambalam panchayat, which served a stop memo notice on the garments unit following complaints from residents in the neighbourhood about effluent from the dyeing and bleaching units flowing into waterbodies. The then State government under the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) negotiated a truce to allow operations to continue. Then in 2013, Kitex Group formed Kizhakkambalam Twenty20, a voluntary body using CSR funds with the declared aim of turning Kizhakkambalam panchayat into “the best in India” by 2020. In the 2015 local bodies elections, Twenty20 fielded candidates in all the 19 wards of the panchayat. It won 17 of the 19 council seats, stunning both the Left Democratic Front, led by the CPI(M), and the UDF. Since then, the group has increased its political presence in the State. In the 2020 local bodies elections, Twenty20 won 18 of the 19 seats in the Kizhakkambalam panchayat. It also spread its influence to neighbouring panchayats — Mazhuvannoor, Aikaranad and Kunnathunad, where it won a comfortable majority. Twenty20 also tested its popularity in the May 2021 Assembly election, though none of its candidates made it to the Assembly. While Twenty20 appeared to be gaining political mileage, P.T. Thomas, of the Congress party, accused the company of being mainly responsible for polluting the Kadambrayar, a river that is a drinking water source for thousands of people in Kizhakkambalam and neighbouring areas. A resolution was also passed in the District Development Committee, backed by two other MLAs, to have a special session on pollution caused by the company. With Twenty20 securing political space, many have described the present developments as a political rivalry between Kitex and mainstream parties. Others have said corporations taking up political space would be detrimental to the democratic values of society.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/business-and-politics/article35260265.ece
11 July 2021||Tbilisi,||India hands over relics to Georgia||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Saturday attended the formal handing- over ceremony of the holy relics of 17th century queen St. Ketevan to Georgia, nearly 16 years after they were found in Goa, describing such historical objects as a “bridge of faith” between the two countries. Mr. Jaishankar is on a two-day visit to Georgia, a strategically important country situated at the intersection of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. “Today is a special day, not only for Georgia but also for India. I have the honour to hand over the holy relics of St. Queen Ketevan to the people of Georgia,” Mr. Jaishankar said at the ceremony at the Sameba Holy Trinity Cathedral. “I consider myself blessed that the purpose of my first visit to Georgia is such an auspicious one,” he said. Mr. Jaishankar handed over the relics of St. Queen Ketevan to the government and the people of Georgia at a ceremony in Tbilisi in the presence of Beatitude Ilia II, Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, and Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili. St. Queen Ketevan was a 17th century Georgian Queen. Her relics were found in 2005 at the St. Augustine Convent in Old Goa, on the basis of medieval Portuguese records, people aware of the matter said. “The presence of some of the relics in India and Georgia is a bridge of faith between our two countries. I hope that in the coming years, the people of both of our nations will traverse that bridge, of spirituality as much as of friendship,” Mr. Jaishanakar said. The relics are believed to have been brought to Goa in 1627 and interred in St. Augustine Complex. At the instance of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, carried out DNA analysis that confirmed its authenticity, the people cited above said. In 2017, at the request of the Georgian government, India sent the relics to Georgia for an exhibition for six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-hands-over-relics-to-georgia/article35260219.ece
11 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||BJP wins big in U.P. block-level polls||The ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday claimed victory in 635 out of 825 block pramukh posts in the State even as the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) accused the State government of misusing its administrative machinery to “forcefully capture” the posts in the high-intensity elections. Meanwhile, the voting and nomination for the polls were marred by scuffles, clashes and firing in some districts, including Etawah where an officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police, City, was allegedly slapped while trying to prevent a crowd of BJP supporters from breaching the barricade near a polling booth. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the BJP and its ally, the Apna Dal, were set to win 635 seats. Out of the 825 seats that went to the polls in 74 districts, the BJP had candidates backed by it on 735 seats and the Apna Dal in 14, while on 76 seats the BJP had friendly fights, Mr. Adityanath said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated his party workers and Mr. Adityanath for the victory. “The benefits that the public got from the Yogi Adityanath government’s politics and schemes for public welfare have been reflected in the party’s massive victory,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Adityanath, in turn, said the victory was a result of the faith of the people in Mr. Modi’s “mantra of Sabka Saath , Sabka Vikas , Sabka Vishwas ”. The State police said incidents of clashes, sloganeering and scuffles were reported in 17 districts. SP president Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the BJP used its power to get votes in its favour, and that block pramukh candidates and kshetra panchayat members were openly kidnapped in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-wins-big-in-up-block-level-polls/article35260548.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vietnam appoints first Honorary Consul in India||As part of Vietnam’s efforts to deepen cooperation with various States, industrialist N.S. Srinivasa Murthy, based in Bengaluru, has been appointed Honorary Consul-General of Vietnam for Karnataka. “He is the first Honorary Consul-General of Vietnam from India and the 19th across the world. He is the third Consul-General to be appointed globally this year,” said Vietnamese Ambassador in India Pham Sanh Chau, addressing a small gathering amid COVID=19 protocols. The appointment is for a period of three years. Mr. Murthy is the owner and managing partner of N. K. Subbiah Setty & Sons, which has been manufacturing agarbattis (incense sticks) since 1932. Speaking at the event, Mr. Murthy said his endeavour will be to promote trade between Vietnam and South India and in particular Karnataka. Bilateral ties In a telephonic conversation on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Pham Minh Chinh on his appointment as Prime Minister of Vietnam and expressed confidence that the India-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) will continue to become stronger under his able guidance. “PM Modi welcomed the fact that both countries share a similar vision of an open, inclusive, peaceful and rules-based Indian Ocean Region, and hence the India-Vietnam CSP can contribute to promote regional stability, prosperity and development,” statement from the Ministry of External Affairs said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vietnam-appoints-first-honorary-consul-in-india/article35260222.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Biden nominates Garcetti as Ambassador to India||U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday nominated Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to the post of Ambassador to India. Mr. Garcetti’s nomination, which had been expected for weeks, was announced by the White House as part of a set of ambassadorial nominations. Mr. Garcetti, 50, who has been the Mayor of Los Angeles since 2013, is a former intelligence officer from the Navy and is a Rhodes Scholar. He also served on the California Board of the Human Rights Watch, a rights advocacy organisation that has frequently criticised the Indian government’s rights record. Mr. Garcetti, in a statement, said he was honoured to accept the nomination and would “forge partnerships and connections that will help strengthen Los Angeles’ place on the world stage”. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Garcetti would replace Kenneth Juster, a Trump appointee who was the Ambassador till January. The Embassy in New Delhi is being run by interim Chargé d’affaires Atul Keshap, a South Asia hand and senior career diplomat. Mr. Garcetti’s closeness to Mr. Biden is seen as a key factor in his nomination. Having someone in New Delhi who “can call Joe” is important to both New Delhi and Washington. “We are excited that President Biden has nominated a reputed leader who has proven himself on several fronts,” said M.R. Rangaswami, a Silicon Valley-based investor, who runs a diaspora organisation called Indiaspora. “It speaks volumes to the importance of the U.S.-India relationship that a close and trusted ally of President Biden may be America’s point person in Delhi.” The India-U.S. relationship has strong support on both sides of the aisle in Washington, though it is not without its critics, particularly with regard to the Modi government’s record on democratic processes and minority rights. As India experienced its second wave of COVID-19 earlier this summer, the U.S. government, the private sector and individuals contributed over $500 million in assistance, according to U.S. government estimates. The defence and security dimensions have also been growing. While bilateral trade has been growing, the trading relationship has had challenges, especially around data flows, agricultural commodities and preferential trade status for India. The two countries have sought to develop their relationship via multilateral forums (such as the U.N. Security Council) and smaller “plurilateral” groupings such as the Quad — India, the U.S., Japan and Australia. Plans are in the works for a summit level in-person meeting of the Quad likely to be held in Washington this autumn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/biden-nominates-garcetti-as-ambassador-to-india/article35260243.ece
11 July 2021||Kolkata,||Sikkim blossoms: State home to 27% of India’s flowering plants||Sikkim, the smallest State with less than 1% of India’s landmass, is home to 27% of all flowering plants found in the country, reveals a recent publication by the Botanical Survey of India (BSI). Flora of Sikkim – A Pictorial Guide , released earlier this week, lists 4,912 naturally occurring flowering plants in the tiny Himalayan State. “The total number of naturally occurring flowering plants in the country is about 18,004 species, and with 4,912 species, the diversity of flowering plants in Sikkim, spread over an area of 7,096 sq. km is very unique,” Rajib Gogoi, Scientist and Regional Head, BSI, Gangtok, and the lead author of the publication, said. Dr. Gogoi said the publication provides details of 5,068 taxa (including 152 cultivated taxa) belonging to 1,491 genera and 209 angiosperm families which are naturally occurring flowering plants, along with geography, ecology, vegetation pattern and forest types of Sikkim. The other authors of the publication include Norbu Sherpa, J.H. Franklin Benjamin, D.K. Agrawala, S.K. Rai and S.S. Dash. In the 582-page publication, the authors have included more than 2,000 photographs of about 1,350 plant species from the State. Kanchenjuga biosphere The State, which is a part of the Kanchenjunga biosphere landscape, has different altitudinal ecosystems, which provide opportunity for herbs and trees to grow and thrive. “From subalpine vegetation to the temperate to the tropical, the State has different kinds of vegetation, and that is the reason for such a diversity of flora. The elevation also varies between 300 metres and 8,598 metres above mean sea level, the apex being the top of Mt. Kanchenjunga (8,586 metres),” Ashiho A. Mao, Director of BSI, said. Dr. Mao emphasised the need to have updated checklist of flora of every State, and active cooperation with the State government is needed in this regard. Sikkim’s Minister of Forest and Environment Karma Loday Bhutia, who was present at the launch of the publication, said that along with unique geographical features, the people of Sikkim have a unique bond with nature and trees. The Minister referred to the notification titled Sikkim Forest Tree (Amity & Reverence) Rules, 2017 which state that the, “State government shall allow any person to associate with trees standing on his or her private land or on any public land by entering into a Mith/Mit or Mitini relationship.” The notification encouraged people to adopt a tree “as if it was his or her own child in which case the tree shall be called an adopted tree”. Mr. Bhutia, however, expressed concern that certain activities in the mountain State were being carried out without considering their impact on the environment and biodiversity. “The widening of roads to Nathu La, which is of strategic interest to us (bordering China), and the hydel power plants in north Sikkim, should also take into account the environmental concerns of locals. We are not against such activities, but it should not come at the cost of our biodiversity,” the Minister said. Orchids galore The publication details 532 species of wild orchids (which is more than 40% of all orchid species found in India), 36 species of rhododendron and 20 species of oak, and more than 30 species of high value medicinal plants, among other species. Mr. Gogoi said that the founding fathers of botany were always interested in the flora of Sikkim. Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, one of the pioneers of modern botany, conducted the first survey of Sikkim in 1848 and published Rhododendrons of Sikkim . In 1898, two British botanists, Sir George King and Robert Pantling, published their monumental work, The Orchids of Sikkim-Himalayas .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sikkim-blossoms-state-home-to-27-of-indias-flowering-plants/article35260257.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Interpol seeks joint fight against ransomware||Senior police officers of the Interpol’s member countries have endorsed measures to boost the role of its National Central Bureaus (NCBs), in view of the evolving threats, technology and the pandemic shifting the foundations of police work. In India, the CBI is the NCB for Interpol. Nearly 300 officers from 167 countries attended the Interpol’s 16th annual conference, held virtually from July 6 to 8. They reviewed major initiatives, ranging from operational and investigative support to expanding the I-24/7 secure communications network to national police and border control agencies, said the Interpol in a statement. These measures are aimed at optimising the performance and operational capacity of the NCBs, and to enhance international police cooperation against transnational crime and corruption. The meeting heard that ransomware activities generated $350 million in 2020, according to Chainalysis, a 311% increase over the previous year. “A global strategy in response to the threat of ransomware is critical — one where we successfully build trust, see effective exchange of data, and maximise rapid operational assistance to law enforcement agencies,” Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said. On terrorism, he said the global threat was at the crossroads, with the territorial defeat of the IS opening up a new insurgency phase in West Asia, while in other critical theatres such as Africa, new groups had joined the terrorist movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/interpol-seeks-joint-fight-against-ransomware/article35260220.ece
11 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||HC orders inquiry into ‘medical negligence’||The Orissa High Court has ordered an inquiry into alleged medical negligence in the treatment of patients during COVID-19 pandemic in the Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR) at Burla, a premier State-run medical institute in western Odisha. The Orissa HC had received a complaint through e-mail from a person identified as Gyanadutta Chouhan about lack of proper medical facilities at VIMSAR and insensitivity shown by doctors and paramedics. On the direction of the court, the Sambalpur District Collector had constituted a three-member committee to investigate the veracity of the allegations. The committee in its report said there was no shortage of medicine and no instances of lack of treatment. Subsequently, petitioner Mr. Chouhan had filed nine affidavits of persons whose close relatives purportedly suffered on account of lack of proper or timely treatment at VIMSAR during the pandemic. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice Savitri Ratho observed that each of the nine affidavits revealed prima facie that the victims did not receive the requisite medical treatment at VIMSAR and that needless deaths had occurred as a result. Stating that these were only prima facie conclusions and the proof of the averments would require to be established by a proper inquiry, the HC appointed A.B.S. Naidu, a former District Judge, as inquiry officer to examine the instances set out in the nine affidavits and whether there was medical negligence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-orders-inquiry-into-medical-negligence/article35260251.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Freedom of speech is under siege: Bhushan||Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan said on Saturday that freedom of speech is under “total siege” in the country. Referring to the death of the 84-year-old Jesuit priest and rights activist Father Stan Swamy, who was jailed in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case, Mr. Bhushan said “anybody perceived to be a serious threat to the government or who speaks out against the government is charged and put in jail”. Mr. Bhushan was delivering the Chinta Ravi Memorial Lecture 2021 on the ‘Threats to Constitution and Rule of Law’. He was speaking to a cross-section of prominent persons like senior journalist Sashi Kumar, writers N.S. Madhavan and Paul Zacharia, senior advocate R. Vaigai, advocate Kaleeswaram Raj, students and members of the civil society. The state incarcerates citizens who exercise their right to freely express their dissent against the government under draconian statutes like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act which loosely defines an “unlawful activity”, Mr. Bhushan said. “Once charged under this law, it is very difficult to get bail because the trial court has to be convinced that there is not even a prima fa cie case,” he explained. Mr. Bhushan referred to the judiciary’s performance in the past five years in protecting the rights of ordinary people. He referred to the role of the top court in politically sensitive cases such as the Ayodhya dispute, Judge Loya death case, Rafale deal, Birla-Sahara case, the bifurcation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act. He said that “people had begun to lose faith”. “It is only in the last six months, with the significant shift in public opinion, that they (judiciary) have been able to retrieve and display judicial independence,” Mr. Bhushan said. The media is going through the “worse kind of censorship” and the government has taken a carrot-and-stick approach, he said. “Inducements by dangling a carrot, and if the carrot does not work, the stick is used through harassment by agencies like CBI, ED and the Income Tax,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/freedom-of-speech-is-under-siege-bhushan/article35260226.ece

While one son was working as a doctor at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, the other was working at the Skill Development Department in the Valley. One policeman, Rasheed Shigan, who was allegedly involved in militant activities, has also been terminated from his service. The employees were fired under Article 311(2)(c), a law passed earlier this year in J&K under which no inquiry is required to be constituted against the accused. Four employees from Anantnag, three from Budgam, and one each from Baramulla, Srinagar, Pulwama and Kupwara were terminated, officials said. The officials said four employees were working in the Education Department, two in the police, and one each in Agriculture, Skill Development, Power, SKIMS and Health Departments. ‘Draconian move’ The J&K government on April 21 constituted a Special Task Force (STF) to identify employees and scrutinise their conduct and lodge cases against those involved in cases related to threat to security or anti-national activities. The task force was described as “arbitrary” and “draconian” by several parties including the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party, the Peoples Conference, the J&K Apni Party and the CPI(M). Earlier, at least three employees, including an assistant professor, a naib tehsildar and a teacher, were terminated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hizb-chiefs-two-sons-lose-government-jobs/article35260229.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Caregivers of disabled need priority for jabs’||The Union Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry earlier this week asked the Health and Family Welfare Ministry to ensure that caregivers of persons with disabilities (PwD) are vaccinated against COVID-19 at the same centre as the PwD on priority basis. The Department of Empowerment of PwD (DEPwD) under the Ministry wrote in an office memorandum on July 7 that it had received an email from Anjlee Agarwal, a PwD, requesting the facility. “Caregivers are required to come in close proximity with persons with disabilities for providing support services to PwDs to enable them to perform activities of daily living. As such, it is important to ensure vaccination of such caregivers alongside persons with disabilities,” the DEPwD wrote. The Health Ministry was asked to issue instructions to all Central and State healthcare authorities and vaccination centres to this effect. Ms. Agarwal, an activist and wheelchair user, said she had to go to a West Delhi school for the first dose with her two caregivers. “To my utter shock, upon reaching the Tilak Nagar school, the people at the vaccination centre refused to vaccinate my caregivers with the excuse that they were not disabled and the vaccination drive was organised for PwD,” she said. She said her caregivers were finally able to get the vaccine after the intervention of senior officials. “I’m a person with high support needs. There are other PwD who cannot raise their voice like I did or write to the authorities. We remain at risk if the people assisting us are not vaccinated. And many PwD are at greater risk of severe disease if they get infected,” she said, adding that an order or instructions to vaccination centres was the need of the hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/caregivers-of-disabled-need-priority-for-jabs/article35260252.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Home Secretary Bhalla sounds note of caution||Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday reviewed the steps taken by State governments for checking the spread of COVID-19 in hill stations and other tourist destinations. The overall management of the situation and the vaccination status in Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West Bengal was discussed. “The Union Home Secretary sounded a note of caution in view of media reports showing blatant disregard of COVID-appropriate behaviour,” said a government release. Mr. Bhalla said the second wave was not yet over; and the States should ensure strict adherence to the protocols. The case positivity rate in certain districts of Rajasthan, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh was over 10%, which was a cause for concern. The States were asked to follow the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and COVID appropriate behaviour. “Adequate health infrastructure preparedness [especially in rural, peri-urban and tribal areas] was also advised, to tackle any potential future surge,” it said. Among those who attended the meeting were NITI Aayog Member (Health) V.K. Paul, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Indian Council for Medical Research Director General Balram Bhargava, the Chief Secretaries, DGPs and Principal Secretaries (Health) of the eight States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/home-secretary-bhalla-sounds-note-of-caution/article35260254.ece

He also sought the establishment of an All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Kumaon region on the lines of AIIMS, Rishikesh. In a tweet, Mr. Dhami said he sought the blessings of the Prime Minister. “Sought his directions on the State’s development, the possible third wave of COVID-19, Char Dham Yatra and kanwad yatra. The Prime Minister assured all possible help for the State’s development,” he tweeted. The PMO also tweeted pictures of the meeting.

According to an official release in Dehradun, Mr. Dhami said an AIIMS in Kumaon will give access to the people of the region to world class medical facilities, adding the State government will give land for it. Mr. Dhami also sought speedy implementation of the 300 mW Lakhwar multi-purpose project from which six States — U.P., Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh — will benefit. The project has all the clearances and work on it can begin after a Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs by the Centre gives its go-ahead, he said.

11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Don’t reveal identity in sexual offence cases: SC||The Supreme Court has asked trial judges to take care to not reveal the identity of victims in sexual offence cases. The court said their privacy should be respected. The observation came in an order dismissing an appeal made against a Chhattisgarh High Court judgment in a case. The apex court noted that the Sessions Judge had mentioned the name of the victim. “We take exception to the judgment of the Sessions Judge where the name of victim is mentioned. It is well-established that in cases like the present one, the name of the victim is not to be mentioned in any proceeding. We are of the view that all subordinate courts should be careful in future while dealing with such cases,” a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan said in the recent order. Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) prohibits the publication of the identity of rape victims or any other details which may reveal the identity. The bar, however, does not ostensibly extend to court judgments. However, the apex court, in the State of Karnataka versus Puttaraja case, had said it would be “appropriate” if courts do not name the victim in its records. “True it is, the restriction does not relate to printing or publication of judgment by High Court or Supreme Court. But keeping in view the social object of preventing social victimisation or ostracism of the victim of a sexual offence for which Section 228-A has been enacted, it would be appropriate that in the judgments, be it of this court, High Court or lower court, the name of the victim should not be indicated. We have chosen to describe her as ‘victim’ in the judgment,” the apex court said in Puttaraja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-reveal-identity-in-sexual-offence-cases-sc/article35260224.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||India pulls out staff from Kandahar consulate||While the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said the decision to withdraw the staff was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, security concerns were believed to be the reason they have not been sent back yet. Officials say they have been particularly worried about Kandahar, with exit routes limited to the airport, as the Taliban forces have taken control of other key districts close to the city. Last Sunday, the district of Panjwai, less than an hour’s drive from Kandahar city, fell to the Taliban fighters. “There’s an increased level of violence in Kandahar and we may possibly see temporary suspension of services by a number of consulates including the Indian consulate,” Afghanistan Ambassador to India Farid Mamundzay told The Hindu on Saturday. ‘Overstated claims’ However, both Indian and Afghan officials warned against overstating the Taliban claims of territorial gains across Afghanistan at present, pointing out that the ANDSF have been successful in pushing back the Taliban onslaught at many places, and the Taliban has lost many of its fighters in the past few weeks of violence as well. On Friday, Kandahar Governor said Taliban militants had been repelled by security forces when they tried to attack the city's ‘District 7’ “Taliban is exaggerating its claims on territory. They aim to frighten the Afghan people, and through such claims they open a gap of realities, into which they pour fear, terror and uncertainties,” Mr. Mamundzay said. The MEA declined to comment on the developments, and while it had denied that India had shut down operations at its consulates in Mazar and Kandahar on Thursday, it said the situation was “evolving and fluid”. “We are carefully monitoring the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, and its implications on the security and safety of Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Our responses will be calibrated accordingly, depending on how the situation evolves,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said on July 8. On Saturday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani lashed out at the Taliban, holding them responsible for the growing violence, and between 200-600 casualties every day, despite the fact that the group’s main demand, that the U.S. and NATO troops leave the country, has largely been met. “Taliban should be asked whom they are fighting for? Who will benefit if Afghanistan is ruined and if Afghans are killed? Are they fighting for Afghanistan, or they want the country to be controlled by others,” Mr. Ghani asked during a speech in Khost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-pulls-out-staff-from-kandahar-consulate/article35260230.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. infra spending dropped sharply in Q1||By contrast, private investments sequentially declined by a mere 1.7% in the first quarter of this year, thanks to a significant 45% uptick in manufacturing projects from Rs. 1.17 lakh crore between January and March 2021 to over Rs. 1.70 lakh crore in the quarter just concluded. However, about Rs. 1.1 lakh crore of these private manufacturing investments are related to just four massive projects, including a Rs. 60,000 crore green energy complex announced by Reliance Industries, two PVC units in Gujarat from Adani Enterprises worth Rs. 29,200 crore and a Rs. 10,000 crore copper smelter by Vedanta. Foreign investment projects slipped 95.4% from the previous quarter, with just 17 projects worth Rs. 3,450.5 crore in Q1 of this year, from 34 projects worth over Rs. 75,000 crore in the preceding quarter. “While the flaring up of COVID 2.0 affected economic activities as well as fresh project announcements, the severity was not as much as observed in the first quarter of last year immediately after the national lockdown,” said Shashikant Hegde, director and CEO of Projects Today. “The fall in fresh investments was also because of a sharp fall in announcement of new projects by government agencies — both Central and State. Recognising this, the Finance Ministry has rightly prodded government agencies to front load their capital expenditure plans,” Mr Hegde added, adding that the timely execution of over 8,000 projects worth Rs. 153.37 lakh crore listed in the National Infrastructure Pipeline must also be pushed. “That will not only revive the economy but also instil confidence in private companies to expedite their own capex plans,” he pointed out. Public investments in new hospitals rose by 25% between April and June, but the number of projects declined from 85 to just 38, while investments in other community services, including water and sewage projects fell significantly. With Reliance Industries’ and Adani group’s mega projects planned in Gujarat, the western State garnered nearly a third of all new investments, over Rs. 1.08 lakh crore, in the quarter. Maharashtra retained its second position for the second quarter in a row, with Rs. 43,559 crore of new projects. The April to June quarter also saw electricity investments falling to nearly a third of the preceding quarter’s levels, while investment plans in transport services dropped 55.1%. The National Highways Authority announced only 24 highways worth Rs. 17,285.74 crore and just eight new railway projects worth Rs. 55.6 crore were kicked off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-infra-spending-sees-steep-fall-in-q1/article35260231.ece

All steps will be taken from our side to ensure that supply is not hampered because of the law to be passed by the Assam government,” Mr. Sangma said, adding that his government would first examine the Assam legislation before any move. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said the proposed legislation would ban the movement of cattle to and from the State primarily to check cattle smuggling to Bangladesh. Dr. Sarma also said beef should not be consumed in areas where Hindus live and where the animal is worshipped.

The petitioner said by virtue of denying a visa to her husband, who had been “arbitrarily blacklisted” by the respondents (Centre), she was deprived from living with him, thereby violating her fundamental right to life and dignity as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The plea, which is likely to come up for hearing next week, said petitioner Manisha Malik and her husband, popularly known as Karl Rock, were YouTube vloggers and had visited most of India to capture its beauty and contribute to the promotion of tourism here.  Union Home Ministry officials had on Friday said the New Zealand national has been restricted from entering India till the next year for violating terms and conditions of his visa.

11 July 2021||New Delhi,||Repeal Defence Services Ordinance, Raja tells PM||The Defence Services Ordinance, 2021 (EDSO) snatches the constitutional, democratic and legal rights available to civilian workers in the defence establishments and needs to be withdrawn, Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D. Raja said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. The EDSO provides for the dismissal of employees without even an inquiry, which is against the constitutional protection given to a Central government employee. The Ordinance also provides for imprisonment of any union leader calling for a strike and any employee participating in a strike. “You will appreciate that employees and their trade unions resort to strike action as a last weapon when all other means of protest/representation on genuine grievances are ignored by the employer,” Mr. Raja wrote. Protesting decision The employees of 41 ordnance factories are protesting against the government decision to reorganise the factories into seven corporations. The conciliation proceedings by the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) with the ordnance factories employees have been suspended. ‘Already assured’ In his letter, Mr. Raja asked: “The government has already assured the federations in writing that none of the ordnance factories would be closed. Whether the government still stands by this assurance?” The employees and the trade unions are fully justified in calling for a strike, since they feel they have been ignored and that their future is in the dark, Mr. Raja said. “It is the responsibility of the government as a model employer to call the federations and enter into a negotiated mutually agreed agreement instead of crushing the democratic rights of the employees,” Mr. Raja wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/withdraw-defence-services-ordinance-raja-urges-modi/article35260241.ece

Mr. Adityanath said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had granted constitutional status to the OBC Commission and provided big representation to OBC leadership in his Cabinet. He said Lohia believed a mature democracy was only possible by giving power to the backwards. “If Lohia ji were here today, he would have been full of joy to see his thoughts bearing fruit,” said Mr. Adityanath in a series of tweets in Hindi. The U.P. CM, whose party banks on the consolidation of the sizeable non-Yadav OBC votes, said the representation and participation of people envisioned by Lohia and B.R Ambedkar were being realised from “ sarkaar to samaaj ” or government to society under the leadership of Mr. Modi.

11 July 2021||JAIPUR,||BJP leader’s remarks on Sis Ram Ola create a row||The purported remarks of BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia on late former Union Minister Sis Ram Ola triggered a row in Rajasthan on Saturday, prompting several political leaders, including Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, to demand an apology from the ruling party at the Centre. Ola, a prominent Jat leader from the Shekhawati region, died in 2013. In a television debate over the recent reshuffle in the Union Cabinet, Mr. Bhatia made some offensive remarks about Ola’s induction into the Manmohan Singh government in 2013 despite his old age. Mr. Bhatia himself shared a video clip of the TV debate on his twitter account but deleted it later following the ruckus. Mr. Gehlot reacted sharply to the remarks and demanded that BJP national president J.P. Nadda tender an apology immediately to the people of Rajasthan. “I condemn these remarks... They have created a lot of anger. Mr. Ola protected the interests of farmers in the social and political fields for more than 60 years. He received Padma Shri in 1968 for his social service,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted in Hindi. A large number of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) activists staged a demonstration outside the BJP State headquarters here. When the BJP workers confronted them, policemen deployed at the venue controlled the situation and dispersed the protesters. BKU spokesperson Ajit Kaswan said the farmers would not tolerate humiliation of their departed leader. Pradesh Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra, Revenue Minister Harish Chaudhary and Tonk MLA Sachin Pilot said the BJP leader's remarks had shown the party's mentality of disregarding the contributions of tall leaders. Rashtriya Loktantrik Party chief and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal also condemned Mr. Bhatia’s remarks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-leaders-remarks-on-sis-ram-ola-create-a-row/article35260722.ece
11 July 2021||Kolkata,||Visva-Bharati yet to pay June salaries||Santiniketan, whose economy largely depends on the Visva-Bharati, is witnessing — according to teachers — a “human crisis” with the university yet to pay its staff for the month of June. Salaries in Visva-Bharati are always paid on the last day of every month, but the salaries for June were yet to be released until the evening of July 10. What is surprising is that the university has not put out any circular explaining the delay. Its PRO, the only official there authorised to speak to the media, did not respond to calls for comment. “This is an unprecedented situation. A human crisis is building up in Santiniketan, considering its economy depends on Visva-Bharati. People have EMIs and rents to pay. Think of the elderly pensioners — how will they survive, that too in these difficult times,” said a professor who has spent 25 years at the university. So unpleasant is the situation now that an organisation called the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights on Saturday filed an FIR at the Santiniketan police station against the non-payment of salaries. Local media is pointing out how retired lower-rung employees are left with no money and are unable to buy medicines. ‘Informed the PM’ Many in the campus see the delay as a fallout of the running feud between Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty and the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA), which has been openly critical of the V-C. The Union has, from time to time, written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chancellor of the university, bringing to his attention the alleged high-handed functioning of the V-C and earlier this week had also raised the issue of non-payment of salaries. According to a union member, most employees in Visva-Bharati got less salary for the month of May without explanation and when a professor sought to know the reason during an online faculty meeting, he was asked by the V-C to take charge of salary disbursement. A verbal showdown between the two followed and the delay in the salary was a result of that spat, the union member said, adding that the V-C, during another meeting of faculty members held during the pandemic, had openly ridiculed teachers “for earning fat salaries while sitting at home”. This is not the first time that salaries have been delayed. Last year too, the disbursement was delayed during February, June and July. The reason given was lack of funds but the Education Ministry insisted that there was no such paucity and had pulled up the authorities. But this is the longest the employees have remained unpaid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/visva-bharati-yet-to-pay-june-salaries/article35260738.ece

Sources said a series of press meets would be kicked off from next week with a press conference addressed by former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in Delhi. Senior leaders have been assigned a metropolitan city each to amplify the party’s message. As per the schedule, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge would speak in Mumbai, Gaurav Gogoi in Kolkata, Shashi Tharoor in Chennai, Anand Sharma in Jaipur, Manish Tewari in Ahmedabad, Deepender Hooda in Hyderabad, Sachin Pilot in Dehradun and Kamal Nath in Lucknow. The Congress is yet to schedule a strategy meeting ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament from July 19. Senior leaders said the current economic situation would be one of the key issues that the party would raise during the 20-day session. Petrol is currently priced at nearly Rs. 100 a litre or above in all the metropolitian cities. The rising fuel rates have had a cascading impact on essential commodity prices too. Both Amul and Mother Diary announced a Rs. 2 a litre hike in milk prices on Saturday. Earlier, the party organised a day-long protest at filling stations across the country against the repeated fuel price hikes. The party has claimed that multiple layers of taxation both at the Centre and State were responsible for these hikes. They argued that bringing the fuel prices within the ambit of the GST was the only way to provide any relief to the end consumer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-to-campaign-against-price-rise/article35260239.ece

11 July 2021||Kolkata,||Six held for alleged human trafficking||The South Bengal Frontier of the BSF has arrested 30 women from Bangladesh who were illegally crossing the international border, upto July 10. Six Indian nationals, whom they described as touts for allegedly trafficking these women into the country, were arrested. According to BSF officials most of the women were lured by these traffickers on the pretext of jobs. For instance, on June 22, 17-year-old Alima (name changed) and her 45-year-old mother were rescued from the Jeetpur border outpost in the North 24 Parganas district. The incidents of cattle smuggling have dropped significantly along the south Bengal frontier spread over 913.32 km along the border from Malda which includes 363.93 km of riverine border but trafficking continues to be on the rise. The COVID-19 related distress has affected the population on both sides. In the year 2019, as many as 2,175 Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended by the BSF which increased to 3,060 in 2020. A significant number of those arrested were women, most of them lured by touts on both sides of the border on the pretext of jobs or marriage. Anti-trafficking Bill The pandemic has not eased the situation in the bordering areas of West Bengal as well and have led to increased incidents of trafficking also. Subhasree Raptan, from Goranbose Bram Bikash Kendra, and a collective working against trafficking Tafteesh, said that investigation in cases related to human trafficking has also suffered in the past few years. “There are scores of cases where survivors of trafficking who are rescued from States like Maharashtra and Delhi, but such cases are not taken up for for inter-state investigation by the Anti Human Trafficking Units,” Ms. Raptan said. She also added that the draft of the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Act, 2021 Bill by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD) has not defined the role of Anti-Human Trafficking Units. The Ministry has invited suggestions for the draft of the Bill and activists like Ms. Raptan working on ground suggest there should be fast track courts for trafficking cases and emphasis on streamlining implementation of victim compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/six-held-for-alleged-human-trafficking/article35260551.ece

The farmers’ body reiterated that the demand was to repeal the laws and not to bring amendments, and the MVA government needs to take an unequivocal stand to repeal the three Acts. The AIKSCC said in a statement: “The state government is trying to bring new farm laws in Maharashtra by making some changes to the controversial farm laws enacted by the central government. However, making amendments to the draft of the central laws will not change the purpose behind the enactment of laws nor will it change the anti-farmer and corporate character of the laws.” “The Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of these laws. In such a scenario, it is unseemly for the state to be in such a hurry about this process,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amendments-to-farm-laws-disappointing/article35260237.ece

A total of 30,755 persons were penalised for not following norms. A fine of Rs. 3.3 crore was collected from the violators. After relaxation of lockdown, residents from various localities started calling corporation helpline 1913 to report violations. On Saturday, most of the complaints were received from T. Nagar and Padi, where high-rise buildings of retail outlets are located. Crowding in many outlets have increased significantly because of inadequate regulations. The officials have advised the retailers to prevent crowding on the premises. The civic body did not lock or seal the shops. It will also collect samples for testing at crowded areas from persons who have symptoms of COVID-19. At least 27,000 samples are being tested in the 15 zones of the city every day to detect the third wave. The positivity rate in shops has remained low for the past few weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/retail-outlets-fined-for-flouting-covid-19-norms/article35260667.ece
11 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu relaxes norms to appoint law officers||Given the enormous strain that COVID-19 has mounted on the legal profession with many lawyers suffering without an income and some having left the profession at least temporarily, the Tamil Nadu government has relaxed the rules that give weightage to the number of court appearances and the gross income earned in the last three years for appointment of advocates to represent the State at the Madras High Court and its Bench in Madurai. A Government Order issued by the Public (Law Officers) Department on Friday amended the Law Officers of High Court of Madras and its Bench at Madurai (Appointment) Rules, 2017. Following the amendment, applicants to the post of law officers need not submit either the list of cases in which they had appeared in the last seven years or the income tax returns filed by them in the last three years. The order also made clear that it would be sufficient for the applicants to submit certificates either from recognised Bar associations in the High Court or from a senior lawyer with 25 years of standing in the Bar to prove that they meet the minimum professional experience required for the post. It further stated that the amendments were being made following three letters written by Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram between June 18 and July 7. When contacted, Mr. Shunmugasundaram said the pandemic had a devastating effect on the profession with many advocates not having any income to sustain themselves. Some were not even in a position to pay subscriptions to their Bar associations. While young lawyers were suffering because of the restricted functioning of courts, some of the aged lawyers could not get accustomed to technology to attend the virtual hearings. “In my estimate, at least 30% of young lawyers practising in the Madras High Court have left Chennai and gone to their native places, at least temporarily. Under such circumstances, it would be unfair to expect them to have conducted a particular number of cases and earned a good amount of income...in the last three years to be eligible for law officer posts. Therefore, we thought it fit to relax the norms,” he said. Nevertheless, the minimum experience required to be appointed to various posts such as Government Advocate, Additional Government Pleader and Special Government Pleader remain unaltered and experience could be proved with certificates from the Bar associations and senior lawyers, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-relaxes-norms-to-appoint-law-officers/article35260641.ece
11 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Retired staff below 60 struggling to invest in post office savings scheme||Though rules allow people above the age of 55, who have opted for voluntary retirement or have been given compulsory retirement, to invest their settlement funds in the post office senior citizen savings scheme (SCSS), frontline staff are apparently rejecting such deposits. An individual aged above 60 can invest under the savings scheme. However, there is an exemption clause which allows employees aged above 55 and below 60 to invest their settlement amount in this scheme, subject to the condition that the investment be made within one month of receipt of such an amount. “The government guidelines clearly state that such employees can invest in SCSS, but the frontline staff at post offices are not accepting the investments, as it appears they are not well versed with the regulation,” Suresh Parthasarathy, founder, myassetsconsolidation.com, pointed out. He has been guiding retirees to invest in SCSS. “The prospects of getting a job for employees above 55 are bleak, and they have to depend on monthly interest incomes to manage their family cash flow. Products like bank fixed deposits and postal deposits are the major interest earners for them,” he added. Higher rate of interest At present, SCSS offers a better interest rate of 7.4% per annum, when compared to rates between 5.3-5.5% offered by banks. Also, post office deposits come with a sovereign guarantee. People are also finding it difficult to meet the requirement that the settlement funds need to be invested within a month of receipt, amid the pandemic. Mr. Parthasarathy said with COVID-19 lockdowns only now being eased, the 30-day time-frame given to invest the settlement amount is not sufficient and the Union Finance Ministry needs to look at extending the time frame, to help this category of employees to invest in the SCSC. “It is high time the postal department took the initiative to popularise the scheme and it must have sufficient displays at post offices to educate the general public,” he added. When contacted, a senior official from the postal department said the Finance Ministry has to take a call regarding extension of time frame from 30 days. He also pointed out that if the field staff are rejecting the investment, the concerned individual can make a representation to a higher official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/retired-staff-below-60-struggling-to-invest-in-post-office-savings-scheme/article35261136.ece

11 July 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Private hospitals told to refund excess charges||The Greater Chennai Corporation has started issuing notices to several private hospitals against which complaints of overcharging were received for treating COVID-19 patients. The move comes in the backdrop of the Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project receiving complaints from several patients about exorbitant charges by hospitals and being forwarded to the civic body for action. A senior official, citing the Governor Order No. 251 issued on May 22 fixing the rates for medical treatment of COVID-19 patients by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, said steps were being taken to get the hospitals to refund the excess charges to the patients. He said 20 complaints had been received against private hospitals in Aminjikarai, Vadapalani, Pallikaranai, Perungudi, and Ambattur. The senior civic official said six hospitals had come forward and reimbursed the ‘additional’ amount charged from patients. The remaining 14 hospitals were yet to respond to the notices. Notices are issued to the private hospitals based on complaints received over helpline 104 and a few directly to the civic body through email. The civic official said once a complaint was received, the patients were contacted and asked to share the bill details. A core team of young medical specialists is involved in diligently checking the bills with the rates prescribed by the State government for COVID-19 treatment.

11 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tribunal sets aside TNERC order denying extension for solar project||The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel) has set aside an order by State power regulator, which had rejected a plea for extension of deadline for a 100 MW solar project. It also said Tangedco cannot encash performance bank guarantees or ask for payment of liquidated damages. In 2017, Tangedco had signed a power purchase agreement with Solitaire BTN Solar Private Limited for procurement of 100 MW of solar power. As per the agreement, the company’s project in Ganguvarpatty, Dindigul district, should have been completed by Sept. 25, 2019. The company moved the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) stating that the project was delayed owing to issues in evacuation infrastructure. It also said COVID-19 outbreak further delayed the project and wanted it to be treated as force majeure events. The TNERC rejected the plea and ruled that only 50 MW of capacity can be allowed to be declared as commissioned and remaining gets terminated. The company moved Aptel against this order. Aptel ruled that the Tangedco had failed to provide an adequate transmission system to evacuate the entire output of 100 MW. It also noted the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy had granted a five month exemption for solar projects due to the lockdown. Therefore, the decision of the TNERC not to allow relief on the ground that the pandemic occurred outside the period of agreement was wrong and set aside. On account of force majeure, Aptel said the scheduled commissioning date was extended from September 27, 2019 to December 27, 2020 without the encashment of performance bank guarantee and payment of liquidated damages. It directed Tangedco to return the performance bank guarantee of Rs. 20 crore and additional performance guarantee of Rs. 7.6 crore to the company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tribunal-sets-aside-tnerc-order-denying-extension-for-solar-project/article35260774.ece

11 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Irregularities alleged in appointments in Adi Dravidar Welfare Dept.||Alleging irregularities, at least three staff associations in the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department have demanded the cancellation of more than 800 appointments made across many districts before the Assembly election. The appointments mostly included cooks for hostels and a few watchmen and office assistants. At the outset, the associations questioned the need and urgency for recruiting hundreds of cooks and watchmen for hostels on a regular time scale pay when the hostels have remained closed since the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020. “When the government is under financial stress, what is the necessity for recruiting and paying them for the past many months without any work,” asked G. Vivek, general secretary of the Chennai-based Tamil Nadu Teachers-Wardens Welfare Association. The associations alleged that the norms for appointments, including the advertisement of the vacancies in the media with adequate details, scrutiny of applications, shortlisting, and interviews, were not properly followed. Model code factor The associations pointed out that a significant number of appointment orders, especially in districts such as Chennai, Tiruvannamalai, Ariyalur, Dharmapuri and Tirunelveli, were dated February 25, 2021, and issued on February 26, the day when the model code of conduct for the election came into force. No appointments can be made when the model code is in force without clearance from the Election Commission of India. A case in point was the appointments in Tirunelveli district. M. Sankarasabapathi, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department Teachers’ and Wardens’ Munnetra Sangam, which is based in Madurai, alleged that the orders were issued in a hurry in the district on the night of February 26 by the office of the District Adi Dravidar Welfare Officer. “After we intervened and brought it to the notice of the Collector, the issuance of the orders was stopped. However, the same recruitment orders were issued soon after the model code was lifted,” he said. According to him, the appointments in the district originally included the names of at least three hostels that did not exist. “Subsequently, the persons appointed to these hostels were allowed to take charge at other hostels,” he said. Mr. Sankarasabapathi said his association petitioned the Minister for Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare, the Chief Secretary and the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption. K. Manuel, president, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Government Employees’ Welfare Association, said a person recruited for a vacancy in Chennai was appointed in Tenkasi on February 25. “This specific case has been taken to the Madras High Court by another applicant,” he said. Mr. Vivek said the violation of the norms appeared to take place even after the new government entered office, as was evident from the recent transfer of teachers without counselling. “We have sought an appointment with the Minister in the coming week to highlight all these issues.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/irregularities-alleged-in-appointments-in-adi-dravidar-welfare-dept/article35260646.ece

11 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Panel to look into the death of elephants on rail lines||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has tasked a committee constituted by a Union Ministry with looking into the death of wild elephants on the rail tracks that link Tamil Nadu and Kerala through the forest areas of Coimbatore and Palakkad districts. The Central Monitoring Committee, constituted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), is dealing with Project Elephant. The NGT took suo motu cognisance of the death of elephants on the basis of the report, ‘Night, early morning trains cause most elephant deaths,’ published in The Hindu on May 29, 2021. The report said trains that plied between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. had caused the death of seven out of eight elephants on the two lines, A and B, between the Kottekad and Madukkarai stations in the last five years. The Bench, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, judicial members Justices Sudhir Agarwal, M. Sathyanarayanan and Brijesh Sethi and expert member Nagin Nanda, asked the committee to look into the issue in coordination with the Railways, the Wildlife Institute of India and the States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It said at a hearing on July 8 that the Central Monitoring Committee should hold a meeting with Tamil Nadu and Kerala and Southern Railway within a month to work out the modalities, including the authority that would incur the expenditure. While the A line runs through the reserve forest for 17 km between the Chullimada and Madukkarai stations, the B line passes through the reserve forest for 23 km between Madukkarai and Kanjikode. In reply to a notice served by the NGT, Southern Railway submitted that the Palakkad Division had taken steps to mitigate accidents involving elephants in the last few decades. The Division said that along with the Forest Department in Palakkad and Coimbatore districts, it was regularly reviewing elephant passages. Speed limit It said a permanent speed restriction of 45 kmph was imposed on 13.9 km of the vulnerable section on the A line and 19.41 km on the B line from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. During the daytime, a permanent speed restriction of 65 kmph was in force for passenger trains and 25/35kmph for goods trains. Signage boards, solar fencing, elephant ramps on tracks, audio alarm, widening of cutting, engagement of elephant trackers and sensitisation programmes for loco pilots were among the measures the Division had taken. In its status report, Tamil Nadu submitted that the two lines passed through the Boluvampatti block-I reserve forest. Elephants crossed the lines frequently and were subject to the risk of train hits. They also crossed the tracks to raid crops. It said most of the accidents took place on the B line, which had an acute curve that reduced the visibility of loco pilots. The B line ran for 2.5 km into the reserve forest. Most of the stretch was laid on a path raised with steep slopes on both sides. it was tough for elephants to ascend or descend. When the train arrived, they found it difficult to get down from the track, it said. The report said the Forest Department had set up structures similar to ramps across the track B to help elephants cross it easily. R. Pandiyaraja of Tenkasi district, who got the details of the elephant deaths under the Right to Information Act, wanted the Central Monitoring Committee to inspect the tracks, accident spots and vulnerable locations. “Members of the committee should also travel on the stretch at night to have a clear understanding of the issue. They should also speak to loco pilots to find out their difficulties,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panel-to-look-into-the-death-of-elephants-on-rail-lines/article35260650.ece

Sameeran told The Hindu . “We have strengthened vigil at all the 14 entry points. Of the 14, the teams at four important points such as Walayar are armed with thermal guns.” The administration has also shared with the local body concerned the contact details of those entering with e-pass for follow-up action. The volunteers from the local body concerned would call on the visitors for a few days after their arrival to check if they showed COVID-19 symptoms, Dr. Sameeran said. As for tracking people shuttling everyday between Coimbatore and Kerala, the administration had asked them to compulsorily take e-pass so that the administration could trace them, if required. On an average, the Walayar check-post alone saw 1,400 vehicles entering Coimbatore. At other places it was fewer. With Kerala also reporting Zika virus, the administration has asked all the local bodies to carry out source reduction exercise as it was vector-borne. With Coimbatore experiencing intermittent rains, it was all the more imperative that the local bodies destroy all mosquito breeding sources and the instruction applied to not only those local bodies that bordered Kerala but every local body in the district, the Collector said. e-pass mandatory Dr. Sameeran said in a release issued later in the day that e-pass was mandatory for those entering the district from Kerala.

Eswaran, observed a fast at Eachanari, near here, on Saturday against the Central Government’s reported move to carve out Western Tamil Nadu into a separate State or Union Territory. The fast was organised after a media organisation reported on this move, Mr. Eswaran said and wanted the government to clarify its stand on the issue. When this was seen along with the Government identifying Union Minister of State for Fisheries L. Murugan as a person from “Kongu Nadu”, at the time of his swearing in, it only strengthened the suspicion that something was in the offing. The Government should deny the report in order to remove the suspicion in people’s mind, Mr. Eswaran said. “Has there been any demand from people or political parties for a separate Kongu Nadu from this region, like the demand or protest held ahead of the formation of Telangana,” he asked. The Centre should not impose its will on the people, he said. “If at all there is any move to bifurcate the State, it should be based on people’s demand,” the MDMK leader said. TPDK stages protest Around 40 members of the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam staged a protest in front of the organisation’s office at Gandhipuram, burning copies of a Tamil daily in which the report appeared. The organisation’s general secretary K. Ramakrishnan said the TPDK was strongly opposed to such a move and saw it as the BJP's effort to strengthen the party by dividing the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mdmk-observes-a-fast-over-kongu-nadu/article35260697.ece

Eswaran, observed a fast in Eachanari, near here, on Saturday against the Central government’s proposed move to carve out western Tamil Nadu into a separate State or Union Territory. In the light of the swearing-in of State Bharatiya Janata Party leader L. Murugan as the Minister of State who has been identified as a person from the Kongu Nadu, the suspicion that something was in the offing has strengthened, Mr. Eswaran said. ‘Unwarranted move’ To quell the suspicion in people’s mind, the Centre should deny the recent media report on such a plan. Such move was unwarranted as there had been no demand from people, he added. “Has there been any demand from the people or political parties for a separate Kongu Nadu from this region like the one for the formation of Telangana?” he said and asked the Centre not to impose its will on the people. If at all there was any move to bifurcate the State, it should be based on people’s demand, the MDMK leader reiterated and warned that the party would intensify its agitation if the Centre failed to deny the report.

11 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Jewellers seek amendments to hallmarking norms for jewellery||With hallmarking of jewellery made mandatory in select centres in the country since last month, the jewellers and manufacturers here say the new norms are resulting in delays (to get the mark) and increases the cost of the jewellery. B. Sabarinath, president of Coimbatore Jewellers Association, told The Hindu that hallmarking jewellery is not new to Coimbatore, which is one of the main gold jewellery manufacturing centres in the country. However, there are two new norms that are causing hardships to jewellers. Identification number Apart from the hallmark, every piece of jewellery should have a unique identification number, which is system generated. Jewellers used to give the jewellery in the morning to any of the 26 hallmarking centres in the city earlier and get it back by evening. Now, they need to send a mail to the centre about the quantity of jewellery that needs to be hallmarked and after the centre gives its assent, the jewellery is sent for hallmarking. It takes three to four days to get the entire lot hallmarked. There are standard procedures that even small retailers need to follow and get the entire stock with them hallmarked. “Every small piece should be scanned and the hall mark and unique identification number embedded on it. “While a centre used to handle 1,500 to 2,000 pieces a day, it is able to handle only 500 pieces a day now. There are delays, the jewellery is kept in a different premises for three or four days, and the costs go up,” he says. Further, there are several manufacturers here who supply to cities across the country. The new norm says the jewellery should have the hallmark during transit. Further the person who makes the preliminary order is made accountable for the quality of the jewellery. This also adds to the confusion. The government should address these issues, he said. According to S.M. Kamalhasan, president of the Coimbatore Goldsmith Association, there are about 5000 goldsmiths in Coimbatore who buy gold and make jewellery and market it to retailers. They need to be aware of the new norms and hence the Association and the Bureau of Indian Standards will organise a programme on Sunday (July 11). ‘Improve awareness’ “We welcome the new norms and will take efforts to improve awareness among the goldsmiths,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jewellers-seek-amendments-to-hallmarking-norms-for-jewellery/article35260687.ece

11 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries asked not to deduct money from workers for vaccination||The Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health in Tiruppur has asked industrial associations to not deduct money from the salary of workers for their vaccination. In a communication to the major industrial associations in Tiruppur, the Directorate said vaccination is among the preventive measures to control the spread of the pandemic and industries should not deduct the vaccination cost from the salaries of the workers. If an industry had done so in advance, the amount should be repaid to the workers. G. Sampath, general secretary of CITU Banian Workers Union, said several industries had deducted the vaccination charges from the workers and after the communication from the Department concerned, they have repaid the amount to the workers. Initially, when the State government announced lockdown relaxations and urged industries to vaccinate workers within a month, several workers employed at a particular unit found jobs in other units after getting vaccinated. Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, says migration of workers from one factory to another is common in Tiruppur and at any point of time 10 % to 15 % of workers will be switching jobs. No factory can stop workers from migrating to another unit. Some companies cannot afford to vaccinate all workers paying the vaccination charges and hence, the Association has been asking the Union government to vaccinate all workers covered under the ESI scheme to be vaccinated at ESI hospitals. An industry source says that at present no industry is looking at vaccination while recruiting workers. Labour shortage is high in Tiruppur and hence, workers switching jobs easily find work. However, some industries are bearing the cost for migrating the workers and if the workers migrate after the vaccination, it becomes a problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-asked-not-to-deduct-money-from-workers-for-vaccination/article35260688.ece

Chetty Street resident A. Nataraja said he received the second dose vaccine in no time. It was a long overdue step from the Corporation, he added. Sources in the Corporation said as against the 1,000 doses despatched, the number of people vaccinated stood at 1,150. This was the Corporation’s first such vaccination drive.

Speaking to reporters, he said that when the new government assumed office, the pandemic was at its peak. There were also reports of large-scale irregularities and other violations by the previous regime across the State. “The Chief Minister has instructed us focus on fighting the pandemic first. We have successfully overcome the major part of the challenge. Now, the government is preparing to face any new crisis such as a possible third wave or so on,” he said. He said that the previous regime had wasted six lakh doses of vaccines. “Whoever was found responsible, will be prosecuted as per the laws,” he added. To a query, he said that during the last regime 60 lakh people had been vaccinated and at least 3,000 staff including doctors, frontline and para-medical nurses had to be regularised. “There are many issues to be resolved. We will discuss with the Chief Minister and try to take favourable decisions in public interest,” he said. Appreciating the medical fraternity for bringing down the positive cases to less than 300 as on July 9, he said that the review with health officials indicated that they can tackle any issues which may crop up in the near future. Showing their preparedness level, a new 100-bedded isolation ward exclusively for paediatric patients, which includes 70 beds with oxygen and 30 with ventilator facilities, was declared open by Cooperation Minister I.

Talavadi is located about 120 km from Erode and borders Karnataka. Agriculture and cattle rearing are the prime source of income for the people. In 2015, Sathyamangalam taluk was bifurcated to form the new Talavadi taluk with 21 revenue villages and 50 hamlets. It has a total population of over 76,000 with the majority being Kannada-speaking people. Though the hill receives rains, inadequate availability of water for domestic purposes and farming continues to be a perennial problem. The stream that originates in Talamalai forest area passes through Neithalapuram, Chikalli, Ikkalur, Maharajanpuram, Talavadi, Osur, Bharathipuram and reaches Chikkahole dam in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka. “Since Talavadi receives rains frequently, rainwater flows into the stream that enters Karnataka,” said S. Manickam, coordinator of the association. He wanted a check dam constructed across the stream, which would help in ground water recharge. Members of the association had submitted a petition to District Collector H. Krishnanunni during his recent visit to Talavadi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/talavadi-farmers-demand-check-dam-across-stream/article35260815.ece

Its president S.M. Jeyakumar said that there were at least 20 Central government offices in Madurai. A wellness centre should be opened here taking into account the welfare of the Central government employees and pensioners. The justification to open such a centre is that there should be a minimum of 6000 beneficiaries that includes Central government employees and pensioners. But there were more than 10,000 beneficiaries in Madurai. Such a centre in Madurai would be a boon to the Central government employees and pensioners from the southern districts. The demand has been ignored though proposals had been sent to the Centre. These centres were functioning in smaller cities in other States.

11 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Need for concerted efforts to protect Vaigai||A study conducted by Centre for Urban Water Resource (CURE) of Dhan Foundation revealed that physical, chemical and biological parameters of the Vaigai are unfit for use. The samples lifted from eight out of nine spots of the Vaigai were found to be unfit for human use. The members of the CURE had conducted a study titled ‘Urban Vaigai- Under Isolation,’ which was released in Dhan Foundation’s magazine ‘Water Watch.’ The study said that ancient Tamil epics like Silapathikaram, Agananuru, Purananuru, Kalithogai and Thiruvilaiyadal Purnam had spoken about a thriving Vaigai river. However, the river is full of prosopsis juliflora, water hyacinth, sewage and solid waste due to urbanisation. The Vaigai is completely alkaline in nature. The samples lifted from the check dam at Ismailpuram showed the presence of ammonia, which is an indicator of high level of degeneration. The dissolved oxygen in the Vaigai varies from 1 to 4 mg per litre. Usually, a value of zero dissolved oxygen would indicate that the river is technically dead. Panthalkudi channel Similarly the levels of Biological Oxygen Demand, which is an indicator of contamination, varies from 30 to 120 mg per litre. The Panthalkudi channel contributes to the maximum load of contamination to the Vaigai. In the core city, growth of water hyacinth in the river indicates the presence of nutrients. Restricting sewage and solid waste into river is the only way to safeguard the Vaigai. The team made a field visit to the Vaigai starting from the Kochadai pumping station to Viraganoor regulator to understand the present condition of the scenario. It has classified 11 km of the urban river into four segments. It said retaining walls and four-lane roads laid along the Vaigai under the Vaigai Riverfront Development of the Smart Cities Mission must consider the water holding capacity to prevent any possible flood. There is a need for collective action to prevent further deterioration of the Vaigai and to protect the river.  With retaining walls and four-lane roads having come up along the Vaigai, water holding capacity must be studied to prevent flood ‘Water Watch’ study||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-for-concerted-efforts-to-protect-vaigai/article35260784.ece

Justice G. Chandrasekharan observed that installation of mobile phone towers to connect India through its length and breadth was the absolute need of the hour. Due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation, students were being taught through online classes. Business transactions and official meetings were being held through video conferencing.

The company had sought police protection in order to install the mobile phone towers across various places in the southern districts. The company said that local residents were opposing the installation. Also, their applications seeking permission were pending before the respective district authorities. The court directed the district authorities concerned to act on the applications and pass an appropriate order.

In a letter addressed to Chief Minister M. K. Stalin, its State general secretary C. Chandrakumar welcomed the proposal and exhorted the State government to consider handing over the responsibility of distributing ration commodities through PDS system to the Civil Supplies Corporation. Stating that necessary infrastructure and other facilities required to carry out the exercise was already available with the Corporation, he claimed that the Corporation stands out as the best unit among the agencies involved in civil supplies-related works at the national-level. At the same time, the Union exhorted the State government to consider the formation of a separate unit within the Corporation for carrying out timely movement of paddy procured at the direct purchase centres to the storage points. The absence of a dedicated unit to ensure quick and safe transportation of procured paddy from the DPCs to the storage points result in loss of paddy due to natural calamities, Mr. Chandrakumar added.

Sekarbabu said on Saturday that the DMK government would give priority to the filling of vacancies in temples. Speaking to reporters after visiting the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam here, he said the AIADMK government had made announcements to fill these vacancies, but failed to carry them through. He received representations that the backlog had affected the routine work at many temples. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin was committed to addressing all grievances. The HR&CE Department was asked to list the vacancies. As a first step, appointments would be made on compassionate grounds. Likewise, many representations highlighted the delay in payment of pension to retired temple employees, and they would also be considered, he said. Asked about the illegal occupation of temple lands, including those of Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Mr. Sekarbabu said action would be taken to retrieve the assets. The Srirangam temple owned 330 acres, as per the records being preserved since 1866, but only 24 acres was under the control of the temple administration. The rest was being held by encroachers in the form of houses, shops and business establishments. If the landholders approached the temple or the HR&CE Department, they could be treated as tenants. Otherwise, judicial action would be taken against them. The Minister said the Srirangam temple was getting a large number of cattle in offerings. Since the ‘goshala’ was overflowing, a proposal would be made to open one more shelter. Food scheme To a question, the Minister said the ‘annadhanam’ scheme had been suspended because of COVID-19. Instead of food being served at the temples, it was given in packets to devotees and the poor. The scheme would be revived once the pandemic came under control. R. Kannan, Additional Commissioner, HR&CE; S. Sivarasu, Collector; S. Marimuthu, Joint Commissioner, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple; and senior officials accompanied the Minister.

Teachers attached to various government schools in the block gather and teach adults over the age of 18 how to read and write. Speaking to The Hindu , Block Education Officer K. Marudhanayagam said that a census was taken in the block where it was found at least 8,000 people, many of them women were illiterate. The teachers organised themselves into teams and decided to take up this project. While some schools began teaching the adults in November, some started in February. A total of 40 centres, of at least 20 students in each, are functioning. “Some have learnt to sign their names in English and Tamil, while some have gone as far as reading books prescribed for students of Class 3 and 4,” Mr. Marudhanayagam said. Chithra Rani, one of the teachers who has undertaken the programme, said that with students unable to attend classes due to COVID-19, the teachers felt the need to help the adults out. Ms. Chitra went door-to-door to meet them and tell them the benefits of learning to read and write. “It is difficult to bring them to the school to learn, as they have housework to do, but they just need a little push,” she said. There are women over the age of 80 who now read books fluently. “A 60-year-old grandmother became overjoyed as she signed her name at the bank after not being able to do it all these years. These are small wins for us,” she said. Homework Mr. Marudhanayagam said that children also get motivated as they watch their grandparents learn. “We send the adults some homework for practice. When the children see their grandparents do homework instead of watching TV, they follow suit,” he said.  It is difficult to bring them to the school to learn, as they have housework, but they just need a little push Chithra Rani Teacher||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/age-no-bar-for-learning-here/article35260777.ece
11 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||MP moots meeting to expedite land acquisition for airport expansion||With land acquisition process for the proposed expansion of Tiruchi airport not making much headway, Tiruchi MP Su.Thirunavukkarasar has mooted a joint meeting with local Ministers, revenue and airport officials to discuss the issues involved and expedite the process. He made the suggestion at the Airport Advisory Committee meeting chaired by him here on Saturday. “Now that we have two Ministers from Tiruchi, I suggested to the Airport Director that the Collector may be requested to convene a joint meeting with them. I will also make a request. Revenue and AAI officials can participate in the meeting and discuss ways to sort out of the issues in land acquisition,” Mr. Thirunavukkarasar told The Hindu . After the first phase of extension of the runway from 6,000 to about 8,000 feet, carried out over a decade ago, the AAI drew up plans to expand it further to 12,000 feet in phases to facilitate operation of bigger and wide-bodied aircraft. It sought about 683.32 acres, which included about 337.70 acres of defence land. The State government had in 2018 accorded administrative sanction to acquire about 345.62 acres, including wetlands, located mostly at the rear of the airport, mainly for extension of the runway. A team of revenue officials, headed by a Special Tahsildhar, was formed to carry out the acquisition, but the task is yet to be completed owing to various reasons, including litigations. Some of the land owners, especially farmers, oppose acquisition of their properties. Land for ROB Mr. Thirunavukkarasar also said that the Defence Ministry is likely to pass orders within a week or so for transfer of a small piece of its land required for the completion of the road overbridge near the railway junction in the city. Referring to the long delayed transfer of the defence land for the project, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar said that he had recently met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi and pressed for the delinking of the land transfer requests from the State for this project from various other projects, as only a small piece of land (67 cents) was sought. The issue was discussed at a meeting of senior officials of the Defence Ministry recently and the orders are expected shortly, the MP said. Hospital upgrade Mr.Thirunavakkarasar, who later inspected the ESI Hospital at Periyamliaguparai, said he would take steps to upgrade the hospital by doubling the bed strength to 100 from the present 50. “The hospital serves as a referral centre for ESI dispensaries in six or seven districts in the region and increasing the bed strength was essential and will benefit a large number of people. Some other requirements such as filling up of vacancies were highlighted to me during my visit and I had promised to take them up. I have also promised funds for improving certain amenities, including establishing a water treatment plant,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-moots-meeting-to-expedite-land-acquisition-for-airport-expansion/article35260780.ece
11 July 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||So. Sathiyaseelan, Tamil scholar, no more||Noted orator, writer and academic So. Sathiyaseelan passed away late on Friday due to age-related ailments. He was 88.  Sathiyaseelan won the State’s Kalaimamani award in 2011 and the ‘Sollin Selvar’ prize in 2015 (as part of the Chithirai Thirunal awards) in recognition of his services to the Tamil language.  He was a popular pattimandram (debate) moderator and speaker and held the floor at over 10,000 meetings and pattimandrams . He wrote 22 books and made several audio recordings on a variety of topics related to Tamil civilisation and culture. Family sources said that Sathiyaseelan remained active till the very end and was in the process of readying his latest book, a literary study of the commonalities between Thirukkural and Silappathikaram , for publication, when his health declined. The book was to be launched in Malaysia this week. Born as the eldest of five children on April 14, 1933, in Perambalur to J. N. Somasundaram, a freedom fighter, and Meenambal, Sathiyaseelan was the first graduate in his family. He had also worked as a schoolteacher and college lecturer and, in his last post, was the principal of Urumu Dhanalakshmi College in Tiruchi. His interest in public speaking was kindled by his early exposure to the speeches of orators and social activists such as Devaneya Pavanar, Swami Chidbhavananda and Natesa Mudaliar. Though he was known for his love for Tamil, Sathiyaseelan actually wanted to be an English teacher. In an earlier interview with The Hindu , he said he joined Moorthy’s Tutorials in Madras (now Chennai) to learn English. “But after some time, I was able to feel the importance of the mother tongue. Without proficiency in the mother tongue, we cannot teach, preach or express ourselves in culture,” he said. He excelled as a master of the Tamil debating tradition of pattimandram , where abstract topics are discussed by two teams of speakers in the presence of a moderator. Sathiyaseelan is survived by his daughter Dr. Chitra Valluvan and wife Dhanabhagyam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-scholar-and-noted-orator-so-sathiyaseelan-passes-away/article35260672.ece

Rajini Pandian, district secretary, Valarum Thamizhagam Katchi, was allegedly hacked to death by an armed gang at Vadasangethi near Thiruthuraipoondi. He was rushed to the Government Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries. His relatives and party workers gathered at the hospital and demanded immediate arrest of the culprits.

On Friday, a quarrel broke out between Rajini Pandian’s supporter and another person. A complaint was lodged by Rajini Pandian’s supporter in this regard with the police later. Police said the opposite group might have attacked Rajini Pandian with lethal weapons. The police have taken into custody two persons from Edaiyur Sangethi. In the meantime, supporters of Rajini Pandian attacked the owner of a motorcycle workshop located near the Government Hospital on the presumption that he was spying for the other caste members who have committed the crime.

The members, including former Additional Director of Animal Husbandry S. Manoharan, Landscape Co-ordinator from the Worldwide Fund for Nature Boominathan, Nilgiris-based conservationist N. Mohanraj, Kalidasan from OSAI environmental organisation and B. Ramakrishnan, Assistant Professor from the Department of Wildlife Biology, Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam, visited Vazhaithottam in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), where the animal is being kept inside a ‘kraal’ (elephant shelter). Deputy Director of MTR, L.C.S.Srikanth, briefed them on the condition of Rivaldo, including the impaired vision and the narrowing of nostrils. Rajesh Kumar, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp said it was extremely risky to tranquilise Rivaldo, due to the injury to his trunk. Therefore, the elephant had to be kept captive in Vazhaithottam, where his injuries were being treated. Some of the committee members asked for clarity of the extent of the elephant’s injuries, and discussed whether it could be freed. Deputy Director, L.C.S.Srikanth, said that the forest department had a few months prior to its capture, noticed a change in the behavior of the elephant, with it being spotted primarily around human habitations and seeking food from local residents. “There are two other elephants, known as Messi and Rivaldo Junior, who associate with the elephant. One of our concerns is that with this particular elephant being so habituated to humans, that the other two elephants too may become habituated to humans in the long run,” said Mr. Srikanth. K.K.Kaushal, Field Director of MTR, said the opinion of the expert committee and the High Court order would be taken into consideration before deciding whether Rivaldo could be released back into the wild.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expert-panel-visits-rivaldo-to-decide-on-its-release/article35260700.ece

11 July 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Fans await reopening of touring talkies||G. Mahesh, a 50-year-old electrician from Kannigapuram in Ranipet, remembers paying 15 paise for the tharai ticket (sitting on the ground) at the Ganesh Thirai Arangam (theatre), a tent kottai, and watching Thiruvilayadal while munching on murukku. His fond memories, which he cherishes now, are three-decades-old. The tent talkies, which gave Mahesh such lovely memories faces a bleak future post lockdown. “This is one of the last surviving tent talkies in the district and even in the State. There used to be more than eight such talkies in the locality but all of them have closed down. This is one safe place as they do not allow drunkards, dancing and bursting of crackers inside. Now, murukku has been replaced by hot bajji , bonda and tea . Popcorn is a recent addition. Before it closed for the lockdown, the last movie that was screened was M.G.R. starrer Ragasiya Polic e,” he says. The theatre, which has been in existence since 1987 and is a favourite among villagers, is tucked away in Puttu Thakku village and is situated on a one-acre plot of land. Behind the faded light blue walls of a building, surrounded by yellow compound walls, a huge white screen is located beneath a tin-sheeted roof. Foot marks on the sand inside indicate the number of people who used to throng the talkies. Seventy-year-old P.K. Ganesan who runs it, claims that he has been running the facility for poor people. He now plans to start a mini theatre with affordable tickets in the same locality or continue to maintain the talkies, on rented land, he says. Despite the traditional look of the premises, the audience is happy with the sound and light features in the talkies. “The first movie screened here was Vetri Vinayagar . Initially, films were used, now we use cube projectors and good sound technology. There are only two classes of ticket — tharai and chair, and they are priced Rs. 20 and Rs. 30 respectively. Behind the tharai ticket area, is the box with cushioned chairs. The entire capacity is 225 but the space can accommodate over 1,000,” says Mr. Ganesan. With the advent of OTT platforms, many theatres have lost their audiences. “But people continue to come here. I do not earn any profit from this but it is a favourite among the poor. They can enjoy the movie with a good breeze from all four sides. Besides, they can have a good time with their family by spending around Rs. 200, including tea, snacks and tickets,” he says. Mr. Ganesan said after COVID-19, the future of the tent depends on the fate of the film industry. Actor Yogi Babu, who visited the talkies prior to the first lockdown, said that it brought back memories of his childhood. “I was moved when I saw it and I was happy to hear that the owner was not running it for profit. I have even been to such talkies. We used to munch on samosas and have fun watching movies sitting on the floor. We used to laugh and cry together. Now these things are missing,” he says. “Such touring talkies should be preserved as these are places from which the industry grew,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fans-await-reopening-of-touring-talkies/article35261140.ece

11 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Will consider Ambareesh statue demand’||Laxman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister, said in Vijayapura on Saturday that the State government would consider the demand for erecting a monument in memory of Ambareesh, former MP and actor. “He was not just a politician. He was a popular actor and served the State in various capacities. Some of his fans are demanding a monument dedicated his memory. I think that is a fair demand. We will see what can be done,” he said. Mr. Savadi said he had no idea about the discussion between Sumalatha, MP, and H.D. Kumaraswamy, JD(S) leader, over allegations of stone quarries causing damage to the Krishna Raja Sagar. In Hubballi, Prahlad Joshi, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, said the issue should not be politicised. “The issue of stone quarries posing a threat to KRS is being debated by some leaders and their supporters. But there should be no attempt at politicisation of the issue. If leaders have any complaint about it, they should approach the Cauvery Neeravari Nigama. Its chief engineer has already clarified that there are no cracks in the dam. I think both leaders should end their discussion now,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-consider-ambareesh-statue-demand/article35260846.ece

11 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Health Department gears up to tackle Zika virus in State||Stepping up vector control measures across the State following the detection of Zika Virus Disease (ZVD) cases in Kerala, the Karnataka Health Department has asked health officials to test samples of suspected cases for Zika after ruling out dengue and chikungunya. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra told The Hindu that officials have been directed tofirst rule out dengue and chikungunya in all fever cases. “Although we have sounded a high alert in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Chamarajanagar bordering Kerala, surveillance has been stepped up across the State as mosquito breeding can happen anywhere,” he said. “ASHAs and Health Assistantshave been directed to intensify the routine surveillance activity in rural areas and fortnightly surveillance activity in urban areas. Municipal bodies have been asked to ensure effective disposal of solid waste to prevent mosquito breeding in peri-domestic spots,” he said. Virologist V. Ravi, who formerly headed the Department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, said dengue and zika viruses are closely related members of the flavivirus genus. Both are transmitted to humans via the day biting aedes aegypti mosquitoes that breed in small collections of fresh water. Dengue virus infection can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and rashes. In some cases, the disease can be severe, causing haemorrhagic fever and even shock (a dangerous drop in blood pressure). Zika virus causes a mostly mild disease characterised by fever, rash, joint pain, malaise, headache, and conjunctivitis. In adults, it can occasionally cause Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune condition affecting the peripheral nerves, and in pregnant women who have been infected in the first trimester, the virus can lead to brain defects in the developing fetus. Unlike dengue, Zika is also transmitted through the sexual route. There is also a risk of contracting Zika after blood transfusion from an infected individual. Dr. Ravi said Zika virus is not new to India and has been circulating here since 1954. However, there have not been any large outbreaks except one in Rajasthan in 2018 wherein 159 people were infected. Senior scientist S.K. Ghosh, who formerly headed thefield station of ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research in Bengaluru, said with the emergence of new vector-borne diseases the focus should be on recruiting more entomologists. “We do not have adequate number of trained entomologists now,” he said. “It is important that people limit their outdoor exposure, use high-grade mosquito repellents and stay covered during the daytime. People staying indoors should ensure that there is no water stagnation within the premises of their homes,” he added. Swati Rajagopal, consultant, Infectious Diseases and Travel Medicine at Aster CMI Hospital, said people with symptoms should get plenty of rest and adequate fluid intake apart from treatment for the febrile illness. The incubation period of ZVD is estimated to be 3-14 days and the symptoms typically last for 2-7 days,” the doctor said. Typically not fatal She underlined that there was no need to panic as Zika infection is not typically fatal. “It is important that authorities ensure proper sanitisation measures in low-lying and crowded areas to restrict the spread of another infection. If left unchecked, in time along with the third wave of the virus this can prove to be a double whammy for the healthcare sector,” she added.  ASHAs and Health Assistants have been directed to intensify the routine surveillance in rural areas and fortnightly surveillance in urban areas. Municipal bodies have been asked to ensure effective disposal of solid waste to prevent mosquito breeding K.V.

11 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Agencies to complete work on 11 roads by July 15||When restrictions were eased as part of Unlock 3.0, Preetam Kumar, a consultant, was asked to physically report to work. However, the commute from his residence at Vijayanagar to his office on Residency Road is a nightmare as several roads continue to remain dug up as part of the Bengaluru Smart City Project work. The recent spate of rain has only made the situation worse. “Getting in and out of the central business district (CBD) area, where most of the roadworks are under way, is a pain. During peak hours, it almost takes 45 minutes to get in and out of the CBD. I wish the government had finished with these projects during the lockdown and before the monsoon,” he said. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also holds the charge of Bengaluru Development, had asked officials to complete the work. In January this year, at a review meeting after an inspection, he had set a deadline of May 31 to complete all the work on 32 roads in the CBD area. At a review meeting on June 10, he pulled up officials for missing the deadline and for delays in the implementation of the Smart City Project works. Expressing concern over “imminent unlocking and commencement of the monsoon”, he set a new deadline of June 30. However, work on only nine of the 32 roads have been completed to date. Civic agencies are confident of completing the work on another 11 roads by July 15. “We need to club utility lines of power, water, and telecom at the street corners which are the only works pending on most of these 11 roads. This will be completed by the next weekend,” said B.S. Prahalad, Chief Engineer, Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. However, agencies estimate that ongoing work on another eight roads, including Kamaraj Road, Miller’s Road, and Dickenson Road, can be completed only by July 30, and that on the remaining five roads, including St. John’s Church Road, and Avenue Road, only by August 30. Traffic jams B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner, Traffic, Bengaluru, said traffic snarls in the CBD had become common ever since the city was unlocked. “On our part, we are managing traffic and allowing roadworks to happen even during the day, in the hope that they get completed quickly,” he said. Since the monsoon has also begun in earnest, the rain has only add to the woes on the streets. Mr. Prahalad said though the lockdown period could have been used to complete pending work, that opportunity was lost owing to labour shortage issues during the period. “Many labourers had to be quarantined and that hit the morale of other workers as well. It created a fear psychosis and we found it extremely difficult to find labourers during the lockdown. Now, work is in full swing and will be completed at the earliest,” he said. But with agencies promising to finish work for several months now, commuters remain sceptical.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/agencies-to-complete-work-on-11-roads-by-july-15/article35260599.ece
11 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC directs State govt. to return 354 acres of land to Jamanlal Bajaj Seva Trust||The High Court of Karnataka has directed the State government to return 354 acres 10 guntas of land to the Jamanlal Bajaj Seva Trust by quashing a 2017 order of the land tribunal, which had declared that the trust was in “excess” possession of this land in violation of the land-holding limit under the Karnataka Land Reforms (KLR) Act, 1961. The court also declared this land spread in different survey numbers in Srigandhadakaval, Herohalli and Gidadakonenahalli villages, which were part of the 400 acres of lands purchased by the trust in 1960, “was not agricultural lands within the meaning of Section 2(18) of the KLR Act” for applying ceiling on land-holding limit. Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by the trust questioning the November 28, 2017, order of the Bengaluru North taluk and the December 7, 2017, order of taking possession of the land based on the tribunal’s finding. “It is sad that an ashram to propagate Gandhian values and envisaged by Acharya Vinoba Bhave has been struggling in legal battle for decades. In the meanwhile, the trust has lost 78 acres of valuable land due to acquisition by Bangalore Development Authority and encroachments,” the court observed, while noticing chequered history of litigations between the trust and the government authorities over the land since 1980s. Noticing that a survey report of the tahsildar of July, 2015, found no cultivable land in possession of the trust, the court said that twice early the High Court had remanded to the land tribunal the issue of ‘excess’ possession of land by the trust. In the first order of 2010, the tribunal had said the trust was in possession of 213 acres 20 guntas ‘excess’ land and in the second order of September 2015, the tribunal had said the trust held 265 acres 24 guntas ‘excess’ land, and the court said these two orders of the tribunal were remanded back. While finding fault with the tribunal for not adhering to the High Court’s earlier direction to consider the 2015 survey report, the court directed the Chief Secretary to ensure that revenue authorities are properly appraised of the position of law. The government had contended that the trust had purchased agricultural lands and it had filed declaration on possessing ‘excess’ land under the KLR Act but later started claiming that they were not agricultural lands and belong to urban agglomeration though the trust had not declared so when urban land ceiling law was in force. The trust has stated that Acharya Vinoba Bhave inspired Kamal Nayan Bajaj, one of the trustees, to set up an international sarvodaya centre in Bengaluru, and the trust, on purchasing 400 acres of land, had established an International Sarvodaya Centre known as ‘Vishwaneedam’ between 1962 and 1972, and has been carrying on activities of social and rural developments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-directs-state-govt-to-return-354-acres-of-land-to-jamanlal-bajaj-seva-trust/article35260621.ece

She was on the KSR Bengaluru-Danapur Sanghmitra Special Express from Krishnarajapuram to Bangarapet section when the personnel on duty spotted her. She told the RPF personnel that she hailed from Bihar, but had run away from home due to repeated sexual harassment by her father. “She seemed scared and requested help,” said a senior officer. She claimed her mother had been aware of the situation, but would not intervene. “The girl said her parents had fixed her marriage against her will, and hence, she chose to run away from home last year,” said the senior officer. In her statement, she said she managed to reach the city last year, but was drugged by an unknown person who kept her in a windowless cell for about a month. She was being taken to an undisclosed location when she was found, said the officer quoting the girl’s statement. The RPF personnel searched for the person accompanying her but in vain.

11 July 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Deficient rainfall leaves farmers worried in Malnad||The Malnad region received deficient rainfall after the onset of the southwest monsoon, leaving the farming community worried. Farmers who already began the cultivation, hoping for good rains, are worried about the crop, while those yet to sow seeds are still waiting for the right time. Against a normal of 539 mm of rainfall, the region, consisting of four districts, received only 327 mm between June 1 and July 9, registering a deficit of 39%. After the first two weeks in June, many places in the region did not receive heavy rains at all. Shivammoga district registered rainfall of 438.9 mm against the normal 696.4 mm. Chikkamagaluru received 294.7 mm against the normal of 493.4 mm. In Hassan, the rainfall recorded was 157.6 mm against the normal of 238 mm. H.R. Basavarajappa, a farmer and leader of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, said “The cultivation has been affected due to erratic rainfall. There was a gap of 20 days between rainy days. Farmers cultivating maize are losing hope of good yield.” In plantation areas, the growers are worried over the yield of coffee. The planters are already at loss owing to various factors, including floods in the previous years, besides a shortage of workers. “There was a long break in the monsoon. When temperature increases due to this gap, there are chances of white stem borer attack. Besides that, if the monsoon prolongs following the long gap, it would be harmful to the crop in the long run”, said H.T. Mohan Kumar, president of Karnataka Growers’ Federation. Jog Falls The Tourism Department opened the gates of the waterfalls at Jog near Sagar for tourists on June 28. In the first few days, hundreds of people visited the place to witness the grand spectacle. As the rains receded the falls lost their vigour. H.S.

11 July 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||BSY lays foundation stone for vegetable market complex||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday laid the foundation stone for a multi-storey vegetable market complex that could bring all growers and vendors under a single roof to carry out their transactions. “Vegetable farmers and vendors had been doing their business on the roadside and pavements. They find it difficult to sell and purchase vegetables during the rainy season. The roadside market was also creating traffic problems and leading to many accidents. Now, their dream of selling and buying vegetables under a safe roof will be realised with the construction of the market complex in Kalaburagi. The project should be completed within the stipulated time maintaining the quality,” Mr. Yediyurappa said in his address. The complex is going to come up on a 2-acre plot at the MSK Mill area at a cost of Rs. 26.3 crore. The Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB) will contribute Rs. 20 crore and the Kalaburagi Urban Development Authority (KUDA) will contribute the rest. The complex will have a basement, a ground floor, and a first floor. The basement will have a parking space, a water sump, an electrical room and the ground floor will house 254 shops of different sizes and platforms for wholesale vegetable auctions, space for solid waste management, a cold-storage facility, and toilets. The first floor will have 47 shops, an office, a bank, and other facilities. “This vegetable market complex is first-of-its-kind in the State. I have happily laid the foundation stone for it today. I will brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the features and he will, I am sure, be very happy,” Mr. Yediyurappa said. Reiterating his commitment to the welfare of the farming community, the Chief Minister said that agriculture had been his government’s priority. “We have always put agriculture on top priority. Realising the difficulties of the floriculture farmers who suffered a lot during the COVID-19 lockdown, we offered Rs. 10,000 financial aid per hectare and over 20,000 farmers got the benefits. Similarly, we have given Rs. 10,000 per acre aid to over 69,000 horticulture farmers,” he said. In a special mention, Mr. Yediyurappa said that Shoba Karandlaje, who was recently inducted as Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, will tour the State shortly and address the farmers’ issues. “She [Ms. Karandlaje] toured the State many times addressing the issues of farmers so far.

11 July 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||CM inaugurates completed projects in Kalaburagi||After laying a foundation stone for a vegetable market complex at MSK Mill extension, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inaugurated many completed projects at a public programme outside the newly built PWD office here on Saturday. The projects included a PWD office building (Lokopayogi Bhavan), two flyovers (one at Sharana Sirasagi and other at Ram Mandir), Kittur Rani Chennamma Residential school building, post-matric hostels for boys and pre-matric hostels for girls. “We are committed to fighting regional imbalances in the State and I have allocated Rs. 3,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget for the purpose. For Kalyana Karnataka, the action plans for various development projects involving a cost of Rs. 1,500 crore have been approved. The funds have been allocated to different districts and taluks based on the Dr. Nanjundappa Committee report,” Mr. Yediyurappa said in his address after the inauguration. Pointing to the revenue crunch caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown, Mr. Yediyurappa said that his government did not cut any funds to the development despite the serious deficit in the revenues. “Due to COVID-19 crisis, there was a serious revenue crunch. Yet, we did not cut any allocations for development. The beautiful PWD building right before you is the glaring example for it. Under the Social Development department, we have spent Rs. 3,200.87 crore for Scheduled Castes and Rs. 1,2070.5 crore for Scheduled Tribes in the State. These funds are used for maintaining hostels, offering scholarships, running residential schools. Around 11.73 lakh students from Scheduled Castes and around 4.62 lakh students from Scheduled Tribes are benefited from it,” he said. The Chief Minister said that his government was ready to handle the pandemic’s third wave. “After successfully facing the COVID-19 second wave, we are now completely prepared to face the third wave. As per the experts, the third wave would bring home more difficulties for us. I, therefore, request you all to join hands with the government in its fight against the pandemic by strictly mandating the guidelines such as wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and cleanliness, and using sanitisers. We are also seeking help from the public to handle the pandemic situation. As many as 134 donors have got registered in CSR portal developed for the purpose and equipment worth Rs. 135 crore have been distributed,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-inaugurates-completed-projects-in-kalaburagi/article35260841.ece
11 July 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||HDK and Sumalatha should stop tussle: CM||Refusing to comment on the ongoing war of words between H.D. Kumaraswamy, former Chief Minister, and Sumalatha, MP, over illegal mining in Mandya, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa asked them to stop the tussle for the sake of the district’s development. “They need not lock horns like this,” he said cryptically on Saturday, adding that he was satisfied that the M.H. Ambareesh  memorial project had got the government nod. Earlier in the day, Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani dismissed the allegations of illegal mining at Baby Betta in Mandya district and expressed his government’s readiness to order a probe if Ms. Sumalatha would produce substantial evidence. “There are no mining activities taking place around KRS dam or Baby Betta in the district. I personally visited the spot after the allegations were made. I had directed the officials to stop stone quarrying and take action against violators. Those who had violated the rules were fined. There is a ban on stone mining around the KRS reservoir. If Ms. Sumalatha has evidence about illegal mining, let her produce it and we will order a thorough investigation,” Mr. Nirani said. Mr. Nirani said the verbal clash between the two leaders would in no way help solve any problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-and-sumalatha-should-stop-tussle-cm/article35260626.ece
11 July 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Forest Department will further expand mangrove cover in coast: Limbavali||Minister for Forest, Kannada and Culture Arvind Limbavali on Saturday said the Forest Department will be encouraged to expand the mangrove forest patch in coastal districts so as to conserve environment and boost eco-tourism. Speaking to reporters after a boat ride through the mangrove forest along Panchagangavali river in Kundapur, Mr. Limbavali praised the initiative of the department in raising mangrove in about 15 hectares of backwaters of Panchagangavali in a year. He asked department officials to raise more such plantations in Kundapur and Byndoor taluks that have vast river backwater system. Stating that mangroves would act as natural barriers to prevent sea erosion and cyclonic impact, Mr. Limbavali noted that Udupi district has mangroves spread over 600 hectares area in Kodi, Jalady, Anagalli, Uppinakudru, Hattikudru, Kannada Kudru, Paduvari, Koderi, Sasthana, and Udyavar. Mangroves also act as breeding places of marine fauna, he noted. Speaking to reporters later at Udupi, Mr. Limbavali said he was aware of the issue of deemed forests in the district and would resolve them in about three months. The district has over 68,000 hectares of deemed forests and there were demands for diverting them for other purposes, including housing. Regarding Kumki, Baane, and other such land, there were discussions and they would be addressed subsequently. “We have to work towards conserving the forest resources for the next generation.” The Minister said Deputy Conservators of Forests have been authorised to approve upgradation of road infrastructure, from mud to bitumen and from bitumen to concrete, in forest areas other than wildlife reserves or national parks. For upgrading road and power infrastructure in reserve forests, online applications have to be made to the Karnataka Wildlife Board, which would be considered at the earliest. Similarly, public utilities, namely bus shelters, etc., should be allowed without cutting trees, he said. The Minister said no law prohibits diversion of social forest lands for the use of public purposes. Inaugurating the Salumarada Thimmakka Tree Park at Hebri, Mr. Limbavali said the government had given revenue lands to raise social forests and if the lands were required for government works, including power infrastructure, they should be given, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forest-department-will-further-expand-mangrove-cover-in-coast-limbavali/article35261019.ece
11 July 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||75 beneficiaries receive Niramaya insurance cards||Following a lull for nearly two years, cards under the Niramaya Health Insurance, which provides affordable health insurance to persons with physical disabilities, were issued at the Seva Bharati’s Chetana Child Development Centre here on Saturday. As many as 75 persons received the cards. The Nirmaya Health Insurance scheme has been floated by The National Trust for Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities, which comes under the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Under the scheme, health expenses to the extent of Rs. 1 lakh, which includes a maximum of Rs. 70,000 towards hospitalisation, Rs. 14,500 towards out-patient charges, and Rs. 10,000 for ongoing therapies for reducing impact of disability and its complications, are reimbursed. Dakshina Kannada district officer for Empowerment of Differently Abled and Senior Citizens D. Yamuna said the local-level committee failed to process applications for Niramaya and other welfare schemes of the National Trust in Dakshina Kannada. The committee was recently reconstituted and Seva Bharati has now been entrusted with responsibility to process the applications for Niramaya. Cards for all the 75 applicants have been issued, she said. Ganaraj from the Seva Bharati said there is no enrolment fee for those from the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. For the non-BPL category, annual enrolment fee is Rs. 500. The scheme will be valid for a period between April and March and has to be renewed every year. Among those who received the Niramaya Health Insurance cards on Saturday included Parashuram, a photographer from Puttur. “I applied for the scheme two years ago for my daughter. This April, I received call asking for additional documents,” he said. Member-secretary of Dakshina Kannada District Legal Services Authority (DKDLSA) Pruthviraj Vernekar, who gave away the cards, said it was important to reach out welfare schemes for the persons with physical disabilities. “If any person with physical disability is facing issues in availing benefits, they can freely contact DKDLSA, which will provide all support for redressal of the problem,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/75-beneficiaries-receive-niramaya-insurance-cards/article35261025.ece
11 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Revision of day train schedule sought||Train patrons in Mangaluru have urged Railways to modify the timings of the day train services between Mangaluru and Bengaluru to more travellers. The departure and arrival timings of day trains were not convenient and hence they should be revised, the patrons have told South Western Railway. G.K. Bhat, rail activist in a letter to SWR, said Train 06211, Yeshwantpur-Karwar tri-weekly special on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 06575, Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Junction Gomateshwara tri-weekly special on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 06539 weekly express special on Saturdays leave Yeshwantpur at 7 a.m. to reach Mangaluru Junction at 5 p.m. Their pairing trains, Train 06212 Karwar-Yeshwantpur tri-weekly special on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and 06576 Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur Gomateshwara tri-weekly special on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays leave Mangaluru Junction at 11.30 a.m. to reach Yeshwantpur at 8.20 p.m. while Train 0654 Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur weekly express special leaves Mangaluru at 9.15 a.m. to reach Yeshwantpur 8.05 p.m. Mr. Bhat said the 7 a.m. departure for these trains at Yeshwantpur was too early for Bengaluru residents to reach Yeshwantpur from different parts of the city. They should be made to leave Yeshwantpur at 9.30 a.m. to reach Mangaluru Junction at 6.30 p.m. With this timing, crossing of up and down trains on Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya Road Ghat section too gets avoided, he said. On the other hand, day trains should start early from Mangaluru Junction to reach Yeshwantpur by evening so as to help passengers to reach their places at different parts of Bengaluru when public transport was available. If their departure timing was advanced to 8.15 a.m., the trains could reach Yeshwantpur by 5.15 p.m., Mr. Bhat said. Prakash Suvarna, a rail patron, also urged the Railways to extend the day trains to Mangaluru Central as proposed earlier by the Railway Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/revision-of-day-train-schedule-sought/article35261016.ece
11 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Associate Professor sentenced to 3 years in jail||III Additional District Sessions Judge B.B. Jakati on Friday sentenced Anita Ravishankar, Associate Professor in Mangalore University’s Sociology Department, to three years imprisonment on finding her guilty of accepting Rs. 5,000 from a Ph.d student. According to the charge-sheet filed by Lokayukta Police, Ms. Ravishankar was the guide for Prema D’Souza and three other students for doctoral research on “Domestic Violence against women in Mangaluru” in 2011-12. Ms. Ravishankar took Rs. 14,000 from each of the four students saying that it was the expenses for an external examiner coming from Mysuru for evaluation of research document. She further asked each one of them to pay Rs. 16,800. While the remaining three students paid the money, Ms. D’souza, instead, filed a complaint with the Lokayukta Police. A team of Lokayukta Police led by then Police Inspector Umesh G. Shet caught Ms. Ravishankar in her office when she was accepting Rs. 5,000 from Ms. D’Souza on December 4, 2012. She was charged with offences under Section 7 and 13 (1) (D) of Prevention of Corruption Act. Special Public Prosecutor K.S.N. Rajesh examined nine witnesses. During hearing on sentencing, Ms. Ravishankar sought relaxation as she is set to retire in 2023 and the marriage of her daughter is scheduled in about six months. The Judge on Friday sentenced Ms. Ravishankar to three years in jail and imposed a fine of Rs. 15,000 for the offence under Section 13(1)(D) read with 13 (2) of Prevention of Corruption Act. She was also sentenced to two years in jail and imposed a fine of Rs. 15,000 for the offence punishable under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Both sentences will run concurrently. The judge directed her to pay Rs. 15,000 out of the fine amount as compensation to Ms. D’Souza, after the end of appeal period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/associate-professor-sentenced-to-3-years-in-jail/article35261018.ece

It is the government’s responsibility to strengthen the dam and the same would be done, he said while interacting with reporters in Udupi. He said Sumalatha, MP, and former Chief Minister and Janata Dal (S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy were engaged in a verbal duel over cracks on KRS. The party does not react to that issue, he said adding both have brought political discourse to lower levels. They should introspect, he added. Asked whether the BJP had left Ms. Sumalatha alone by not supporting her, Mr. Limbavali said the MP got elected as an Independent candidate. On the issue of alleged police brutality on Radhakrishna Nayak Hirgana, said to be a Congress worker, Mr. Limbavali said it was unfortunate that former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah supports Indian Army-baiter instead of condemning such an action. It was appropriate for Mr. Siddaramaiah to withdraw his words, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/krs-has-developed-cracks-minister/article35261021.ece

One child, who is three years old, has been left with the mother. Following a complaint to the Directorate of Child Protection, a team from the district administration comprising Sullia Tahsildar Anita Lakshmi, the Child Development Project officer, the Labour Inspector, Sullia police, and representatives of Bachpan Bachavo Andolan, visited the farmhouse of Vishwanath Bhat. They found the three-year-old child and six children aged between 10 and 12 in the house. They were produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on Saturday. CWC Chairman Renni D’Souza said these seven children lived with their mothers in the house of Mr. Bhat. These women have told CWC that Mr. Bhat was taking care of them. Apart from paying wages for the women working in the farm, Mr. Bhat was paying for the education of their children. As representatives of andolan have accused Mr. Bhat of bonded labour and forcing children to work in the farm, Mr. D’Souza said the CWC has directed the Labour Department and the office of District Child Protection Officer to submit separate reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/six-rescued-children-sent-to-institutions/article35261022.ece

11 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Illegal mining in Mandya: A saga of bans and non-implementation||The current political slugfest over illegal mining in Mandya – between Mandya MP Sumalatha and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy – is only the latest in a series of such periodic bouts on the issue that erupted in the district. The district administration of Mandya frequently orders “ban” on quarrying or use of explosives for stone extraction; the latest being soon after the blast in Hunasodu near Shivamogga in January this year which left six people dead. In August 2019, the authorities had announced a ban on use of explosives for stone extraction so as to rein in nearly 80 units that were then functioning in Srirangapatana and Pandavapura taluks, mostly without permits or their licences had not been renewed. This was followed by another ban in January 2020, but to no avail. M. Lakshman, convener of Cauvery Technical Committee, constituted by the Institution of Engineers, Mysuru chapter, and comprising members who have worked on dams, said these bans are only announced through the media but never implemented. It is business as usual after a few weeks and there is no monitoring on continuous basis. Illegal quarrying and mining is controlled by political leaders and include both the past and some present MLAs cutting across parties, and hence, the ban cannot be implemented, according to Mr. Lakshman. Though the focus tends to be on quarrying in Baby Betta Kavalu in Pandavpura taluk, due to its proximity to the KRS, there are scores of stone quarries operating without permit in the district and pose a threat to the structure. Seismic analysis The threat to the dam was also confirmed by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) when it submitted a report to the government in September 2018 based on seismic data monitoring and analysis. The KSNDMC has established VSAT Enabled Permanent Seismic Monitoring Stations on the KRS dam premises and it recorded two signatures of varying intensities within a gap of six seconds on September 25, 2018, and attributed it to quarry blasts. What is significant is that the two recorded signatures came from a radial distance of 10.5 km from the KRS dam observatory, which is the same as the radial distance from the observatory to Baby Betta where stone quarrying takes place. The KSNDMC report further stated that the signatures recorded at the KRS dam observatory were not earthquakes as they were not recorded in other observatories established nearby at Gundal dam, Thippagondanahalli, Harangi, and Hemavathi dam. No regulation In view of the importance of the dam in Cauvery basin and being the lifeline for millions by providing drinking water and irrigation, the KSDNMC had called for surveying the area within a radial distance of 20 km from the dam. It also sought for a plan to regulate activities which can harm the dam structure in the long run. But nothing has been done to crack down on quarrying and illegal mining. When an amateur photographer from Mysuru flew a drone to get an aerial perspective of the KRS dam last year, he was rounded up by the police and booked for violation of the law. But the same alacrity as displayed towards the act of taking a photograph of the dam has not been shown by the authorities in cracking down on quarrying and mining, which poses a greater threat to the dam, said an observer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/illegal-mining-in-mandya-a-saga-of-bans-and-non-implementation/article35260618.ece
11 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Planned trial blasts stalled because of COVID-19||Months before the war of words broke out between Sumalatha, Mandya MP, and the JD(S) leaders over the safety of KRS reservoir, which is considered to be the lifeline of thousands in Karnataka and neighbouring Tamil Nadu, the Irrigation Department had invited a team of experts from Dhanbad-based Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), to study the impact of quarrying on the dam. The team, which had already inspected the dam and the quarries during a site visit, were scheduled to carry out trial blasts at different locations in the vicinity of the dam. “But, last month, they wrote to us informing that they were unable to make the visit due to COVID-19. They will let us know the next date soon,” said an official of the Irrigation Department. To conduct the trial blasts, experts from the CSIR institute will select quarries based on their distance from the dam, which will be “nearby, at intermediate distance and far away”. While the blasts will be conducted at the quarry sites, instruments will be placed at the dam to study the vibrations. A report will be submitted based on it. Prior to engaging the CIMFR, the department had also invited teams from Central Water and Power Research Station (PWPRS), Pune, and National Institute of Rock Mechanics (NIRM). The PWPRS team had visited the dam after the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) sent a report to the State government on tremors felt near the dam due to quarrying in September 2018. Subsequently, trial blasts by the PWPRS team were planned during the regime of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, but were cancelled after farmers’ organisations had opposed the move on the grounds that the exercise was a threat to the dam. The proposed trial blasts by CIMFR, however, is expected to be monitored by the district administration of Mandya, including Deputy Commissioner and officials from Mining, Revenue and Police Departments, the Irrigation Department official said. Building material The quarries in Mandya supply building material like M-Sand and crushed stone for construction activities in Mysuru, Mandya. and Kodagu districts, besides the ongoing Bengluru-Mysuru highway work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/planned-trial-blasts-stalled-because-of-covid-19/article35260620.ece

11 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Pandemic ‘delays’ UoM museum project||The University of Mysore’s ambitious project of establishing a museum in commemoration of its centenary has once again been delayed because of the continuing pandemic situation. This comes even as a few design agencies and architects have come up with concepts to narrate the glorious history of one of the country’s oldest universities. The museum was conceptualised to showcase various aspects of the culture, heritage and history of the university, which celebrated its centenary five years ago. The museum was one of the centenary projects and the university was finalising the museum concept. Actually, the University wanted to give a start to the project in July last year after the lockdown curbs were eased. However, the project could not make any major headway last year though the University wanted not to delay the already-delayed project anymore. The building for housing the museum has been constructed at a cost of Rs. 3.75 crore with a total built-up area of 14,738 sq.ft, near B. N. Bahadur Institute of Management Studies on the campus. The university also had plans to expand the building to make it even more spacious. “One agency cited a whopping budget of Rs. 16 crore to execute the work while a couple of others quoted Rs. 8 crore and Rs. 10 crore respectively. We have thought of consulting a few others who could do it for our budget and finalise the best concept,” said Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar. He told The Hindu that the museum will become a reality soon as the university is firm on completing the last remaining centenary projects. “We could have finalised the concept but the pandemic delayed it as we could not consult others for ideas. The project will happen since the building is ready. Expression of interest will be called again. More experts in the field will be engaged soon to give visitors a unique experience,” he said. Founded by Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar in 1916, UoM is the sixth oldest university in the country and the oldest in the State. The university took off from Maharaja’s College and the courses were moved to the Manasagangotri campus in 1960. The university had proposed to make it a one-stop facility for getting key information for researchers, professionals and students with sections such as ‘origin, history and the royal patronage’, ‘glorious growth of 100 years’, ‘eyes on the stars’, and ‘mending milestones’. According to the museum’s concept note, the project was proposed as India’s first thematic and interactive museum of a centenary-old university, enabling effective content delivery and user interaction by employing modern techniques such as touchscreen terminals to illustrate the exhibits and multi-media systems to render documentary videos. The museum model should be a blend of traditional and modern methods of exhibiting items chronicling the origin and growth of the university, besides the exemplary contributions and academic achievements in 100 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-delays-uom-museum-project/article35261041.ece
11 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Questions raised over injured tiger’s death||The death of a five-year-old tiger while being shifted from Bandipur to Bannerghatta on Friday has come under scrutiny from wildlife activists, who have expressed concern over the entire operation. A male tiger was found injured in Hediyala range of Bandipur and the Forest Department tranquillized it for closer examination and decided to shift it to Bannerghatta in Bengaluru for treatment. But the tiger died en route, near Mysuru. The Forest Department said the tiger was injured in a territorial fight after moving in from Antharsanthe range of Nagarahole and was emaciated. But Joseph Hoover of United Conservation Movement has questioned as to why two darts were fired at an injured and emaciated tiger. He said the authorities justified their decision on the grounds that the tiger was weak and emaciated and hence the strength of the first dosage was reduced. As the tiger could not be tranquillized with the first dosage, another dart was shot, according to Mr. Hoover. Mr. Hoover, who is also a member of the State Wildlife Board, said it was obvious that the wildlife veterinarian miscalculated the weight and condition of the tiger and suspected that the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s SOP was not followed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/questions-raised-over-injured-tigers-death/article35261028.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Activists divided over memorial||The protests against the proposed closure of Maharani’s NTM School to pave way for a memorial for Swami Vivekananda continued on Saturday with activists showing no signs of relenting. The genesis of the issue is traced to a proposal mooted in 2010 to construct a memorial for Swami Vivekananda who had stayed at Niranjana Mutt during his visit to Mysore in November, 1892. But there is also a Kannada medium school which has a history of over 130 years and the activists want it to be saved and the school developed. The issue has divided the people of Mysuru with a cross-section of them in support of the memorial while there is also strong opposition to it. Though a court order went in favour of Sri Ramakrishna Mission which is set to implement the memorial project, the activists want the government to pass an ordinance to bypass the court ruling and save the school which was among the earliest schools for girls. On Saturday, Kannada activist and progressive leader Pa. Mallesh led a protest and said that the agitation to save the school will continue. He said they were not opposed to the memorial which, he said, could be constructed elsewhere but the school too has a history and has to be conserved and developed. ‘Double standards’ The issue has even left the political class divided and though Chamarajanagar MP V. Srinivas Prasad has supported the memorial, his stance has been criticised by activists. They said the recent statements of Mr. Prasad in support of the school exposed his double standards. When he was in the Siddaramaiah Cabinet he was opposed to the memorial but now he is in the BJP and is supportive of it, said Mr. Mallesh. The memorial entails construction of a meditation centre, an auditorium, a yoga training centre, coaching classes for competitive examinations, vocational training centre and a library. The proponents of the project aver it will be a major cultural centre for youth and that the opposition to it was misplaced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/activists-divided-over-memorial/article35261039.ece

A meeting attended by P.P. Chitharanjan, MLA, District Collector A. Alexander, among other officials, here recently discussed issues related to the project. Mr. Chitharanjan said a decision had been taken to complete all processes related to land acquisition by August 15. Traders whose shops would be demolished for the project would be relocated. “Steps will be taken to hasten various processes related to reconstruction of the bridge. All shop owners to be displaced for the project will be rehabilitated. A rehabilitation package will be implemented,” the MLA said. Officials said 103 shops would have to be pulled down. The plan was to begin the reconstruction works on November 1. Although the government issued a preliminary notification setting in motion the land acquisition process last year, further proceedings were delayed due to the pandemic. According to the notification, 0.4556 ha in Mullakkal village under Ambalappuzha taluk will be acquired for the project. Estimate of Rs. 98.90 cr. The project will be implemented by the Kerala Road Fund Board at an estimate of Rs. 98.90 crore. It will be funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. The existing bridge across the Vada canal has six roads merge at two approaches to it. As a result, heavy traffic congestion affects the smooth flow of traffic on the Alappuzha-Madurai State Highway. The proposal is to build a new elevated bridge, a set of underpasses, ramp roads, and flyovers on either side of the canal, which is expected to help ease traffic congestion in Alappuzha town. As per a detailed project report prepared by the Public Work Department’s bridges design unit, the flyover is designed as a roundabout with no signals. A Social Impact Assessment (SIA) report submitted by Rajagiri Outreach, a wing of the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, noted the implementation of the project would have huge positive impact on the locality as well as the overall development of the town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bridge-reconstruction-land-acquisition-by-aug-15/article35260994.ece

The Kareelakulangara police on Saturday arrested Rajesh, 36, father of the child, in connection with the incident. The alleged incident happened on Friday night. Following the attack, the child was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Alappuzha. “She has been admitted to the hospital with a skull fracture and internal bleeding. She is fully conscious. Her condition is being closely monitored by the medical staff,” said R.V. Ramlal, medical superintendent, MCH, Alappuzha. Inebriated condition According to the police, the accused reached home in an inebriated state and started to beat his wife. When the child intervened to diffuse the situation, he attacked the girl too. After the incident, she started vomiting and was taken to the Taluk Hospital, Kayamkulam, by her mother and neighbours. The child was later shifted to the MCH for better treatment. She is the youngest of the couple's three children. Officials said that Rajesh engaged in drunken brawl with his wife and children on a regular basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/7-year-old-girl-injured-after-being-attacked-by-her-father/article35260926.ece
11 July 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||Edible Schools to connect children to food crops, fields||The M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) in Kalpetta in association with Botanical Garden Conservation International (BGCI) has launched an innovative project titled Edible Schools to connect children to food crops and family farming. “Edible Schools is a concept where children are engaged in food production under the guidance of trained, interested and caring leaders, who lead them into discovery and exploration of soil, water, biodiversity, and the science of agriculture production and consumption,” said N. Anilkumar, Senior Director, MSSRF. “We launched the pilot project in two schools in Wayanad, including Hill Blooms School, Mananthavady, and Government High School, Thrikaipetta, around seven months ago, and it was a huge success,” he said, adding that the project would be replicated in other schools. The programme was initiated by developing a nutrition garden and fruit garden at both the schools in line with the COVID-19 protocol. Gardens on 2 cents Nutrition gardens were designed on approximately 2 cents (870 sq.ft), and fruit trees were planted as part of campus greening. Nutrition gardens have mostly leafy greens such as Amaranthus, Palak spinach, Curry leaf, and Moringa as well as commonly consumed vegetables like bhindi, brinjal, beans, and cow peas, said Merlin Lopaz, a scientist at MSSRF. The schools have also planted fruit tree species, medicinal plants, wild food plants, and larval host plants of butterflies. Owing to the pandemic, students’ visits to schools were limited, but the issue was addressed, with each student extending the nutrition garden to their homesteads. Two WhatsApp groups have also been formed to clear doubts of ‘student farmers’. Students were also trained in collection and multiplication of seeds of native wild trees. As a result, they maintain a herbarium collection and small nursery at home of trees such as Pterocarpus marsupium (Venga), Syzigium cumini (Njaval), Ficus racemose (Athi), and Pongamia pinnata (Ungu). The seedlings will be handed over to MSSRF, and thus the students will be part of the reforestation programme of the foundation, Dr. Anilkumar said. Through this activity, children can learn about the importance of native trees in the restoration of degraded farm fields, he said. Ecosystem restoration and reduction of threats to biodiversity without undermining the needs and aspirations of the local community are the two high-priority interventions of MSSRF, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/edible-schools-connect-children-to-food-crops/article35260921.ece
11 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Mobility hub’s Phase 2 work in doldrums||Even as uncertainty looms large over the Rs. 572-crore second phase development work of Vyttila Mobility Hub (VMH), primarily due to the inordinate delay in reconstituting the VMH Society as a company, stakeholders are peeved at the little effort being made to ensure its seamless connectivity with Vyttila Junction during the second phase development works of the junction. The State government has not registered the Society as a government-owned company or as a special purpose vehicle (SPV), although the first phase was commissioned in 2010, soon after which the assurance of kick-starting second phase work was made. Constituting the VMH Society as a company is crucial to overcome numerous issues, including the availing of loan and attracting investors for the second phase work slated to be executed on a public-private partnership (PPP)  basis. A senior official of the agency had said in February that a plan of action to set in motion the second phase work would be readied in March, for which the formalities for registration of the company were in final stages, said official sources. French loan With company formation caught in red tape, there is concern over the fate of a soft loan that was expected from a French lending agency. “Even more worrisome is the fact that no effort is being made to integrate VMH with the proposed redesign of Vyttila Junction, to put an end to traffic hold-ups. Buses and other vehicles still have to use the narrow approach road (Kaniampuzha Road) that leads to the hub. The bell-mouth at the turning from the junction is too narrow and confusion prevails there,” said Sunitha Dixon, chairperson of Kochi Corporation’s works standing committee and the councillor representing Vyttila Division. Despite odds, the least that the VMH Society must do is to ensure proper footpaths and street lighting on Kaniampuzha Road. It is very unsafe for passengers, especially women, to use the footpath and road in its present condition, said Ms. Dixon. The VMH Society must ensure a wider road and wide footpaths. The overgrowth of weeds and shrubs had considerably lessened usable space in the temporary parking area near the hub’s entrance, she added. The fate of a skywalk that had been mooted a decade ago to ensure safety of pedestrians crossing Vyttila Junction and proceeding towards the hub was sealed by what is increasingly being termed as an unscientific flyover that was built at the junction. The chairman of Vyttila United Forum V.R. Thampy said little thought went into constructing the flyover. “We had submitted a detailed memorandum to the Chief Minister in 2017, with a list of suggestions. It ought to have been integrated with the 25-acre VMH, which is set to witness exponential growth in the years to come,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mobility-hubs-phase-2-work-in-doldrums/article35260943.ece

Land acquisition and other aspects of the flyover will follow suit, once people’s representatives are apprised of the various components of the project, which is aimed at decongesting the Edappally-Aroor NH 66 Bypass and the Edappally-Angamaly NH 66 corridor. The corridor will have a design speed of 100 km per hour, like the Ahmedabad-Baroda Express Highway, they added. A total of 8 km on the proposed NH Bypass will be elevated, including flyovers at busy corridors. Considering the relatively higher price of land in Kerala, the State government is expected to pool in with 25% of the cost (being the viability gap funding) to acquire approximately 219 hectares for the project to ready a 45-metre-wide NH to bypass Kochi city. Tenders for the project will be finalised in March 2022, while the construction period will be between 24 to 30 months after land is acquired. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had readied a 3(a) notification to begin preparatory work for the project. The greenfield NH Bypass is slated to begin south of Kundannoor Junction and end at Karayamparambu near Angamaly. It will be executed simultaneously with a project to widen the Karayamparambu-Thrissur NH stretch into a six-lane one. Being an access-controlled NH, vehicles will not be permitted direct access. Motorists will have to rely on underpasses to turn towards side roads. The compensation package under the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 will include fair value of land that will be acquired, 100% solatium and value based on ‘multiplication factor’. The factor will be higher in rural areas than in urban parts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dpr-for-kundannoor-angamaly-bypass-to-be-ready-in-five-months/article35260939.ece
11 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Category D local bodies facing many challenges||The local bodies figuring in Category D based on the average weekly test positivity rate (TPR) of above 15% are facing multiple challenges in their efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. Some panchayats had pointed out a reluctance on the part of people to undergo testing. Chellanam, which figured top in Category D with a TPR of 26.33%, is facing such a scenario, according to the panchayat authorities. “Many were hesitant to undergo testing fearing that their livelihood would be hit badly. Being a coastal region, several families depend on daily wages and the worsening financial crisis seems to be making them think twice before undergoing the test,” said K.D. Prasad, panchayat president. “We have ramped up the tests in all wards. Nearly 26 of the 41 persons who took the test in Wards 15 and 16 tested positive on Friday. They claimed lack of any symptoms as a reason for not turning up at the testing centres,” he said. Kadungallor panchayat president Suresh Muttathil said that only those who had symptoms associated with the infection were turning up for testing. “We have now stepped up ward-level sensitisation on the need to come forward and undergo the tests to check the spread of the disease. Any drop in vigil will result in reduced number of persons turning up for testing,” he said. Kadunagallor had recorded an average weekly TPR of 18.04%. A.K. Nishad, chairman of the health standing committee in Kalamassery municipality, said the industrial regions in the civic body were showing an increase in the number of positive cases compared to the residential areas. “We have now increased testing focusing on migrant workers in South Kalamassery industrial region and the HMT region,” he said. The municipality had to initiate stringent measures after it recorded an average weekly TPR of 16.88%. Mr. Prasad said directives had been given to ensure that workers in various sectors, including those under the employment guarantee scheme, underwent testing before proceeding with their daily work. “Otherwise, the situation will turn worse,” he said. Mr. Muttathil said the number of testing camps had been increased in Kadungallor panchayat. “We had tested 140 to 200 persons over the last two days,” he said. Vaccination drive Mr. Nishad said the vaccination drive at the primary health centre under the municipality had slowed down after the council had set up a centre opposite the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, after the second wave began. The primary health centre was also facing staff shortage. “With cases going up, we have now resumed the vaccination drive at the primary health centre,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/category-d-local-bodies-facing-many-challenges/article35260945.ece
11 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rent-a-bike sector hopes to ride high on solo-travel trend||The post-pandemic trend of travelling solo as free-independent travellers (FITs) or in small groups of people to locales tucked well away from urban areas is expected to give fillip to the rent-a-bike/bicycle business. The mode of travel will ensure physical distancing while providing an opportunity for FITs and tourists in small groups to relish each moment of their trip with a spirit of adventure. There has traditionally been demand for rent-a-bike/bicycle schemes, with daily rents in the range of Rs. 400 to Rs. 1,000 for anything from scooters to an array of ordinary or off-road motorbikes. Short supply That many popular bicycle models were in short supply due to demand from youth and others who got fed up of being confined to their homes during the pandemic is in itself a sign that people are biding their time to check out tourist locales in neighbouring districts. It was in sync with experiential tourism that got popular during the past decade, said a senior tourism official. Firms from across Kerala that offered pre-defined or tailor-made travel packages for FITs and small groups of tourists are pinning their hopes on domestic tourists travelling in the coming months, followed by foreign tourists. One of them has come up with chauffeur-driven bike tours, in which a tour guide will double up as a chauffeur for solo tourists to check out little-explored locales. “This service is common in places like Goa and Manali and encourages visitors who are not keen on travel by car or bus. They are also very cost effective,” said Jorphey Gabriel of Kochi-based Glenn Tours. “In Kerala, there is difficulty in getting permit for such tours from Kerala Motor Vehicles Department, even as conventional rent-a-bike firms abound. We hope to arrange a 60-day pan-India motorbike tour, once tourists begin coming to Kerala,” he said. There are firms like Kerala Bike Tours that operate guided two-wheeler tours. “Most of our customers were foreign tourists. Our business model is based on organising guided tours that last a week or two weeks. We will arrange a guide to help the guests in groups of less than 10 two-wheelers discover destinations. A four-wheeler back-up vehicle that will accompany them will have a mechanic and a driver. Discerning guests, in their eagerness to leave minimum carbon footprint, used to come seeking electric two-wheelers during the past few years,” said Daniel Benster of the firm, which rented out 15 vehicles, mostly from the Enfield stable. Of late, the demand is for single-day tours, including for off-roading. Tourists, especially foreign nationals, consider motorbiking in India an exciting proposition. However, obtaining licence from the MVD was often tricky and the firm’s licence application was pending, added Mr. Benster. Deputy Transport Commissioner Shaji Madhavan said rent-a-bike firms must apply for licence from the Transport Commissioner’s office, following which an inspection would be done to ensure that there were minimum number of vehicles, fitted with GPS, and that the firm had computer and internet connection. Based on that, the State Transport Authority would recommend the issuance of licence. The possibility of licence being given to chauffeur-driven bikes had to be studied, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rent-a-bike-sector-hopes-to-ride-high-on-solo-traveller-trend/article35260928.ece

Chinchurani has said that steps will be taken to protect and propagate local cattle breeds. She said the department targeted producing 1,000 heads of local breeds within two years. She was speaking at a function organised near Perumbavoor, where two bulls of the Periyar Dwarf or Kuttampuzha Dwarf variety were adopted by the Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) on Friday. The programme to protect the local variety of cattle is being undertaken with the support of Kuttampuzha Kullan Pasu Prajanana Paripalana Sangham, a voluntary body dedicated to the protection and propagation of the variety of cattle. The Minister said efforts would be made to ensure the protection of the cattle variety and fodder production would be supported through wage payment for the workers. The function to adopt the two bulls was organised at the Mar Augen High School in Kodanad. Eldhose Kunnappilly, MLA, presided over the programme. The Periyar Dwarf variety is found along River Periyar in places such as Kuttampuzha, Kodanad, Malayattoor, Kalady, Panamkuzhi, Paneli, Vadattupara and Charupara. The bulls are adopted for semen collection for both genomic studies and propagation through artificial insemination centres. KLDB authorities said the bulls were being adopted after studying their characteristics and ascertaining they did not carry any diseases. The pair of bulls will be quarantined for a month at KLDB’s Puthur facility in Thrissur district before they are tested again for diseases. They will then be sent to the Kulathupuzha facility in Kollam district for semen collection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-cattle-breeds-to-be-protected-chinchurani/article35260929.ece
11 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A song born remotely over different time zones||When the State was under triple lockdown earlier this year, a song was being born; remotely and across two different time zones. Now as the State is being unlocked, the song from the film Njan Mikhael , shot fully in Australia, will be released by actor Aparna Murali and singer Haricharan, who sang the song, over their Facebook pages on Sunday, which, incidentally, is observed as Cheer Up the Lonely Day. The film is the fourth directorial venture by the Australia-based young molecular biologist-cum-budding filmmaker Jose Sunny after two critically acclaimed zero-budget short films and a short feature. While the film was shot in 10 days, the composition of the just over five-minute-long score took over three weeks of creative back-and-forths over Skype and social media platforms. It took place at odd times as the director was located in Australia and the composer Mejo Joseph and lyricist Shobin Kannangattu were in India. In total sync “I wanted the song to be structured with a start, mid, and climax of its own while seamlessly falling in sync with the overall narrative. Notwithstanding the difference in time zones, I was available any time for creative discussions even at the cost of my sleeping hours,” said Mr. Sunny, who heads the science department of St. John’s College at Dubbo, a quaint city in the Orange Region of New South Wales, Australia. Mr. Joseph was given the edited visuals on which the song was to be composed, which he said, happened very rarely but was a huge blessing in capturing the exact emotions. “It was a challenging composition as the mood and tempo had to keep changing through the song,” he said. Remote working meant that Mr. Joseph never saw the singer who sang it from Chennai and the musicians who played the instruments. “It was a strange but enriching experience and felt like a new window for creativity was being opened,” said Mr. Joseph. Penning lyrics based on visuals was the first such experience for the five-film-old Mr.Kannakattu, who found the detailing by the director equally helpful. “I could have penned it to the metre of the composition at one go but deliberately wrote it over multiple days to ensure that every word chosen carried the exact emotional weight,” he said. Mr. Sunny recollected how he and the lyricist discussed for days over the choice of a word.  Njan Mikhael produced by Anish K. Sebastian will have a theatre release in Australia in August and then over the OTT platforms. Mr. Sunny’s short films Cage (2017) and Oorjam (2018) and the short feature Mullaperiyare Chathikkalle (2019) were critically acclaimed. All the three featured in multiple film festivals across the world while Mullaperiyare Chathikkalle was adjudged the best experimental film at the Calcutta International Cult Film Festival in 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-song-born-remotely-over-two-time-zones/article35260949.ece

The gaps that this season of remote learning may leave in the academics and personality of teenagers have prompted the State Education Department to roll out a mentoring programme for them, facilitating personal interactions between teachers and students. The programme, Oppamundu Adhyapakar (Teachers Are With You) is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government and aided schools in Ernakulam under the Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell (CGACC) of the General Education Department. “Under the programme, teachers in a school will be assigned as mentors to a specific number of students. While the counsellors and career guides associated with Souhrida Clubs functioning in higher secondary schools will lend the overall support, all teachers are being made participants in the programme,” said C.M. Azeem, State coordinator, CGACC. A meeting was held by the district deputy director of education and school principals to chalk out an implementation strategy. The programme will be reviewed and based on its impact will be rolled out across the State. The programme has its genesis in the quality improvement programme being implemented by the Education Department in the 20 most backward schools a year. The programme that included even house visits by the teachers was found highly effective. “We have asked the teachers to conduct multiple interactions with students in a month to identify and address their academic and non-academic issues. While academic issues will be addressed by linking them up with the teachers concerned, emotional issues will be either referred to school counsellors or to government referral facilities,” said Mr. Azeem. A training programme will be organised for teachers on tackling the problems they encounter based on the feedback from them.

The project, according to him, intends to ensure maximum hygiene during the menstrual period and also seeks to promote more economical and eco-friendly practices among women. In view of the pandemic, the authorities conducted online meetings to raise awareness among women about the advantages of using menstrual cups.

11 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||TPR-based restrictions in Kozhikode draw flak||The ongoing pandemic restrictions in Kozhikode city have not gone down well with a section of society, which has claimed that it will only lead to further spread of infection. Opposition parties have objected to placing the whole city under lockdown for six days a week. Right now, the Kozhikode Corporation has been included in the ‘C’ category, with an average test positivity rate (TPR) for COVID-19 between 10% and 15%. Lockdown is in force within the city limits, and shops and other business establishments, except those selling essential stuff, are allowed to open only on Fridays. Till recently, however, shops were allowed to function on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. As is the situation elsewhere in the State, there is complete lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays. This apparently led to a rush last Friday, when people thronged the city from everywhere. Heavy traffic was seen at major junctions such as Stadium Junction and Bank Junction, Mavoor Road, Mananchira, Nadakkavu, and Karapparamba. S.M. Street, a major trade centre in the city, too saw a large number of customers. Bumper-to-bumper traffic was the order of the day, as many people from other parts of the district came to the city for their needs. Traders’ bodies such as the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti and the Malabar Chamber of Commerce have sought steps to open all shops on all days in line with the pandemic protocol. Meanwhile, United Democratic Front members in the corporation council said it was unscientific to enforce curbs based only on TPR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tpr-based-restrictions-in-kozhikode-draw-flak/article35260914.ece
11 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Ayurveda likely to get a Drugs Controller soon||The State government is likely to consider the demand for an independent Drugs Controller for Ayurvedic drugs soon. This follows a directive of the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy to State governments to “appoint and notify State Director/Commissioner/or Secretary of the AYUSH Department as the Controlling Authority to whom inspectors and Licensing Authorities shall be subordinate” for taking permission to “execute regulatory/enforcement action in respect of Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani drugs”. This is in line with the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945. Petition to CM The Ayurvedic Medicine Manufacturers Organisation of India (AMMOI) had petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on November 30, 2020, citing this order, while pointing out that though the State had a separate AYUSH Department, it did not have an independent Drugs Controller for Ayurvedic drugs. Right now, the Deputy Drugs Controller (Ayurveda), who is also the State Licensing Authority, is attached to the State Drugs Controller for modern medicine. Staff shortage D. Ramanathan, AMMOI general secretary, said in his letter that the Deputy Drugs Controller had no authority over government employees. The Drugs Control Department also has severe staff shortage, due to which the 700-odd manufacturers in the State were unable to get their licence renewed on time. The petition was forwarded to the AYUSH Secretary and to the Deputy Drugs Controller (Ayurveda) for immediate action. The AYUSH Secretary was informed on February 25 that the demands in the petition were legitimate. In a detailed proposal to the government, the Deputy Drugs Controller (Ayurveda), said that the industry was mainly focussing on exporting drugs to different parts of the world and quality was important. Regular inspection It can be ensured only through regular inspection of manufacturing and sales sections, along with sampling and quality analysis of raw and finished drugs. “Regular surveillance, surprise inspections, and proper enforcement of legal proceedings are necessary to curtail the increasing practices of unprincipled and illicit manufacturing, trades, and advertisements. Proper availability of supporting staff pattern is also required to make the mission successful,” the proposal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ayurveda-may-get-drugs-controller-soon/article35260924.ece

Mahalingam, the new Director of the Calicut International Airport, to restore the operation of wide-bodied aircraft, which was suspended after the Air India Express crash in August last year. His predecessor K. Srinivasa Rao, who has been transferred to the Visakhapatnam International Airport as its Director, keenly took interest in recommencing the operation of big aircraft. A special team attached to the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had carried out an examination for the purpose. The August 7 mishap killed 21 people, including both pilots, and injured more than 100 passengers. However, it is learnt that the suspension of the operation of wide-bodied aircraft will continue at the airport till a five-member team of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), probing the Air India Express crash, submits its report. Haj embarkation The recommendations of the probe team are vital for the resumption of big aircraft operations although the aircraft that met with the accident was classified under Code C (medium or short range). This also means that the airport will be included in the list of Haj embarkation points in the country, sources said. Services Incidentally, in July last, Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) resumed operation of Haj flights. And that too after a gap of five years when the operation of wide-bodied aircraft was banned at the airport from May 2015 in the wake of the Court of Inquiry report on the Air India Express Boeing 737 crash in Mangaluru in May 2010. Mr. Mahalingam, who had a stint at the Calicut Airport at the middle-rung level earlier, but now at the helm, faces the challenge of salvaging the situation from the COVID-19 pandemic. Calicut airport, which is considered the seventh top international airport in the country, witnessed negative growth in aircraft and cargo movements. Aircraft movements stood at - 64.3 %, passenger volume at - 72.1%, and cargo movements at -67.5 %). The new director will have to bring back the dominance of the airport in international and domestic sectors to the pre- COVID-19 levels.  The suspension of wide-bodied aircraft operations will continue till the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau probing the Air India Express crash submits its report||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-calicut-airport-director-has-his-work-cut-out/article35260909.ece
11 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Govt. urged not to issue fresh quarry licences||The All Kerala River Protection Committee has appealed to the Chief Minister, Industries Minister, and the Director of the Department of Mining and Geology not to issue more quarry licences to improve revenue as mentioned in the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement of the government. In a detailed letter, committee State secretary T.V. Rajan pointed out that the State could earn more revenue by making minor changes to the existing rules.  Slamming the move to allow quarrying in leased land and ‘pattayam’ land, the committee said scientific analysis, instead of diluting the existing laws on mining, could earn the government more profit from the existing quarries. The Kerala Minor Minerals Concession Rules (KMMC) 2015 were formulated on the basis of a Supreme Court judgment of 2012. Environmental clearance was made mandatory for every quarry under the rules. However, certain clauses were added to the rules, which enabled quarry owners to bypass the apex court order on environment clearance. Mining mafia At present, a no-objection certificate (NOC) is enough to start a quarry in government land. If leased land and pattayam land are also made available, the entire State will be open for the mining mafia, the letter said. Besides, the premise that a quarry owner could keep up to 495 acres in his possession, is viewed as a precursor of allowing quarrying in plantation land as well. CRP system The committee has suggested a change in the consolidated royalty payment (CRP) system for the government to earn more from quarries. It said the CRP was meant to help quarry owners and not the State. Loopholes The committee suggested that the KMMC Rules, which have several loopholes, be cancelled, and new rules be formulated after proper assessment to save the State from a grievous environmental disaster. It is even contemplating to approach the court in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-urged-not-to-issue-fresh-quarry-licences/article35260910.ece

The national-level undergraduate test conducted by the Council of Architecture (COA) is for admission to five year B. Arch and B. Planning programmes. It is held in two rounds, and Sunday’s test is the second round. Kerala has 20 centres, except in Wayanad and Kasaragod, and thousands are writing the test. A student from Kozhikode told The Hindu on Saturday that the applicants from Malabar were unable to download the admit card from the NATA website till late in the evening. Earlier, Vinod Kumar K.K., an applicant, tweeted, “No link to download admit card for tomorrow’s NATA exam for Kerala students. Irresponsible approach by @CouncilofArchi1. Requesting for immediate action @EduMinOfIndia@dwould pradhanbjp@PMOIndia@Republic”. The exam is held in two shifts from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. The applicants should reach the centre an hour before the test starts. Since Kerala has a weekend lockdown on Saturday and Sunday and there is no public transport, the applicants are clueless as to what to do. Council representatives, however, have reportedly told the applicants that there had been some delay in setting up the centres owing to pandemic restrictions. Those who do not have the facility to download the admit card could do it at the exam centres. But students from Wayanad and Kasaragod are wondering how they will reach the centres if details are known late in the night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/applicants-allege-delay-in-issuing-admit-cards/article35260912.ece

They said search was on for the three who fled with the worker’s mobile phone and cash worth Rs. 5,000. Jharkhand native Najeebul Sheikh who sustained serious injuries in the incident is undergoing treatment at the government hospital at Thamarassery. The accused allegedly dragged him behind the bike when he tried to stop them from fleeing. According to the police, Sheikh was dragged for around 10 metres. The incident took place near a rented house of migrant labourers near Koduvally Madrasa Bazaar around 2 a.m. Police said the theft was carried out by a gang of local youths. It was the second such incident in Koduvally in the last 10 days. In the first incident on July 1, Ali Akbar, a worker from Bihar, was allegedly dragged by two persons behind their motorbike. He was also robbed of his mobile phone. Sanu Krishnan, 18, and Shamnas Abdurahiman, 23, the accused in the case, were arrested the following day. Meanwhile, the Labour Department has asked employers of migrant labourers to ensure their safety at camps.

11 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Retelling the sensational story of Naxal Varghese||“Immediately someone went over to Varghese and led him to a fissure in a rock, and made him sit there. Now he was visible only up to his chest. Lakshmana ordered, ‘Shoot!’ I held the barrel close to Varghese’s chest. Only the length of the rifle separated us – almost four feet. It was a .303 rifle I had with me. The day was February 18, 1970 and the time, 6.55 p.m. As demanded earlier by Varghese, I made a sound ‘Shoo . . .’ I didn’t check whether others heard me. I pressed the barrel against his chest. As soon as he shouted, ‘Long Live Mao Unity! Victory to Revolution!’ the firing was done. Varghese fell to his right. Thus the very hand that had fed him the last morsel of rice, killed him.” That was perhaps the first encounter killing in the State. The revelation of constable Ramachandran Nair that he had shot Varghese point blank on orders from his superiors at the height of the anti-Naxalite drive of early 1970s has been retold in reams and bytes. A recently released English translation - Naxal Varghese: Take-Off and Tail Spin - by Sebastian Joseph is literally taking a reader to the history of the Naxal movement in Kerala. A former journalist of Malayala Manorama , Mr. Joseph extended his reportage after retirement to explore the nuances of the revolutionary zeal in his home district of Wayanad. Of the trilogy, published in Malayalam, only the second one has been translated to English, he says. Contemporary element Maybe the episodes of Varghese or Sakhav Varghese and for some Kerala Che Guevara, who fought against the exploitation of Adivasis by feudal lords in Wayanad, have a contemporary element in the State polity. “This is more than a sequel to Spring Thunder and gives a realistic account of the Thirunelly-Thrissilery riots. Varghese led the riots when the leaders of Thalassery-Pulpally actions were in jails,” Mr. Joseph says. Translated by Radhika P. Menon, this research-oriented book, mostly based on interviews and documents, has been divided into 36 sections tracing the communist movement in Wayanad, milestones in the Adivasi struggles, capture and killing of Varghese. Objective manner Mr. Joseph says that the accounts of the participants, the witnesses and the victims of the riots have been recorded in an unbiased, objective manner, and several official documents, interpretations, witness statements marshalled to authenticate them. “Certainly, the sacrifice of the Naxalites has to be recognised. And nobody can do a better job than a journalist in telling their stories,” he says.  Translated by Radhika P. Menon, the book, based on interviews and documents, has been divided into 36 sections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/retelling-the-sensational-story-of-naxal-varghese/article35260965.ece

11 July 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||An Ayurveda sage revered the world over||P.K. Warrier, who passed away on Saturday weeks after celebrating his birth centenary, has been the most respected name in Ayurveda across the world. He popularised Ayurveda by adopting modern scientific methods without compromising the traditional values. At a time when the practitioners of modern medicine used to frown on all other medical genres, Dr. Warrier strutted like a king who was benevolent enough to rub shoulders with them. Modernity He mounted the higher echelons of Ayurveda by constantly accommodating modernity. The success story of Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, which he headed for 68 years, was that of Dr. Warrier’s. Kind and compassionate, Dr. Warrier gave his healing touch to all sections of people, from princes to paupers and from country heads to servants. Former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, former Mauritius President Kailash Purryag, and a Spanish prince were among those who enjoyed Dr. Warrier’s soothing touch. In India, his patients’ list will stretch up to Presidents and Prime Ministers. Dr. Warrier established Kottakkal Ayurveda as a brand and made it popular the world over by representing everything that is authentic and pristine in Ayurveda and strengthening it through research and experiments. He upgraded and expanded Ayurveda by applying modern practices in clinical, pharmaceutical, research and educational spheres. He started a revolution in Ayurvedic drug manufacturing by applying industrial technology. He replaced the traditional firewood by introducing boiler-generated steam for preparation of medicine. Dr. Warrier’s imprint is visible in Vaidya Sala’s factories at Kottakkal, Kanjikode and Nanjangud. Innovative zeal Dr. Warrier was instrumental in modernising the medical formulations as well. Thanks to his innovative zest, bitter liquid kashayas are now available in tablet form, greasy oils in gel form, viscous lehyas in granule form, and hyper-fine bhasmas in capsule form. “We could endear Ayurveda to the new generation through these innovations,” Dr. Warrier was once quoted. Standing in the forefront for setting up of the Centre for Medicinal Plants and Research (CMPR) at Kottakkal, he initiated collaborative projects with major agencies of scientific learning. It was the then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who inaugurated the CMPR in 2003. The five-volume treatise Indian Medicinal Plants: A Compendium of 500 Species co-authored by Dr. Warrier remains testimony to his dedication for research and documentation. Always smiling and endearing, Dr. Warrier successfully mixed love and medicine in his treatment. Dr. Warrier insisted on simplicity for his patients as well. He built a network of friendship that cut across geographic, communal, caste and other boundaries. He was revered as the doyen of Ayurveda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-ayurveda-sage-revered-the-world-over/article35260968.ece

11 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||No title deed means no benefits||Prema Gilbert’s house in Cheriyathura was left battered in the strong waves that pounded the capital’s coastline some months back. The small plot near the sea had been her family’s abode for the past three decades. With the house left almost uninhabitable by the waves, she applied for financial aid from the government for carrying out maintenance work. But, for many like her who live along the coast and do not have title deeds or ownership certificates for their land, getting any such government aid is a tall order. “I used to stay in that house with my daughter and her child. While my husband passed away 12 years back, her husband left her nine years back. We had applied at the village office for government aid for carrying out maintenance work, but we have been told that without a title deed it is hard to get.  Now, we are living in a rented house. Due to the lockdown, my daughter lost her job and I have also not been able to go for my job as a domestic worker,” says Ms.Gilbert. No documents According to Shajitha Nazar, councillor of the Vallakkadavu ward, located near the capital’s coastline, she has come across hundreds of such cases of fishworker families who have been living in the coast for decades, unable to get any benefit because they do not have the documents to prove ownership of the land. “There are many in the coastal wards who have been waiting for so long for such benefits. Some of them are paying land taxes even though they do not have ownership certificates. Though suggestions have been made to use the land tax receipt as a document as a proof of ownership to provide them the benefits, especially in the maintenance projects, it has not worked till now,” says Ms. Nazar. Tony Oliver, president of the Trivandrum Kambavala Matsyathozhilali Federation, says that many of the houses in small plots of land along the coast have been built without any permits as many of these families have been living there for long. “Even the owners of the 60 houses in the Tsunami colony near Valiyathura have been unable to get financial aid for maintenance. Since the past many years, representations have been given to various authorities, but to no avail, as they do not have ownership documents,” says Mr.Oliver. Until recently, a large number of applicants for building permits from these regions, including those for Pradhan Manthri Awaz Yojana (PMAY) have been finding it hard to construct houses or to get TC numbers due to the requirement of a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Airport Authority of India(AAI), considering the area's proximity to the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. Resolved The issue was finally solved after interventions by the Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation and elected representatives. Quite a few others have been waiting to get rehabilitated under the State government’s housing schemes for the fishing community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-title-deed-means-no-benefits/article35261109.ece
11 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Measures for Zika containment||The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has framed guidelines for the monitoring and containment of Zika virus disease in the district. Greater focus was being ensured towards vector management in the wake of 15 people being diagnosed with the disease. An order issued by District Collector and DDMA chairperson Navjot Khosa delineates the responsibilities of the Health Department as well as local self-government institutions in tackling the outbreak. Surveillance The District Vector Control unit of the Health Services Department has been tasked with vector surveillance in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation area and with providing technical advisories to local self-government institutions for mosquito control activities. The district surveillance officer and district programme manager of the National Health Mission have been directed to adopt steps to impart Zika containment awareness to urban medical officers and ASHA workers. Awareness will also be provided on the need to adopt personal protective measures against mosquito bites in antenatal clinics. The district health authorities have been ordered to strengthen fever clinics in all peripheral institutions. They have also been ordered to ensure the deferral of blood donation by donors with history of fever two weeks ago. Ultrasound scanning centres have also been directed to report incidences of Microcephally during regular antenatal scans to the District Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) officer. Local bodies have been entrusted with carrying out mosquito control activities in public places and uninhabited areas. Municipal health services will undertake fogging and spraying on the basis of technical directions from senior biologist of District Vector Control unit. The ward health sanitation committees have been directed to undertake source reduction of mosquitoes in their areas. These panels will have to organise dry day observances in public offices and residences on Saturdays and Sundays respectively. Fever surveillance will also be conducted in their respective jurisdiction to monitor any clustering of fever cases. Ward health sanitation members will inspect residential areas, public and private offices for mosquito breeding. Junior health inspectors have been asked to report the non-compliance of measures being implemented to eradicate mosquito breeding sources to local health authorities such as medical officers in local bodies and corporation health officers in Corporation areas. Antenatals The DDMA order also observed that while the disease caused by Zika virus was not severe in general population, it could become a cause for concern when it infected antenatals in early trimester of pregnancy. Besides those who had been diagnosed with the disease have been cured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/measures-for-zika-containment/article35261114.ece
11 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Why State couldn’t lower case graph||Kerala’s epidemic curve, after scaling the peak in mid-May when the test positivity rate (TPR) was around 30% and clocking approximately 44,000 cases daily, has for the past four weeks settled at a level wherein an average of 12,000 new cases are reported daily and the TPR is steady at 10-11%. Why does Kerala continue to report a huge number of cases daily when the case graph plunges in other States? “The epidemic curve in Kerala shows a gradual rise, spreading out after the peak and a gradual decline. This indicates controlled transmission and sustained containment measures,” says T.S. Anish, a member of the State’s expert committee on COVID-19. “Wherever the epidemic curve has risen and fallen sharply, the duration of the epidemic might be less, but it would have resulted in significant mortality. Such places are also at risk of a new wave. In fact, Kerala’s strategies are an investment to prevent a third wave,” he says. Not very different Kerala’s epidemic curve is not behaving any differently now than it did after the first wave peaked in October end. The curve continued to remain on a plateau till February when large-scale gatherings and the arrival of Delta variant led to the second wave. “There are many reasons behind the epidemic curve not returning to the baseline such as infectiousness of the virus to people’s behaviour during the pandemic. Kerala was already having 2,500 plus cases daily when the second wave began rising,” points out Rakhal Gaitonde, Professor, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. “The level of efficiency that was being maintained in controlling transmission through COVID protocols was not enough when the Delta variant arrived,” he adds Dr. Gaitonde points out that unlike in other States where testing dipped after the second wave peaked, Kerala has consistently been doing the same amount of tests. Homogenous population Public health experts also argue that Kerala is one homogenous population, with no urban-rural divide. Large-scale mixing of population is sustaining disease transmission here. “In other States, case reporting fidelity is affected as soon as the disease moves from urban to rural areas. This gives the impression that in these States, the pandemic has subsided,” Dr. Anish points out. Also, according to Indian Council of Medical Research’s serosurveillance study in January, 89% of the population in the State is still naive. Delta is one of the most evolved virus variants and as long as there is a susceptible population, transmission is likely to be sustained. In a nutshell, Kerala is paying the price for its better containment efforts. The behaviour of the pandemic curveis thus a composite of the urban-rural continuum, social behaviour, the highly transmissible virus variant itself, the efficiency of non-pharmacological interventions in controlling transmission, and finally, the pace of vaccination drive.

11 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||‘Tie-up’ for weather forecast has many backers||A call made by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science for better synergy between the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and private weather agencies is likely to find strong supporters in Kerala. The reason is that the Kerala government had made a similar recommendation in 2018 in a letter to the Centre criticising the “inadequate observation network” of the IMD in the State. The letter written by P.H. Kurian, the then Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue and Disaster Management), to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, had noted that private weather companies operated several weather observatories in the State while the IMD network was inadequate. It suggested a public-private partnership (PPP) where the IMD uses data from private weather networks, provided their stations meet the national weather agency’s standards. The letter, written against the backdrop of the devastating August 2018 floods in the State, described such a partnership as a prudent path. “The IMD should, as per their Results Framework Document (RFD), scrutinise all weather stations set up by private weather observers and decide on which of these stations are meeting IMD standards and whether data from these are useful for assimilation into the climatological archives of the State. If they are, these data may also be used by the IMD for increasing the weather observation network, for a cost agreement between the IMD and these private weather agencies. A public-private partnership in this regard is a prudent path to achieve the desired data and benchmarks in modelling,” the October 6, 2018 letter noted. Apparently, there was little action on it and in 2020, the Kerala Government authorised its State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) to source inputs from Skymet Weather Services, the IBM Weather Company and Earth Networks. According to the 2018 letter, the IMD had very few automated rain gauges and gathered daily rain data from “just about 68 stations” in Kerala. Temperature observations were being collected only from seven observatories. The IMD being the nodal department should have at least 256 rain gauge stations in Kerala (1/150 sq km), it said. While making its call for better synergy, the Standing Committee on Science has nonetheless underlined the importance of having one authoritative source for weather forecasts. In recent months, the IMD has, in response to the State government’s persistent demand, increased the number of automatic weather stations and introduced measures to improve localised weather prediction.  In a letter to the Centre, it was noted that private firms ran several weather observatories in the State while the IMD network was inadequate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-tie-up-for-weather-forecast/article35260988.ece

Revenue Inspector Sujith Kumar, who was attached to the Thiruvanathapuram City Corporation at that time, is currently working as Superintendent at the Ramanattukara municipality. Minister for Local Self Governments M.V.Govindan said in a press release that instructions have been issued to the Urban Affairs Director to suspend the officer. He had allegedly demanded bribe from one Jenensen, who had in 2019 submitted an application to change the building classification from residential to commercial, to open a small bakery manufacturing unit. In a video, which he released to television channels on Saturday, the official can be seen demanding bribe for himself and some clerks in the zonal office. Though he later managed to open the unit through the Industries department's single window clearance system, some other officials from the Corporation again came up with objections, according to him. With the COVID-19 outbreak too happening around the same time, the unit has remained closed since last year. Mr.Jenensen is currently working in a supermarket even as equipment, in which he had invested lakhs in, remain unused in the rented space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/official-suspended-for-demanding-bribe/article35261110.ece

11 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Relook at scrapping of KEAM marks weightage?||The State government is re-evaluating its inclination towards scrapping the 50% weightage given to Class 12 marks in the KEAM (engineering and pharmacy) entrance examinations for admissions to engineering and pharmacy courses. In-principle approval has been granted for the move on the basis of a proposal submitted by the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations (CEE). However, the government now fears the arrangement could work against meritorious students for various reasons. The mark assessment process finalised for Class 12 CBSE and ICSE students is also believed to have prompted the rethink. A presumption that the results could be declared through a process of lenient evaluation has led the government to seriously consider dropping the Class 12 weightage this year. Higher Education Minister R. Bindu, who has been receiving numerous calls from anxious students lately, said reverting to the earlier system of considering marks obtained in the entrance examination alone could trigger complaints. “While there are students who supported and opposed the proposal, many high-performing students who have been unable to enrol for entrance coaching programmes feared their higher education prospects could be hit. Such social aspects will have to be factored in while taking a call on the issue,” Dr. Bindu pointed out. She said a fair decision would be taken after assessing the Class 12 results in a manner that ensured none were adversely affected. CBSE officials are learnt to have assured the Higher Education Department that the results will be declared this month. August The office of the CEE has been contemplating the possibility of conducting the entrance examination in the first week of August. The examination, which had been scheduled to be held on July 24, was postponed to avoid a clash of dates with the JEE-Main examinations. Discussions are under way to finalise a feasible date when the proposed centre in Mumbai, New Delhi and Dubai are available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/relook-at-keam-marks-weightage/article35260963.ece

Acting on a petition from a woman in Thrissur district, the commission of members Fr. Philip Parakatt and K. Nazeer on Thursday directed the Director of General Education, CBSE Regional Officer, and the Chief Executive and Secretary of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations to issue circulars to schools asking them to follow the panel’s direction. Shortfall of Rs. 1,500 The petitioner said her child had taken admission to LKG in a Thrissur school in 2019-20. When she entered Class I this year, on the first day of the school year, she was not allowed to attend the online class by the school. The school cited a shortfall of Rs. 1,500 in the fee paid earlier. The petitioner said that in the wake of COVID-19 her husband had lost his job and also suffered an accident, leading to delay in fee payment. She approached the commission again seeking steps for a transfer certificate for her daughter and the Rs. 25,000 paid at the time of school admission. Question of Rs. 25,000 During an online hearing, the school Principal said the transfer certificate could be issued immediately, but on the return of Rs. 25,000, he could not say anything without the directions of the school management. The Principal also said the Rs. 25,000 had been collected under the head of establishment charge and no capitation fee had been charged. Since the school had classes till grade 12, if the child continued to study there, no other establishment charge would have to be paid. ‘Only in UKG’ The commission said that it was clear that Rs. 25,000 was a stipulated sum for continuing education till Class 12. As per Section 13 of the RTE Act, no capitation fee should be collected at the time of admission. Since the child had only completed UKG, the Principal had no right to collect anything except the amount proportionate to the grades completed, and the rest should be returned to the petitioner.

It will see participation from paediatric experts from leading institutes like the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), New Delhi; Ayurveda Medical College, Kannur; and National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur, sharing their clinical experience with case studies from the current and previous COVID cycles. As per the latest studies, the third wave of COVID may affect the age group up to eighteen.

Neelakandhan Mooss, Director, Vaidyaratnam Group. “We expect to develop a treatment protocol in COVID-19 management of paediatric cases with advice from the expert panel. The aim is to have a scientific approach towards COVID-19 and post-COVID management in adults,” he said.

11 July 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rising production cost takes a toll on groundnut crop||Over the past decade rising cost of groundnut crop production has been driving away farmers to other remunerative crops like horticulture, as a result of which the total area where the groundnut is sown has come down in Anantapur district, the largest producer of groundnut in the State. If the total crop area in the district was 7.33 lakh hectares in 2011 with the cost of cultivation being Rs. 1,284.15 crore, it came down to 3.71 lakh hectares in 2019 when the cost of cultivation was Rs. 1,874 crore. The cost of cultivation further rose to Rs. 2,913 crore last year, when the crop area was 4.8 lakh hectares, and the agriculture department estimated the total production at 2.18 lakh metric tonnes, according to Joint Director Agriculture Y. Ramakrishna. Yerragunta Ramireddy and Pullalarevu Chenna Reddy of Raminepalli in Rapthadu Mandal are two such farmers who gave up cultivating groundnut crop as now they have to buy seeds, engage labour at an average wage of Rs. 500 a day. On top of that, the ever-increasing need for using fertilizers and pesticides made the profits vanish. “Earlier, we used to store our own seeds and sow them next year and were sure of the quality, but now we have to depend on private sellers or the ones offered by the government at subsidised rates. Apart from this, labour charges have increased considerably,” said Mr. Ramireddy, who owns with 30 acres of land. Mr. Ramireddy, who used to live in a joint family, did not have to hire many labourers earlier as his family members were all engaged in the work. “But now, most of the children go to school or colleges and settle for jobs with none to take care of the agriculture. This has led to dependence on labourers and tractors, shunning the bullocks,” Mr. Chenna Reddy pointed out. The current cost of cultivation was over Rs. 25,000 per acre and the increasing rates of diesel and petrol have pushed up the cost of hiring tractors also. Both the farmers are now growing pomegranate. Average net income As per a study, the average net income per acre by farmers was the highest in Rajasthan Rs. 10,442, followed by Chhattisgarh at Rs. 9,925, Gujarat at Rs. 7,963 and Jharkhand at 5,663.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rising-production-cost-takes-a-toll-on-groundnut-crop/article35261063.ece
11 July 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Strike brings rural water supply to a halt||The entire Rural Water Supply network came to a standstill in Anantapur district with the workers in the two major schemes – Sri Sathya Sai and Sri Rama Reddy drinking water schemes – serving close to 2,000 villages went on a strike from Saturday, with talks failing on Friday. While the Sri Sathya Sai scheme is operated and maintained by the L&T company, the Sri Rama Reddy scheme is maintained by the Rural Water Supply (RWS) Department. The 572 workers in the SSS scheme had been working in 1,100 villages in 44 mandals of the district and they were being paid by the L&T, which had been managing it for the past 25 years. From June 30, the L&T is learnt to have expressed its inability to run the scheme as Rs. 46 crore bills were pending from the State government and it stopped payments to workers. Payments for the workers for the past six months, amounting to about Rs. 14.8 crore, were due, though the RWS officials had sent the bills to the government. RWS Superintending Engineer D. Venkata Ramana told The Hindu that while they were trying to revive water supply from Sunday, they might be able to ensure 20% of it by deploying the department personnel supervised by the AEs. The talks would be held on Monday or Tuesday and the next course of action would depend on the government’s decision. “Even if the L&T wishes to leave the O&M (operations and maintenance) completely, which they have not informed in writing, we are prepared to run the scheme with the available RWS staff,” Mr. Ramana said. Regarding the Sri Rama Reddy scheme, the wages of the workers in CPW schemes pending till now besides the ESI and PF dues were being sought by the workers’ union headed by G. Obul Kondareddy. The union has refused to come back to work unless their problems are resolved and enhanced wages announced from April 2021 with a new agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/strike-brings-rural-water-supply-in-anantapur-to-a-halt/article35261048.ece
11 July 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Meet calls for coordinated effort to get Krishna water for Rayalaseema||The members of civil society in Anantapur district on Saturday decided to work in a coordinated manner with all political parties to protect the right of Rayalaseema people over the Krishna water and ensure that the 122 tmcft allocated to the region is brought here without any hurdles. At a round-table conference here at the NGO Home, MLC Vennapoosa Gopal Reddy along with Besta Corporation director K.V. Ramana gave a call to all the political parties to come together to fight for the rights of the region by opposing the Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s statements that Andhra Pradesh was drawing more than its allocation. Mr. Gopal Reddy said it was due to the Jala Yagnam initiative of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy that the Rayalaseema region was getting some water and the stand taken by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had been appreciated by all in the current dispute over Krishna waters. “The role of national parties in this dispute is important so that everything is settled amicably,” Mr. Gopal Reddy said. A teacher Appireddy Harnadh Reddy and Rythu Sangham former leader Peddireddy along with another teacher popularly known as ‘100 tmc Ramanjaneyulu’ criticised KCR for seeking over and above what had been decided by the Brajesh Kumar Committee. “We had cooperated with your region when projects like Kalwakurthy, Dindi, and Palamuru were proposed for Mahabubnagar district and we did not object as people in that region were suffering, but now while Rayalaseema is turning into a desert, KCR is not ready to allow the rightful quota of its people from the Krishna,” said Mr. Harnadh Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/meet-calls-for-coordinated-effort-to-get-krishna-water-for-rayalaseema/article35260310.ece
11 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Weapons seized in Bengaluru jail raid||Early morning raids on Saturday by the Bengaluru City Police, including the Central Crime Branch (CCB), in various parts of the city including at Central Jail, Parappana Agrahara, led to the recovery of weapons such as knives and daggers, marijuana and mobile phones and SIM cards from inmates. “The raids were carried out after we received credible information that several gangsters and rowdies were carrying out activities from inside the prison,” said a source. Several teams along with dog squads carried out the search and made the seizures. The police were also probing the possible involvement of prison officials who failed to check the trade of narcotics. Another cause for concern is the number of mobile phones seized despite jammers in place. “We are analysing the mobile phones and SIM cards to ascertain illegal activities,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). Simultaenously, the city police also carried out massive search operations and raided residences of rowdies and habitual offenders in the city. “We have recovered a huge number of lethal weapons and rounded up several habitual offenders. Enquiries are being conducted,” said a senior police officer. Residences searched In Whitefield, the police conducted operations on the residences of 116 rowdies in their jurisdiction and recovered 2.5 kg of marijuana and lethal weapons such as knives, daggers and machetes. “Three rowdies have been booked under NDPS Act while 15 have been booked under Section 110 ( security for good behaviour from habitual offenders) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC),” D. Devraj, DCP, Whitefield said. Two murders These raids were conducted in the backdrop of two brazen murders in the city in broad daylight at public places over the last two weeks — financier Madan and former civic councillor Rekha Kadiresh. The police have also been cracking down on the sale of drugs in the city, increasing border checks and inspecting premises of private courier firms that are often used to ship consignments of narcotics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/weapons-seized-in-bengaluru-jail-raid/article35260289.ece

11 July 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||SP: special drives to check drunken driving||Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar said that special drives would be launched against drunken driving and sale of helmets with fake ISI marks to the customers in Madanapalle, Chittoor, Palamaner, Puttur and Sri City sub-divisions. Speaking to mediapersons here, Mr. Senthil Kumar said that two-wheelers constitute the majority of road mishaps and not wearing a helmet leads to most of the casualties among riders. Drunken driving was also found to be the prime reason behind the casualties among road users. Considering the statistics of mishaps, the drive would concentrate on imposing heavy fines on those found to be drunk while driving, besides prosecuting the violators, which would invite imprisonment ranging from one day to a fortnight. The police personnel would conduct raids to confiscate stocks of helmets with fake ISI stickers, he said. The SP sought the public to check the quality before purchasing helmets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sp-special-drives-to-check-drunken-driving/article35261050.ece

11 July 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Opposition coalition can take on the BJP’||Coalition of opposition parties irrespective of diverse ideologies was possible to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian democracy is replete with successful coalition governments, but this would be possible only if they place a convincing alternative to the present regime. This was the consensus among the representatives of three opposition parties at a session on ‘Does India lack an effective Opposition’, organised as part of the Indian School of Business (ISB) Leadership Summit here. Parliament members Asaduddin Owaisi from the AIMIM, Manish Tewari from Congress, Priyanka Chaturvedi from Shiv Sena and Sanjaya Baru, former Media Advisor to the late PM P.V. Narasimha Rao, projected the danger of diminishing democracy in India but also presented the hope of opposition parties coming together in the near future. Mr. Tewari, former Union Minister, said the powerful presence of the BJP will diminish as it was proved in the recent elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. India has seen successful coalition governments from 1991 to 2004 under different PMs. Ms. Priyanka Chaturvedi also chipped in giving the example of Maharashtra experiment where three ideologically different parties were successfully running the government with a common minimum programme. However, Mr. Owaisi argued that opposition parties must present an alternative ideology to the BJP’s ideology to win people’s confidence. As long as secular parties also toe the line of Hindutva, people will not believe in them. Some parties have openly or discreetly supported all the controversial laws brought in by the BJP and how can people believe them to be different, he asked. ‘No counter’ Mr. Sanjaya Baru found fault within the Opposition not presenting a counter to the narrative being set by the present government. He recalled that during the Nehru period, Congress was much stronger as a party and the government, but the Opposition then was always effective in presenting its argument. But the present Opposition parties perhaps lack the ideological clarity but yet there was an opportunity even now. He also recalled how from 1990 to 2014 there was consensual politics in India under P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Behari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. Ms. Chaturvedi argued that equal representation of political parties among the Opposition was the need of the hour since Congress was no longer a stronger party. So all the others will demand better share and there should be a possibility of other parties leading the opposition coalition. Mr Tiwari said coalitions have matured in India since 1996 recalling how P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh governments pushed most contentious laws to unshackle the economy in coalition governments. Atal Behari Vajpayee also could put through a coalition that lasted six years. Time to act Mr. Sanjaya Baru warned that young citizens have to worry about the onslaught on the Indian Constitution in the last seven years and said the very survival of India as a democracy would be in danger. Mr Tewari said if young people love liberty and freedom it was time to stand up and be counted. In a year or two down the line it may be too late. Ms. Chaturvedi also concurred with the thoughts and said democracy is made non-functional by the present government using the same tools. “Ten years down the line we don’t know whether India would remain a democracy,” she felt adding that lack of coherence in the Opposition must end. The fears of a presidential system in India was ruled out by Mr. Sanjaya Baru as he said it was impossible in India given its diversity. He reminded that India was a union of States and the Government in Delhi should be seen as accommodating all. Excessive centralisation and the fear that two Gujaratis running the government is being felt and other States will start questioning the incentive for remaining in the Indian Union, he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/opposition-coalition-can-take-on-the-bjp/article35260281.ece
11 July 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Eight cybercrooks from Rajasthan brought to Hyd.||Eight cyber crooks from Rajasthan involved in extortion, sale and purchase of vehicles through OLX, Facebook, Instagram and other websites were remanded by the Cyberabad police on Saturday. On June 20, the accused were arrested by Ramgarh police in Alwar district of Rajasthan and brought to city on prisoner transit warrant. The accused were identified as Kasam alias Ajay Singh (27), Babli Khan (19), Samaydeen (24), Farukh (23), Saikul Khan (22), Sahil Khan (19), Rahul (19) and Arsad (26), all resident of Piproli village under Ramgarh police station. “The above seized gadgets were analysed and their involvement was established in a number of OLX frauds and other cases of Cyberabad Commissionerate,” Commissioner of Police VC Sajjanar said. He said that on March 6 last, they received a complaint from one D. Srinivas in which he stated that he posted an advertisement on OLX website for selling a cot worth Rs. 16,000. The complainant received several calls from the fraudster and he showed interest in purchasing the said product and sent QR code for making payment. The complainant believed it as genuine, scanned QR code but instead of the amount being credited, he was debited of Rs. 90,000 in four transactions from the complainant's HDFC Bank account, Mr. Sajjanar said. “After completion of the transaction, the fraudsters stopped responding to Srinivas calls and soon he realised that it was fraud and approached us,” he said. According to the Commissioner, fraudsters post advertisements of sale of cars/two-wheelers for very less price than the market price on OLX, Quikr platforms, to attract and to cheat the gullible public. They pose themselves as Army officials and post ID cards as Army and CISF Personnel by creating fake Aadhar and Identity cards of Defence personnel, to gain the trust of the public who browse OLX or other advertising platforms, he said. “If any person shows interest to buy the vehicles/goods, the fraudsters insist the victims to deposit the money by citing different reasons such as advance amount, gate pass charges, shipment charges, insurance charges and delivery charges by sending the fake transport receipts reflecting Indian army symbols,” he said. Further they also respond to the advertisers whoever posts ads in OLX, Quikr for sale of any furniture/electronic goods/vehicles, and contact them by posing themselves as Army/Defence officials. They, on the pretext of buying the goods, send QR codes to the advertisers and make them scan, and in the process cheat them, Mr. Sajjanar said. Further they collect WhatsApp numbers of the people and in the guise of friendship and dating, start chatting through WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, after which they start nude video call and insist the victim watch the video and blackmail them for money by sending those videos.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cyber-crooks-from-rajasthan-brought-to-hyd/article35260613.ece

11 July 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana’s offer exceeded that of other States, says Kitex||The incentives offered by the Telangana government exceeded the promises made by the governments of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, the Kitex Group said on Saturday, explaining its decision to invest Rs. 1,000 crore in the Kakatiya Mega Textiles Park. K.T. Rama Rao, Telangana Industries Minister, had promised that the industrial unit would not be harassed by political leadership or government agencies. The Telangana government promised all help, it said. A Kitex team was flown to Telangana by a private jet on Friday by the Telangana government. MLA’s allegations P.T. Thomas, Congress MLA, said he stood by his allegations against the Kitex Group. He said he would send Mr. Jacob a defamation notice and seek a compensation of Rs. 1 crore. The MLA had alleged that the dyeing, bleaching and printing units of the company were polluting the Kadambrayar river. “There are only 243 workers in the unit. Of them, only 40 hail from Kerala. So it isn’t a question of 15,000 people’s employment.” Mr. Thomas also alleged that the Kitex Group-led Twenty20, ruling the Kizhakkambalam grama panchayat, had denied permission to a Russia-based Keralite for setting up affordable housing units in the panchayat. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the UDF’s stand was that no industrialist should leave. He said the Kitex Group had helped the LDF come to power, but now the front and the company seemed to have fallen out. The government must respond on the controversy, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telanganas-offer-exceeded-that-of-other-states-says-kitex/article35260282.ece
11 July 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Lokame Tharavadu’ hopes to reopen soon||The pandemic erected virtual walls around people, locking them up in isolation, gloom and despair. If there was/is a goal, that was/is to survive! And the ‘Game of Survival’ took artist Mona Mohan, from Thripunithura in Ernakulam, to painstakingly make hand-stitched portraits of people who have survived the odds, on cora cloth. Among the faces that she stitched up were those of her husband Ratheesh Thampan, also a struggling artist, who took to driving an autorickshaw to pull through the difficult times; of noted climate activist Greta Thunberg; and the Masaka children in Africa. Ms. Mohan’s work and that of Mr. Thampan — titled ‘Emancipation of Mind’, large acrylic abstracts — are among those of 267 Malayali artists part of the art show, ‘Lokame Tharavadu’ (The World Is One Family) readied across five venues in Alappuzha awaiting reopening in compliance with the pandemic protocol. There is a venue in Ernakulam too — the Dubar Hall Art Gallery, where works by senior artists will be on display. Permission sought Bose Krishnamachari, curator of the show and president of the Kochi Biennale Foundation that is organising the show as a means to bring together Malayali artists from around the world, has written to the Chief Secretary seeking permission to resume the show that was forced to hibernate 10 days after opening because of the second wave of COVID-19. “We are happy that the situation is gradually improving and various sectors are waking up again. We have submitted a detailed plan, recommending the number of people allowable at a time in the 13 buildings hosting the show. Our desire is to keep the show open in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol till September 30. It can be a great boost for a heritage city like Alappuzha,” says Mr. Krishnamachari. The State government is the lead sponsor of the show, but there are supporters like Betty Karan, who made available some of the spectacular buildings, ramshackle yesteryear warehouses along Alappuzha’s sinewy waterways, for the conduct of the exhibition. The works bring in a great deal of variety, in terms of style, medium, material and political position, but the backstories of some of the artists are equally fascinating. Santha C., a 64-year-old artist from Kozhikode, for instance, has exhibited intricate, colourful abstract works. A Class 8 dropout, she raises chicken and ducks for a living and has been active in the democratic women’s association. Thaj Backer, an artist from Malappuram, has employed the esoteric Ponnani ink, also called Arabic ink, made from the burnt nut of the Tamanu tree with tree gum as binder. He is showcasing a series of images capturing life and its periodic transformation in his native town. Blodsow, an artist from Alappuzha, has drawn inspiration from Elsworth Kelly’s ‘Spectrum’ and re-imagines it in the backdrop of the lower caste women’s struggle for dignity (the struggle for the right to cover their chests) and equal labour rights. He has used multicoloured blouse material procured from a local shop to put together the work. Video installations, conceptual and thematic photo essays, sculptures, paintings, site-specific works and mixed media art are all part of the show. There are highly personal works too, like Jitish Kallat’s ‘Epilogue’ in which he recreates the lifetime of his late father using the waxing and waning images of the daily bread (roti) that resembles the moon. Some 22,000 moons are thus arranged month-wise, capturing his life period. Unlike the Biennale, works exhibited at the show are up for sale and patrons have already bought some of the works seeing them on Instagram and other social media platforms. “It’s good for many Kerala artists to make themselves visible.It was in September last year, after the first wave of the pandemic, that we thought of holding such a show to fill in the vacuum, to support the artists and promote art exhibitions,” says Mr. Krishnamachari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lokame-tharavadu-hopes-to-reopen-soon/article35260283.ece
11 July 2021||KOLLAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||A couple’s library spreads love for reading||A couple of decades back, coastal Clappana had very little in store for avid readers. They had to cross vast paddy fields and dirt tracks to reach the nearest library, a trip undertaken by bookworms only. Though the situation has changed over the years, that did not stop L.K. Dasan and S.Vinitha from setting up Aksharappura, a library next to their home with thousands of books collected in the past seven years. A schoolteacher by profession, Mr.Dasan says limited exposure to books as a student prompted him to start a library. Their mission “As a school-goer I always wanted more access to reading material and we built Aksharappura brick by brick so that nobody is denied that opportunity. Though many libraries came up in the panchayat after 2016, we mainly cater to the coastal parts of Clappana and bordering Alappad,” he adds. The couple has been systematically sourcing books since 2014 and the library was started in 2017 with nearly 1,500 books, a handful of dailies and over 15 periodicals at a rented space. “In 2020, we got the Kerala State Library Council affiliation and it was then we decided to construct a building on three cents beside our house. Mr. Dasan and Ms. Vinitha, who works as clerk at the Service Cooperative Bank, set aside a portion of their salary for the construction, which was completed in July 2021. “ The taluk library council offered us all support and we dedicated our library to the nation this week.” As a teacher, Mr.Dasan is well aware of the challenges involved in cultivating the love for reading, especially when the habit is not part of the routine. “School libraries often provide no solution as they hardly stock books from all categories. If students like Basheer, they won’t be able to get all books, or a particular title by the author there. Ours is basically a neighbourhood of fishers, farmers, and daily wage workers and often it is not possible for them to invest extra hours scouting for books,” he says. PSC coaching Apart from lending books, the library also offers free PSC coaching along with tabla, vocal, and guitar classes. While COVID-19 kept millions of readers out of libraries, Aksharappura has been home-delivering books without any break. Mr.Dasan says they get regular enquires from over 150 members who keeps on reserving books. “As part of Penvayana, a programme of Karunagapplly taluk library council, we reach out to homemakers and girls at their houses. During the pandemic, we used to drop books for people in quarantine and home care. Except for the initial lockdown days, we have been busy distributing books,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-couples-library-spreads-love-for-reading/article35260285.ece

The victim, who is believed to be in her thirties, had been undergoing treatment in the destitute ward of the hospital for several months.

All India Youth Federation State president P. Rajendra said youth organisations cutting across party-lines would stage relay fast before collectorates on July 13 and 14 in protest against the job calendar released on June 18 to fill just 10,143 vacancies in various posts.

11 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Bid to tarnish Kerala’s image’||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that there seems to be a ‘planned move’ to ‘shame and brand’ Kerala as an unfriendly investment destination. Mr. Vijayan was speaking against the backdrop of Kitex owner Sabu M. Jacob's national attention-grabbing move to shift his investment from Kerala to Telangana, citing political harassment by the Left Democratic Front government. Mr. Vijayan said any attempts to put a stain on Kerala's investment-friendly image were tantamount to trespass against the developmental aspirations of the people. The people had rejected a similar campaign in the past to demonise Kerala as the graveyard of investors. They would do the same in the future. He said Telangana was well within its rights to attract investment and fete industrialists. Nevertheless, the potentially damaging propaganda that Kerala was hostile to business flew in the face of facts. Kerala had scored first in NITI Aayog's latest sustained development index report. Industrial development is the primary yardstick of the survey. Kerala stood second in the country in innovation, investment climate and human resource. The National Council of Applied Economic Research had rated Kerala first in terms of political stability and business awareness. Kerala saw investment to the tune of Rs. 6,612 crore in the past five years. The government has now extended a Rs. 1,416 crore package to revive the pandemic-hit MSME sector. As many as 70,946 MSMEs set up shops in the State. Land acquisition for the Koch-Bengaluru industrial corridor has entered the final phase. Massive infrastructure development projects are in the offing. The government has passed the Kerala Investment and Facilitation Act, 2018. MSMEs can set up shops on the strength of an affidavit. They need to get the requisite permissions and licences within three years of the start of production. The government has instituted single-window clearance boards in industrial parks. A centralised system to make factory inspections hassle-free is in the pipeline. Checks will be software-driven and not complaint-based. The government has standardised the application form for getting an industrial permit. Kerala is striving to gain the 10th position in the national ease of doing business categorisation. Party alleges conspiracy CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said a conspiracy was afoot to project a distorted image of Kerala’s conducive investment climate. Attempts were on to demonise Kerala as an investor unfriendly State. He said Kitex’s sudden disavowal of Kerala was not impromptu. “There is a political motive. Suddenly Kitex gets invited by other political dispensations to set shop in their respective jurisdictions. They send jets to fete the industrialist. That is not spontaneous,” he said.  Kerala stands first in NITI Aayog's latest sustained development index report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bid-to-tarnish-keralas-image/article35260293.ece

The series of demonstrations was launched by Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president S. Sailajanath on Wednesday along with AICC secretary C.D. Meiyappan, which was followed by a signature campaign conducted over the last three days by Andhra Pradesh Mahila Congress president K. Prameelamma and city Congress president Mangati Gopal Reddy to elicit public opinion on the unprecedented hike. Party activists gathered outside petrol stations and sought the signature of the motorcyclists and autorickshaw drivers, who were evidently in favour of the campaign. “People are coming forward voluntarily to affix their signature, which shows that they are fed up with the hike effected by the Union government on petrol and diesel prices,” Ms. Prameelamma told the media. Mr. Gopal Reddy demanded an explanation from the Centre on the need for a consistent hike in prices. He termed the move ‘unwarranted’, at a time when the common man was affected by the pandemic, which in turn caused loss of livelihood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-continues-protest-against-fuel-price-hike/article35261059.ece
11 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Digital deprivation no barrier to learning||Adapt, adopt and evolve had been the catchwords of the lockdown period that disrupted the normal course in every sector, and education was no exception. Schools were shut down and teachers and learners moved to the online space to remain in touch with their academic curriculum. The large number of students who did not have access to the smartphones and regular access to the Internet data were at risk of losing touch with their academic lessons. Peer learning To beat this digital deprivation, the A.P. Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (APSWREIS) hit upon the idea of Village Learning Circle (VLC). “It’s a study circle of the students by the students and for the students from within a local community or a village, based on the concept of peer learning, wherein senior students help their juniors in learning by constituting small groups,” explained B. Navya, Secretary of the society. Since almost 50% of the students in the social welfare schools did not have access to technology, it was important for the society to think innovative and reach out to them with a solution. “We introduced the VLC model on July 1. It is already paying dividends,” she said, informing that the 26 Balayogi Gurukulams in the State had established 150 VLCs. “We intend to replicate the models in other schools and penetrate deeper into the villages, reaching out to more number of students,” she said. Role for alumni The society has also roped in the alumni of the schools residing in the locality to help the children with the support of teachers, who guide them wherever necessary and provide relevant study material. The principals of the schools identified for setting up VLCs take up an important role. They identify villages with more than three students to form a VLC, map the students to the villages, identify a class leader, alumni and map them to the village volunteer. A VLC WhatsApp group is formed to share time table and day-wise content to be studied. The teachers finalise grade-wise content with the help of other teachers in their school and, initially, a two-week schedule is provided for each class. This is extended gradually. Wherever and whenever possible, a teacher is assigned the task of visiting the village to provide support and guidance in the initial stage, and the VLCs function under regular monitoring of aspects related to COVID-appropriate behaviour, safety, hygiene, ventilation and water provision. “The principals have also been asked to ensure a fun-filled and joyful learning atmosphere,” said Ms. Navya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/digital-deprivation-no-barrier-to-learning/article35260616.ece

11 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Dr. YSR Horticultural University develops 13 hybrid crop varieties||Dr. YSR Horticultural University has developed 13 high-yielding hybrid crop varieties including coconut, coriander, chilli, colocasia, fenugreek, cassava, banana and turmeric that are resistant to pests and diseases and tolerant to environmental stress. The hybrids include four varieties of coconut and three varieties of chilli. University Vice- Chancellor T. Janakiram told The Hindu that it took 16 to 18 years for developing the perennial crops such as coconut and about 8 to 10 years for annual crops like chilli, tuber crops and seed spices. The process involved identification of genetic lines, crossing the varieties, evaluation at the research station level, multi-location trials and mini-kit testing, he says. The new varieties are tolerant to environmental stress such as temperature, drought, cyclone and etc. For instance, Lavanya, a turmeric variety, has a yield potential of 55 to 65 tonnes per hectare (raw rhizome yield) and is tolerant to leaf spot, leaf blotch and rhizome rot diseases. Godavari Bontha, a culinary variety of banana, has comparatively higher yield potential than Kovvur Bontha. With an average bunch weight is 23 to 24 kg, it is tolerant to pests such as thrips and aphids and moderately resistant to leaf spot diseases, he says. The university has developed varieties including Vasista Ganga, Gauthami Ganga, Abhaya Ganga and Vynateya Ganga (coconut) and Suruchi (coriander) and Godavari Chema (colocasia). Suruchi has very good aroma, when compared to traditional variety such as Sadhana and others grown commercially. Godavari Chema is recommended for cultivation as a solo and intercrop with banana and coconut, with an average yield potential of 18 to 20 tonnes per hectare. Notified area of adoption “The States for which the notified area of adoption has been issued include Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan for coriander. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu can go for adoption, depending upon the crops and varieties. These new varities were approved by the Central Variety Release Committee. Also, they have been notified in the gazette,” says the Vice-Chancellor. Mr. Janakiram says steps such as producing foundation and certified seed at the respective research stations are being taken to supply the varieties such as chilli, seed spices, tuber crops to farmers. “The crop technologies are being commercialised so that nurseries and NGOs can produce the seed or planting material on a large scale to supply them to farmers. Soon, we will sign a MoU with a few firms for commercial production of the newly developed varieties,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dr-ysr-horticultural-university-develops-13-hybrid-crop-varieties/article35261064.ece
11 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘BJP is opposed to building churches with people’s money’||The State government should desist from spending people’s money for the construction of churches, which, in fact, has to be done with the funds mobilised from within the community like it happens in the case of Hindu temples, BJP State president Somu Veerraju has said. “But the YSRCP government is funding the construction of churches. The BJP is opposed to it, not because of the religion in question but as a matter of principle,” Mr. Veerraju said while welcoming several pastors into the party here on Saturday. “If the government appeases a particular religion, it amounts to playing vote bank politics,” Mr. Veerraju said. “The BJP is a principled party. It follows the norm that people have to be Indians first, and religious identities come later,” he added. Expressing regret that there were people who refuse to sing ‘Jana Gana Mana’ and ‘Vande Mataram’, Mr. Veerraju asserted that Hinduism was a way of life.“Those who call BJP a Hindutva party should desist from making such comments,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-is-opposed-to-building-churches-with-peoples-money/article35261066.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy should make his party MP Ayodhya Rami Reddy resign from the Rajya Sabha following Income Tax raids on his residence for alleged tax evasion. At a press conference, Mr. Ramaiah demanded that the Chief Minister also suspend the MP from the primary membership of his party and prove his commitment to ethical values. The TDP leader said the Rajya Sabha was a place for people with wisdom and experience but Mr. Jagan had sent a person with such a dubious track record to the House of Elders. He alleged that corruption was at its peak in the State with ‘corrupt and dishonest people like Mr. Rami Reddy’ rallying behind their leader and party chief. Mr. Ramaiah also criticised the YSRCP honorary president Y.S.

Rawat’s response to the allegations of accounting lapses, alleged that he had stated what he asked to by the YSRCP leadership.

11 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Accept feedback on draft plan till August 31, BJP urges VMRDA||The BJP leaders have asked the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) to give an extra 45 days, till August 31, for communicating objections and suggestions on the Draft Master Plan-2041. Addressing the media here on Saturday, former BJP MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju said that the 30 days period given is insufficient, keeping the COVID-19 pandemic in view. The deadline expires on July 15. “These plans affect the lives of over 7.5 million people living in the districts of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram and are prepared for the next 30 years. Hence sufficient time should be given for the people to respond,” he said. MLC P.V.N. Madhav pointed out that the usual and scientific approach is that a perspective plan is first prepared and approved by the government and based on the same a draft master plan has to prepared for approval. But in this case the VMRDA has hurriedly published both the Draft Perspective Plan and the Draft Master Plan simultaneously during the pandemic period. “It was notified on June 16, when partial curfew was still in force,” he said. The BJP leaders, including M. Raveendra and Suhasini Anand, said that no physical copies in form for books were made available and the documents and plans were only displayed online, which is difficult for common man to download and read due to the huge file size. Moreover, the plans are also not clear, they said. The BJP leaders pointed out that the VMRDA was still uploading information and this is confusing the people. Moreover, several documents such as zoning and development have not been uploaded in full, they said. They said that the document is uploaded in English language and demanded that it be uploaded in Telugu also. The colour coding in some documents are wrongly depicted, as hills are shown as agricultural lands and vice-versa. These discrepancies need to be corrected and uploaded for better understanding, said Mr. Raju. There is also no documents showing survey numbers, sub-divisions and extents of land being lost by citizens, which is important for people to understand to raise their objections, the BJP leaders said. Before approving the present draft master plan there is a need to review the status of roads. Most of the roads proposed in earlier master plans were dropped in the subsequent master plans. The planners need to give a serious thought to this aspect to avoid a similar situation for the present plan, said Mr. Madhav. According to Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju, Visakhapatnam city is a north-south oriented linear city, but while planning the road network this important factor, seems to have been missed out. Visakhapatnam has many major roads running parallel to each other like Beach Road, National Highway, Anakapalle- Anandapuram Road, Kothavalasa –Vizianagaram Road. Connecting these roads there are many roads from east to west direction which are narrow. The master plan-2041 instead of proposing to widen these roads to 80 or 100 feet has proposed many green field roads unnecessarily. Most of these new roads cannot be formeddue to hurdles and forming these will lead to huge financial costs and human suffering. A ground inspection report related all major roads proposed has to be prepared and only practically possible roads should be depicted in the plan, said Mr. Raju and Madhav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/give-time-till-august-31-to-accept-feedback-on-draft-plan-bjp/article35261092.ece

11 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||NREDCAP formulates scheme to provide e-bikes to govt. employees on EMI||Electric vehicles may rule the roads in the State during the next three to four years, if the plans of the New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of AP (NREDCAP) are any indication. The NREDCAP has formulated a scheme to provide electric two-wheelers to government employees on EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) basis. The beneficiaries need not make any down payment and the EMIs can be for periods ranging from 24 to 60 months. The EMI amount would be between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 2,500, which includes the Annual Maintenance Cost (AMC) of the vehicle for three years. The maximum speed of the vehicle would be between 40 and 100 km/hr, based on the model and brand chosen by the beneficiary. The scheme is applicable to all government employees, including those in the Cooperative Societies, Public Sector Undertakings and pensioners. The focus would be on village/ward secretariat staff and other low paid employees, who opt for this scheme. NREDCAP, which developed a web portal and mobile app for processing, approval and monitoring of two-wheeler distribution programme on EMI basis to government employees, will act as a single window agency for the implementation of the scheme. The Heads of Departments and the Drawing and Disbursement Officers (DDOs) have been asked to motivate their employees to adopt EVs. Interested employees have to submit their application through evnredcap mobile app or through the web portalwww.evnredcap.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nredcap-formulates-scheme-to-provide-e-bikes-to-govt-employees-on-emi/article35261147.ece
11 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Efforts on to form a platform against BJP, says Narayana||Communist Party of India (CPI) national secretary K. Narayana has said that efforts are on to rope in all like-minded parties to form a formidable platform against the BJP for the coming general elections. Addressing the media here on Saturday, he said that already almost all regional parties, except for a few such as the YSR Congress Party, have gone against the BJP and even neutral parties such as the BJD are thinking on the same lines. This is happening due to the BJP’s ‘anti-people’ policies such as the new Farm Acts, he said. Coming down heavily on the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that the basic ides of minimum government and maximum governance has gone for a toss and now it is the other way. To cover up his failures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Prime Minister has made Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan the scapegoat, by removing him from his portfolio, alleged Mr. Narayana. Mr. Modi has now become the most unpopular PM and the cover-up of COVID deaths has been exposed by the media, he alleged. When the death toll is around 41 lakhs, the government is showing only 3.5 to 4 lakhs, Mr. Narayana alleged. He also criticised Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy for allegedly under-counting the deaths. “I was there in the Tirupati hospital, when 23 patients died, as the oxygen tanker had come 45 minutes late. But the government had declared that only 11 patients died. During the COVID, while the entire population suffered due to bad planning and lack of infrastructure, only the corporate hospitals had benefited,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/efforts-on-to-form-a-platform-against-bjp-says-narayana/article35261152.ece

A large number of steel plant employees, hundreds of members from various trade unions and political parties took part in a bike rally from Kurmannapalem Junction to Gandhi Statue, near the GVMC building, here on Saturday. Holding placards with slogans ‘Save VSP, Save India’, the protestors raised slogans against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and demanded that the government immediately withdraw the decision. Addressing a public meet after the rally, CITU State General Secretary M.A. Gafoor said the VSP has helped the country by supplying oxygen to various parts and said that it is the responsibility of people of the State to ensure it is not privatised. He alleged that due to the government policies the VSP suffered losses and demanded that the government allot captive mines to the plant. He said that the State government should increase pressure against the BJP on the issue. AITUC State General Secretary G. Obulesh alleged that the BJP government is only favouring the private sector. He said that in the coming parliamentary sessions, all party leaders should raise voice against the privatisation of the VSP. CITU State president Ch. Narsinga Rao said that the Union government didn’t respond to the resolution passed by the State government on the issue and this is tantamount to humiliating Telugus. He also questioned the State government to answer whether it is capable to fight against the Union government over the issue or not. He said that if the State government is not capable, workers union are ready to fight and protect the VSP. Former TDP MLA Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said that the YSRCP leaders should put pressure on the Union government in Parliament and see that the privatisation process is stopped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bike-rally-marks-150th-day-of-stir-against-vsp-privatisation/article35261143.ece

Eggs, the nutrient rich superfood, and other food items of the Take Home Ration (THR) menu are being delivered at the homes of beneficiaries under the 11 projects/blocks of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme owing to closure of the AWCs due to the pandemic.

On Saturday, one citizen posted a photograph of a number plate with one digit having the photograph of an MLA. Another citizen posted a photograph of a number plate that’s covered with a surgical mask. “We penalise them and make them rectify the number plate,” said a policeman attached to Toli Chowki Traffic Police when asked about the tampered number plates. Barely visible But even when the number plates are rectified, they are barely visible. According to a 2018 Ministry of Road Transport and Highways notification, all vehicles should have high security number plates with a chromium-based hologram. “The unique high security registration plate shall be linked electronically to the vehicle after its affixture on the vehicle on registration,” says the notification. But on the streets of Hyderabad, the rule book goes for a toss as honest citizens are punished for minor infractions while those tampering with number plates with criminal intent go scot free. Bending, smudging, breaking, tying ribbons, hanging helmet and changing the angle of the rear number plates are some of the tricks being devised by motorists to escape being penalised. It is not just the two-wheeler riders who are smudging, bending and hiding number plates. Vehicles transporting construction material and dangerous goods are the biggest culprits. Every night, hundreds of heavy duty trucks loaded with sand and other construction material stream into the city from east. A majority of them have number plates hidden behind ribbons, danglers, have smudged digits or illegal guard rails blocking the view. Even when they are caught, vehicles transporting overladen cargo get a rap on the knuckles. A vehicle with TS07UH1277 owned by a plastic goods company has been penalised multiple times but with Rs. 100 or Rs. 135. While the challans are being promptly repaid, the transport of overladen goods has not ceased putting citizens’ lives at risk. Helpless policemen “We cannot do more than this. We can only click photograph and hope they pay the penalty,” said the traffic police official posted near Ring Road in Karwan. Incidentally, on the same stretch of road there are three parking bays for trucks transporting construction material. The number plates of the vehicles parked there remain hidden or are smudged. The vehicle owners use the jurisdictional boundaries on either side of the Attapur Bridge to evade police surveillance.  “We cannot do more than this. We can only click photograph and hope they pay the penalty.” Traffic police official, Posted near Ring Road, Karwan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/to-avoid-penal-action-motorists-obfuscate-vehicle-numbers/article35260899.ece
11 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Open garbage points, vacant houses breeding dengue mosquitoes||Proliferation of open garbage points, and homes either locked or abandoned are two new additions to the list of causes for rapid increase of dengue-causing mosquitoes in the city this monsoon. Several locations in the city are seeing increased number of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes which spread the dengue fever. Aedes mosquito can be differentiated from other species by its feeding habit during day time. Two years ago, the city had experienced an explosion of dengue cases due to GHMC’s laxity in controlling the mosquito population. Dengue has made an entry this year too, with the city recording a total of 56 cases so far. However, officials say that only six cases have been confirmed through ELISA test, while the rest were only suspected cases which tested positive through NS1 antibody technique. Spread of the disease could be slow because the Aedes mosquito cannot fly beyond half a kilometre, but nevertheless it is a cause for concern, say experts. “If a dengue case surfaces in a locality, about 100 houses surrounding the infected home become vulnerable because the Aedes mosquito can fly up to half a kilometre unlike Anopheles which can fly two kilometres,” says chief entomologist GHMC A. Rambabu. Unlike Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant and dirty water, Aedes mosquito breeds in fresh water, which makes every household a hot breeding ground for it. They thrive in garbage dumps, auto-mobile service centres and open plots too, as rain water accumulates in discarded cups and plates, and old tyres. “Owing to removal of dumper bins, there has been an increase in the number of locations where garbage is dumped, and this has led to proliferation of mosquitoes,” Syed Bilal, a resident of Chaderghat, says. There has been rise in the number of locked and abandoned houses too, due to COVID-19 pandemic situation, which have become ticking time-bombs with respect to breeding of Aedes mosquitoes. “Two old houses were sold and vacated in our street before the onset of pandemic, but the purchasers have not taken any interest in them due to the economic slowdown. Mosquitoes breeding there are entering our homes, about which we are unable to do anything,” says Satyanarayana, an apartment welfare association president in Dilsukhnagar. Several residents have also locked their homes and left for respective native villages for fear of contracting the infection, he said. Officials say that other than spreading awareness about arresting the breeding, it will be impossible for Entomology staff to physically inspect every household and ensure that the water is cleared. The city has only about 2,300 Entomology workers for over a crore population, whose responsibility it is also to take up anti-larval operations, fever survey, and spraying of disinfectant solution against COVID-19 spread. While emptying water containers was the most sought after photo-op last year for ministers, VIPs and celebrities on social media, no such bustle can be seen this time round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/open-garbage-points-vacant-houses-breed-spots-for-dengue-mosquitoes/article35260873.ece
11 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Govt. will fight even with God for its due’||Minister for Municipal Administration, Information Technology and Industries K.T. Rama Rao has said that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government would not only fight with Andhra Pradesh but even take on the God for the State’s rightful share in Krishna water and make the combined Mahabubnagar prosperous by irrigation every inch of cultivable land. “Under the leadership of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the State government won’t compromise on the issue of Krishna wates and get every drop of water that belongs to Telangana and complete Palamuru-Rangareddy lift irrigation scheme at the earliest”, Mr. Rama Rao said participating in Pattana Pragathi programmes that were organised in the district headquarters town of Narayanpet on Saturday. The police resorted to a lathicharge against slogan-shouting Akhil Bharat Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists who obstructed the Minister’s convoy in protest against unemployment. The police beat some of them brutally while dispersing the crowd. ‘Will stop injustice’ The Telangana Rashtra Samithi government would not only stop the injustice heaped on the combined Mahabubnagar district and achieve the State’s judicious share in Krishna water, the Municipal Administration, Information Technology and Industries Minister said. Stones laid He laid foundation stones for integrated handloom training and textile park, integrated market, martyrs memorial park and inaugurated a children’s science park. He also inaugurated children’s intensive care unit (ICU) ward in the District Hospital. Speaking on the occasion, the Information Technology and Industries Minister sought to know whether any other State in the country was implementing welfare schemes such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, Kalyana Laxmi and other being implemented in Telangana. ‘TS distinction’ Telangana had the distinction of producing highest quantity of paddy production and procurement during the recent rabi season, he noted adding that the government was working on establishing food processing zones to make value addition to the farmers’ produce. Stating that people used to get drinking water supply once in two weeks in the combined Mahabubnagar district, he said they were getting it every alternate day now. He announced construction of new Collectorate and other offices. Mr. Rama Rao said weavers’ welfare was priority to the State government and as part of it they would be extended insurance scheme on the lines of farmers soon. The handloom training and textile park, first of its kind, would be established with a cost of Rs. 10 crore, he stated. Ministers S. Niranjan Reddy and V. Srinivas Goud, Member of Parliament M.

11 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State Waqf Board quietly issues circular on free burial spaces||Grave spaces for exorbitant sums of money has been a contentious issue. So much so that the Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) has minced no words in the recent past that burials must be provided free of charge. But it was only after the Telangana State Information Commission (TSIC) came down heavily on the board that more than five months later it issued a circular, without fanfare, directing managers of graveyards to provide free burial spaces, or face stringent action. The issue came to light when a Right to Information Act applicant Kareem Ansari, an activist working with the portal youRTI.in, received a copy of the circular from board on Thursday. At a hearing at the TSIC in February, State Information Commissioner Mohd Ameer termed the situation of charging for burial spaces as ‘alarming’ and stated that ‘oral instructions’ made by Chairman Mohammed Saleem on social media on the issue are available. He also stated that there ‘must be specific guidelines/procedure laid down by the Government or by the Chief Executive Officer’ to fix ‘nominal charges for allotting graves’. He opined that the system at the board needs to be streamlined, and action should be taken against those who have been charging kin of the deceased large sums of money for burials. The circular dated June 28, which was sent to all mutawallis (managers) in the State, apprised them that the it had come to the attention of the board that they were not allotting burial spaces, and were also charging ‘huge amounts from poor Muslims’. Erring mutawallis and managing committees were warned of severe action, with the board stating that they should provide grave space free of charge, ‘failing which criminal action will be taken against the responsible persons’. Interestingly, a copy of the circular was marked to the TSIC with a request to close the case. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Ansari said that issuing writing instructions is a welcome move. “For several months no written instructions on the issue were given. The State Information Commission took note of the problem and gave an order which will help several poor people who are unable to afford to bury their dead. The board should now ensure that this circular is complied with.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/waqf-board-acts-on-free-burials/article35260864.ece
11 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Fill 1.98 lakh posts identified by panel, says Revanth||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy has demanded that the government fill the 1.98 lakh vacancies identified by the Pay Revision Commission headed by retired IAS officer C.R. Biswal and also take back the 1,600 part-time nurses recruited for COVID servies. In a letter to the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said the government announcing that it would fill just 50,000 vacancies was nothing more than cheating. Similarly, there were several vacancies in the corporations that were not part of the Biswal Commission and they too need to be notified and filled. The TPCC president found fault with the way the staff nurses were thrown out after recruiting them during the COVID. They extended services in the most difficult period and throwing them out now was inhuman. He reminded how the Chief Minister praised them as gods when COVID was at its peak. It was unfortunate that the CM did not have five minutes to meet them when they went to Pragati Bhavan. He warned that if the government did not respond on the vacancies the Congress would announce a plan of action to put pressure on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fill-198-lakh-posts-identified-by-panel-says-revanth/article35260884.ece

11 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Favourable weather aside, kharif sowing lags||Notwithstanding the favourable weather conditions, cultivation of crop during the ongoing kharif (vaanakalam) season is lower compared to last year as sowing of crops has been completed on a little over 35% of the planned area – 49.29 lakh acres out of 140.12 lakh acres – till the end of July first week. Sowing operations were completed on nearly half of the planned extent last year by the same time. Crops were cultivated on over 61.31 lakh acres out of the planned area of 125.45 lakh acres during the last kharif. However, the pattern of sowing has been in tune with the State government’s expectations as it has has been repeatedly asking the farming community to prefer cultivation of cotton and redgram to paddy during the kharif season. “Accordingly, farmers have sown cotton on nearly 71% (34.9 lakh acres) of the total extent sown and redgram on another 10% (4.84 lakh acres) of the area sown”, a senior official monitoring the progress of sowing operations explained. In its plans, the government has suggested that the farming community take up cotton on 70.05 lakh acres, redgram on 20 lakh acres and paddy on 41 lakh acres out of the total 140.12 lakh acres mapped for cultivation of kharif crops. “The widespread rains are expected to pace up sowing operations as the ideal time for sowing of a majority of the kharif crops is till the end of July third week, although some crops could be raised beyond,” the official said. Ample inputs Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy stated that all major inputs such as seed and fertilizer had already been positioned. Against the requirement of 13.06 lakh quintals of various seed, the availability was about 18.29 lakh quintals. Similarly, more than one-third of 25.5 lakh tonnes of fertilizer required for the entire season had also been positioned. Besides, over Rs. 7,360 crore investment support had been given to about 60.84 lakh farmers under the Rythu Bandhu scheme, he siad. Average rainfall till the end of July first week is 39% higher than normal as actual rainfall has been 237.7 mm against the normal of 171.6 mm. Kumram Bheem-Asifabad district has recorded a maximum (average) of 364 mm, while Wanaparthy recorded the lowest (average) of 86.2 mm rainfall. Nearly 90% of the rural mandals, 519 out of 578, recorded normal and higher rainfall including nearly 62% of them receiving excess (174) or largely excess (182) rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/favourable-weather-aside-kharif-sowing-lags/article35260879.ece
11 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||BJP govt. collecting Rs. 14,000 cr. a year on fuel taxes: Congress||TPCC working presidents J. Geetha Reddy and Anjan Kumar Yadav have accused the BJP government of fleecing the common man collecting Rs. 14,000 crore as fuel taxes every year despite the crude prices falling rapidly in the international market. At a press conference here, Ms. Geetha Reddy said that BJP government had revised the fuel prices 43 times since it came to power apart from enhancing LPG prices by over Rs. 200 hitting the lower middle class and middle class hard. “Yet there is no remorse on the part of the BJP government or its leaders,” she said. She said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao should provide some relief by reducing state taxes but he had concern for Additional Collectors for whom he had bought KIA cars worth crores of rupees but doesn’t have the heart to help the common man. Both Modi and KCR should realise that people’s incomes were severely affected by Coronavirus over the last two years. The former Minister also said attacks on Dalits had increased in Telangana and so were lockup deaths. Rape and sexual harassment of women were on the rise and yet the government was claiming everything was under control. Police had become insensitive to attacks on women, she alleged. She also objected to the ‘vulgar’ comments made by Minister Dayakar Rao against a women officer in full public view and demanded that he be dismissed from the Cabinet immediately. Mr. Anjan Kumar Yadav said the Telangana Congress would organise bicycle rallies and bullock cart rallies in the State on July 12 against the rising fuel prices. A massive rally would be held from Indira Park to Raj Bhavan on July 16 on the same issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-govt-collecting-rs-14000-cr-a-year-on-fuel-taxes-congress/article35260888.ece
11 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Couple marries again, 15 years after divorce||After 15 years of separation, a divorced couple decided to remarry and got reunited before Lok Adalat conducted at City Civil Court complex here on Saturday. A retired employee in his late 60s and and his wife in late 50s got separated 15 years ago, having secured divorce direction from a local court in Hyderabad. They were married for 20 years by then. On personal grounds, they decided to take divorce. After securing divorce direction, they were living separately in Hyderabad while their children completed their education and settled abroad. The retired employee and his former wife, both of whom were living separately, recently decided to remarry. The woman filed a petition in the Family Court which referred the matter to Lok Adalat. During the proceedings of the Lok Adalat held at CCC complex, the couple appeared and secured an order permitting their marriage. The issues relating to pensionary benefits of the husband and other legalities were finalised.

The woman earlier worked with ICICI Bank and quit the job eventually. “When she approached the bank authorities for return of her certificates which were reportedly in their custody, the latter claimed that they were lost,” the City Civil Court Legal Services Authority secretary K. Murali Mohan said. The woman filed a petition in a local court which was referred to Lok Adalat. City Civil Court chief judge and LSA chairperson C. Sumalatha took the initiative to ensure that justice was rendered to the woman who filed a petition in court seeking Rs. 25 lakh compensation. Eventually, the bank authorities agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 1.15 lakh during the consultations and presented a cheque for that sum to the woman.

11 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KCR, Jagan playing with people’s emotions: MLA||Telangana Congress working president T Jayaprakash Reddy has alleged that Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Jaganmohan Reddy are playing with the emotions of people on Krishna water projects and advised them not to create a wedge among people. At a press conference here, he said K. Chandrasekhar Rao was trying to rake up emotive issues like he did during the Telangana movement for his political benefit though he had failed in solving the issue despite ruling the State for the last seven years. Ministers on both sides were adding fuel to the fire with irresponsible statements rather than sit and find a solution. This was also being done to divert people’s attention from unemployment and downslide in the economy due to Coronavirus. TTD refusal Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy also objected to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) officials’ refusal to recognise the recommendation letters of people’s representatives from Telangana. He said officials working in such revered positions should not create bad blood between people. Lord Venkateswara doesn’t differentiate between His devotees and officials should continue with the existing system, he said and urged both CMs to intervene. Stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was behind Sharmila launching a party in Telangana, he said this drama should end. Though she was the daughter-in-law of Telangana, she hailed from Rayalaseema and people would not accept her. Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy’s silence on her entry actually reflected BJP’s role, he said and reminded that the Andhara Pradesh Chief Minister never opened his mouth against the BJP. He was silent when the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was being privatised and lakhs of Telugu people were opposing the move.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-jagan-playing-with-peoples-emotions-mla/article35260886.ece

11 July 2021||Chandigarh,||BJP expels Punjab ex-Minister for 6 years for ‘anti-party’ acts||The Punjab BJP on Saturday expelled former State Minister Anil Joshi from the party for six years. The action against Mr. Joshi came after he gave his reply to a show-cause notice issued by the BJP’s State unit for his “anti-party” activities. According to the notice, Mr. Joshi had been making statements against the Centre, the party’s central leadership and policies. Mr. Joshi was expelled on the directions of State unit chief Ashwani Sharma, according to a party statement. Mr. Joshi did not give up his stubborn attitude of going against the party, whereupon State BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, on the recommendations of a disciplinary committee, expelled him from the party for six years, the statement said. Earlier, in a two-page reply to the show-cause notice, Mr. Joshi said he never spoke against the Centre’s farm laws and asked the State party chief if it was indiscipline to talk about farmers. The former Amritsar North MLA asserted that he always spoke about the party’s interests. “I neither spoke against the Centre’s farm laws nor against the Central leaders,” Mr. Joshi replied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-expels-punjab-ex-minister-for-6-years-for-anti-party-acts/article35260755.ece
11 July 2021||Mumbai,||Gokul to hike milk prices in Maharashtra from today||The Kolhapur District Co-operative Milk Producers Union, which owns Gokul, the largest-selling milk brand in Maharashtra, on Saturday announced a hike in prices in the State, except in Kolhapur, Sangli and Konkan, from Sunday. Minister of State for Home and Kolhapur district Guardian Minister Satej Patil said, “As promised during the election of the Kolhapur District Cooperative Milk Producers Union, we have decided to increase the procurement price by Rs. 2 for buffalo milk and Rs. 1 for cow milk. We collect 12 lakh litres of milk every day across the State, so the decision will benefit farmers. Except for Kolhapur, Sangli and Konkan division, there will be a hike in the selling price of milk.” Gokul is also aiming to increase the daily collection of milk to 20 lakh litres from the current eight lakh litres. “The collection will be increased by two lakh litres every year to achieve this target,” said Mr. Patil, who is also the head of the Kolhapur District Co-operative Milk Producers Union. The decisions taken by the new board, formed after the election, included signing a memorandum of understanding with State milk marketing agency, Mahanand for sale in Mumbai. This would reduce packing expenditure and save Rs. 18.80 lakh per year, the minister said, adding that overall, with slashing of various expenses, Rs. 13 crore would be saved annually. “Gokul has also set up a captive plant which will start generating medical oxygen, needed for the treatment of coronavirus patients, from July 25,” Mr. Patil said. It is giving financial aid of up to Rs. 1,000 crore to farmers to purchase buffaloes of Murha, Jafarabadi and Pandharpuri breeds which produce more milk, he added. “This decision to hike milk prices is due to an increase in the milk procurement price by Rs. 2 and Rs. 1 for buffalo and cow milk, respectively,” Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gokul-to-hike-milk-prices-in-maharashtra-from-today/article35260714.ece

11 July 2021||Navi Mumbai,||APMC traders to strike against Centre’s ordinance on July 16||Over 2,000 grain and spice traders at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Navi Mumbai will hold a protest on July 16 over the Centre’s new ordinance on stocking of pulses. Bhimji Bhanushali, secretary, Grain, Rice and Oilseeds Merchants’ Association, said, “The ordinance sets a limit on storage of pulses. Retail traders cannot stock more than five tonnes, and wholesale traders cannot exceed 200 tonnes.” He said the rise in prices of pulses had irked customers, and to check it, the government has decided to increase imports and restrict storage. Mr. Bhanushali said, “APMCs in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh have decided to shut shop indefinitely as a mark of protest. Market committees in Akola, Latur, and Amravati, where large transactions of pulses take place, will also join the protest. At a virtual meeting with the Federation of Association of Traders, it was unanimously decided to hold a State-wide strike on July 16, instead of an indefinite bandh.” Traders said the ordinance could result in the prices of pulses doubling from Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 and farmers facing losses as well. “The prices are 10% to 20% less than the minimum support price now, but the government has decided to limit the stocking of pulses for the benefit of the corporate sector,” Mr. Bhanushali said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/apmc-traders-to-strike-against-centres-ordinance-on-july-16/article35260715.ece
11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘There is breakdown of governance in U.P.’||A group of retired civil servants have written an open letter to raise concerns over what they termed was the “breakdown of governance” and “blatant violation of the rule of law” in Uttar Pradesh. The letter, signed by 87 members of the Constitutional Conduct Group and endorsed by 236 others, including Justice (retired) A.P. Shah, activists and academics, stated: “We note with mounting alarm that the present ruling regime in U.P. has ushered in a model of governance which swerves further and further away from the values of the Constitution and the rule of law with each passing day.” The letter stated that detentions, criminal charges, and recoveries were commonly used against those who exercised their right to protest. It added that the case of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who was arrested while on his way to report on the case of gang rape of a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras, was particularly egregious. The letter highlighted the number of encounter killings from 2017 to 2020 and termed “encounter injuries and killings as official hate targeting”. “From 2017 to 2020, 124 alleged criminals were shot dead in 6,476 “encounters”, according to data compiled and released by the U.P. police to the media. The word “encounters” has been used to also include the infliction of serious injuries caused, for example, by shooting a person in both knees and leaving him disabled for life,” the letter said, adding that Muslims, Dalits and other backward castes were killed predominantly. The letter also flagged the State’s handling of COVID-19 during the second wave, in which sights of “dead bodies floating in the Ganga” were seen. “The world bore witness to the catastrophe that the people of U.P. had to endure owing to the failure of the government to act in time. Reports from crematoria show that across districts, deaths are being massively undercounted in Uttar Pradesh,” it said. The group called for an end to arbitrary detentions and torture as well as the policies of institutionalisation and legitimisation of vigilantism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/there-is-breakdown-of-governance-in-up/article35260756.ece
11 July 2021||New Delhi,||AAP and BJP trade barbs over inquiry report on ‘DTC scam’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Delhi BJP locked horns on Saturday over a report by a committee constituted by Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal to investigate alleged irregularities in the procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the BJP had lost face yet again after levelling allegations of corruption to the tune of Rs. 5,000 crore against the Delhi government “continuously for the last three months”. Former Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly and BJP Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta, who filed the complaint that led to the formation of the committee, shared portions of the findings on social media. He added that the panel’s recommendation of cancelling the maintenance tender worth Rs. 3,500 crore and issuing a fresh one in its place proved that a scam had taken place. “The investigation committee of the BJP-led Central government has not been able to find any flaws or irregularities in the purchase of buses. The report of the inquiry committee has made it clear that the government led by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi is honest and the Delhi BJP leaders in the opposition are trying to malign the image of the government,” Mr. Sisodia said. “The Delhi government is working day and night for the people but instead of learning from it, BJP leaders are spreading hatred and lies. They are stopping the good work in public interest. BJP leaders should be ashamed and they should come in front of the public to apologise,” he added. BJP demands resignation The BJP, however, demanded a probe by the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) in the alleged Rs. 5,000-crore ‘DTC bus scam’ and also sought the resignation of Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot and the removal of the responsible Transport Department officials. Mr. Gupta said there were only two companies which came forward with regard to bus purchase. The Delhi government also decided that the companies can bid for bus maintenance as well. “It is now evident the same two companies supplying buses will also get the maintenance job which would be worth Rs. 3,500 crore. In this way, the government in the name of buses purchase and their maintenance has committed fraud worth Rs. 5000 crore. The ACB must be allowed to probe the case,” he said. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the opposition had “caught the government in the middle of doing a great wrong”. “As DTC has its own depots, workshops and employees, why keep an outside agency for maintenance? Now, even the committee report is saying the tender of Rs. 3,500 crore for maintenance should be issued afresh,” Mr. Bidhuri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-and-bjp-trade-barbs-over-inquiry-report-on-dtc-scam/article35260751.ece
11 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘Haryana solely responsible for water crisis hovering over Delhi’||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Vice Chairman Raghav Chadha on Saturday alleged that the Haryana government was “solely responsible” for the water crisis hovering over Delhi. Haryana’s “careless and apathetic” behavior may lead to water scarcity in New Delhi Municipal Council and VIP areas including the PM’s residence, the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and major ministries. Water supply in parts of central, west, and south Delhi will also be affected, he warned. Mr. Chadha said the Haryana government had stopped water that is released into the Yamuna for Delhi’s needs and was providing 120 MGD less, which had decreased production of water in Delhi by 100 MGD. Water production at the Chandrawal WTP has come down from 90 MGD to 55, at Wazirabad WTP from 135 to 80 MGD and at Okhla WTP from 20 to 15 MGD, he said. The daily water production in Delhi had come down from 245 MGD to 150-145 MGD, despite the Upper Yamuna River Board having directed Haryana to provide an additional 150 cusecs of water, he added. “It is the legal responsibility of the Haryana government to provide water to Delhi as per Supreme Court orders and the Memorandum of Understanding,” Mr. Chadha said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, citing data regarding water supply received from Haryana, accused Mr. Chadha of lying and contended that the Hayrana government had not stopped the supply of water to the Capital. Earlier in the day, North East Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari held a ‘water panchayat’ in north Delhi’s Malkaganj where, the BJP claimed, residents were facing grave water shortage for the last three months. “The Haiderpur plant received 235.16 MGD daily in 2021 compared to 233 MGD in 2020 from Haryana. Bawana in 2021 received 20.99 MGD, up from 19.61 MGD in 2020. Nangloi 43.26, up from 43.10 MGD. Dwarka 51.33 MGD, up from 50.51 MGD,” Mr. Khurana added. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said if the BJP-led Haryana government does not release Delhi’s rightful portion of water in 24 hours, the connection of water supply to Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta’s residence would be stopped. “The people of Delhi have decided that they can give 24 hours to BJP to restart and supply water which is their staunch right. If this does not happen, we shall stop the connection of water supply in Delhi BJP’s Chief Adesh Gupta’s house,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Mr. Bhardwaj’s statements were a “melodramatic reaction” to cover the Delhi government’s “failure to provide proper water supply”. “In fact the threat to cut Mr. Gupta’s water connection seems to have been copied by AAP from BJP’s recent statement that if the Delhi Jal Board fails to restore proper water supply we will cut the supply to the house of the Jal Board Chairman,” Mr. Kapoor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-solely-responsible-for-water-crisis-hovering-over-delhi/article35260753.ece

11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||One held after police bust factory manufacturing duplicate bike tyres||Delhi Police on Saturday said that a factory manufacturing duplicate tyres of a brand has been busted in Outer North Delhi’s Siraspur village. The accused has been arrested, they said. DCP (Outer North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that the accused has been identified as Mohammed Akram (41), a resident of Azad Market. The police said that one Neeraj Kumar approached the police and complained that a factory in Siraspur was manufacturing duplicate two-wheeler tubes of a brand. A team raided the factory where a huge quantity of duplicate tyres were found along with packaging material and dyes. Akram was then arrested. Mr. Ranjan said that during interrogation, Akram told the police that he had been in the business of trading of two-wheeler and four-wheeler tubes and his brother Sultan had a shop in tyre market in the Capital. After demolition of the market, Akram started his own manufacturing unit in a rented godown in Khera village but finally switched to the present location. Akram revealed that he used to sell the duplicate products under a fake brand name in Delhi-NCR,” Mr. Ranjan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/one-held-after-police-bust-factory-manufacturing-duplicate-bike-tyres/article35260748.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said the owners of the call centre, Ramkumar (34), Shyam Kumar (35) and Govind (22), all residents of Sultanpuri, are in custody. The police received information on Friday regarding a fake call centre operating in Sector 7, Rohini. The accused allegedly duped people on the pretext of offering them mobiles at cheap rates through a lottery scheme. “Police raided the call centre and nabbed the accused. During inquiry, it was revealed that most of the victims belonged to northeastern States,” Mr. Tayal said. Talking about the modus operandi, Mr. Tayal said the accused used to collect mobile numbers from the Internet and randomly made calls They used to tell people that their number had been selected for a lottery scheme in which they could get a mobile phone worth Rs. 17,000 on payment of just Rs. 4,500. In order to gain the customers’ trust, they used the post office as the logistics service provider. “However, instead of sending mobiles, they would send cheap wallets, belt and soaps,” the officer said. Police have also raided the warehouse where the accused allegedly kept the articles and found packets that were ready to be delivered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fake-call-centre-busted-in-rohini-24-arrested/article35260749.ece

11 July 2021||Kabul,||Afghanistan to rush troops to border||Afghan authorities prepared on Saturday to try to retake a key border crossing seized by the Taliban in a sweeping offensive that the insurgents claim has helped capture a vast swath of the violence-wracked nation. As U.S. troops continued their withdrawal, the Taliban said its fighters had seized two crossings in western Afghanistan — completing an arc of territory from the Iranian border to the frontier with China. It now held 85% of the country, a Taliban official said on Friday, controlling about 250 of Afghanistan's nearly 400 districts — a claim impossible to independently verify, and disputed by the government. On Friday Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP their fighters had captured the border town of Islam Qala on the Iranian frontier and the Torghundi crossing with Turkmenistan. Herat Governor spokesman Jilani Farhad said on Saturday the authorities were deploying fresh troops to retake Islam Qala post, the biggest trade crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. “They will be sent there soon,” he said. The Afghan government has repeatedly dismissed the Taliban's gains as having little strategic value, but the seizure of multiple border crossings and the taxes they generate will likely fill the group’ coffers with new revenue. In a clear sign fighting was getting closer to major urban centres, an official at one hospital in Kandahar — the country's second-largest city and the birthplace of the Taliban — said on Saturday dozens of wounded had been admitted in the past 24 hours, including at least 15 service members. With the Taliban having routed much of northern Afghanistan in recent weeks, the government holds little more than a constellation of provincial capitals that must largely be reinforced and resupplied by air. Severe strain The air force was under severe strain even before the Taliban’s lightning offensive overwhelmed the government's northern and western positions, putting further pressure on the country's limited aircraft and pilots. On Thursday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. military mission would end on August 31. Afghan commandos clashed with the insurgents this week in a provincial capital for the first time, with thousands of people fleeing Qala-i-Naw in northwest Badghis province. On Friday, the Afghan Defence Ministry said government forces had “full control” of the city, but a local official said on Saturday the insurgents had attacked again during the night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghanistan-to-rush-troops-to-border/article35260205.ece
11 July 2021||Beijing,||China evacuates citizens from Afghanistan||China evacuated 210 nationals from Afghanistan as U.S. troops stepped up their withdrawal from the war-torn nation, the airline that carried out the emergency chartered flight said. A Xiamen Airlines flight departed the capital Kabul for the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, on July 2 carrying Chinese citizens who had been stranded in Afghanistan, it said in a Thursday social media post. Among them were 22 people who were later confirmed to be infected with coronavirus, despite the airline taking “top-notch epidemic prevention measures” during the flight and upon landing, it added. COVID patients The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that recent returnees included coronavirus patients and called on all nationals to leave Afghanistan, without revealing further specifics of the evacuation flight. “In order to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Afghanistan, the Chinese government has reminded citizens in Afghanistan to leave the country as soon as possible and provided necessary assistance,” its Consular Affairs Department said in a Wednesday social media post. Chinese health authorities reported 25 new imported coronavirus cases in Hubei province on Wednesday, 22 of which were from the Kabul flight. The flight was organised by the Chinese government, reported the state media tabloid Global Times . In recent weeks, Beijing has harshly criticised what it sees as a hasty and chaotic withdrawal by Washington. “The U.S. disregards its responsibilities and duties and withdraws troops from Afghanistan hastily, dumping the mess and war on the Afghan people and countries in the region,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a routine briefing Friday. “The U.S., as the original culprit of the Afghan issue, bears unavoidable responsibility for the current situation in Afghanistan.” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is set to discuss the deteriorating Afghan security situation with counterparts from Russia, India, Pakistan and numerous Central Asian countries at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation next week. The evacuation flight was hailed as a patriotic victory by Chinese social media users, with related trending hashtags gaining more than 300 million views on Weibo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-evacuates-citizens-from-afghanistan/article35260203.ece
11 July 2021||Port-au-Prince,||Haiti asks U.S., UN for troops as fears of instability grow||Haiti has asked Washington and the UN for troops to secure its ports, airport and other strategic sites after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise opened a power vacuum in the crisis-hit Caribbean nation, an official said Friday. The U.S. has already said it will send FBI and other agents to Port-au-Prince, two days after Moise was shot dead in his home. In the wake of the slaying “we thought that mercenaries could destroy some infrastructure to create chaos ... During a conversation with the U.S. secretary of state and the UN we made this request,” Elections Minister Mathias Pierre told AFP . The U.S. State Department and Pentagon both confirmed receiving a request for “security and investigative assistance” and said officials remain in contact with Port-au-Prince, but did not specify whether military troops would be deployed. The UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A UN diplomatic source had earlier indicated that a Security Council resolution was needed to do as the Haitians had asked. Washington had already signaled its willingness to help the Haitian investigation, and White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki added Friday that senior FBI and other officials would be heading to the Caribbean as soon as possible. The development came as questions swirled about who could have masterminded the audacious assassination, with most members of a hit squad of Colombians and Americans either dead or in custody, and no clear motive made public. Amid the uncertainty, three men are being touted as potential leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/haiti-asks-us-un-for-troops-as-fears-of-instability-grow/article35260207.ece

Dr. Mohamed Nur at the Medina Hospital told reporters that the toll reflected only the dead and wounded who were taken to the facility in Mogadishu where he works. “I am sure the number is bigger as some of the victims were rushed to other hospitals, such as the privately owned ones,” he said. The al-Shabab extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack. A Somali police spokesman said Mogadishu’s Police Commissioner, Col. Farhan Mohamud Qaroleh, was the target of the attack but he was safe. “A suicide car bomber with heavy explosives plotted by the terrorist group al-Shabab has targeted the Mogadishu police commissioner,” police spokesman Sadiq Adam Ali said. It was the second such large explosion in the city this month. A blast targeting a teashop killed at least 10 people last week. Last month, a suicide bomb attack at a military base in Mogadishu killed at least 15 people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/9-killed-in-extremist-attack-in-somalias-capital-8-injured/article35260214.ece
11 July 2021||Charlottesville,||U.S. city removes two Confederate statues||The southern U.S. city of Charlottesville on Saturday took down two statues honoring Civil War generals for the pro-slavery Confederacy which had become the focus of protests, including a deadly 2017 rally of white supremacists. The statues of generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson are among hundreds of Confederate monuments in the United States now widely considered symbols of racism, even if their supporters argue they are a historical legacy. Workers in the Virginia city used a crane to remove the statues — which depicted the men in uniform mounted on horses — as a crowd watched and cheered. No clashes were immediately reported. Mayor’s statement “Taking down this statue is one small step closer to the goal of helping Charlottesville, Virginia, and America, grapple with the sin of being willing to destroy Black people for economic gain,” Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker, who is African-American, told reporters before the monuments’ removal. Tensions over the fate of the Lee statue led to violence in August 2017, when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of demonstrators in Charlottesville, killing a woman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-city-removes-two-confederate-statues/article35260542.ece
11 July 2021||Kano,||Bandits kill 35 villagers in northwest Nigeria||Armed raiders killed at least 35 people in five villages in northwest Nigeria’s Zamfara State, police said on Saturday, in the latest deadly attack to hit the violence-torn region. “Thirty-five people were killed by the bandits in the five villages,” State police spokesman Mohammed Shehu told AFP . Motorcycle-riding gunmen launched coordinated attacks on remote villages of Gidan Adamu, Tsauni, Gidan Baushi, Gidan Maidawa and Wari in Maradun district, shooting residents and burning homes. “The attackers left before security teams arrived because the area is hard to reach due to bad roads,” Mr. Shehu said. But residents said 43 people were killed and seven injured in the attack late on Thursday. “We found a total of 43 bodies from the villages along with seven people with injuries,” resident Danladi Sabo told AFP . He said those killed were buried on Friday while the injured were taken to hospital in Gusau, the State capital.

Before his arrest, Mr. Hashem had told The Daily Star newspaper the fire “may have been a result of workers’ carelessness” and a discarded cigarette could have sparked the carnage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bangladesh-factory-owner-held-after-fire-kills-52/article35260210.ece

11 July 2021||Chennai,||Services panel charts roadmap to double exports in five years||The Services Export Promotion Council (SEPC) is preparing a roadmap to achieve doubling of services exports in the next five years, said Chairman Maneck E. Davar. Separately, the SEPC has urged the government to ensure that the new foreign trade policy, being formulated, also includes incentives for services exports by according parity to the sector with merchandise exports, he said. The current trade policy, whose validity was to have ended in March 2020, has been extended till September this year. The council has tagged areas such as tourism and hospitality, logistics and medical value travel as ‘champion’ sectors meriting additional focus. “Take the example of Netflix, which recently announced plans for a studio with post-production facilities in India; if we wish to attract other companies to set up such facilities for entertainment technology across the country over the next five years, we have to understand what they need — in terms of infrastructure and human skills,” said Mr. Davar. “In education services, we had some 45,000-odd foreign students in FY19-20. We could aim to double that within 3-5 years.” ‘Vital part of economy’ Stressing the need for policy backing, Mr. Davar said, “The perception is that services don't require any support or incentives from the government, which is not correct. Services form a very vital part of our economy.” Acknowledging that manufacturing faced a very competitive environment globally and therefore required support, he said the SEPC was only seeking a ‘level playing field’ for services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/services-panel-charts-roadmap-to-double-exports-in-five-years/article35260566.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Water market gaining traction in India, abroad’||Chennai-based Va Tech Wabag Ltd., a pure-play water technology multinational firm that offers a portfolio of solutions across water and wastewater treatment, braved the COVID-19 pandemic and posted double-digit growth last fiscal. MD Rajiv Mittal discusses how the firm secured an order book of Rs. 9,500 crore. Excerpts.  How did you manage to stay afloat during the second wave of the pandemic? As you would have seen last year, in spite of a very strict lockdown, we closed the year on a positive note with a double-digit growth on top line and bottom line. During this time, our engineering and procurement functions were working at full capacity, even while operating from home, ensuring business continuity. In recent times, there have been lockdowns in India in various States. However, we transitioned to the new normal to ensure minimum disruption, carrying forward the lessons we learnt from the first wave. At our construction sites, we ensured provision of all basic essentials, regularly sanitised accommodation and ensured adherence to COVID safety norms for our workforce for continuity of construction with minimal disruption. Being an essential service provider, our operations and maintenance (O&M) sites were operating at full capacity to ensure safe and clean drinking water and sanitation to help people stay at home safely during the pandemic. Tell us about your performance in Q1 of FY22? By and large, we are ensuring operational continuity at our O&M sites, as water and sanitation falls under essential service. As far as engineering, procurement and construction sites are concerned, we are ensuring operations in our construction sites with minimal disruption. However, we are hopeful that our Q1 performance would be better compared with the corresponding period last year. How do you foresee the rest of the fiscal year 2021-22? Right now, we are having a strong order book and a good cash position will help us in speeding up execution. Going forward, we foresee the water market gaining traction, both in India and overseas. We will be focussing on further strengthening our order book, especially targeting the high technology jobs, which is an area of expertise for Wabag. What is your order book value and how did you manage to get it? Currently, we have an order book of Rs. 9,500 crore. Our excellent order book gives us a revenue visibility of 3x. Some large-scale orders contributing to this order book are O&M contracts of Agra and Ghaziabad under One City, One Operator model, our hybrid annuity model (HAM) projects in Kolkata and Patna, our Jeddah Airport 2 sewage treatment plant in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Ipswich Biel water treatment plant in Switzerland. What is the capex for the current year and revenue outlook for FY22? We have always been an asset light organisation and the same will be our focus going forward. Even for our HAM projects, we have partnered with financial partners who will be investing in debt and equity, and we will only be investing a small portion of the total project cost. As the situation over the last two years has been uncertain owing to the pandemic, we have refrained from giving a guidance. We are confident that Wabag will continue to grow, as in the past. What are some of the key projects the company has implemented in Tamil Nadu? Kodungaiyur Power-Neutral WWTP, Chennai, the first waste water treatment plant in India to complete 1,10,000 hours on a single gas engine; Nemmeli desalination plant, the largest municipal desalination plant in India; and Koyambedu water reuse plant – recycling secondary treated water up to potable standards for industrial use in SIPCOT industrial areas across Oragadam, Sriperumbudur and Irungattukottai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/water-market-gaining-traction-in-india-abroad/article35260568.ece

Since the time it went fully digital in 2016, Sodexo had introduced an array of digital solutions for employee benefits such as meals, fuel, telecom, learning and development, health and wellness through its multi-benefits pass. “Digital cards and digitisation have helped clients navigate crises in the last one year,” Mr. Sarkar said. “Our solutions are trusted by over 11,000 clients across public and private companies and that reinforces our vision to design solutions that improve everyday quality of life of our clients, consumers and merchants,” the CEO asserted. In calendar 2020, the company had ensured complete continuity of operations. “This can be attributed to the fully-digital business model and delivery of digital cards during the pandemic,” he said. “The business continued to stay resilient due to all four stakeholders, namely employees, clients, consumers, and merchants, going fully digital and adapting rapidly to the changing times,” Mr. Sarkar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/digital-cards-helped-our-clients-in-crises-sodexo/article35260564.ece

11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Olympic team to leave for Tokyo on July 16||Indian shooters, training in Croatia and Italy, are scheduled to leave for Tokyo on July 16, for the Olympic Games. The 13 rifle and pistol shooters, training in Zagreb, will leave with the coaches and a physio. The two skeet shooters — Mairaj Ahmad Khan and Angad Vir Singh Bajwa, along with coach Mansher Singh — training in Italy, will leave from Rome on the same day. The entire shooting team will meet in Amsterdam to board the flight which will take the team to Tokyo on July 17. The rifle and pistol shooters will have coaches Suma Shirur, Deepali Deshpande, Oleg Mikhailov, Samaresh Jung, Ronak Pandit travelling with them. It is understood that accreditation procedures are being worked out for coaches Pavel Smirnov and Jaspal Rana. Both Jaspal and Mansher joined the teams recently, and had spent time in isolation, according to the prescribed protocol. Even though the entire team has been vaccinated for the coronavirus, the organisers do not insist on the same. They have an uniform testing procedure for all the athletes and officials arriving for the Games in Tokyo. In fact, the testing protocol and the health study starts a week or two before they board the flight to Tokyo. The IOC president Thomas Bach who reached Tokyo recently is scheduled to be on three days isolation, which goes to show that the Olympic family is being treated on par with everyone, as far as the sensitive COVID-19 situation is concerned. The athletes and officials have a 70-page instruction playbook to follow. Every team will have a COVID-19 liaison officer to specifically take care of testing and medical procedures related to it. The athletes will be tested every day. The organisers have clearly said to anyone with COVID-19 symptoms in the 14 days prior to the departure for the Games, “Don’t travel to Tokyo”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/olympic-team-to-leave-for-tokyo-on-july-16/article35260631.ece
11 July 2021||LONDON,||Barty lives a dream, scripts history||Ashleigh Barty became the first Australian woman to win the singles trophy at Wimbledon since Evonne Goolagong in 1980, beating Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-3 on Saturday. This was her second Slam overall, after French Open 2019. Inspired by Goolagong, she wore an outfit at Wimbledon that was a tribute to the dress her mentor wore when she won the tournament for the first time in 1971. Fittingly, in her victory speech, a teary eyed Barty said, “I hope I made Evonne proud.” She was off to a perfect start on Saturday, collecting the first 14 points and racing to a 3-0 lead, before holding off a comeback from Pliskova to take the set. She returned Pliskova’s speedy serves — the ones that produced a tournament-high 54 aces entering Saturday — without any trouble, hit winners with her heavy topspin forehand and set up others with her sliced backhands. She threw in an ace or two of her own, and actually finished with more than Pliskova, 7-6. The key stat by the finish probably was this: Barty won 22 of 31 points that lasted nine strokes or more. She was at her best in the second set too even as Pliskova finally got the measure of her strokes. But Barty wobbled while serving for the championship at 6-5, sending consecutive forehands long to get broken. The ensuing tie-breaker was shaky, which she ceded to the Czech with a double fault. In the third, though, Barty went up an early break, and stayed the course. After a shaky second set, she had managed to get back to the steadier version of herself and didn’t flinch even when she had to stare down a break point while serving at 5-3. A missed backhand by Pliskova removed that threat, and Barty then delivered a 108mph ace. One last backhand miss from Pliskova ended the match, and Barty crouched at the baseline and covered her face with her arm.   1 Barty is the first women's top seed to win Wimbledon since Serena Williams in 2016 and the first to win any Major since Halep at 2018 French Open  4 The Aussie is the fourth junior Wimbledon champion to lift the senior title (2011 & 2021), joining Ann Jones (1956 & 1969), Hingis (1994 & 1997) and Mauresmo (1996 & 2006)  6 Barty is the sixth woman in the Open Era to win her first two Major titles at the French Open and Wimbledon, after Goolagong, Evert, Graf, Muguruza and Halep  6 Pliskova, who lost her second Major final, was broken six times by Barty, including thrice in the first set. In the six matches before this, she had been broken only four times  35 The final was Barty's 35th Tour win this year, the most for any women's player||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barty-lives-a-dream-scripts-history/article35260198.ece

Batra was informed of the inconveniences athletes from other countries faced on landing in Tokyo by the Indian Chef de Mission on Friday. He has raised the issue with the Games’ organisers. In a statement, Batra said it had been brought to his notice that athletes arriving at the Narita airport had to wait nearly four hours for the immigration process to begin. No food or water This was followed by another three hours of waiting for transport. No food or water was provided during this time. Also, according to the German contingent, volunteer services were almost non-existent, he said. The first batch of Indian athletes is set to depart for Tokyo on July 17. Meanwhile, the organising committee has assured delegates that all issues are being addressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/batra-flags-fresh-concerns/article35260577.ece
11 July 2021||Northampton,||Sciver sizzles, sets up England’s victory||England defeated India by 18 runs via the DLS method in the rain-curtailed first T20I here on Friday. All-rounder Nat Sciver’s 27-ball 55, that included eight fours and a six, and wicketkeeper Amy Jones' 43 off 27 balls took England to 177 for seven in 20 overs. Sciver's sensational fifty was England's joint fastest in the format. In reply, India failed to keep up with the required run-rate despite vice-captain Smriti Mandhana's quickfire 29 off 17 balls. Rain came down with the visitors at 54 for three in 8.4 overs, 18 runs behind England under the DLS method. England now leads the three-match series 1-0 and 8-4 in the multi-format points system having lifted the ODI trophy. Chasing 178, India was off to the worst possible start as pacer Katherine Brunt bamboozled the big-hitting Shafali Verma for a duck. Smriti and Harleen Deol (17 not out) then got the tourists back on track. With rain on the cards, the duo quickly stitched a 44-run partnership with Smriti hitting six boundaries, including successive fours off Brunt. But Sciver struck, getting rid of Smriti in the sixth over. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur's (1) prolonged lean patch continued, falling to Sarah Glenn in the very next over. The quick loss of the skipper's wicket cost the Indians dear as they were well behind in the DLS calculation. Earlier, veteran pacer Shikha Pandey (3/22) snared three wickets while spinners Poonam Yadav (1/32) and Radha Yadav (1/33) chipped in. Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt gave England a solid start, collecting 48 runs in the PowerPlay. After skipper Heather Knight's departure, Sciver and Jones kept the momentum going with a 78-run stand. Harmanpreet and Harleen pulled off splendid catches in the penultimate over as Shikha struck thrice, getting rid of Sciver, Jones and Sophia Dunkley.  The scores:   England 177/7 in 20 overs (Danni Wyatt 31, Nat Sciver 55, Amy Jones 43, Shikha Pandey 3/22) bt India 54/3 in 8.4 overs (Smriti Mandhana 29). England won by 18 runs via DLS method.

11 July 2021||London,||Djokovic eyes Slam No. 20, Berrettini his first||The man standing between Novak Djokovic and a record-tying 20th Grand Slam title, Matteo Berrettini, remembers being wowed by Wimbledon when he played in the junior event as a teenager. “For me, it was just absurd. I asked myself, ‘Who knows if one day I'll return and play in the main tournament, even just in qualifying? I have no idea.’ And now I'm in the final,” he said, then laughed at the thought of it all. "So it’s all a bit strange," continued the barrel-chested, big-hitting Berrettini, now 25. “But what’s beautiful is that I’m much more aware of what I can do now. I know I can do this, because I'm here.” That he is. On Sunday at the All England Club, the No. 1-seeded Djokovic's 30th Major final will be No. 7 seed Berrettini’s first — and the first for any man from Italy since Adriano Panatta won the 1976 French Open. It will also be the first men's final at Wimbledon with a woman chair umpire — Marija Cicak. Djokovic recalled what it felt like to play in a Slam final for the first time. He was 20 and lost to Roger Federer in three tight sets, including two tiebreakers, at the 2007 US Open. “I was just so thrilled to be in the final,” Djokovic said. “I was close. I had a good match against Roger, but I just probably did not, maybe, believe enough, I guess, in the victory at certain moments when the scoreline was close.” Self-confidence is not an issue for Djokovic these days, however. He's won his past 18 sets, every one since dropping his first of the fortnight. He's won his last 20 matches at Wimbledon, dating to the start of the 2018 tournament. Can the Italian end that streak? Sunday will tell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-eyes-slam-no-20-berrettini-his-first/article35260193.ece

11 July 2021||London,||From the ‘hated one’ to the star of Euro||Raheem Sterling will complete a remarkable journey from vilified scapegoat to England legend if the forward inspires his side to victory in Sunday’s Euro 2020 final against Italy. Sterling has been England’s most influential player during its memorable run. If England is to make history at Wembley this weekend, it needs Sterling to unleash his pace and trickery on the Italians. When Sterling started England’s first group game against Croatia, there were some who claimed it was a mistake to pick him instead of Jack Grealish. But Southgate is a firm believer in Sterling’s “incredible resilience and hunger” and the forward rose to the occasion with England’s winner against Croatia. It was his first goal in a major tournament after some wretched experiences in the international arena. His lowest ebb came at Euro 2016 when England fans turned on him after a series of lacklustre performances, culminating in the humiliating exit against Iceland. On social media, Sterling branded himself the “hated one” during that tournament and he had to deal with negative stories in the press about his perceived lavish lifestyle. The backlash could have ruined someone with a more fragile personality, but Sterling’s tough upbringing prepared him for football’s slings and arrows.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/from-the-hated-one-to-the-star-of-euro/article35260195.ece

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A watershed moment||A year-and-a-half ago, Sajan Prakash, 27, thought he would not make it to the Tokyo Olympics. The swimmer suffered a slipped disc, which also hurt his neck. As he recovered, the pandemic forced pools to close in Thailand, where he was training at Thanyapura Aquatic Centre in Phuket on a scholarship. Confined to his hostel, he contemplated returning to India. But the situation here was worse. Then, last August, a reprieve came in the form of a 50-day camp in Dubai organised for top Indian swimmers with national coach Pradeep Kumar. After the camp, Sajan was in a quandary again. He wanted to stay back in Dubai, but that was going to be expensive. That is when coach Pradeep and his wife, Gowri, came to Sajan’s rescue. The couple invited him to stay with them in Dubai and ensured he got better in the pool. On June 26, Sajan clocked 1:56:38 seconds in the men’s 200-metre butterfly event at the Sette Colli Trophy in Rome. In doing so, he became the first Indian swimmer to make the Olympic Qualifying Time (also known as FINA ‘A’ cut), which ensures automatic qualification for the Olympics. Unable to make the ‘A’ cut hitherto, Indian swimmers had to count on the Olympic Selection Time (also known as ‘B’ time) or the universality quota — less certain ways — to get to the Olympics. Three days later, Sajan’s compatriot Srihari Nataraj, 20, joined him in securing the ‘A’ cut after his time of 53.77s in a 100-metre backstroke time trial in the Rome event was ratified by international swimming’s governing body, FINA. Srihari, like Sajan, had to overcome obstacles before breaching the qualifying mark. For over six months, he could not swim due to the lockdown. Then, this January, his father passed away. It took about seven months of relentless training to shave half a second off, which determined his entry to the Tokyo Games. An Olympic medal still remains a distant dream for Indian swimming. But Sajan and Srihari’s ‘A’ cuts could be a defining moment. Long way to go Ever since the 1951 Asian Games in which India won six swimming medals, including its only gold, there has been very little success. The country has added just three more medals at the Asian Games and one (in para-swimming) at the Commonwealth Games . In bigger meets — the World Aquatics Championships and the Olympics — qualification itself has been a big deal. Can the medal drought be attributed to genes? Sports science expert Genadijus Sokolovas, who has worked with the world’s top swimmers like Michael Phelps, says, “Genes matter very little. If this is about size, then, the fastest fish is not the biggest.” According to him, a swimmer’s success depends on their training, technique and motivation. The U.S. swimmers, he says, win medals because they have access to good coaches, excellent training facilities and a supportive ecosystem; not because they are superhumans. Srihari and Sajan say they are happy with the coaching and training facilities. India’s senior coaches Nihar Ameen and Pradeep are winners of the Dronacharya award (given to honour sports coaches in India) and have decades of experience. The top Indian swimmers had the chance to interact with Sokolovas in February during a six-day workshop organised by the Swimming Federation of India (SFI). They also have access to world-class facilities at the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence. “A lot more professionals are involved now. In our days, we never had dieticians, biomechanics experts and physiotherapists at our disposal,” says former Olympic swimmer Nisha Millet. Things seem to be improving for Indian swimmers at the elite level. The problem, Nisha points out, is at the grassroots. “Once you reach the top-level, you get support from the Government, federation and private institutions. But when you are lower down the rung, there is no one to guide you properly,” she says. Girls, for instance, have to deal with cultural taboo as some parents, Pradeep says, don’t want them to wear swimsuits after puberty. And, according to Nisha, they get fewer job opportunities through swimming than boys. These reasons probably explain why no Indian female swimmer since 2004 has made even the ‘B’ time; they have only gone to the Olympics via the universality quota. Coach Pradeep says the government, private institutions and clubs should promote swimming. The road ahead Srihari and Sajan’s ‘A’ cut is important because it has lifted a mental block among Indian swimmers. “We used to think ‘A’ cut was impossible. Now, two people have made it at the same event,” says Srihari. Pradeep believes this will trigger more ‘A’ cuts in the next Olympics. At the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, he says, India should aim for a podium finish. For these long-term goals to materialise, there is a lot to be done, says SFI’s general secretary Monal Chokshi. One of the immediate goals is to ensure each State has at least three swimming academies under the Khelo India programme. Indian swimming, he explains, follows a two-tier system. The top-tier swimmers have access to high-performance centres like the one in Bengaluru. The junior swimmers — about 130 (“a very small number” according to Chokshi) — are supposed to make use of the Khelo India academies. These academies, however, are not easily accessible. “Srihari’s 53.77 would have won him a medal 15-20 years ago,” says Sokolavas, “There will be a time, 10-20 years from now when Indian swimmers will be swimming faster than current world records. But we can try to do it much before that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-watershed-moment/article35260980.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Vignettes of the new normal: What remote work does for them||In November 2020, Vivek Lakshman M, his wife Abinaya A and their three-year-old son Rakshan Vivek were “billeted” at an independent house in Ganga Nagar, Kilipallam within Thiruvananthapuram city limits. The resident family at the address was being their host. Viveks’ stay turned out to be a fortuity for that family. The odds of the Viveks visiting them around the same period in 2019 were as high as a snowstorm in mid-summer Thar. Ditto for 2018, 2017 — in fact, that logic travels ad infinitum , in reverse chronological order. For some years before 2020 dawned, 34-year-old Vivek did know the family, but it took that unusual year to place the Viveks at Kilipallam at a fitting hour. Incidentally, that family constitutes Vivek’s in-laws — for those keen on precise details, his father-in-law Ananthan and mother-in-law Kumari. Working on the engineering side of the media industry and domiciled at an apartment complex in Pudupakkam on Old Mahabalipuram Road, Vivek had pulled up his stakes temporarily from Chennai to work from two locations down south, one on each side of the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. Now, around the time the Viveks landed in Kilipallam, there was also another visitor at Ganga Nagar — invisible and unbidden. It was the dreaded Coronavirus. “My mother-in-law is in the habit of walking on the verandah of their independent house, where construction work was under way at that time. There was more than the usual footfall. Having made an interstate travel, we were serving the mandatory 14-day quarantine period,” narrates Vivek. “Both my mother-in-law and father-in-law ran a temperature, and they later turned positive for the Coronavirus. All three of us were also infected, but ours were mild cases. In contrast, both my father-in-law and mother-in-law required hospitalisation. If we had not been at Kilipallam then, both of them would have brushed it aside as a regular flu, and not tested themselves for COVID-19. With a severe bout of pneumonia much earlier, my father-in-law’s lung capacity was already compromised. Lack of treatment for COVID-19 could have put him in a spot of trouble. For, he required to be in hospital for eight days. My mother-in-law was also hospitalised for the same set of days. Around that time, both tested negative and were back home.”  Off to Tirunelveli  In the earlier months of the pandemic, the Viveks settled down to remote work and social engagement, similarly on the other side of the border, at NGO A Colony within Tirunelveli city limits. This host-family at Tirunelveli consisted of Abinaya’s in-laws — father-in-law N Manoharan and mother-in-law Renuka Manoharan. The Viveks’ visit could not have come a day too soon. The Manoharans had slipped into a routine that was not doing much for their happiness. “Beyond the walks and television serials, my father and mother did not find anything outside of themselves to fascinate them,” points out Vivek. “The fact that their grandson Rakshan spent months on end with them brought a lot of zing back into their lives.” On the work front, Vivek was pleased as punch, as there were no connectivity issues to rant about. At Tirunelveli, he signed up for a BSNL broadband connection. “Within four days, they laid a fibre cable, created a junction point and gave the connection. At Kilpallam, I worked with mobile hotspot, and the 4G network delivered — 25 mbps — more than what I required to work comfortably.” The Manoharans gave their son a room all to himself to work in absolute privacy, disrupting it only fleetingly from time to time when the mom would drop in with a bowl of snacks. The opportunity to dote on the son, grandson and daughter-in-law was having a magical effect on the seniors. “My father served the railways working at Thalaiyuthu railway station in Tirunelveli, as a railway manager. Years after retirement, loneliness was gnawing at him. He was planning to move to Thiruvananthapuram where relatives are domiciled, particularly at Valliyur in Radhapuram taluk. However, our months-long stay at NGO A Colony has now led my father to consider dropping the relocation idea. Also with remote-working, my brother is with them now,” Vivek elaborates. The Viveks returned to Chennai for Rakshan’s pre-kg admission, primarily to attend to formalities that can be carried out only in propria persona.  With offices still continuing with remote work and schools still parked in cyberspace, the possibility of the Viveks making shorter sojourns — say, three-week stays in Tirunelveli and Thiruvananthapuram — is glowingly bright. Enriching experience Not just the seniors, the youngsters also feel enriched and energised by this experience. “Earlier, that odd weekend — usually arriving in two or three months — provided the only window for us to travel to our hometown. You would start on Friday evening and land there on Saturday morning and the rest of that day would be lost to travel fatigue. On Sunday, you would be fed at home till you burst at the seams. And of course, you would still be temped to try out the ‘special barotta ’ at Tirunelveli or the ‘border barotta ’ as it is called in Tenkasi. These barottas are a world apart.” Vivek continues: “The moment you land in Chennai, which would be around 9 a.m. on Monday, you have to wolf down whatever is available and be off to the office. In the end, it would hardly come across as a great weekend.” Vivek underlines that remote-working from Tirunelveli and Kilipallam meant Abinaya, who is a homemaker, had more time to herself and that Rakshan could be choosy about who he would play with.

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The Indian courser: On uncertain ground||When parents pop out of sight, an infant has trouble believing they have not disappeared forever. As its grow in days, the infant totters on to an understanding of “object permanence”, learning not to equate “popping out of sight” with “going out of existence”. The problem arises when infants that have grown into adults fail to unlearn the lesson of object permanence in certain situations. If something — and someone — keeps popping out of sight far too often, and pops back in only after a drearily long passage of time, it may actually be disappearing from the scene. Not with a bang, but with a series of inscrutable budges. Applying this logic to wildlife conservation, wildlife ecologists can sometimes get overly optimistic about a species’ resilience, believing it exists in the same encouraging numbers, ignoring growing evidence that it is checking out of many of its known habitats. Talking of a specific case, there is evidence that it is time to such shed misplaced optimism about the Indian courser ( cursorius coromandelicus ). The Indian courser is found across India in patches of suitable habitats. Though still described “widespread” and of “least concern”, the bird puts in rare appearances in many of its known habitats. In Chennai and surrounding districts, Indian courser’s occurrence data is patchy, being occasionally reported from lake beds (when they had become dry), the most notable example being Siruthavoor. With the Indian courser, ornithologist V. Santharam employs unminced language one wants to hear more often. “The Indian Courser is one of those species likely to become hugely uncommon and disappear in the next few decades. It has already become uncommon in many areas. Because, open areas are places people think should not be left open.” The Indian courser is viewed as a ground bird, because it largely sticks to terra firma even when it perceives a threat to its safety. Its “fleeing” behaviour shows this bird bets on its wings as well as its legs to carry it to safety — more on the latter. The Indian courser belongs to the category of birds that make short work of nest-building. The nest is just a scrape in the ground. Its preference for open, dry land is what puts the bird at a huge disadvantage. Because, it is just the kind of earth that turns the eyes of “development”, eyes that view fallow lands as waiting to be “put to good use”. “These birds like open lands, open dry river beds, lake beds and open stony dry country,” points out Santharam. “The Indian Courser is receding because it prefers open areas which are sparsely populated and less disturbed.” Field notes  On the subject of how the Indian courser is being squeezed out of its habitats, the ornithologist presents a snapshot of a pre-monsoonal Pallikaranai from the 1980s. “We have seen the species in Pallikaranai Marsh. Those days, you would be able to spot it right from the road (which would later go on to become the Pallavaram-Thoriapakkam 200-feet Radial Road.” The natural water-flow movement of the Marsh existing at that time provided a conducive environment for the Indian courser during certain months of the year. “In those days (just as now), the Pallikaranai area would be inundated up to the road during the monsoon. But the difference is that once the rains stopped, the water would start receding. There would be these areas along the road, for at least up to 300 metres on both sides, that would be covered with slight grass in most parts and be slushy in some parts. Overall, it would offer a more dry kind of habitat for months. When the water was down — as I have seen in the months of September and October before the monsoon arrived — the Oriental pratincoles would come. So would the Indian coursers,” explains Santharam. He then goes on to present the prevailing situation. “But now, there is water logging through the year, changing the quality of the habitat. Reeds are found right next to the road. In those days, reeds would be seen only half a kilometre away. When the section got developed, the character of the place changed. The water would not flow that freely and started stagnating and reeds also started coming up close to the road.” Studies needed  “The Indian courser is one the most neglected and least studied birds,” says S Balachandran, deputy director at the BHNS Regional Migration Study Centre in Point Calimere. “It is not a common bird, and over 40 years of field studies, primarily across Tamil Nadu, I must have had only 10 sightings of the Indian Courser. In the Tirunelveli side, in a dry area, I had seen one or two Indian coursers. Other of the rare sightings I have had of this species include the ones at Kaliveli and Kodiakarai. Going by the Tamil Nadu experience, the bird is scarcely found. As the bird prefers neither wetlands nor forests, and is a species of dry open land, surveying it can a challenge. Being found in barren and dry grassland, this bird suffers directly from development activities. It is affected just as the yellow-wattled lapwing is, which is also a bird of dry open land.”While according due importance to the role of citizen-science efforts to document sightings of species like the Indian Courser, Balachandran punctuates the necessity of carrying out a sustained study of the Indian courser.  (‘Uncommon Resident’ discusses resident birds of Chennai and surrounding districts that are not easily seen, and may be dwindling in numbers )  “The Indian courser is one of the most neglected and least studied birds.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-indian-courser-on-uncertain-ground/article35260469.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Shift Velachery fire station to allocated space, say residents||Velachery received a Tamil Nadu Fire & Rescue Services (TNFRS) station six years ago, and since then, the facility is being operated from a small shed belonging to Annai Indira Nagar Residents Welfare Association. It is remarkable that if the Association had not stepped forward and provided this space, this station could have been established at Sholinganallur or Medavakkam. Over the last six years, the fire service personnel at the station are enjoying a great rapport with the residents of Annai Indira Nagar. As a matter of routine, these personnel are extended an invite to the Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations conducted by the residents. Their presence in the neighbourhood provides us with a sense of security. However, the Association is faced with a necessity, and to meet it, it would require this space. Prior to the establishment of teh TNFRS station, this space was used for conducting Association meetings. Now, meetings happen at residents’ houses. Last year, we apprised top TNFRS authorities about it. Moreover, TNFRS needs a space of its own, for its fire tending vehicle is now parked on the road, exposed to the elements. We learnt that land was allotted for establishing TNFRS station at the TNHB Colony in Velachery. However, there seems to be little progress beyond that. I request the authorities concerned to do the needful at the earliest. S.

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||An entrepreneur on how a virus shaped his life decisions||In June 2020, when CK Sunil Kumar, his wife Jolly Sunil Kumar and son Arjun Surya “fled” Chennai in their Swift, they could not have anticipated the challenges that lay ahead of them. Coronavirus cases were then surging in Chennai; Jolly had co-morbidities; for Sunil, running the diagnostic centre (a stone’s throw away from their home) in Ayanavaram was out of the question. The combination of these factors pointed in one direction — towards their hometown, Haripad in Alapuzha district, Kerala. Having done the emergency travel registration, they were off to Haripad, hitting the road with their hatchback. “Fear of the virus and the economics of the situation dictated our decision. Obviously, under the circumstances, staying alive was more important than anything else,” says Sunil, who is 48 years old. “I did not want to take any chance by opening our centre, which offered sugar, ECG and other regular tests. With a raging pandemic, most people would avoid taking these tests if they can, and so the centre was not going to get us now the kind of income we required to meet our daily needs.” Sunil saw his savings dwindle as the rent for his house and the centre alone soaked up Rs. 20,000 every month. On June 5, as they were on the way to their hometown, an unforeseen event overtook them. While on a short route from Tiruchi, around 9.30 p.m., Sunil lost control of the car, which careened off the road. In the inky darkness, the three were trapped in a low-lying patch — 15 feet below the road level. “Fortunately, none of us suffered any major injury,” says Sunil. A Good Samaritan journeying that way rescued them. “As we learnt later, our rescuer Raja was a car dealer. He rung up his contacts to get a spare part for the side arm of the car wheel that got bent due to the fall. Hearing the sound, local villagers had gathered and they helped us pull the car out,” narrates Sunil. In around four hours, they were in a position to leave the spot. On home ground After reaching their hometown, picking up the pieces by starting a business was not easy. Haripad being a small town, it offered a natural resistance to enterprise in the best of times. And they were in the midst of a pandemic. The only solace was they did not have to pay rent as they had their own house. “Another reason to move to their native place was that my elderly mother had to be taken care of,” says Sunil. In September, when cities started relaxing lockdown restrictions, Sunil and Jolly returned to shift their belongings from their home for good. Later, the two opened a similar diagnostic centre in their native town after pledging their property. Now, they have three persons in employment. “Obviously, business cannot be expected to be as brisk as in pre-COVID days. People would avoid coming to a diagnostic centre unless it is an emergency,” says Sunil. The COVID situation seemed to be getting better when the private school where their son Arjun is studying called the students for in-person classes. The family decided to temporarily move to Chennai, and they took a rented accommodation to help Arjun complete his crucial year of schooling. Before he could get the full benefit of an in-person academic programme, the second wave swept through Chennai and classes were suspended after a month. Testing positive  In April, the three tested positive. “We both were in a critical condition and had a hard battle against the virus,” says Sunil, who shuttles between Chennai and his hometown. Though these one-and-a-half years have been challenging, the Sunils’ are grateful for the many people who crossed their paths and helped them out of impossible situations. “I have not paid my son’s fees till now and the school never harassed me,” says Sunil. “My friends Suresh Sankarankutty, Suraj, Sijith and Sunil have been a big source of support to me.” Sunil came to Chennai as a 17-year-old with just Rs. 500 and it is this city that helped him build his dreams. “If the situation improves, and I really hope it does, we would love to be back in Chennai. It is the city where I built my dreams and I want my son to build his too in this city.”  Fear of the virus and the economics of the situation dictated our decision. Obviously, under the circumstances, staying alive was more important than anything else||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/an-entrepreneur-on-how-a-virus-shaped-his-life-decisions/article35260465.ece

Now, it is something to be proud about — largely because of what effected the turnaround. In May, when the gated community’s management committee (MC) planned to launch a vaccination drive for the 18-to-45 age group, it took a count of the unvaccinated at the community, which brought a shocking piece of statistic to light. Arun Dhanaraj, secretary, Jains Inseli Park Owners’ Association reveals that it was discovered that hardly two percent of the support staff had taken the jab. As the community had 50-odd support staff, this shortfall was setting off alarm bells. The MC touched base with the local UPHC and sought a vaccination camp to be conducted at the community. All of this was happening when the second wave was at its height. With the medical apparatus being stretched to the limits, this effort did not bear fruit. Simultaneously, the MC was working on the support staff, impressing upon them the fact that total vaccination coverage is what would lead us out of the pandemic. The committee also made it clear to the staff that without vaccination, the professional association may have to be brought to an end. The MC team launched a sponsorship drive called #IPCares (Inseli Park Cares) to ensure vaccination with a private hospital. “We collected Rs. 40,000 through sponsorship. Our property manager and the staff on our rolls were among those who loosened their purse strings,” he says. Through the MyGate app, updates about who had signed up for the vaccination camp as well as who sponsored for it were broadcast. “For the direct reports among the support staff, the Association sponsored the entire vaccination amount; for those on the payroll of a vendor, the Association met 50 p.c. of the vaccination amount,” says Arun. Provision as incentive Finally, on 12 June 2021, 161 people including residents took the vaccination at an on-site drive organised in association with a private hospital. As a goodwill gesture, the frontline staff who took the jab received a five kilo rice bag. As a majority of the MC members being employed with corporates, they successfully replicated methods followed by their organisations in planning and executing employee vaccination drives.

Murugesh (48) and Sirish Ramkumar (46) — were sufficiently moved by the sorry state of the fitness equipment at a Greater Chennai Corporation-run indoor gym at Elliot’s Beach in Besant Nagar to have them replaced. The gym enables the duo to relive their boyhood years. “Ramkumar and I are childhood friends, as both of us have lived at Besant Nagar 26th Cross Street since the 1970s. This gym is just a three-minute walk from our street, and we availed oursleves of it. In the 1980s, there were not many private gyms, which led people from different economic backgrounds to make use of the facility. In 1996, the building that had the gym was demolished and a new one was constructed in its place — that is on the walkway, opposite KFC,” says Murugesh. Though already weather-beaten, the gym equipment got worse over the last one year, probably due to sustained lack of disuse, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. “During lockdown, there were not many users. Hence the equipment got rusted. I informed Ramkumar, who is in Dubai now, about it. He agreed to fund the purchase and installation of new equipment. On his behalf, I purchased them. The Greater Chennai Corporation officials are also aware of this and accepted the donation. The sponsored equipment include dumb-bells set of 10 kg, 12.5 kg, 15 kg, and 17.5 kg; bench press and rod; two plates of 15 kg each and a stand for all these equipment. Once, the pandemic subsides, we plan to buy more equipment,” says Murugesh, who believes the gym has been suffering from a lack of adequate maintenance over the years. He presents a slice of the gym’s history: “It was in 2004 that the gym in-charge P. Govindaraj retired — he was the first and the last one to be placed in charge of the gym. After him, the Corporation did not appoint any staff to take care of the gym. He was a resident of Odaima Nagar, near Velankanni church in Besant Nagar. He would open the gym at 6 a.m. and close it by 9.30 a.m. Again in the evening, he would keep it open from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The regulars at the gym would be waiting for his arrival. Now, though no staff has been appointed to manage the gym, one set of keys has been left with Olcott Urur residents, and another set with Odaima Nagar residents, as they are the ones who mostly use it. Now, the gym opens only in the morning.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/corporation-gym-at-elliots-beach-gets-new-equipment/article35260478.ece

He revisits hangouts — Kumbakarai Falls, Sothuparai dam and Kailasanthar temple on a hilltop among others — that would define leisure for him before he shifted to Chennai for work. Last June, Mathivanan, his wife K Sugapriya (also an IT employee, now on remote work) shifted to Theni along with their two-year-old daughter, as their respective companies allowed them to work from anywhere. Both the IT professionals feel their lives have suddenly been enriched by the company of relatives and friends and the energising air of the countryside. Not to mention, the absolute lack of junk food. Sugapriya is thankful that their child could spend considerable time with her grandparents and be influenced by their value system. Further, Sugapriya is also able to visit her mother’s place in Madurai, less than a two-hours’ road trip away. “Earlier, we used to come down to Theni only once in three months,” says Mathivanan. Usually it would be too hurried a trip to fully savour the joys it had to offer. Mathivanan and Sugapriya have a rented accommodation in Sholinganallur, “We were paying a rent of Rs. 12,500; when we considered vacating the house, the owner offered to reduce the rent by Rs. 4,500. We agreed to it,” says Mathivanan. Though one-year of remote-working from Theni has led to many social benefits, Mathivanan and Sugapriya also miss the office and the team lunches in Chennai. Given the fact that these IT professionals are only in their 20s, and the opportunities for professional growth the city offers, they view their stay in Theni as just a sojourn.

Darwin Annadurai, managing trustee, Eco Society India, underlines the deleterious effect this invasive species can have on the lake ecosystem. “A voracious feeder, this catfish can gobble up native fish species, water snakes and also hatchlings of water birds. This species is a prolific breeder.” T. D. Babu, a former principal scientist and research scholar, Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) says: “The Indian government has banned breeding, farming, transporting and sale of this fish as it is an invasive species. As it grows and breeds faster, it can dominate a waterbody, subduing native species. Doing away with this species is a challenge, as they can survive in any adverse conditions. As they are air breathers, they can survive in sludge with low dissolved oxygen levels.” Annadurai adds, “The Public Works Department should take steps to remove the catfish from this lake at the earliest. Besides, fishermen should be advised not to rear it. The waste from the poultries, including, the wings of the chicken, intestines, and heads are fed to these species. Rearing it in an artificial pond or spotted in waterbodies will contaminate the quality of the groundwater, render a foul odour and make it non-potable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/invasive-fish-species-at-lake-in-southern-suburbs/article35260467.ece

The recently-formed residents’ group — Cholamandal Devi Nagar Residents Welfare Association — draws attention to the condition of the street name boards in the locality. “It is a decade since this colony came under the limits of the Greater Chennai Corporation. While under Injambakkam Panchayat, some name boards were installed, and they have faded over the years. And the Corporation has not installed any name board in our colony so far. Instead, Corporation has written on the compound walls of the houses. In some streets, the names disappear when residents repaint their walls or when existing buildings are demolished and new ones are constructed. In the absence of name boards, we find it difficult to guide people to our houses,” says D Sukumar, president, Cholamandal Devi Nagar Residents Welfare Association.

At present, the base for the new transformer has been erected. The Association’s treasurer N Nalla Sivam points out that the transformer’s base has been erected on a rainwater channel by raising a sand bed across it. As the locality is low-lying, this arrangement can cause water stagnation during the rainy season. Besides, the base eats into the 14-feet wide road along the channel, causing traffic congestion. K. Sarangadass, the association president, says that for these reasons, the transformer and the base needs to be shifted elsewhere without much delay. The Association represents Kailash Nagar, Mookambigai Nagar, Sri Perumal Nagar, Rathinam Nagar, Sairam Nagar, and Shanthi Nagar, hence the name KAMPERS.

He would meet up with his friends, some of whom would have flown in from The United States of America, Dubai and Switzerland. All of them, including Vinod, would primarily come to this beachside town in Thiruvananthapuram city for the ten-day ‘Arattu’ festival at Janardhana Swamy Temple. For the last two years, the reunion of friends has not happened. Around three months ago, Vinod, and his family left for Varkala, packing only essential items. “As the cases started to rise exponentially and there was shortage of beds and oxygen, I decided to go to my native place. Work from home and online classes made it possible,” says Vinod. Usually, the annual trip to Varkala would energise him. In contrast, the current stay has left him frustrated, as he cannot engage in the usual activities he would while on a visiting Varkala. Simply because it is not a vacation that has taken him there now. “I miss Chennai — the city is my workplace,” says Vinod. But he is counting his blessings. His remote work and his daughter V.

Suddenly, the world Krishnan has left behind seems to be calling, stirring memories and desires.   Krishan makes the long journey by train from Colombo into the war-torn Northern Province for Rani’s funeral, revisiting a land scarred by the 30-year civil war. It’s a personal journey as well as the journey of a nation trying to find its identity while negotiating the chasm between expectation and reality. In this excerpt from Chapter 7, Krishnan is on the train to Kilinochchi, watching the half-forgotten landscape unfold before his eyes, pondering the distance Sri Lanka has travelled in the long years since he left the North behind.  It always made Krishan a little uncomfortable that he’d chosen to return while so many Tamils were willing to risk everything to leave, a choice that had only been possible, he knew, because of the fortune and privilege of his circumstances, the safe distance of his own life from the violence and poverty of the northeast. It was true that his father had been a casualty of one of the Tiger bombings in Colombo, that he had in this sense been deeply affected by the war, but the fact was that he’d grown up in comfort, in a house of his own far away from the actual fighting, that he’d never had to experience violence directly, neither gunshots, shelling, nor displacement, nothing more than casual racism here and there, threatening interrogations by police and soldiers on the street. The idea of doing social work in the northeast would have never even occurred to him, probably, had he not been so insulated from the traumas of the war, and in a way his departure after two years had only underscored how different his life was from those who’d spent their lives in the northeast, those for whom coming and going wasn’t simply a matter of choice. Krishan looked at the scenes passing outside as they left the town, the outlines of the trees in the distance distorted by the intensity of the heat, and feeling a little restless he took out his phone and looked at the time. They were less than an hour from Kilinochchi and he wasn’t sure what to do with himself, whether to try reading or listening to music, neither of which he felt like doing. He didn’t want to remain seated, had been sitting for several hours and felt an urge to stand up, then realized that he hadn’t yet smoked that day, that it would be nice to leave the carriage and have a cigarette now that he was finally in the north. He reached down and took out his lighter and pack from his bag, glanced around quickly to make sure no one happened to be walking through the carriage, then stood up and began making his way along the aisle, holding the seat backs for support till he passed out into the small corridor between the carriages. He waited a few seconds to make sure he was alone, then lighting a cigarette discreetly against the wall he pulled open the train door, latched it to the wall, and leaned outside, his face immediately assailed by a blast of hot, dry wind, his eyes by the penetrating, preternatural brightness of the day. Just a stone’s throw from the train he could see the A9 running in parallel with the tracks, veering sometimes closer and sometimes farther away, the air above its smooth black surface trembling from the heat of the tarmac. The highway was hardly a highway, consisting of only a single lane for each direction of traffic, but because it was the main road linking north and south it had assumed a kind of epic proportion in the minds of everyone who’d lived through the war. The southern section had been controlled by the government for most of the fighting, the northern section by the Tigers, each side manning their portion of the border with heavy fortifications and multiple checkpoints, so that for the better part of twenty-five years it had, like the train line, been completely inoperative. It had been reopened finally in 2009, just a few months after the defeat of the Tigers, the military quickly filling up the craters, demining the adjacent land, and repaving the road so it was ready for civilian use, though for a long time soldiers continued checking every single vehicle that crossed the border, going methodically through every single compartment and every single piece of luggage if the passengers were Tamil. The train line had taken much longer to be put back into operation, not only because all the stations on the northern section of the line had been bombed out, but also because every inch of track and every nut and bolt had been stripped away by the Tigers, who’d made use of the iron for weapons, bunkers, and anything else they required in their typically meticulous way. It had taken several years for the government to relay the track, and when the line was officially reopened the previous year it had been celebrated with great fanfare, the government using the occasion to symbolize how the entire island was now back under its control, a marker of their achievement as liberators of the country. That had been in 2014, toward the end of his time in the northeast, when he’d become so used to traveling by bus that he didn’t even think to use the train, and looking at the highway from his slightly different vantage point now, Krishan found himself thinking of all the journeys he’d made between Colombo and Jaffna since returning to the island, the intense longing he’d felt, during those first months especially, as he gazed out from his bus window at these same unending landscapes of brush and palmyra, landscapes so flat and dry and unforgiveable that it seemed sometimes almost miraculous that so many generations had worked life and sustenance out of the earth. It was hard to say what it was about the northeast that had drawn him there after so many years abroad, what it was that had taken root so deeply inside him that he abandoned the life he’d built for himself in Delhi in search of another one here. It was true that guilt had played some part, guilt for the relative ease of his life growing up, guilt for the fact that he’d spent so much of his twenties lost in academic texts, but there was also something in the sparse, desolate beauty of the region that had brought him here, he thought as he gazed out of the train, something much stronger and more substantial than guilt. He’d spent so many hours looking at images of the northeastern countryside during his time in Delhi, not during his initial obsession with the war’s final massacres but afterward, sensing in those images of sprawling fields and thick jungle something ancient and almost mythical, something that made him dream of a possible fulfillment without knowing how or from what source. Compelled by some need to dwell more on the origins of the war, to understand the nature of the longings that had led to such a devastating conclusion, he’d begun reading about the earlier, more idealistic days of the separatist movement, and it was the story of Kuttimani more than anything else, he remembered now, that had captivated him at the time, that had crystallized the longing to live in the northeast that was just beginning to take hold of him.  Extracted fromA Passage North by Anuk Arudpragasam, published by Penguin Hamish Hamilton this month.  The highway was hardly a highway, consisting of only a single lane for each direction of traffic, but because it was the main road linking north and south it had assumed a kind of epic proportion in the minds of everyone who’d lived through the war||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-train-to-kilinochchi/article35260504.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Your country, my country||A year after the People’s Liberation Army began to amass troops at the Line of Actual Control, an act which led to blood being spilt for the first time in 45 years on the India-China boundary at Galwan, a slew of books has put the spotlight on the bilateral relationship. Most of all, there is renewed curiosity about why China does what it does, especially when it concerns India, which, at least in India’s own perception, has not provoked Chinese aggressions. On the downslide Kanti Bajpai’s book India Versus China: Why They Are Not Friends attempts to answer the question, with the help of four Ps: Perceptions, Perimeters, other Partnerships and Power asymmetry. The book, the second in a series from Juggernaut publishers after diplomat and scholar Husain Haqqani’s India Vs Pakistan: Why Can't We Just be Friends? , contains a concise version of the history of India-China ties, tracing a trajectory on the downslide. Bajpai says while both countries may have held each other in high esteem in ancient times, they now look at each other with disdain which ranges from the casual racism of the Chinese and Indians towards each other (epithets like “A-san” and “Chinky” respectively) to complete mistrust of each other’s designs on their territories. Much of the Chinese impression of India has been shaped by Indian policemen who were posted to China by the British during the Opium wars, argues Bajpai (the term A-san or Ahsan refers to Indians pejoratively as “Uncle Toms” in the West). Meanwhile, the “perimeter” or boundary dispute has hit an impasse, which the author ascribes to the power gap between the two countries. “From a position of strength, China does not see the need to accommodate, while from a position of weakness, India feels it cannot afford to do so and risk further loss of standing and strategic autonomy,” writes Bajpai. Realistic picture The author provides a fairly realistic picture of China’s growing arrogance and unilateral aggressions, especially in the past decade, but concludes that the two conflagrations between India and China in 1962 and 2020 are more likely to have been caused by Chinese misperceptions and overreactions to India’s actions. On the 1962 war, for example, Bajpai holds on to John Garver’s view ( Protracted Contest: Sino-Indian Rivalry in the Twentieth Century ) that the casus belli were Tibet and India’s shelter to the Dalai Lama, which China read as New Delhi fomenting its overthrow in Tibet. In 2020, he surmises that China took a suspicious view of Indian infrastructure development near the Karakoram highway as intended to constrain Chinese progress on the Belt and Road Initiative, further aggravated by Home Minister Amit Shah’s intemperate language in Parliament while discussing Aksai Chin after the government’s reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir and amendment in Article 370. There is then the question of India’s other strategic partnerships, most notably with the United States, which in 2020, like 1962, is being read in Beijing as a plan to contain China with India playing a “junior” partner to the U.S. Finally, Bajpai makes the point that the power gap between the two is growing, making it more difficult for the two countries to forge better ties for the foreseeable future, adding that their best relationship was in the 1940s and 1950s when they were more equal. The book points out that on absolute and relative terms, China is far ahead of India, and given current growth rates, the present GDP gap of $11.5 trillion between them will only increase in the next few decades. In addition, it says that China far outstrips India on human development indicators and soft power. Bleak prognosis Where the book possibly errs is in offering the least optimistic construct on all issues between the two countries. While other scholars have held, for example, that India and China have had a connection for 5,000 years without a war until 1962, Bajpai describes a relationship that with a few exceptional periods has never been friendly. The book describes Hu Shih’s famous 1937 paper for Harvard University “The Indianisation of China: A Case Study of Cultural Borrowing”, as a castigation of Indian Buddhism’s enfeebling impact on China, when in fact the paper also describes China’s “grateful” receipt of the “gift of Buddhism”. “Never before had China seen a religion so rich in imagery, so beautiful and captivating in ritualism and so bold in cosmological and metaphysical speculations. Like a poor beggar suddenly halting before a magnificent storehouse of precious stones of dazzling brilliancy and splendour, China was overwhelmed, baffled and overjoyed,” Hu described in the paper. The prognosis from Bajpai’s book, as a result, is bleak, and as suggested by its title, would mean that India and China are not, and cannot be friends. This conclusion is possibly a clear-eyed view of the present, but not necessarily of the future of two countries which share a 3,500 km boundary and bilateral trade, even post-COVID, post-Galwan, that exceeds all others (for India). While the modus vivendi, former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon has said, is no doubt broken, a working relationship is by no means redundant or unnecessary.

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||‘The most important thing to have is a thinking routine’||Swedish author Fredrik Backman’s most recent book, Anxious People, feels like a novel written for the pandemic era. The story of eight strangers stuck in an apartment open house is as much about anxiety and depression as it is about hope and kindness. “I got the idea when I was apartment hunting with my wife,” Backman says in a phone interview from Sweden. “We went to see around nine apartments one day until I was like ‘they are all fine, let’s just pick one,’” he laughs. “But in that setting, there was also a strange sense of competition that brought out people’s anxieties and insecurities. I am interested in relationship dramas and why people act like idiots, so I found that fascinating.” In a candid conversation, the bestselling author of A Man Called Ove and Beartown speaks about his craft, juggling multiple characters and narratives, and more. Edited excerpts: Let’s start at the beginning. Were you interested in writing as a child? No, I never wanted to be an author. Writing for me was just a good way of communicating. When you write something, you can rewrite and edit before showing it to someone... I found that really useful as a kid. Even now, I don’t actually think of myself as a writer per se. If there are 10 words to describe something, I choose the easiest. I think this makes my books easy to translate, because the translator does not have to hunt too much to find the exact words. Do you have a writing process? What is it like? I wish Ihad a process! I just think about stories all the time. It is my favourite thing to do. Young writers ask me about my writing routine. But the most important thing to have, in my opinion, isn’t a writing routine... it’s a thinking routine. You can sit in front of a computer for 10 hours, but if you don’t have an idea, what are you going to write? You have to have an idea first. Some people think, ‘Ah, I will create this perfect writing den and I’ll sit down there, and words will flow.’ Maybe it does work. But I need to think about ideas for at least 100 hours first. Your books usually have a long list of characters. How do you keep track of them all? Thekey is tothink of them as people and not characters. I live with them in my head for a long time, and think about them so much that they become real people to me. Every character is a combination of several real people — I take inspiration from 20-odd real people and that becomes one character. Each character has to feel real to me. Otherwise they won’t feel real to you. So when people ask me how I keep track of different characters, I ask, ‘How do you keep track of your family or friends?’ They are all distinct human beings to you. That’s how. Your novelBeartowndeals with heavy topics like rape and trauma. How do you approach such topics with sensitivity? I spent a lotof time researching for that book. I talked to over 100 people who had been in similar situations, and some of them had truly horrific stories. It was a hard book to write, as it should have been. What are your hobbies? I am not ahuge fan of travelling, so the lockdown hasn’t really taken away much from me in that aspect. I like spending time with family and friends. These days, I enjoy arguing with my daughter as I accompany her to football practice. What are you working on currently? I’mcurrently working on the third part of the Beartown series (its sequel, Us Against You , was published in 2018). Will this be the last book of the series? I don’t know yet.  Each character has to feel real to me. Otherwise they won’t feel real to you||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-most-important-thing-to-have-is-a-thinking-routine/article35260506.ece

So a recently retired man decided to switch seamlessly from a 30-year nine-to-five office routine to a life of quality time, and not be a nuisance while he is at it. In pursuance of a morning-walk regime, he sets the alarm for 6 a.m., but his bladder wakes him up at 5.30 a.m. The rest of his household is in deep slumber. In his recently adopted self-sufficient mode, he goes to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. His main aim is to conduct a noiseless kitchen operation, and not to awaken the entire household at that ungodly hour, earning everyone else’s ire. He switches on the light and finds it too bright, appearing to light up the whole house. It may invite censure from his sleep-disturbed family. So he switches it off and settles for work in semi-darkness, martyr that he is. He tiptoes around the kitchen for 10 minutes, hoping to locate the elusive kettle which he suspects that his wife has deliberately kept hidden, just to send him on a meaningless treasure-hunt, and also to show him who owns the kitchen. He finally spots the kettle, partially visible under a pyramid of washed vessels. Hoping for a noiseless manoeuvre, he gingerly pulls it out inch by inch. The malign pyramid waits till the kettle is 99% eased out and then crashes down spectacularly, causing him to experience a minor cardiac episode. He holds his breath for the next five minutes waiting for a furious complaint from the startled household. Fanned out This is where science comes to his rescue, in the form of noise-cancellation. In all the rooms of his house, the fans are whirring, slashing air ferociously at the maximum regulator setting (which is the only setting his family knows), and the crash of the vessels in the kitchen does not penetrate through this sound barrier of air being massacred. So far, so good. It is a weekday evening, and the family is settled in front of the TV. He is the last in the queue to watch his favourite channel. So he retires to his room, surfing YouTube on his laptop. It is a weekday morning. The rest of the family has gone out for work. The household is at peace again, with just he and his wife there. He is trying to read a book. From the kitchen, his wife is advising that he should be more involved and proactive about this and that. She stops mid-sentence and lets out a horror-movie screech, rushing out and breathlessly announcing the appearance of a monstrous winged insect. He goes in, swats the tiny beetle and has a Eureka moment of realisation. If he is to retain his relevance in the household, especially in the eyes of his old lady, he needs to keep a stock of spiders and tiny beetles in a jar and release them in the kitchen periodically whenever she begins her lecture. sagitex@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/pensioners-predicament/article35260500.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Grief and sorrow as a celebration of love and relationships||A rampaging virus has taken too many lives, and counting, each loss difficult to comprehend, impossible to replace. With the COVID-19 toll crossing unimaginable numbers worldwide, there is a sense of dread about the uncertain future. The last breath and the resultant fullstop have evoked considerable literature. In recent times we have had Arun Shourie’s Preparing for Death and Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi’s Loss . Rabindranath Tagore, of course, wrote some of his most well-known songs after personal tragedy. In 1903, a year after his wife Mrinalini Debi passed away, Tagore penned these lines, “there is sorrow ( dukkho ), there is death ( mrityu ), yet there is peace ( shanti ), there is joy ( ananda )...” Contemplating on the fear prevailing over the coronavirus, Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa says people find it difficult to accept that all of life’s beauty ultimately belongs to death, “and that at any moment it may come to an end.” ‘Permanent scattering’ June 10, 2020 was the worst day of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s life. She lost her father, James Nyowe Adichie, at a time the world was in lockdown due to COVID-19 — he was in Nigeria, the writer far away in America. He had a kidney ailment not thought to be serious, and speaking for the millions aggrieved by the virus, she wondered: “How is it that the world keeps going, breathing in and out unchanged, while in my soul there is a permanent scattering?” In Notes on Grief , a moving intimation of loss and mortality, she writes that grief is a cruel kind of education. “You learn how ungentle mourning can be, how full of anger. You learn how glib condolences can feel. You learn how much grief is about language, the failure of language and the grasping for language.” Adichie finds it impossible to think of her father in the past tense — he was not; he is . She backs away from condolences, is deeply riled by mentions of age because that is irrelevant in grief, detests the word ‘demise’, and doesn’t feel comforted by ‘presumptuous’ words of comfort like ‘he is in a better place’ or ‘he is resting’. Help from a biography Is there value in the Igbo, African way of grieving, Adichie wonders, “where you take every call and tell and retell the story of what happened, where isolation is anathema and ‘stop crying’ a refrain.” As she grapples with her grief, she rereads a biography of her father, ‘the foremost professor of Statistics’, and recalls his “certain kind of colonial African education, prudent and proper, Latin-loving and rule-following.” There is no easy way to overcome her sorrow but slowly, Adichie looks at old photographs, his Sudoku books, videos and papers. She remembers hailing him as ‘Odelu-Ora Abba (one who writes for our community)’ and her father calling her ‘Nwoke Neli (roughly, the equivalent of many men)’ among other names. She is reminded of her father’s sense of humour, already dry, which “crisped deliciously as he aged”; his sense of duty, a “gentle man and a gentleman.” An ode to her father also becomes a history lesson on Nigeria and its mutinies over land, oil, people. A friend sends Adichie a line from her own novel Half of a Yellow Sun : “Grief was the celebration of love, those who could feel real grief were lucky to have loved.” The layers of loss make life feel papery thin, writes Adichie, whose mother passed away on March 1 this year. “How Does a Heart Break Twice? How can my mother be gone forever, and so soon after my father,” she asked in a tearful tribute to Grace Ifeoma Adichie. Even metaphysical poet John Donne’s words, “Death, thou shalt die”, can be of little comfort in the time of grief.

This was a huge revolution in jewellery and once, on meeting Mikimoto, Thomas Edison said he had achieved what was “supposed to be biologically impossible”. What had Mikimoto created that naturally occurs when some dirt irritates a mollusc? 2 Helenite is a green obsidian-like gemstone that was created accidentally after a certain natural phenomenon occurred in 1980. Local timber workers were using acetylene torches to free salvage equipment when they noticed that the heat was transforming the ash and rock into a beautiful green colour. It has since been recreated away from the source, but it gets its name from a geographical entity in Washington whose activity in 1980 caused devastation. From what entity do we get helenite? 3 In 2014, scientists at Bayerisches Geoinstitut in Germany successfully created diamond gemstones using much higher pressure than found in the earth’s core, where diamonds are usually formed. The starting material was something you would see on your breakfast table. The process is messier and slower, but proves that carbon in any form can be converted. What did the scientists turn into diamond that you usually have either crunchy or smooth and on toast? 4 Chrysoberyl is a gemstone that is an aluminate of beryllium. Normally yellowish-green in colour, there is a variety known as alexandrite that has the unique characteristic of pleochroism, which is an optical phenomenon that depends on how you view the gemstone. What difference would you notice in alexandrite depending on whether you viewed it under natural sunlight or artificial incandescent light? 5 This gemstone is a form of lignite. It is derived from wood that has changed under extreme pressure. Its English name comes from the French word jaiet . It gets its characteristic dark colour thanks to high carbon concentration, which led to its name being used as an adjective to mean ‘as dark a black as possible’. What is the name of this gemstone? 6 Painite is a very rare borate mineral, with only two specimens ever having been cut into gemstones. Discovered by a gem dealer after whom it was named, the mineral is extremely rare as it contains both zirconium and boron, two elements that rarely interact naturally. Painite is found only in the Mogok area, where rubies were once mined. Which country, whose capital was Rangoon till 2006 and is Naypyidaw now, is this region in? 7 Biogenic gemstones are those that are formed from an organic source created through natural biological processes rather than geological processes. The most common one is pearl. Certain ammonites are fossilised in such a way that they become a type of gemstone called ammolite. A rare biogenic gemstone is fossilised tree resin, which has been valued since Neolithic times and written about since the fourth century BCE. It is the softest gemstone. What is this gemstone that was the starting point of the Jurassic Park franchise? 8 These two gemstones are essentially the same, with the colour varying due to different minerals as trace impurities. They are both types of corundum, but there is one name for red ones and another one for those of any other colour. The red colour comes from the presence of chromium, and this gem’s name comes from the Latin word for ‘red’. There is a theory that the other gem’s name comes from the Sanskrit for ‘Sacred to Saturn’. What are these two gemstones? 9 Garnets are silicate minerals that are almost always a deep red in colour. The most famous of these gems is the carbuncle, which has been mentioned many times in the Bible, in a Sherlock Holmes story, by Shakespeare in Hamlet and a character in the Final Fantasy series. The name ‘garnet’ comes from the old French words for ‘grain, seed’, because they looked like the seeds of a certain fruit. Which fruit’s seeds give the red garnet its name? 10 Before huge corporations started taking over the diamond mining industry and making it into the billion-dollar enterprise it is now, historically diamonds were actually found on the surface in alluvial deposits in south India. For a long time, till the 18th century CE, India was the biggest source of diamonds. The banks of one particular river in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, were a prolific area for discovering diamonds. Which river is this that at one time used to deposit diamonds on its banks?

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The melee at level crossings||It is a great leveller. It has the power to make every vehicle — no matter its size, the VIP quotient of its occupant or the nuisance value of its horn — painfully wait at its behest. In Indian cities, railway level crossings at most places are a sore reminder of the deep-rooted inertia and lack of foresight of our city planners in implementing alternatives such as overbridges or underpasses. Level crossings are a relic of an era when traffic volumes were one-tenth of what they are now. That was a time when every middle-class family’s ambition was “Hamara Bajaj” and very few actually got to ride one, as a waiting period of four or five years for the scooter was quite common and things like EMI were not even heard of. The scene near level crossings is of utter chaos driven by the hurry of motorists, though a little patience and respect for order (something very foreign to our nature) will go a long way in making matters easier. As the gates tilt down to a close to the accompaniment of a buzzing sound, some bikers race to sneak through with the adeptness of movie stuntmen. Once the gates are down, the dreary wait for the train to pass begins, and so does the crafty jugaad mentality of motorists. Like rats and cockroaches, those on two-wheelers manage to sneak past the waiting traffic, to be close to the gate so that they can scoot off the moment it opens. By the time the train arrives, the traffic build-up on both sides resembles rival armies arrayed in a battle formation, eagerly waiting for the war bugle to go off. Once the gates are opened, all driving etiquette takes a back seat and Darwinian instincts take over. The size of the vehicle and number of wheels become crucial. Those steering burly six-wheeler trucks try to bully those behind the wheels of small cars. Luggage autorickshaws laden with steel rods intimidate two-wheeler riders by subjecting them to close shaves. For all motorists in general, it’s a nerve-racking one-inch-at-a-time rite of passage as they have to maintain their cool amid high-decibel horns, heated exchanges and brinkmanship by fellow motorists. By the time the chaos gets over, it’s time to down the gates for the next train. shajilkumark@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-melee-at-level-crossings/article35260498.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Power and responsibility||Reading Rasheed Kidwai’s House of Scindias: A Saga of Power, Politics and Intrigue during a time when second, third and in some cases even fourth generation inheritors are grappling with political legacy and the manner of its transfer, is an interesting experience. As I read it, I was also reporting on the full-scale revolt within the Paswan family, and of course the unending tussle within the Congress party to settle the question of leadership. Stamp of authority The prolific number of political leaders that the Scindia family has spawned deserves to be recorded but the manner in which sociologist Max Weber’s seminal work on power and authority has worked its way through the story of one family is even more fascinating. Weber distinguished between three kinds of authority — traditional, rational and charismatic. Traditional authority accrues from respect in society based on old established cultural patterns, the rational from legal frameworks and bureaucratic structures like governments and charismatic authority is derived from an individual’s personal charisma and magnetism. In the Scindias, one can see the intertwining of all three types of authority over generations, its scope and limitations as well. And while some members of the clan traversed opposing ideological planes — Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia started off as a Congress MP and later helped found the Bharatiya Janata Party, her son Madhavrao Scindia was in the Jan Sangh (precursor to BJP) and moved to the Congress, and his son, Jyotiraditya, did the opposite, being in the Congress first and then moving to the BJP — the book is more about their successful negotiation in being in power. The book covers a swathe of history, from the original founder of the Scindia clan, Ranoji Rao Scindia, to the current generation. It delves into the Scindias’ relationship with the Peshwas of Pune, the Mughals in Delhi, their role in the First War of Independence of 1857 right up to post-independent India. What is interesting is that at crucial moments in India’s history, the clan managed to prevail — particularly telling is the fact that the late Jiwajirao Scindia, Maharaja of Gwalior at the time of independence, was one of the first princely states to accede to India even when others protested and provided a role model for many to follow. Mystery fortune The book presents a chapter on each of the Scindias who made it into public life, and Kidwai peppers the narrative with interesting anecdotes including the missing “beejak” or map key for a fortune which legend has it that it is lodged in underground vaults in Scindia-owned palaces and forts. My personal favourite is the appeal made during elections by family members when on opposite sides of the political spectrum — folklore has it that whenever a Scindia was asked to campaign against another, they would simply tell the crowd meri izzat rakh lena (protect my dignity), leaving the crowd confused as to what was expected of them. Kidwai reflects on the nature of dynasty and the endurance and dexterity required for staying on in power, whether as a crowned ruler, or a democratically elected “public servant”. It also shows that the ability to stay at the helm of public affairs and the transfer of political legacies seldom make for comfortable dinner conversations in families, something newer political dynasties may want to pay heed to.

But I decided to break the norm and try both non-veg and alcohol and ended up liking both. I mean, nothing was holding me back really except our imaginary entitlements handed down from generation to generation. But there’s a major problem. I tried telling my family, but they were furious. Now, they are arranging my marriage. And most of the women hang up on me when I tell them I occasionally imbibe. Without even wanting to know me as a person. Even when I clarify I am nowhere close to being an alcoholic or carnivorous predator. I would have preferred a love marriage, but unfortunately it didn’t happen and maybe now I am too old. I am in my early 30s. How do I tackle all this? Should I stay unmarried?  — Single and Anxious   to Date      Dear SAD,  Frankly, dear boy, your family is sounding strictly boring. But first things first. Why are your parents still worrying about what you are eating and drinking? They should have stopped thinking about it once they weaned you off Cerelac and started you on pappu-saadam. The fact that they are still watering you and watching you grow makes me strongly believe that they think you are a potted plant. And, as you are well aware, potted plants cannot happily drink alcohol and eat chicken 65. They will soon wilt. Wilting is not good condition for plants. Or men. How to convince them that you are grown-up adult male of species Homo sapiens ? Well, for starters, you could behave like one. For example, move out of your climate-controlled, vermicomposted little flowerpot and start living alone. After the initial shock of seeing you feeding and cleaning yourself, your folks will probably come to terms with it and stop stuffing plant food down your gullet. Mind you, they might also go into deep shock. In which case, a small shot of brandy is highly recommended. There are two advantages to this. One, of course, they might actually come out of their shock. Second, they might like it so much they will want to carry on drinking. In which case, you can move back into their house. I also suspect it is your parents who are writing your matrimonial profile in which they are saying tall, fair descendant of god is looking for hard-working apsara with good salary and sambhar skills. This kind of ad works very well when you are looking for pest control service but not for future wife. I think those women are probably calling you just for the pleasure of hanging up. AJC Bose said even potted plants are sentient, so maybe you can write ad yourself? Try this: ‘Smart guy, loves cooking, will change nappies.’ Or: ‘Smart guy, loves cooking, says sorry.’ After this, you can add anything — ‘Alcoholic with squint eyes.’ ‘Omnivore with blue beard’. It will cease to matter. Oh and don’t forget. You must cunningly insert the word ‘broad-minded’ somewhere. It is an umbrella hint to prospective bride which basically covers all bases — boy drinks, boy is divorced, boy murdered first wife, boy is unemployed, boy is carnivorous predator, etc. etc. It takes care of all the preliminary chit-chat that in olden days used to take place over coffee-bajji-mysorepak. Once you do this, most probably when the women call you, they will simply ask, “Okay, what time you start every evening?” Which is a simple question even you can answer without preparation.  — AA   agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/get-hic-hitched/article35260529.ece

South captured the king of clubs lead with his ace as East followed with the four. South cashed the ace of hearts, dropping the queen, and continued with another heart to the jack and king. The defence from this point was merciless. East cashed his ace and king of diamonds before returning the two of clubs to his partner. West, noting his partner’s high-low in clubs, did not take long to continue with another club. South ruffed with dummy’s six but East over-ruffed with the nine and contract was down one. This was excellent defence, but declarer should have prevailed. Can you spot how? As a point of technique, South should have ducked the opening club lead. Sometimes there is no clear reason for doing this, but if it can be done safely, it might scissor communications between the defenders. Had South ducked the opening lead, the defence would not have had a chance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/missed-chance/article35260534.ece

There has been more conversation within families and at the workplace — such as it is — on the screen and on the phone, about the disease, about the science, about the restrictions, about the vaccine. The daily dump of information from experts and non-experts, the constantly updating dashboards and trackers, have resulted in a rich archive that future historians of science and public health can plough through to understand what it must have been like to live through these times. And there’s been no shortage of podcasts in what has emerged as an entire genre of pandemic programming, offering advice, analysis and explanation about everything related to COVID-19. The audio series Positive , from which the quotes above are drawn, does something a little bit different; it bears witness. Everyday heroes While the pandemic caused untold suffering, it also threw up everyday heroes from among our midst, people who went out of their way to render help and provide succour in multiple ways. It also led to the discovery of pockets of resilience and strength within ordinary folk; the ability to reach out, or to keep it together in times of extreme uncertainty and anxiety. The six vignettes that make up the series give you, without preamble or commentary, a glimpse into what it is like to live in the midst of fear, helplessness, and heartbreak — and to emerge with a semblance of hope. Ranging from around eight to 13 minutes, these are first-person narrations of people who “surfed the rough seas of the pandemic... in hospitals, volunteer hubs and within families”. The series is produced by the new digital media startup Newsreel Asia, which launched in May this year. Anupama Chandrasekaran, one of the founders and an audio producer at Newsreel Asia, says, “The idea was not to be tied down by the limitations of the pandemic but to continue telling stories without travel or studio needs. It was truly a low-cost exercise to produce something meaningful and timely in an experimental format.” Even if you have grown weary of pandemic-related content, or, having experienced it too closely, wish to put it all behind you, these stories will resonate because of their direct, even terse, simplicity. The format, says Chandrasekaran, “simply allowed the people whose story it is to tell it. No narrator, no frills, just a real slice of their life in their own words.”  Positive is currently available only on the Newsreel Asia web site, along with a small but promising set of other audio and video documentary series.

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Can schools be reopened during the pandemic?||By the end of June 2021 over 150 million children in 19 countries were either attending virtual classes or had no schooling at all. It has been more than a year since the first nationwide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in India in March 2020 when schools were closed and online classes came in vogue. Parents, teachers, administrators, governments and children themselves have raised major concerns over this potentially life-altering decision for the school-going children. The recent second wave of the pandemic has made everyone all the more anxious and apprehensive about the safety and wellbeing of children. This situation has not only led to the loss of education but also their social and mental wellbeing with hitherto unknown long-term consequences. Lessons learnt Moving beyond the emotional conundrum, let us look at what we have learnt over this past year about COVID-19 and its impact on children so as to make a scientific rationale towards the return of young pupils to the classrooms and hallways of school buildings. Children get infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but the overall risk of infection remains much lower than that of the adults. Studies suggest that children are half as susceptible to infection as adults mainly due to the biological difference of having fewer ACE2 receptors and that too mostly in the upper respiratory tract. These are the receptors in human cells through which the spike protein of the virus binds to the cells. Although mutations in spike proteins have been identified among the virus variants such as beta and delta, it is expected that children will continue to be less susceptible as long as ACE2 receptors remain the major binding sites for the virus. It is known that 90% of infections among children remain asymptomatic or mild, and although the few children with severe disease will need hospital care, only 1-2% require intensive care unit management. Children with underlying health conditions could be at higher risk for severe disease. With a low incidence of 12 per 100,000 children, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, the most life-threatening complication that can occur is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) but most children have recovered well with few deaths mostly attributable to management issues. The last nationwide serosurvey (December 2020-January 2021) reported that the proportion of children 10-17 years old with prior infection was similar to the adults at around 25%. This indicates that children were not at a higher risk of infection than the adults. It has been suggested that children had a relatively higher infection rate during the second wave of the pandemic. However, we did not see any rise in the overall proportion of COVID-19 positive children in the country. Global studies Globally and in India schools have never been reported as the focal point of any super-spreader event. Data over the past year from several countries where schools were functional at various levels clearly show that the rate of COVID-19 transmission among students in schools was much lower than in the community. These include studies from the U.S. of more than 90,000 students and teachers in North Carolina, and over 20,000 students and staff from 17 schools in rural Wisconsin. Researchers in Norway, Salt Lake City and New York City, U.S. found attack rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.7% in schools suggesting that infected students do not tend to spread the virus at school. Very low secondary attack rates – the risk of spread from one infected person to others in a closed setting – have been reported from school-based investigations in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Singapore and the U.S. However, attack rates of around 15% were reported from Israel when schools reopened in mid-May 2020 and were attributed to poor implementation of mitigation measures. We also need to watch out for the emergence of variants and the influence on transmission and detection of the virus in children. The level of community transmission in a district should be the key parameter to guide a graded approach to reopening of schools. For this purpose, a matrix of two indicators – the reported number of cases per 100,000 population and the test positivity rate – could be helpful to categorise districts. Pragmatic thresholds for each will need to be deliberated upon by public health experts. Districts with the lowest case burden as well as positivity rate would be the ideal places for resuming in-person classes. Safe return plan We need to have a safe return plan. This would entail stringent adherence to universal masking for staff and students, hand hygiene, physical distancing (more so between students and staff than between the students themselves) and adequate ventilation (keeping doors and windows open, use of fans and no air conditioning). Outdoor areas may be used as classrooms, when possible. Classroom routines will have to be redesigned to limit student interaction inside and outside classrooms, such as staggered timetables for different classes, fewer classes per day, shorter duration of classes etc. High levels of testing and contact tracing within schools would be critical after reopening of schools. Children are likely to remain asymptomatic even when infected, and hence facility for routine testing of students once or twice every week is a must. Although PCR testing is the current norm, antigen tests with high sensitivity and specificity and authorised for children and asymptomatic individuals are in the pipeline and could greatly increase access to testing in school settings. Protocols for contact tracing of infected students or staff, quarantine, isolation, temperature checks and symptom screening should be in place. Younger children seem to be less likely to get sick or transmit the virus than teenagers and adults. Modelling studies indicate that reopening secondary schools will impact community transmission more than reopening primary schools. These findings suggest that reopening of primary schools should take precedence over secondary schools until the community prevalence becomes relatively low to allow secondary schools to reopen. Vaccination of teachers and other school staff should be prioritised. It would not only influence transmission inside school premises but overall high vaccination coverage will reduce the COVID-19 burden paving the way towards safer schools. As parents, educators, health officials and public administrators now is the time to ask not if our schools should reopen but how and when we can make it happen. The intellectual, social, emotional and mental development of our children is at stake.

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The 2020 Millennium Technology Prize goes to…||The 2020 Millennium Technology Prize, announced in May, has been awarded to Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman, “for their development of revolutionary DNA sequencing techniques.” Their work is a perfect blend of science and innovation, and very apt as we have all heard a great deal about genome sequencing in the context of the ongoing pandemic. Emphasis on innovation Awarded by the Republic of Finland, along with top Finnish academic institutions and industries, The Millennium Prize has a 21st century outlook, with a strong emphasis on innovation. Past winners include Tim Berners-Lee (for implementing the world-wide web) and Frances Arnold (for her work on directed evolution in a laboratory setting). Three of the eleven awardees so far have subsequently won Nobel prizes. We wait, with bated breath, for Balasubramanian and Klenerman! Shankar Balasubramanian was born in Chennai, and has lived in England for most of his life. After his PhD, he joined the Chemistry Department, Cambridge University. He teamed up with David Klenerman, recruited by the Department around the same time. The initial aim was to build a microscope that could follow single molecules. Of special interest to him was the molecular machinery that DNA uses to make copies of itself. Somewhere in their discussions arose the germ of the idea for a new way to read the alphabet that make up DNA, and to thereby access the information stored in them. DNA (or RNA, in some viruses), the genetic material of life forms, is made of four bases (A, T, G and C; with U replacing T in the case of RNA). A chromosome is the duplex of a long linear chain of these – and in the DNA sequence is information – the blueprint of life. Life famously can replicate, and DNA replicates when an enzyme, DNA polymerase, synthesises a complementary strand using an existing DNA strand as the template. Breakthrough idea The breakthrough idea of Balasubramanian and Klenerman was to sequence DNA (or RNA) using this process of strand synthesis. They cleverly modified their ATGC bases so that each shone with a different colour. When copied, the “coloured” copy of DNA could be deciphered from the colours alone, using miniature optical and electronic devices. A very significant advance in their “Next Generation Sequencing” (NGS) method lies in the size of DNA that could be sequenced at one go – more than a million base pairs can be sequenced, which translates to hundreds of genes or even the whole genome of an organism. This is made possible by simultaneously sequencing hundreds of pieces of DNA at the same time. Many copies of this long DNA “sentence” are randomly broken up into small pieces, each no more than a few hundred bases long, which are all sequenced together. The “reads” are then fitted together, in the manner of a puzzle, to give the final sequence. This technology was spun off as a commercial entity, Solexa, with the initiative of Balasubramanian and Klenerman. This phenomenally successful startup was later acquired by the biotech company Illumina. Falling cost What about the cost of all this sequencing? When the Human Genome Project delivered the first, near-complete sequence of our genome, the cost was estimated to have been 3 billion dollars. As all our chromosomes together have 3 billion base pairs, it becomes an easy calculation – One dollar per sequenced base. By the year 2020, Next Generation Sequencing technologies had pushed the price for sequencing your genome down to a thousand dollars – when this technology becomes prevalent in India, this sum should become a few thousands of rupees! To think that a coronavirus genome has not 3 billion but 30,000 RNA bases – not surprisingly, this has resulted in an explosion of data on the genomes of the novel coronavirus and its variants. Health authorities in the United Kingdom have sequenced the viral genome of one out of sixteen people who have tested Covid-positive. The popular genomic data sharing site GSAID has over two million submissions of Cov-2 genomic sequences, from 172 countries. NGS has been at the heart of monitoring the spread of viral variants across the globe, and tracing the source of outbreaks. Shankar Balasubramanian continues to run a fine laboratory, focused on the design of therapeutic molecules that would tune down the uncontrolled expression of certain genes, and so control the damage they cause in conditions such as cancer.

Balasubramanian in collaboration with Sushil Chandani who is a professional computational biologist, sushilchandani@gmail.com )  dbala@lvpei.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/the-2020-millennium-technology-prize-goes-to/article35260268.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Cuba develops the world’s first conjugate vaccine for COVID-19||Cuba’s State-run corporation, BioFarma, said on Friday that its indigenously produced Soberana 2 vaccine was 91.2% efficacious in phase-3 trials. This follows closely on an announcement that another of its vaccines, Abdala, had reported an efficacy of 92.8% in late stage trials. The greater-than-90% efficacy puts them in a select league; however, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that had reported an efficacy of over 90%, both the Soberana and Abdala are three-shot vaccines. Both are subunit vaccines, meaning that a part of the virus fiorms the antigen and s hitched on to another construct. In Abdala the spike protein of the coronavirus is combined with a chemically manufactured adjuvant, whereas in Soberana 2, the spike protein is chemically linked to the tetanus toxoid, making it a conjugate vaccine. The design and manufacturing allows the vaccine to be stored in regular refrigeration settings of 2–8 degree Celsius. Conjugate vaccines  The most common conjugate vaccines are those used for Haemophilus influenza type b and the pneumococcal bacteria. However, a unique aspect of the Soberana vaccine is that it is by far the only one among coronavirus vaccine candidates that relies on the conjugate vaccine technology. Marlene Ramirez Gonzales, one of the scientists involved in the Cuban vaccine development project, in a March letter to the British Medical Journal explained the rationale: “The [Carribean] island’s four vaccine candidates against COVID-19 are developed as subunit vaccines, one of the most economical approaches and the type for which Cuba has the greatest know-how and infrastructure. From protein S - the antigen or part of the SARS-CoV2 virus that all COVID vaccines target because it induces the strongest immune response in humans - Cuban [vaccine] candidates are based only on the part that is involved in contact with the cell’s receptor: the RBD (receptor-binding domain) which is also the one that induces the greatest number of neutralising antibodies...Cuba had already developed another vaccine with this principle. It is Cheimi-Hib, ‘the first of its kind to be approved in Latin America and the second in the world’, against haemophilus influenzae type b, coccobacilli responsible for diseases such as meningitis, pneumonia and epiglottitis.” Experts say that while there are no inherent disadvantages to taking a conjugate-vaccine approach for coronavirus vaccines, they have generally been used against bacteria and not viruses. The two parts of a conjugate vaccine are typically connected by chains of polysaccharides, according to epidemiologist and public health expert, Chandrakant Lahariya, and they generally induce a weaker immune response in young children. “Cuba has a long history of vaccine development and has developed certain platforms that work to their advantage. So it makes sense for them to adopt this route. There is nothing inherently disadvantageous, though, to this approach,” he said. Effective response For an effective vaccine response, not only antibodies but even killer T-cells, or those produced by the immune system and capable of destroying infected cells, must be produced. In a protein sub-unit vaccine, the spike protein may be able to elicit a strong antibody response but when combined with the tetanus toxoid, a very widely used childhood vaccine and therefore one which the immune system recognises, such a T-cell response could also be generated and conferring more effective protection, said Shahid Jameel, virologist and Director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University. He added that while there could be “logistic” concerns with a three-dose vaccine, it wasn’t right to compare efficacies of various vaccines as those numbers had different contexts. “Every vaccine's efficacy results are in comparison to placebo, and not against another vaccine.... each trial was done differently.” While the efficacy results of the Cuban vaccines haven’t been published in peer-reviewed journals, that the vaccines have been developed entirely by the public health system and amidst a U.S. trade embargo, are among the reasons why they have evoked interest in several other Caribbean countries as well as beyond. Global response Iran’s Pasteur Institute has said it will participate in phase-3 clinical trials for Soberana 02, with another 60,000 to be enrolled in Venezuela. Other countries including Mexico, Jamaica, Vietnam, Pakistan and India have expressed an interest in the Cuban vaccines, as has the African Union (on behalf of all 55 of the African nations). Cuba, which exports medical services, has said it will apply different rates for vaccines depending on the importer’s ability to pay.  The island’s four vaccine candidates are subunit vaccines - the type for which Cuba has the greatest know-how.

11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Scream signals||Do humans perceive joyful or fearful screams more strongly? Most often, a human scream signals fear of imminent danger. But screaming can also express joy or excitement. For the first time, researchers University of Zurich have demonstrated that non-alarming screams are more efficiently perceived and processed by the brain than their alarming counterparts. The researchers investigated the meaning behind the full spectrum of human scream calls. The results revealed six emotionally distinct types of scream calls indicating pain, anger, fear, pleasure, sadness and joy. They found humans respond to positive screams more quickly and accurately and with higher neural sensitivity than to alarming screams. In the trials, 12 participants were asked to vocalise positive and negative screams that might be elicited by various situations. A different group of individuals rated the emotional nature of the screams, classifying them into categories. The brain activity of participants listening to the screams was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to know how they perceived, recognised, processed and categorised the sounds. They found different brain regions showed much more activity and neural connectivity when hearing non-alarm screams. “It's highly possible that only humans scream to signal positive emotions like great joy or pleasure. Unlike with alarm calls, positive screams have become increasingly important over time,” Sascha Frühholz says in a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/scream-signals/article35260271.ece
11 July 2021||New Delhi,||Up to Rs. 1 lakh fine for violating new noise pollution norms||Residents will now have to pay anywhere between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 1 lakh for violating noise pollution norms as the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has asked authorities to strictly implement revised rules. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s revised penalties, violators will have to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 for using a loudspeaker or a public address system at a public place without permission or during the night. The equipment will also be confiscated. The DPCC has issued directions to all DMs, SDMs, Delhi Police, and traffic police for strict compliance of these rules. Permissible levels A fine of Rs. 1 lakh will be issued for operating diesel generator sets of over 1,000 KVA capacity without permission, Rs. 25,000 for DG sets between 62.5 KVA and 1,000 KVA; and Rs. 10,000 for diesel generator sets up to 62.5 KVA. Permissible noise levels in residential areas is 55 decibel during the day time and 45 decibel during the night. In commercial areas, the permissible sound limit is 65 decibel during the day and 55 decibel during night. In sensitive areas, it is 50 decibel during the day and 40 decibel at night. Other than this, there are ‘silent zones’ that include areas that lie within 100 metres of schools, colleges, hospitals and courts. According to the order, in case of bursting of firecrackers beyond the prescribed limit within the premises of any RWA or at a marriage function, the organiser and the owner of the premises will have to pay Rs. 20,000 for the first violation. For the second violation, the organiser and the owner will have to pay Rs. 40,000. Thereafter, the fine will be Rs. 1 lakh and the premises will also be sealed. If noise pollution is caused by bursting of crackers beyond a limit at a marriage procession or public and religious rally, the organisers will have to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000. If it is in a ‘silence zone’, then the fine will be doubled. If an individual household bursts crackers in a residential or commercial zone, then the fine will be Rs. 1,000. However, it will be Rs. 3,000 in case of violation in a ‘silence zone’. In case construction equipment emits sound beyond the permissible limit, a fine of Rs. 50,000 will be imposed, the order also stated. DPCC officials said the penalties were revised by the CPCB in 2020 in which recommendations were made that violators be made to shell out more money for flouting permitted noise pollution limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-to-rs-1-lakh-fine-for-violating-new-noise-pollution-norms/article35260744.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Cauvery and the row over Mekedatu project||The story so far: On July 6, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru that his government would go ahead with the long-pending Mekedatu dam project in the Cauvery Basin to cater to the drinking water needs of the Bengaluru Metropolitan City and surrounding areas. On the same day, in New Delhi, Tamil Nadu’s Water Resources Minister Durai Murugan met Union Minister for Jal Shakti, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, and impressed upon him not to grant Centre’s clearance for the project. This was preceded by a July 3 letter Mr. Yediyurappa wrote to his Tamil Nadu counterpart M.K. Stalin, calling for talks on the subject. However, the latter did not explicitly react to Mr. Yediyurappa’s offer of negotiations, even as he explained why Tamil Nadu continued to oppose the project. Mr. Stalin has called an all-party meeting in Chennai on July 12. What do the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal and the Supreme Court say? The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, in its final order on February 2007, made allocations to all the riparian States — Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, apart from the Union Territory of Puducherry. It also stipulated “tentative monthly deliveries during a normal year” to be made available by Karnataka to Tamil Nadu. Aggrieved over the final order for different reasons, the States had appealed to the Supreme Court. In February 2018, the court, in its judgment, revised the water allocation and increased the share of Karnataka by 14.75 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) at the cost of Tamil Nadu. The enhanced quantum comprised 4.75 tmc ft for meeting drinking water and domestic requirements of Bengaluru and surrounding areas. What is Karnataka planning? Encouraged by the Supreme Court verdict, Karnataka, which sees the order as an endorsement of its stand, has set out to pursue the Mekedatu project. Originally proposed as a hydropower project, the revised Mekedatu dam project has more than one purpose to serve. Estimated to cost Rs. 9,000 crore, the project envisages the construction of a reservoir of 67.16-tmc ft capacity, which will come up about 4 km away from the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. A hydropower plant of nearly 400 MW has also been proposed. The Karnataka government has argued that the proposed reservoir will regulate the flow to Tamil Nadu on a monthly basis, as stipulated by the Tribunal and the Supreme Court. This is why Mr. Yediyurappa has contended that the project will not affect the interests of Tamil Nadu farmers. Why is Tamil Nadu opposed to it? Tamil Nadu feels that Karnataka, through the project, will impound and divert flows from “uncontrolled catchments” to it, a component which was taken into account by the Tribunal in the 2007 order while arriving at the water allocation plan for the State. As per an estimate, around 80 tmc ft of water flows annually to Tamil Nadu, thanks to the catchments including the area between Kabini dam in Karnataka and Billigundulu gauging site on the inter-State border, and the area between Krishnaraja Sagar dam in Karnataka and the gauging site. As the upper riparian State has adequate infrastructure even now to address the water needs of Bengaluru, there is no need for the Mekedatu project, according to Tamil Nadu. The Mekedatu project also does not find mention in the Tribunal’s final order or the Supreme Court judgment. Besides, given the unpleasant experiences that it has had with Karnataka in securing its share of the Cauvery water over the years, Tamil Nadu is wary of the assurances of the other side. What happens next? Tamil Nadu’s petitions against the project are pending with the Supreme Court. The project is yet to get environmental clearance from the Centre. A way out can be found if the two parties agree to the idea of a joint execution, operation and maintenance of the project or a third party’s participation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cauvery-and-the-row-over-mekedatu-project/article35260202.ece

11 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Biggest-ever haul: 354 kg heroin worth Rs. 2,500 crore recovered||In the biggest-ever drug recovery by the Delhi police, 354 kg of heroin worth Rs. 2,500 crore has been seized and four persons, including an Afghanistan national, have been arrested. Special Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Neeraj Thakur said the accused have been identified as Hazrat Ali, a resident of Afghanistan; Rizwan Ahmed, resident of Delhi; and Gurjot Singh and Gurdeep Singh, both residents of Jalandhar, Punjab.  Extensive network The police said the racket extended across several States as well as Afghanistan and Europe. Around 100 kg of chemicals used for preparing the contraband has also been seized. Police said information was recently received about Rizwan’s whereabouts and he was arrested from Ghitorni on July 5. He is allegedly involved in supplying drugs in Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. During interrogation, Rizwan allegedly told the police that he works for Isha Khan, who recently left India and is now based in Afghanistan. Rizwan allegedly told investigators he was asked by Isha to meet Gurpreet and Gurjot, who were operating a drug racket from Faridabad. Acting on the information, the two were arrested from a housing society in Faridabad. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said a huge recovery of heroin was made from the duo. Around 166 kg of heroin was recovered from a car, another 115 kg from a different vehicle, and another 70 kg was found in a secret cavity in a bed at their accommodation. On Rizwan’s instance, Hazrat Ali was arrested from Gurugram and 2 kg of heroin along with chemicals used to prepare the contraband was recovered. Talking about the modus operandi, Mr. Kushwah said the opium is grown in Afghanistan and then packaged and transported to Chabahar port in Iran. The consignment is then shipped to JNPT Jawahar Lal Nehru Post Trust Mumbai. Thereafter, the contraband is separated from legitimate exports and sent to makeshift factories in Madhya Pradesh for further extraction and processing. Locals, with the help of Afghan experts, process the heroin using chemicals. The heroin is then delivered across the country. Further investigation is under way, said the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/biggest-ever-haul-354-kg-heroin-worth-rs-2500-crore-recovered/article35260742.ece
11 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||People will pull down BJP govts.: Bansal||Haryana Congress in-charge Vivek Bansal on Saturday said the people suffering from inflation, poverty and unemployment would pull the Central and State government down, adding that the government, which had harassed and exploited the peasants, was not a “protector” but “predator”. Protest against inflation Mr. Bansal was addressing a gathering of the party workers and the public in Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri along with State party president Kumari Selja and senior leader Kiran Chaudhary as part of Congress’ State-wide protest against the rise in prices of petrol and diesel and cooking gas. A procession was also taken as part of the demonstration through the city, which included bullock carts and mule carts along with a large number of cycles. Attacking the Modi government for price rise, Mr. Bansal alleged that the country was suffering due to inflation, but Prime Minister Modi didn’t have ears to listen to grievances. Referring to the second wave of Covid, Mr. Bansal said there was no oxygen for patients, there were no beds in hospitals and helpless people were dying on the streets, but Mr. Modi’s focus was only on the tactics to grab power in West Bengal. ‘Voice of people’ Ms. Selja said the Congress would become the voice of the people suffering from inflation, poverty, corruption and unemployment. “Will fight the battle of the masses. The public is looking at us. The next government will be of the people,” said Ms. Selja. She said that at the behest of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi, they have come out on the streets to protect the interests of the people. She asked whether anyone had ever thought that the price of petrol would exceed Rs. 100 per litre. She added that this was the result of the anti-people policies of the present government. Ms. Choudhary said the large gathering at such a short notice was a clear indication that the government had lost the trust of the people. “The government has ruined the poor, the farmers and the workers. This government has cheated every section,” said Ms. Choudhary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/people-will-pull-down-bjp-govts-bansal/article35260704.ece
11 July 2021||Guwahati,||Police encounters continue in Assam; one more killed||Amid the Opposition parties decrying the rising number of police encounters under the Himanta Biswa Sarma government, one more murder accused was killed and two alleged ganja smugglers were injured as they “attempted to escape from custody” in separate incidents in Assam on Saturday. With the fresh casualties, at least 13 suspected insurgents and criminals have been killed and dozens, including rape accused and cattle smugglers, injured in police encounters in the State since the second BJP-led government assumed power two months ago. In BTR The latest incidents took place in Chirang and Kokrajhar districts, both part of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). A person accused of the murder of a homeguard was killed while attempting to escape from police custody in Chirang district. “Within 24 hrs Chirang Police cracked the case of brutal murder of Homeguard Eyad Ali. 3 persons arrested & the murder weapons were recovered. In an attempt to flee from Police custody, escaping accused Abdul Khalek sustained bullet injuries and later succumbed to his injuries,” Chirang district police tweeted. In another incident, Kokrajhar district police intercepted a truck allegedly smuggling 840 kg of ganja worth over Rs. 2 crore, at Srirampur near the Assam-West Bengal inter-State border. “While recovering another 10 kg of ganja, which the accused had hidden along the highway, the duo attacked the police personnel & tried to escape from the custody. “In order to prevent it, Police team resorted to control firing, in which both the accused were grievously injured,” the Kokrajhar district police said in a Twitter post. On July 6, a suspected drug peddler from Manipur was critically injured when he had allegedly tried to escape from police custody near Rani in Kamrup district. The rising number of shoot-out encounters in the last two months has whipped up a political furore in Assam with the Opposition alleging that the police has turned “trigger-happy” under the Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma-led regime, which assumed charge on May 10. Justifying the series of encounters since he assumed power, Mr. Sarma had on July 5 said that shooting at criminals “should be the pattern” if they attempt to escape from custody or try to snatch guns from the police to fire at them. ‘Dangerous effects’ State Congress chief Ripun Bora has said that Mr. Sarma’s statement has dangerous ramifications of turning Assam into a ‘police state’ by making law enforcers trigger-happy and disregard human rights. Raijor Dal chief and Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi has also alleged that “open killing” by the police is going on in the name of encounters. Assam Jatiya Parishad general secretary Jagadish Bhuyan has alleged that the surge in encounters was a ploy to “silence” the lower-rung criminals to protect their bosses, including politicians and top police officers, running illegal syndicates. The BJP, on the other hand, wondered whether the Opposition parties were unhappy that criminals had died.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-encounters-continue-in-assam-one-more-killed/article35260708.ece
11 July 2021||Chandigarh,||BJP expels Punjab ex-Minister for 6 years for ‘anti-party’ acts||The Punjab BJP on Saturday expelled former State Minister Anil Joshi from the party for six years. The action against Mr. Joshi came after he gave his reply to a show-cause notice issued by the BJP’s State unit for his “anti-party” activities. According to the notice, Mr. Joshi had been making statements against the Centre, the party’s central leadership and policies. Mr. Joshi was expelled on the directions of State unit chief Ashwani Sharma, according to a party statement. Mr. Joshi did not give up his stubborn attitude of going against the party, whereupon State BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, on the recommendations of a disciplinary committee, expelled him from the primary membership of the party for six years, the statement said. Earlier, in a reply to the show-cause notice, Mr. Joshi said he never spoke against the Centre’s farm laws and asked the State party chief if it was indiscipline to talk about farmers. The former Amritsar North MLA asserted that he always spoke about the party’s interests. “I neither spoke against the Centre’s farm laws nor against the Central leaders,” Mr. Joshi replied. ‘Talking about farmers’ He asked Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma whether it was indiscipline to talk about farmers. “Is it indiscipline to talk about arhtiyas , industrialists, small traders and labourers,” he asked. He added the workers are leaving the party and asked the State BJP chief whether giving a suggestion to save the party was indiscipline. Mr. Joshi also pointed out that initially, farmers protesting against the farm laws in the State had a few demands that could have been handled had the BJP’s Punjab unit made some efforts. ‘Blaming the party’ Mr. Joshi has been blaming the party’s State leadership for not giving a correct feedback to the Centre on the farm laws. He had also stated that it had become difficult for party workers to come out of their homes.

11 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha to start boating facilities by December||The Odisha government has set out to identify 100 vast waterbodies where boating facilities could be started for tourists by December. Although outlook for tourism economy recovery remains highly uncertain with the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of subsiding and the third wave already predicted, the government decided to encourage eco-tourism. At a high level meeting, Chief Secretary Suresh Chandra Mahapatra directed Forest and Environment, Water Resources and Tourism departments to jointly identify around 100 spots for starting boating. The departments have been asked to come up with the list in a month and take steps to set up the floating jetties so that activities should start by December, said Mr. Mohapatra in a statement. “Proper identification of location and their promotion will attract private investment that will take the State’s eco-tourism to next higher level,” he said. As per the plan, woman self-help groups and van surakshya samities and local communities should be provided adequate training and orientation to manage these places. Odisha has around 118 small and big dams including the major dams where boating facilities could be provided for tourists. Some lakes such as Chilika and Ansupa always add value to eco-tourism. Meanwhile, the Centre has identified four protected areas having huge prospects in eco-tourism. These are Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park, Chilika Wildlife Sanctuary, Gahirmatha (Marine) Wildlife Sanctuary and Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-to-start-boating-facilities-by-december/article35260711.ece
11 July 2021||July 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Unmarked graves and ‘cultural genocide’||The story so far: In late June, Cowessess First Nation, an indigenous organisation, found the remains of 751 people, mainly indigenous children, at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan province in Canada. This, as per Cowessess, was “the most significantly substantial” discovery of graves of indigenous children to date in the country. Indigenous groups have uncovered two more sites at former residential schools in recent months, both in British Columbia, taking the number of unregistered graves found since May 29 to 1,148. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “Canadians today are horrified and ashamed of how our country behaved.” Indigenous organisations have urged his government to probe the schools and expedite measures for reconciliation. This week, Cowessess First Nation signed an agreement with Saskatchewan and the federal government reclaiming its right to look after its own children.   What’s the residential school system? The residential school system was a federal government initiative aimed at forcefully assimilating indigenous children into the European way of life. Started in the 19th century, there were at least 130 residential schools across the country. The schools were funded by the federal government’s Department of Indian Affairs and run by churches, mostly the Catholic Church. In 1883, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald defended the system in Parliament. “When the school is on the reserve, the child lives with its parents, who are savages ... It has been strongly pressed on myself, as the head of the Department, that Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from parental influence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men,” he said. An amendment to the Indian Act in 1894, under Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell, made attendance at these schools compulsory for indigenous children. They were forcefully taken away from their families. Between 1883 and 1996, an estimated 150,000 indigenous children were sent to these schools. Many of them never reunited with their families.   What happened to the children? In the residential schools, the children were not allowed to speak their language or practise their culture. Many of them were emotionally, physically and sexually abused. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2008, estimated that some 4,100 children attending these schools either died or went missing. The Commission said it was impossible to reach a conclusion on the exact number of deaths because of the schools’ burial policy and poor record-keeping. In most cases, the authorities did not even hand over the bodies of the children to their families. The Canadian government’s Indian Affairs policy was to “hold the schools responsible for burial expenses when a student died at school”. The Commission wrote, “Parental requests to have children's bodies returned home for burial were generally refused as being too costly.” The children died mainly due to tuberculosis, malnutrition and other illnesses caused by the inhuman conditions inside the schools. Murray Sinclair, a former judge and Senator who headed the Commission, said recently that the actual number of deaths could be “well beyond 10,000”. Indigenous organisations have also claimed that the actual number is more than the official estimates. How has the Canadian government responded? In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued the first formal government-level apology to the indigenous community for the residential schools. The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission gathered some 7,000 statements from survivors of the schools to prepare a detailed report uncovering the truth behind the system. It also made 94 recommendations for reparation and reconciliation. The Commission report, published in 2015, concluded that the school system amounted to a “cultural genocide”. The recommendations included independent investigations into the crimes of the past and measures to protect Aboriginal rights and culture. Mr. Trudeau had promised during the campaign that addressing the indigenous question would be central to his agenda. But indigenous groups say the federal government has been slow in its response to the implementation of the Commission’s recommendations. Several First Nations, which are using ground-penetrating radar technology to mark human remains buried underground, have asked for government help in quickly uncovering graves. The Trudeau government had set aside 27 million Canadian dollars to search for graves, but did not release the funds until after the findings of the remains in British Columbia were announced earlier this year. Has the Catholic Church apologised? The Commission also asked the Catholic Church to issue an apology and take steps for reconciliation. After the latest discovery of graves, Pope Francis said “the sad discovery further raises awareness of the pains and sufferings of the past”, but stopped short of issuing an apology. In 2018, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops said the Pope could not personally apologise for the residential school system.  Murray Sinclair, who headed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said the number of deaths in the residential school system could be ‘well beyond 10,000’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/unmarked-graves-and-cultural-genocide/article35260200.ece
