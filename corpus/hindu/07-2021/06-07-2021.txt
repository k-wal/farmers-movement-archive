06 July 2021||Mumbai,||Tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy dies in Mumbai hospital||Tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy, 84, who was an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon caste violence case, passed away on Monday afternoon, the Bombay High Court was told. Dr. Ian D’souza, medical director of the Holy Family Hospital where Fr. Swamy was admitted on May 29 after having contracted COVID-19 while in Taloja jail, told a division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar that he had pulmonary infection, post COVID-19 complications in the lungs and pneumonia. Dr. D’Souza said the Jesuit priest suffered cardiac arrest at 4.30 a.m. on July 4 and was put on ventilator. He never regained consciousness. Senior advocate Mihir Desai, representing Fr. Swamy, said, “We have no grievance against the hospital. However, we cannot say the same thing about the National Investigation Agency [NIA] and State authorities. I am seeking a judicial probe into this as there was a delay of 10 days in taking him to the hospital from jail.” The Bench said, “...this is shocking news. We passed that order ... to take him to the hospital of his choice. We have no words to express our condolences.” Mr. Desai said the NIA did not seek his custody even for a day and he was sent to Taloja jail as soon as he was arrested from Ranchi on October 9, 2020. He requested the court to pass an order to hand over the social worker’s body to Father Frazer, his friend and former principal of Xavier’s college. Mr. Desai sought the submission of all medical reports and the post-mortem report to the court. Fr. Swamy was shifted to the private hospital from Taloja jail on May 29 after directions from the High Court. He tested positive for COVID-19 on May 30. He also had lower back pain and bilateral hearing loss among other ailments, and was suffering from Parkinson’s disease. His request for a sipper to drink water was turned down. The Jesuit priest, through videoconferencing, told the court on May 21: “I am eating less and less and my co-accused are worried about me. I would prefer to suffer and die like this in Taloja jail than be admitted to J.J. Hospital. Only one thing that I would request the judiciary is to consider interim bail. That is the only request.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tribal-activist-father-stan-swamy-dies-in-mumbai-hospital/article35160283.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBSE to cut syllabus, hold board exams in Nov. & April||With continuing school closures and examination disruptions due to COVID-19, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a new assessment scheme for Class 10 and 12 students this year. In 2021-22, it will reduce the syllabus, hold board examinations twice during the year in different formats, and ensure continuous recording of internal assessment scores in order to have a variety of options to calculate a final score at the end of the year, according to a notification issued on Monday night. Result of uncertainty The announcement comes after widespread uncertainty during the 2020-21 academic year, when the second wave of COVID-19 caused the postponement and then cancellation of year-end board examinations. The CBSE finally asked schools to use a combination of scores from Class 10, 11 and 12 and internal marks to calculate the final results. “The syllabus for the Board examination 2021-22 will be rationalised similar to that of the last academic session,” said the notification. Last year, the examination syllabus was reduced by 30%. The CBSE has divided the 2021-22 academic year into two terms with 50% of the syllabus to be covered in each term, with board exams to be held at the end of each term, according to the notification. The first term exam will be held on a flexible schedule between November-December 2021, with a window period of 4-8 weeks for schools situated in different parts of the country. It will be a 90-minute paper with multiple choice questions only, likely to be conducted in schools with the supervision of external superintendents. The second term exam will be held in March-April 2022 in examination centres, and is likely to be a two-hour exam with various question formats. In case the pandemic situation is not conducive for such a long, descriptive exam to be held, the second term exam will also be conducted with a multiple choice question format. The CBSE will issue guidelines to make internal assessments, practicals and project work more credible and valid to ensure fair distribution of marks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cbse-to-cut-syllabus-hold-board-exams-in-nov-april/article35160281.ece
06 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Gradual revival of monsoon likely by July 8||The southwest monsoon, which has been weak over Kerala so far, is likely to shed its lethargy and gradually revive by July 8. “According to the latest numerical weather prediction model guidance, the southwest monsoon is likely to revive gradually over south peninsula, including the west coast and adjoining eastcentral India, from July 8,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. A low-pressure area is likely to form over the westcentral and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal off the coasts of north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha around July 11. Several districts of Kerala can expect isolated heavy rainfall over the next few days, the IMD Meteorological Centre here indicated on Monday. Yellow alert has been sounded for Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Idukki, Thrissur. and Kozhikode on Tuesday and all the aforementioned districts plus Malappuram, Kannur and Kasaragod on Wednesday. Ernakulam, Idukki and Thrissur and the northern districts except Palakkad are on yellow alert on Thursday and Friday. Kerala has recorded a deficit of 43% in the southwest monsoon rainfall between June 1 and July 5. All districts except Kottayam recorded deficient rainfall. Kottayam has reported a deficit of 16%, but in IMD terminology, percentage departures between -19% and +19% from the normal is considered ‘normal’ rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gradual-revival-of-monsoon-likely-by-july-8/article35160613.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,||45:45:10 ratio to promote II PU students, govt. tells High Court||The State government on Monday told the High Court of Karnataka that it will promote regular or fresher students of second year pre-university (PU) courses by giving 45% weightage for their marks in SSLC or equivalent board exams, 45% for I PU marks and 10% for their internal assessment marks of II PU given by their respective colleges. Also, the government said that it will pass all repeaters of II PU exam by giving them minimum passing marks along with 5% grace marks in their respective subjects. Even private candidates, who are appearing as repeaters, will be promoted by giving passing marks along with 5% grace marks. However, private candidates, who are appearing for the II PU exam for the first time, will have to appear for the exam that will be conducted when the COVID-19 situation eases in the State. The government said that all those students who have registered for II PU exam for improving their earlier marks can retain marks awarded in each subject earlier or they can appear for the exam along with private candidates. The government submitted a statement giving out details of policy of promoting repeaters and private candidates before a Division Bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice Hanchate Sanjeevkumar during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition. When the Bench asked about the policy formulated to promote regular or fresher students, government counsel orally said that it [the government] will follow 45:45:10 ratio for promoting regular or fresher students for the academic year 2020-21. Meanwhile, the government also told the Bench that the results of regular or fresher students of II PU and repeaters will be announced before July 31 as directed by the Supreme Court. The petitioner, S.V. Singre Gowda, who is a managing trustee of Gnana Mandira Education Trust, Bengaluru, had termed as discriminatory the decision of the government to promote only fresh/regular students without holding exam and to conduct exams for repeaters and private candidates when the pandemic situation eases. Exam by Aug. 31 The Bench, while recording the government’s policy to promote repeaters also without conducting exam, directed the government to conduct exam for private candidates and those who want to improve their earlier marks by August 31 and declare results by September 20 in view of declining number of COVID-19 positive cases in the State. While recording these submissions on behalf of the government, the Bench disposed of the petition. In its June 17 order, the Bench had directed the government not to declare the results of the II PU course till a decision was taken based on suggestions made by an expert committee set up to study methodology to be applied for promoting II PU students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/454510-ratio-to-promote-ii-pu-students-govt-tells-high-court/article35160334.ece
06 July 2021||CHENNAI,||As restrictions ease, tourists start trickling into hill stations in T.N.||With the Tamil Nadu government easing the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and doing away with e-registration and e-pass for intra- and inter-district travel, tourists have started trickling into popular hill stations. Bryant Park, one of the major attractions in Kodaikanal, was reopened after 75 days. Visitors were screened before entry. Rajan, a tourist from Rajapalayam, drove to Kodaikanal to take a break from the lockdown. “For all these months since April 2020, I did not leave my house. With the situation having improved, I am planning to stay here for the next two to three days,” he said. Lack of guidelines However, in Yercaud and the Nilgiris, all parks and attractions remained closed as the administration waited for specific orders, officials said. According to officials of the Horticulture Department, six parks and eco-tourism sites under the Forest Department in Yercaud remained closed due to lack of government guidelines. Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya said the district administration was awaiting orders from the State government to reopen tourist spots. While restrictions on the movement of visitors from other parts of Tamil Nadu had been lifted, visitors from other States, including Kerala and Karnataka, would still have to apply for an e-pass and await approval before entering the district, officials said. But with the lockdown severely affecting the finances of almost everyone, taxi operators like Adbul at the Seven-Road junction in Kodaikanal said the government should extend some assistance to them. “We expect the government to give us financial assistance and also waive the interest on EMI for car loans for a year,” he said. Meanwhile, restaurants across Tamil Nadu resumed dine-in service after a long gap. Only 50% of patrons were allowed at a time, as per the government guidelines. Places of worship were thrown open to devotees after many weeks. Clubs and hotels ushered in patrons. Long-distance bus services resumed across the State, with uniform relaxations being offered.

06 July 2021||Vijayawada,||‘Visit unauthorised projects in TS first’||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has written a letter to Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Monday requesting him to prevail upon Telangana to stop the indiscriminate drawal of water from the Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar (NSP) and Pulichintala projects for power generation and to direct the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to visit the unauthorised projects under execution in Telangana before inspecting the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS). The Chief Minister also appealed to Mr. Shekhawat to immediately notify the jurisdiction of the KRMB and to keep all the offtakes of water (for power generation, irrigation and drinking) in the common reservoirs under the control of the KRMB with the CISF protection for effective operation and maintenance in the interest of both States. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said it was disheartening to bring to the Union Minister’s notice the blatant violation of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 and of the operational protocols and directions of the KRMB by Telangana, and that it was depriving Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) of its rightful share of the river water and causing a huge wastage of water. He complained that Telangana was drawing water for power generation though power was incidental to irrigation needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/visit-unauthorised-projects-in-ts-first/article35160275.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC aghast that Section 66A of IT Act is still used||The Supreme Court on Monday found it “distressing”, “shocking” and “terrible” that people were still booked and tried under Section 66A of the Information Technology (IT) Act even six years after it struck down the provision as unconstitutional and a violation of free speech. Section 66A had prescribed three years’ imprisonment if a social media message caused “annoyance” or was found “grossly offensive”. The court, in the Shreya Singhal  judgment authored by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman in March 2015, had concluded that the provision was vague and worded arbitrarily. On Monday, senior advocate Sanjay Parikh and advocate Aparna Bhat, for the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said the number of cases registered under Section 66A had actually increased post the judgment. “What is going on is terrible, distressing! We will issue notice,” Justice Nariman, heading a three-judge Bench comprising Justices K.M. Joseph and B.R. Gavai, exclaimed. ‘Only as a footnote’ Attorney General K.K. Venugopal pointed out that law books published post the verdict featured the non-existent Section 66A “in full”. “The police officer, while registering a case, looks at only the Section in the main text... The fact that the Section has been struck down is given only as a footnote...,” he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-aghast-that-section-66a-of-it-act-is-still-used/article35160279.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Twitter failed to comply with IT rules: Centre||The Centre on Monday informed the Delhi High Court that micro-blogging site Twitter had failed to comply with India’s law regulating tech companies, losing its immunity as ‘intermediaries’. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), in an affidavit filed before the court, stated that despite three months time being granted to all Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) to comply with the Information Technology (IT) Rules 2021, Twitter had failed to fully comply with the same. Twitter, last week, had informed the High Court that the interim Resident Grievance Officer and the interim Nodal Contact Person in India had resigned from their positions in June. The tech giant stated that it was in the final stages of appointing replacements; meanwhile, “grievances of Indian users are being addressed by the Grievance Officer”. The MeitY, however, pointed out that as per the details gleaned from Twitter’s website, grievances from India were currently being handled by its personnel situated in the United States, “which amounts to non-compliance with the IT Rules 2021”. In India, Section 79 of the IT Act shields social media platforms or intermediaries such as Twitter from liability for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by it in certain cases. The Ministry said when an intermediary fails to observe the IT Rules, the intermediary could be liable for any punishment under any law for the time being in force in respect of the offending content. The Ministry stated that immunity conferred on intermediaries is a “conditional immunity” subject to the intermediary satisfying various conditions. “The IT Rules, 2021 are the law of land and Respondent No. 2 (Twitter) is mandatorily required to comply,” it added. The Ministry’s affidavit came in response to a petition by advocate Amit Acharya, seeking to appoint a Resident Grievance Officer under Rule 4 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/twitter-failed-to-comply-with-it-rules-centre/article35160285.ece

The MoHFW also said no privacy impact assessment of the use of FRT was conducted prior to its deployment. “Facial recognition authentication is used as one of the methods for Aadhaar authentication for online verification of beneficiary prior to COVID-19 vaccination wherein facial template is captured and sent to UIDAI for verification of image of beneficiary,” the Ministry said in response to an RTI filed by the not-for-profit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF). It also stated that no additional procurement had been made for the implementation of FRT-based verification, and a pilot project for such authentication is still under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-facial-recognition-used-to-verify-jab-recipients/article35160274.ece

06 July 2021||Mumbai,||Maratha quota: Maharashtra seeks Centre’s intervention||The Maharashtra legislature on Monday passed two resolutions asking the Centre to intervene in the issue of reservation to OBCs and the Maratha community. Minister Chhagan Bhujbal presented the resolution requesting the Central government to provide empirical data on OBCs to reinstate the political reservation of the community in local civic bodies. “The Supreme Court decision is not limited to Maharashtra. It will affect every State in the country, including those run by the BJP. The Centre must make empirical data available as sought by the top court,” he said. The Assembly and Council also passed a resolution to ease the 50% limit on reservation to ensure Socially and Economically Backward Class (SEBC) be given reservation benefits. Minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the Cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, presented the resolution saying that irrespective of the State or Centre having the right to declare Marathas as SEBC, unless the 50% cap on reservation is lifted, the community would not be able to enjoy the benefits. “This is not limited to Marathas in Maharashtra. Many castes in different States are demanding the same and this needs to be handled by the Central government,” he said. Mr. Chavan pointed out that the Supreme Court has rejected the revision petition filed by the Central government regarding 102nd constitutional amendment. He also made a slew of announcements for SEBC candidates such as increasing the age-limit for some benefits to 43 years. “The 2014 candidates who received the appointment letter before the court order will be made permanent,” he said. Earlier, Mr. Bhujbal presented the correspondence between former Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis with Niti Aayog seeking empirical data on the OBCs. He was replying to Mr. Fadnavis’ objection that the present tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government did not act as mandated by the Supreme Court by appointing the Backward Class Commission for 15 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maratha-quota-maharashtra-seeks-centres-intervention/article35160736.ece
06 July 2021||Mumbai,||Fr. Swamy had a long list of ailments||Father Stan Swamy had told the Bombay High Court that he preferred to die in prison rather than get treated in any hospital. On May 21, a committee of doctors, led by the dean of J.J. Hospital, examined Father Swamy. Their report said, “He has bilateral upper limb tremors, bilateral hearing loss, generalised weakness, occasional loose stools, and occasional lower back pain. He had tremors in both upper limbs and these tremors increased in action and in different postures. He had sluggish reflexes in lower limbs and normal reflexes in upper limbs. He had an imbalance of gait. His audiogram showed that he had moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and severe sensorineural hearing loss in the left.” The committee advised that he should be provided with physical assistance, physical support in the form of a walking stick and a wheelchair as per requirement. A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and S.P. Tavade noted, “We have observed that he has severe hearing problems and he is physically very weak. He has categorically stated that he does not want to be treated at any hospital and he will prefer to die in jail rather than get admitted to any hospital.” Father Swamy had told the court that his general health completely deteriorated after he was sent to Taloja prison and that “there is a lot of give and take in the prison”. He insisted that he should get interim bail. While rejecting Father Swamy’s medical bail, the special NIA court said, “ Prima facie it can be gathered that Fr. Stan, along with other members of the banned organisation, hatched a serious conspiracy to create unrest in the entire country and to overpower the government, politically and by using muscle power.” On March 22, 2021, judge D.E. Kothalikar said, “There are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation of commission of the offences punishable under chapters IV [punishment for terrorist activities] and VI [terrorist organisations] of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the applicant is prima facie true. Considering the express bar imposed by Section 43D(5) [no person accused with chapters IV and VI shall be released on bail], he cannot be released on bail.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fr-swamy-had-a-long-list-of-ailments/article35160210.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CoWin made open source: PM||The CoWin platform is being made open source and it will be available to all countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the CoWin Global Conclave here on Monday. He said that with nearly 200 million users, the Aarogya Setu app was a readily available package for developers. “There is no parallel to such a pandemic in hundred years and no nation, however powerful, can solve a challenge like this in isolation,” Mr. Modi said, and added that all had to work together. “Guided by the approach of ‘One Earth, One Health’, humanity will certainly overcome this pandemic,” he said. Trustworthy proof Stating that India has adopted a completely digital approach while planning its vaccination strategy, the Prime Minister said a secure and trustworthy proof helped people establish when, where and by whom they had been vaccinated. “Digital approach also helps in tracking the usage of vaccination and minimises wastage,” he said. “Furthermore, vaccinated people do not need to carry around fragile pieces of paper to prove anything. It is all available in digital format,” the Prime Minister said. He also highlighted the customisability of the software to the local requirements of the countries interested in it. Speaking about the CoWIN Global Outreach Programme, R.S. Sharma, CEO of the National Health Authority, said India endeavoured to share this tech-enabled vaccination platform as a free public good with the world. “It is a known fact that nations across the world are endeavouring for universal vaccination amidst the steepest timelines,” said Dr. Sharma, adding that “it’s clear that as we thrive in the age of digital in the 21st century, we can’t rely on methodologies from a century ago of achieving herd immunity by letting a pandemic leave the society devastated, like the Spanish Flu did.” “Persistent immunisation is going to be, by far, the most effective means to keep our people safe, globally,” he said. Dr. Sharma said that CoWIN has become the fastest tech platform in the world to amass over 200 million registrations in a record four months, and then 300 million registrations in a mere five months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cowin-made-open-source-pm/article35160222.ece
06 July 2021||Mumbai,||12 MLAs suspended for a year from Maharashtra Assembly||Twelve BJP MLAs have been suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly for one year for “abusing” and “misbehaving” with the presiding officer in chair, both inside and outside the Assembly. The Assembly also passed two resolutions asking the Union government to intervene in the issue of reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and the Maratha community. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab presented a resolution to suspend the MLAs and the House passed it on a majority vote. The BJP, while boycotting the House, termed it an act to suppress its voice and an attempt to bring down the number of the Opposition. The MLAs — Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Harish Pimple, Jaikumar Rawal, Yogesh Sagar, Narayan Kuche, Bunty Bhangdiya, Parag Alvani and Ram Satpute — will be barred from entering the Assembly premises for the next 12 months. The ruckus inside the Assembly took place as the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government brought a resolution seeking empirical data on OBCs from the Union government. Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised a point of objection before senior Minister Chhagan Bhujbal presented the resolution, claiming that the State government did not follow the Supreme Court’s directions for 15 months. After allowing Mr. Fadnavis to speak, Shiv Sena MLA Bhaskar Jadhav, who was the presiding officer in the Speakers’ chair, directed Mr. Bhujbal to read out the reply and present the resolution. As he denied Mr. Fadnavis an opportunity to reply to Mr. Bhujbal, agitated BJP MLAs rushed in front of his chair and smacked the mike. They also tried to lift the sceptre in front of the Speaker’s chair. The House was adjourned for 10 minutes after the resolution was passed. It was then adjourned three times for 15 minutes and once for 30 minutes. The Assembly and Council also passed a resolution to ease the 50% limit on reservation to ensure Socially and Economically Backward Class (SEBC) be given reservation benefits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/12-mlas-suspended-for-a-year-from-maharashtra-assembly/article35160184.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Union Cabinet likely to be expanded this week||The long-anticipated reshuffle and expansion of the Union Cabinet is likely to take place this week, according to highly placed sources. The expansion, with 24 slots to fill and multiple Ministries held by single Ministers to be decoupled, has been talked about for a while now. The possibility of it happening either on July 7 or 9 is now being talked about with more certainty. Several shoo-ins in the Union Cabinet, including a leader from north-central India who is owed a ministerial berth as a political quid pro quo and a leader from eastern India, have cancelled their travel plans and have been asked to be in Delhi on those dates. Party appointments Sources in the BJP said the Cabinet expansion will also affect the organisational appointments in the party as a senior general secretary of the BJP is expected to get a Cabinet berth. Government sources were largely mum but did say that the inductions would take into account the needs of the States going to the polls next year, including Uttar Pradesh, from where Anupriya Patel of NDA ally Apna Dal is likely to be inducted. “Multiple Ministries are currently being handled by one Minister or other — there are four such clusters of Ministries that need to be redistributed and the Cabinet reshuffle exercise is likely to address that issue,” said a source. According to the Constitution, the number of Ministers in the Union council of Ministers cannot exceed more than 15% of the total Lok Sabha members. This puts the number of ministerial slots vacant as of now at 24 — a sizeable number. Sonowal’s chance Whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will fill the slots in one go or just restrict it to necessary inclusions — such as that of Jyotiraditya Scindia who joined the BJP last year and helped topple the Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government — is yet to be seen. The names of Ashwini Vaishnaw, MP from Odisha and an aide to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Rakesh Singh, MP from Madhya Pradesh, are also doing the rounds. As of now Mr. Scindia and former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who gracefully gave way to Himanta Biswa Sarma after his government was voted back to power in Assam, seem to be the strongest candidates in the list of inclusions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-cabinet-likely-to-be-expanded-this-week/article35160268.ece
06 July 2021||PATNA,||‘My regime was not jungle raj, it was rule of the poor’||For the first time after over three-and-a-half years of incarceration, ailing Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad inaugurated the party’s 25th foundation day virtually from Delhi on Monday, and asserted that “his regime was not jungle raj , as is being projected by political rivals”. In his nearly 30-minute address to party workers and leaders, a frail Mr. Prasad regretted that he was unable to be physically present among them because of his ill health. “My regime was not jungle raj , as is projected by rivals. It was the rule of the poor. During the last Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, I wanted to come out [of jail], but could not,” he said as workers and party leaders, including Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav (his sons), watched him on a large screen at the party headquarters in Patna. He hailed the party workers and commended both his sons for their oratory skills. “I want to assure the people that we’re not going to step back and will not be cowed down by the pressure and conspiracies of our political rivals. Tejashwi should not be discouraged, as the future of RJD is very bright and we’ll take the country ahead,” Mr. Prasad said. Out on bail The ailing RJD chief, who was convicted in several fodder scam cases, came out on bail recently and has been recuperating at the residence of his elder daughter and party Rajya Sabha member, Misa Bharti, in New Delhi. He was sent to the Ranchi Central Jail, but served most his sentence at a government hospital in Ranchi for multiple ailments. Recently, he was shifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. “If Tejashwi and Rabri Devi [his wife] had not taken me to AIIMS in Delhi, I would have died in Ranchi. But I’ll come to Patna soon and tour the State to meet everyone,” he said. ‘Regular training’ He said farmers, youth and students associated with the party should undergo “regular training”. “People believe that only the RJD can end the current problems.” He accused the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar of corruption and mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis. “Every day, at least four murders take place in Bihar. Lakhs of people have been rendered jobless and reduced to being migrant labourers,” Mr. Prasad said. Hitting out at the BJP government at the Centre, Mr. Prasad said, “Inflation and unemployment has broken the backs of the people. After GST and demonetisation, there is an economic crisis in the country and there is an attempt to create a rift in the social fabric. After Ayodhya, some people are talking about Mathura. For power, they are ruining the country.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/my-regime-was-not-jungle-raj-it-was-rule-of-the-poor/article35160180.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cities along rivers urged to include conservation plans||Cities situated on river banks will have to incorporate river conservation plans when they prepare their Master Plans, says a policy document from the National Mission for Clean Ganga. The guide document, while spelling out provisions in the National Water Policy that emphasise the need for such plans, also says that these “river-sensitive” plans must be practical and consider questions of encroachment and land ownership. “There is a need for a systematic rehabilitation plan for such encroaching entities that emphasises on alternative livelihood options in addition to a relocation strategy. Planners should make every attempt to engage with such entities during the preparation of the Master Plan in order to develop empathetic and humane solutions,” the document notes. The recommendations are currently for towns that are on the main stem of the the Ganga. There are, as per the estimate of the policy document, 97 of them encompassing five States — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal. The plan must also clarify on land ownership. A key aspect of conserving and protecting river and riverine resources involves increasing green cover in the vicinity of the river by creating green buffers, removing concrete structures and employing “green infrastructure.” However, implementing such solutions will require restrictions on the Floor Area Ratio, ground coverage and setting limits on the maximum permissible heights of buildings. “Ascertaining the land ownership in these areas is, therefore, important to avoid legal complications while the Plan is being implemented,” says the document. The Master Plan should n0t mandate specific technologies, but it can “create an environment” for facilitating the use of state-of-the-art technologies for river management. These include satellite-based monitoring of water quality; artificial intelligence for riverine biodiversity mapping; big data and citizen science for river-health monitoring; and unmanned aerial vehicles for floodplain mapping. These were being used across the world successfully. Cities with an ongoing Master Plan tenure ought to be conducting an “immediate analysis” of the extent to which these the river guidelines could have been adopted and this “will help” in incorporating the appropriate revisions when the current plan is reviewed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cities-along-rivers-urged-to-include-conservation-plans/article35160224.ece
06 July 2021||Mumbai,||He fought tirelessly for jal , jungle and zameen for tribals||Father Stanislaus Lourduswamy, who was popularly known as Father Stan Swamy, was born in Tiruchirappalli in the then Madras Presidency on April 26, 1937. He had been a priest for 51 years and fought tirelessly for jal (water), jungle (forest) and zameen (land) for the tribal people. Father Swamy, who passed away at 1.24 p.m. on Monday, was arrested on October 8, 2020, by the National Investigation Agency from Bagaicha in Ranchi, where he lived. Father Tony, who lived with Father Swamy at Bagaicha for several years, said, “His life was very inspiring to me personally. He always stood up for those who were denied justice, especially the Adivasis. He was moved by how they were denied the fundamental rights and always tried to work for them. He always stood up for those displaced and constantly wrote about their rights. It always inspired me.” Advocate Peter Martin, who filed the public interest litigation petition on behalf of Father Swamy before the Jharkhand High Court, said, “The irony is that he was so engaged in the work for the under-trial people implicated in false cases and he died as an under-trial.” Activist Siraj Datta, who worked with him on several issues for close to a decade, said, “He was a wonderful human being. He was extremely committed to working for the voiceless people and helped them get their due.” N. Ram, former Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu and Director, THG Publishing Private Ltd.; former Supreme Court Judge Justice Madan Lokur, and writer Nayantara Sahgal spoke at an online condolence meeting for Father Swamy. Very courageous: N. Ram Mr. Ram recollected his time with Jesuits in college and their commitment towards the marginalised and the poor. He said, “Father Stan was very courageous and stoic and was on a mission to work for the tribals. I would like to call attention to the authoritarian and communal trends that we see around us with a number of injustices, human rights violations, violations of law.” Mr. Ram also spoke about co-accused Sudha Bharadwaj in the case. “Let us not forget Sudha Bharadwaj, who has been languishing in Byculla jail for two-and-a-half years. This just shows a very poor commentary on courts for not acting in time. The way institutions are being manipulated to obey the diktats coming from above. We have to bring more solidarity in our polity,” he said. Mr. Lokur observed, “I am disappointed with the courts and prosecution in this case. This is ‘inhuman.’” While in prison, Father Swamy had said, “We will still sing in chorus. A caged bird can still sing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fr-swamy-tirelessly-fought-for-jal-jungle-and-zameen/article35160211.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘ONORC scheme in Delhi, Bengal soon’||Delhi and West Bengal are expected to roll out the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ (ONORC) scheme by the end of the month, while Chhattisgarh is still in the process of acquiring the necessary devices, according to Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey. However, the low penetration of Aadhaar in Assam due to concerns linked to the National Population Register (NPR) is hampering the implementation of ONORC there, he told presspersons on Monday. “In Assam, the basic reason is that the Aadhaar penetration is still low and we are working with UIDAI on that. As Aadhaar seeding improves, then Assam should also follow. We are pushing hard,” he said. “There are issues related to the National Population Register, so Aadhaar seeding [of ration cards] itself is only 36-38% in comparison to the national rate of 92%,” he said. However, he declined to elaborate on how Aadhaar for ration purposes is linked to the NPR, or the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Centre is engaged in political battles with the non-BJP governments in Delhi and West Bengal regarding their failure to roll out ONORC, but has taken a different tack so far on Assam, which is a BJP-ruled State. “In the case of Chhattisgarh, process for procurement of ePOS [or electronic Point of Sale] has begun. Almost 4000 devices are expected to be delivered in July, and the remaining in August,” said Mr. Pandey. “Delhi and West Bengal will be coming on board very soon as their ePOS machines have been installed and testing trials are happening. Central and State teams are working together in close coordination on this.” These are the only four States that are not implementing the ration card portability scheme that the Centre has been pushing as the solution for migrant workers’ difficulty to access subsidised food, especially during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/onorc-scheme-in-delhi-bengal-soon/article35160190.ece
06 July 2021||New Delhi,||Sonia to meet Amarinder today||Amid the ongoing political turmoil in Punjab, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is likely to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday to give a final shape to a compromise formula to end the bitter factionalism. The party had announced that by the first week of July, it hoped to put the infighting behind it. For the past several weeks now, the State has witnessed a very public feud between the Chief Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu. Last week, Mr. Sidhu had an hour-long meeting with former party chief Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra where his role in the Punjab Congress is said to have been discussed. Prior to that, Mr Sidhu and Captain Amarinder had separately met the three-member All India Congress Committee (AICC) that had been set up to resolve the issue. The AICC panel — comprising Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, general secretary (Punjab) Harish Rawat and J.P. Aggarwal — is learnt to have recommended that Mr. Sidhu needs to be suitably accommodated apart from suggesting a 18-point programme. While the Chief Minister has been open to suggestions on cracking down on sand and transport mafia, improving the power situation and visible action in the 2015 sacrilege issue, he is opposed to making Mr. Sidhu the Pradesh Congress Committee president. The Chief Minister wants the PCC to be headed by someone from the Hindu community and not a Jat Sikh since the government is headed by one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sonia-to-meet-amarinder-today/article35160208.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Survey of Class 3 students to set baseline for literacy goals||The Centre’s NIPUN Bharat Mission has set a goal that by 2026-27, every Class 3 child should be able to read with understanding at the rate of at least 60 words per minute, be able to read and write numbers up to 9,999 and solve simple multiplication problems. For this purpose, Rs. 2,688 crore has been set aside under the existing Samagra Shiksha scheme for 2021-22, said Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank at the launch of the mission on Monday. A National Achievement Survey of Class 3 students to be conducted this November will set a baseline to track future progress. “Until grade 3, children are expected to ‘learn to read’ and acquire basic skills. After grade 3 children are expected to be able to ‘read to learn’. If this does not happen, the learning gap continues to widen from that point, as the texts in the language textbooks and mathematical concepts become more complex and abstract in later grades,” said the NIPUN Bharat guidelines. “Thus, grade 3 is the inflection point and this is where children who have not made it, get left behind.” Apart from reading with comprehension, a child of 8 or 9 years should be able to write grammatically correct sentences, and converse with clarity using suitable vocabulary in the home or school languages. Together with simple number problems and the ability to identify shapes, time and date, fractions, and measurements in real-life situations, these goals are collectively being called the foundational literacy and numeracy skills every child should possess. Stage-wise targets Similar stage-wise targets are being set in a continuum from the pre-primary or balvatika classes. The NIPUN Bharat strategy includes changes in curriculum and teaching methods to include more activity, art and story-telling, creation of print-rich materials and resources, teacher training, and stress-free assessment methods in order to reach these goals. NIPUN Bharat also emphasises the importance of using a child’s mother tongue in teaching, a principle of the National Education Policy 2020, which received some criticism. “The mother tongue of the child must be the language of communication [if not the medium of instruction] with the child in school in the formative years, so that the child does not suffer any confusion in understanding the transactions and is able to grow with free expression,” said the guidelines. It noted that most children, given sufficient instruction, can learn to read in their own home language within 4-6 months if there is oral comprehension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/survey-of-class-3-students-to-set-baseline-for-literacy-goals/article35160216.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC describes plea on ‘toolkit’ as frivolous||The Supreme Court on Monday reminded a person who took offence to a “Congress toolkit” that India is a democracy where he can choose to ignore something he does not like or agree with. The petitioner, Shashank Shekhar Jha, wanted a National Investigation Agency probe into the toolkit which allegedly dealt with the government’s handling of COVID. Mr. Jha said the Congress party’s registration should be suspended if the “anti-national acts” were proved. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah found the petition frivolous. “Mr. Jha, if you don't like the toolkit, you can ignore the toolkit,” Justice Chandrachud advised the petitioner. Justice Chandrachud said parties engage in political propaganda, and it was left to each individual to engage with or ignore them. Mr. Jha, however, referred to how Singapore had objected to “propaganda”. “Oh... India is a democracy, you know,” Justice Chandrachud replied. Mr. Jha had even suggested a preliminary inquiry into the toolkit to see if any offences under sedition law or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act were made out. “The time of the Supreme Court is taken up by such frivolous petitions,” Justice Chandrachud said. The court allowed the petitioner to withdraw his petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-describes-plea-on-toolkit-as-frivolous/article35160225.ece
06 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC to hear U.P. govt. on conversion issue||The Delhi High Court on Monday extended the interim direction to the Delhi Police to ensure the safety of a woman from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who had converted from Hinduism to Islam on her own accord, till July 22. The next hearing has been scheduled for that day. Justice Rekha Palli said she could not pass any direction in relation to the case without first hearing the Uttar Pradesh police. As no counsel for the police was present during the videoconferencing hearing, Justice Palli ordered that a copy of the woman’s petition be served to standing counsel of Uttar Pradesh in the Supreme Court. “Before any orders are passed, against Respondents 4 [U.P. police] and 5 [U.P. government], which is situated beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this court, it is deemed appropriate to hear Respondents 4 and 5,” the High Court said. On July 1, the court directed the Delhi Police to take adequate steps to protect the life and safety of the 29-year-old woman. Renu Gangwar, in her petition, said she converted from Hinduism to Islam on May 27 of her “own free will and without any threat or coercion from anyone”. Following this, she changed her name to Ayesha Alvi, which was published in newspapers. Ms. Alvi, who is a resident of Tilhar, Shahjahanpur, and working in Delhi, allegedly started getting calls from different reporters requesting a meeting. However, even after her refusal, a reporter allegedly came to her place in Tilhar and took photographs and videos without her permission, she said. “The petitioner [Ms. Alvi] is facing extreme threat to her life and that of her immediate family members who are being witch-hunted by the officials of the Uttar Pradesh police as also by the media and the vigilante groups,” she stated in her plea. One reporter allegedly demanded money while threatening to publish the news of her conversion. “When she refused, he made threats again. Thereafter, he took Rs. 20,000 from her,” the petition, filed through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra and Nitin Kumar Nayak, said. Ms. Alvi said she was “an adult and protected by the Constitution to choose her own faith and she cannot be targeted and harassed for the choice she makes with regard to the religion she follows”. She urged the Delhi High Court to protect her from being taken away from its jurisdiction “by force or coercion and or by way of any other illegal means by the agencies of the State or any other person”.

06 July 2021||PATNA,||Amid rousing welcome, Chirag begins his yatra||Chirag Paswan, who is locked in a fierce tussle with his uncle and rebel party MP Pashupati Kumar Paras to gain control of the Lok Janshakti Party, received a rousing welcome on Monday in Patna and Hajipur from where he embarked on his Aashirwad Yatra across the State on the occasion of the birth anniversary of his late father and founder of the party Ram Vilas Paswan. The rival group led by Mr. Paras also celebrated Ram Vilas Paswan’s birth anniversary, with his supporters, at the State party headquarters in Patna. A large number of LJP leaders and supporters welcomed Chirag Paswan at the Patna airport with slogans attacking his uncle and party leader Pashupati Kumar Paras for his “betrayal”. Hundreds of cars and motorbikes followed Mr. Paswan’s motorcade which, after a brief stopover at his house in Patna, moved to the statue of B.R. Ambedkar near the High Court. Mr. Paswan wanted to offer floral tribute at the statue before embarking on his Yatra, but the gate of the premises was locked. He and his supporters then proceeded to sit on a dharna for some time. “We had informed the district administration in advance about our programme,” said Mr. Paswan. His supporters shouted slogans against the Bihar government and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Later, Mr. Paswan and his supporters left for Hajipur in Vaishali district, from where his father Ram Vilas Paswan had won elections several times, to embark on his Aashirwad Yatra. His motorcade grew in number and hundreds of party workers and leaders welcomed Mr. Paswan in Hajipur, now represented by Mr. Paras in Parliament. “I am beginning my yatra from Hajipur because it was my father’s karmbhoomi (land of labour) and will take this yatra to every district of the State,” Mr. Paswan told mediapersons in Delhi before setting off on his journey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-rousing-welcome-chirag-begins-his-yatra/article35160205.ece

06 July 2021||New Delhi,||No information on Cong. reshuffle: Adhir Ranjan||Breaking his silence over reports of his removal as the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday said none from the party had informed him about any such change. Mr. Chowdhury, however, said he was a foot soldier of the party and would follow the leadership’s instructions. “I have no information about it as none from the party has informed me so far,” Mr. Chowdhury, a five-time Lok Sabha member, told The Hindu over phone from his constituency, Berhampur in West Bengal. “Whatever responsibility is given to me by leadership, it becomes my dharma [duty] to carry on,” he added. On Sunday, reacting to a report that Mr. Chowdhury was being removed as the Lok Sabha leader, official sources of the party called it “premature and unfounded”. However, there was no categorical denial as Mr. Chowdhury is likely to lose one of his posts: either his position as the West Bengal Congress chief or Lok Sabha leader. And it will be timed with other changes in the All India Congress Committee (AICC). After the death of AICC in-charge Rajeev Satav, the Congress high command needs to appoint a new in-charge for Gujarat that will go to the polls at the end of 2022; find a replacement for Jitin Prasada who was the West Bengal in-charge; accommodate Rajasthan Congress leader Sachin Pilot as well as rehabilitate Ramesh Chennithala who was replaced as the Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly.

06 July 2021||Srinagar,||Alliance vows to reverse changes of Aug. 2019||The five-party People’s Alliance for the Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) in Jammu and Kashmir, which held a series of meetings on Sunday, reiterated that all parties would “fight together to reverse the unconstitutional and unacceptable changes foisted on the people of J&K on August 5, 2019 using all constitutional, legal and political means at its disposal”. “The PAGD’s struggle for undoing these changes will continue as long as it takes while striving to achieve this objective as early as possible,” it said. The alliance’s stand assumes significance as it comes a day ahead of the visit of the J&K Delimitation Commission to hold meetings with political parties, civil society groups and the officials.

Justice Mukta Gupta also sought a response from the ED on Mr. Purkayastha, who is also the founder of NewsClick, seeking anticipatory bail in the money laundering case. The court noted that a copy of the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), registered by the ED in the case, had not been provided to the petitioners yet. The High Court will hear the case again on July 29. The agency, represented by advocate Amit Mahajan, submitted that Mr. Purkayastha had appeared before the agency for investigation once and had sought 10 days’ time to bring certain documents. However, he did not appear again, Mr. Mahajan said. When the court asked why the ED had not yet supplied the ECIR copy to the petitioners, counsel said the agency was waiting for him to appear before it and then it would provide the ECIR copy. Counsel also said the agency would issue fresh summons to Mr. Purkayastha to join the investigation. To this, the judge orally said, “So, when you issue summons, also give the copy of the ECIR to him”. NewsClick has sought the quashing of the First Information Report (FIR) lodged by the Delhi Police on its allegations of foreign funding on the ground that it did not disclose any cognisable offences as alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-extends-interim-protection-to-purkayastha/article35160182.ece

Stan Swamy, who was such a passionate crusader for social justice,” the tweet added. General secretary of the Communist Party of India D. Raja said Fr. Swamy’s death was an institutional murder. “Both the State machinery and the judiciary are responsible for his death. The State was not ready to give him even a straw... The judiciary’s conduct is also questionable. On what grounds did they deny bail to a 84-year-old person who was suffering from multiple illness.” Kavita Krishnan, member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) politburo, hit out at the Central government as well as the judiciary over Fr. Swamy’s death. “Modi & Shah have accomplished the custodial killing of the gentle Jesuit social worker Fr Stan Swamy, who spent his life serving the oppressed. I hope the judges who denied him bail never get to sleep at night: they have blood on their hands,” she said in a tweet. CPI (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said he was “deeply pained and outraged” at the death of Fr. Stan. “...A Jesuit priest & social activist he tirelessly helped the marginalised. Draconian UAPA custody, inhuman treatment since October 2020 with no charge established,” he said in a tweet. Dr. Stanislaus D’Souza S.J. of the Jesuit Provincial of India, said: “I express my deepest condolences to the family members, friends, lawyers, well-wishers and all those who stood by Stan.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/activists-and-leaders-call-for-accountability/article35160186.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||CBSE to cut syllabus, hold board exams in Nov., April||The second term exam will be held in March-April 2022 in examination centres, and is likely to be a two-hour exam with various question formats. In case the pandemic situation is not conducive for such a long, descriptive exam to be held, the second term exam will also be conducted with a multiple choice question format. The CBSE will issue guidelines to make internal assessments, practicals and project work more credible and valid to ensure fair distribution of marks. Schools must create a student profile for all assessment undertaken over the year and retain the evidence in digital format, with marks uploaded onto CBSE’s IT platform, said the notification. The CBSE has made provisions for different assessment scenarios depending on the pandemic situation. If both term exams are held, the final theory marks will be equally split between the two. If the pandemic forces complete school closures in November and December, the first term exams will be conducted online or in homes, and would carry reduced weightage in the final results. If the second term exams cannot be held, the final results would be based on an increased weightage for the first term exam scores and internal assessment marks. If schools are completely closed, and both the first and second term exams have to be conducted at home, the final results will include weightage for the scores in internal assessment, projects and practical work, as well as both term-end examinations. “In all the above cases, data analysis of marks of students will be undertaken to ensure the integrity of internal assessments and home based exams,” said the notification issued by CBSE academic director Joseph Emmanuel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbse-to-cut-syllabus-hold-board-exams-in-nov-april/article35160188.ece

Hundreds of BJP workers took part in the protest and clashed with the police in central Kolkata. Among those taken into custody were BJP MLA and head of the party’s women wing, Agnimitra Paul, and BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. There was a huge deployment of police to control the first major law violation event organised after the Trinamool Congress government came to power for the third consecutive time in May 2021. The State BJP leadership said more than 50 leaders were arrested. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the police restored to unprovoked use of force. “What has the Trinamool Congress government to fear that they are preventing a peaceful protest?” Mr. Ghosh asked. The State BJP president said administering fake vaccines to hundreds of people was a serious issue and could not be brushed under the carpet. The fake vaccination scam came to the fore last month, when hundreds of people were administered fake vaccines by an impostor claiming to be an IAS officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-arrest-protesting-bjp-leaders-in-west-bengal/article35160194.ece
06 July 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata urges PM to cut taxes on petrol, diesel||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said she was shocked that the retail prices of petrol had crossed Rs. 100 a litre across many States In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she urged him to substantially reduce the taxes charged by the Central government on petrol and diesel. “It is my earnest request that the taxes charged by the Central government on petrol and diesel be substantially reduced to give much-needed relief to the common people and also to check the overall inflationary trend in the country today,” she wrote. In the two-page communication, Ms. Banerjee pointed out that the petrol and diesel prices had been hiked eight times since May 4. Out of these, prices were hiked six times in June and four times in one week. “Wholesale Price Index [WPI] in the country rose by 12.94% in May 2021, compared to May 2020. Similarly, Consumer Price Index rose by 6.30% where the prices of edible oils used by common people every day, rose by 30.8%, eggs by 15.2%, fruits by 12% and health-related items, in the middle of the pandemic, by as much as 8.44%,” the letter stated. ‘Staggering’ revenue Ms. Banerjee noted that the Central government had collected a “staggering” revenue of Rs. 3,71,725 crore from oil and petroleum products in the financial year 2020-21, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. “In fact, over the past six years of your government, Government of India’s tax collection from oil and petroleum products has jumped by a staggering 370% since 2014-15 due to constant hikes in Central Excise Duty on oil and petroleum products, including cesses and surcharges at the cost of the common people,” she observed. The Centre was constantly increasing the cess component of Central taxes, which resulted in the denial of the State’s legitimate share of 42% tax collected by the Centre. “I sincerely urge you to desist from the anti-federalist trend development in the last few years,” the letter said. It comes at a time when the petrol price in most of the districts of the State had crossed over Rs. 100 a litre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-urges-pm-to-cut-taxes-on-petrol-diesel/article35160195.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Avoid attachment||Many philosophical and psychological insights pertinent to an individual’s worldly existence can be drawn from the skilful depiction of the Jadabharata episode by Vyasa in the Bhagavata Purana, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. King Bharata had been a righteous ruler and duly fulfilled all the duties devolved on him. At one stage in his life, he gave up all this and chose to lead an austere life in the Himalayas to seek liberation. His life as a hermit is described as exemplary in the Bhagavata Purana. Yet, he slipped from his aim of salvation at the end of his life owing to the attachment and concern he developed towards a motherless young deer. He began to believe that the deer too endeared itself to him and derived much comfort from this thought. Once, when the deer was missing, he became greatly agitated and worried. His mind imagined all the likely dangers that the deer might have met with. The more he thought of all these, the more he longed for its presence as he believed that it will be safe only in the ashram. He would ruminate thus: Will the deer come back before the sun sets and sit on my lap once again and remove my distress? He even forgot the austerities he had been practising all these years and concentrated only on the deer. Sastras advocate practice of compassion as a virtue and also warn against show of dvesha towards any object or being. But when concern turns into possessiveness, it ties one to samsara. Rama worried about all the sufferings that Sita would be undergoing and was inconsolable. Lakshmana tried to calm Him by pointing out that all human contacts and relationships are very temporary and one should accept that parting from all these is inevitable. It is attachment that makes separation unbearable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/avoid-attachment/article35160214.ece

The Forum for Durgotsab, a platform of 500 community Durga pujas in the city, took to Facebook on Sunday to say that the countdown has begun, and a list of norms, to be adopted for this year’s celebrations, would soon be prepared. State minister and one of the spearheads of big-ticket Chetla Agrani Puja, Firhad Hakim, said “this is not the time to organise a gala Durga puja”. “We have asked our clay modeller to make an idol which is comparatively smaller in size,” he said. His cabinet colleague Subrata Mukherjee, maintained that the panel has decided not to invest in dazzling illumination, a hallmark of the puja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/for-second-year-low-key-durga-puja-on-the-cards/article35160659.ece

Mr. Adhikari, who quit the Trinamool and joined the BJP ahead of the Assembly election, is an accused in the 2016 Narada tapes case, and Mr. Mehta is representing the CBI in the Supreme Court and the Calcutta High Court in the agency’s probe against senior Trinamool leaders in the matter. After the allegations surfaced, Mr .Mehta had clarified that though Mr. Adhikari came to his residence, he declined to meet him. In the memorandum submitted to the President, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray and Mahua Moitra MPs, said, “Such a meeting, between the Solicitor-General, who is also appointed as the Special Public Prosecutor for the CBI, and an accused person being investigated by the same agency, raises extremely serious doubts of impropriety.” After the meeting, Ms. Moitra told presspersons that Mr .Mehta’s clarification was untenable. One cannot just saunter into the Solicitor-General’s residence like you drop in to see a friend, she said. “We will not let this matter be swept under the carpet.” The memorandum also seeks to draw a connection between Mr. Adhikari visit to Home Minister Amit Shah and to Mr. Mehta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-mps-urge-kovind-to-remove-tushar-mehta/article35160200.ece

06 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination drive launched for employees of commercial hubs||The Greater Chennai Corporation has launched a bulk vaccination campaign for traders and employees of commercial establishments in crowded areas. On Monday, Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi and Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan launched the programme for traders in T. Nagar. “At least 5,000 traders in T. Nagar are yet to be vaccinated. We will conduct the vaccination programme for five days there,” Mr. Bedi said. “Traders, shopkeepers and their employees, who directly deal with customers, will be put on the priority list for vaccination. At a joint meeting with the Police Commissioner and the Collector, we told the traders’ associations that if they come forward, then the Corporation will organise special vaccination camps. Our appeal is that all traders should get themselves vaccinated, and should prominently display a board saying the same outside their shops,” he said. Footfall in T. Nagar shops has been rising after the relaxation of the lockdown, and the vaccination of employees is expected to prevent the spread of COVID-19. On the first day, Corporation teams administered 214 doses of Covaxin and 463 doses of Covishield to traders, shopkeepers and their employees in T. Nagar. All staff in T. Nagar’s commercial outlets are expected to be vaccinated this week. All employees in commercial areas, such as George Town, will also be vaccinated shortly. Corporation officials have been directed to assist traders in getting the second dose of the vaccines on time. Traders with comorbidities will be identified and assisted by the primary health centres in their neighbourhoods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-drive-launched-for-employees-of-commercial-hubs/article35160401.ece
06 July 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||T.N. govt. should focus on pandemic, says Anbumani||PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Monday disagreed with the State government’s decision to use the term ‘Union government’ instead of ‘Central government’, and said that just by changing names nothing is going to happen. “The Indian Constitution says Union of States. But by just changing names, nothing is going to happen. The State government should bring good schemes to Tamil Nadu by speaking with the Central government,” he said at an event organised to release the party’s 19th shadow finance budget for the State. The DMK government should concentrate on the pandemic and should prevent the third wave in State, he added, while welcoming its decision to form an Economic Advisory Council comprising distinguished economists. The party’s founder, Dr. S. Ramadoss, who released the shadow budget, said the State’s revenue could be increased by Rs. 2,22,125 crore to a total revenue of Rs. 4,98,585 crore. While promising a strong Lokayukta in the State to curb corruption, the shadow budget also allocated Rs. 5,000 per month to unemployed youth based on their educational qualifications and Rs. 2,000 per month to poor families. The budget also allocated Rs. 25 lakh crore to improve infrastructure in the State for the next 10 years. It promised proportional representation to various caste-groups. With the appropriate handling of mineral resources, revenue of Rs. 2,09,945 crore could be earned. It stated that Rs. 50,000 crore from the revenue expenditure of Rs. 4,27,426 crore would be used to pay off Tamil Nadu’s debt in 10 years. Dr. Ramadoss said that an ‘Action Taken Report’ and an ‘Economic Survey’, much like the Central government, would be published for Tamil Nadu and said that the State’s economy must grow at 10% for the next 10 years. Dr. Anbumani said ‘non-taxable revenues’ would be increased to Rs. 2.09 lakh crore and around Rs. 1 lakh crore and Rs. 25,000 crore could be obtained through the sale of granite and M-sand. “As a pilot project, government buses will be free for everyone in Chennai and for women and children in districts. This will improve the economy and also reduce pollution,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-govt-should-focus-on-pandemic-anbumani/article35160412.ece

Stalin chaired a meeting of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) at the Secretariat on Monday to review inter-departmental coordination between government agencies to face possible disasters. An official release said Mr. Stalin instructed authorities to employ all available techniques to reduce the loss of human and other lives and loss and damage to property during disasters. Tamil Nadu should be made an expert in managing any disaster, he said. “In the recent times, disasters have not been natural. Humankind has had to take responsibility for them. The change in climatic conditions has not been normal. We should understand the change,” an official release quoted Mr. Stalin as saying during the meeting. Officials should take steps to prevent disasters, Mr. Stalin said. Recalling the Governor’s announcement in the Assembly on setting up of an expert panel to prevent flooding in Chennai, he advised officials in this regard. As Cuddalore was flood prone too, he instructed officials to take precautions against flooding in the district. The urban poor and farmers in rural areas are the worst affected during disasters, he said, instructing officials to ensure their safety and compensate them for their loss. Volunteers and NGOs in the respective areas can be roped in for disaster management, he said. Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu and Commissioner of Revenue Administration K. Phanindra Reddy also made presentations during the meeting. Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, DGP C. Sylendra Babu, Finance Secretary S. Krishnan, Home Secretary S.K. Prabakar, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, Revenue Secretary Kumar Jayant, School Education Secretary Kakarla Usha, Higher Education Secretary D.

06 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All eyes on Stalin’s move on Vanniyar quota||All eyes are on Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s decision on implementing the 10.5% internal reservation for Vanniyakula Kshatriyas within the 20% quota for the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in education and employment in government services, with the Supreme Court refusing to stay the operation of the law. The Chief Minister’s move is being keenly watched as admissions to undergraduate courses are expected to begin in a month. When asked whether the government would begin enforcing the law, Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi and Minister for Backward Classes Welfare S.S. Sivasankar referred to Mr. Stalin’s statement in the Assembly last month. During a debate on the motion of thanks to Governor Banwarilal Purohit for his address to the House, the Chief Minister told PMK floor leader G.K. Mani that a “good decision” will be taken after consulting the officials of the departments concerned. Also called the Special Reservation Act of 2021, the law got the Governor’s assent on the day the Bill was passed by the House on February 26, which was just before the Election Commission's announcement on the poll schedule for five States, including Tamil Nadu. Apart from carving out 10.5% for the Vanniyakula Kshatriyas, the law distributed the remaining portion of the quota for the MBCs and Denotified Communities (DNCs) among two groups — 7% for 25 MBCs and 68 DNCs and 2.5% for the remaining 22 MBCs. The Act has mentioned seven sub-castes under the entry ‘Vanniyakula Kshatriya’. A former official of the State government, who has been studying the subject of internal reservation for the Vanniyars for years, feels that if the government chooses to enforce the law, it marks an “acknowledgement of the community’s identity”. Despite the community’s representatives demanding a higher share, the previous AIADMK regime went by the quantum — 10.5% — that was mentioned in the recommendation made to the government in 2012 by M.S. Janarthanam, the then Chairman of the State Backward Classes Commission, and this was cited by his successor M. Thanikachalam while providing his opinion on the matter. The former official added that the new scheme of internal reservation would be more beneficial to the community in education than in employment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-eyes-on-stalins-move-on-vanniyar-quota/article35160396.ece

Preetha Reddy, vice-chairperson of the Apollo Hospitals Group, and Srinivasa Rao, president of RCME, signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the project — Healing Tiny Hearts — on Monday.  The project aims at supporting 500 paediatric cardiac surgeries or interventions to correct congenital heart defects of economically underprivileged children, according to Mr. Rao. Ms. Reddy said that of every 1,000 babies born, eight had congenital heart diseases. She stressed on the need for access to timely surgery and intervention to save their lives. The Department of Paediatric Surgery, headed by Neville Solomon, has performed over 5,000 paediatric cardiac surgeries over a decade. Dr. Solomon said the hospital has a dedicated operation theatre, catheterisation laboratory, ECMO facility and paediatric heart transplant unit. Newborn babies just a few hours old and weighing only 1.2 kg have been successfully operated on. The department of paediatric interventional cardiology has done more than 10,000 complex interventions in children, a press release said. The paediatric cardiac programme is run with the help of the CM’s health insurance scheme, donations from Save a Child’s Heart Initiative, crowdfunding platforms and the RCME. The programme has an initial target of helping at least 500 children over a period of one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/apollo-childrens-hospital-signs-mou-for-healing-tiny-hearts-project/article35160403.ece

06 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Co-accused get advance bail in cases against Siva Shankar Baba||The Madras High Court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to some of the co-accused in two out of three cases booked so far against self-styled godman Sivashankaran alias Siva Shankar Baba on charges of having sexually abused girl children of a residential school on the outskirts of Chennai. Justice M. Dhandapani granted advance bail to Deepa Venkataramanan in two cases. The other co-accused R. Karunambikai, Dhivya Balasubramanian and Neeraja Jayaraman were granted bail in one of the three cases. All the petitioners were ordered to surrender their passports before the lower court concerned. The judge also ordered that the petitioners must appear before the investigating officer every day for two weeks. The advance bail was granted after senior counsel A. Ramesh and advocate D. Selvam argued that there were hardly any materials to implicate the petitioners in the alleged crime. The counsel said there were no direct allegations against the petitioners either in the First Information Report or in the victims’ statements recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. They said the petitioners had been arrayed as the co-accused solely because they happened to be staff of the residential school founded by Sivashankaran. They also pointed out that one of the present complaints against the petitioner had been lodged by a former student of the school for an incident that allegedly took place in 2012. On the other hand, Government Counsel Raj Thilak told the court that so far three FIRs had been booked against the prime accused and statements had been obtained from four victims. Many more former students were in touch with the police and wanted to lodge complaints. If anticipatory bail was granted to the present petitioners at this stage, it would deter others from approaching the police, he said. However, the judge said such considerations could not be taken into account to deny bail to people against whom there were no direct allegations in the Section 164 statements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/co-accused-get-advance-bail-in-cases-against-siva-shankar-baba/article35160414.ece
06 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Centre ready with counter affidavit in NEET committee case||The Centre on Monday informed the Madras High Court that it would file its counter affidavit to a case filed by BJP State secretary K. Nagarajan, challenging the constitution of the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee, by Tuesday. The State government constituted the panel last month to study the impact of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on medical admissions in the Tamil Nadu. Appearing before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan said the Centre’s counter affidavit was ready, and it would be filed in the court. He agreed to serve copies of the counter affidavit on the writ petitioner and numerous parties, organisations and others who wanted to get impleaded in the case. Since the Centre’s counter affidavit was essential to decide the case and because numerous impleading petitions in support of the committee had been filed, the first Division Bench decided to hear all of them in the afternoon session on July 13. It ordered that the Centre’s affidavit be filed by July 8 and be served on the counsel for the DK, the DMK, the MDMK, the CPI and others who wanted to get impleaded. The judges said they would not formally allow all of them to get impleaded in the case, since it might lead to confusion. Nevertheless, all of them would certainly be given an opportunity of a hearing, since the issue was of importance and all stakeholders ought to be heard, the Chief Justice said. Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram said he had filed a counter affidavit on behalf of the State government, and was ready to argue the case. Senior counsel P. Wilson, representing a student who wanted to get impleaded, said he had circulated all judgments related to the case. He went on to state that the constitution of a committee on the issue was not new and referred to Justice P. Kalaiyarasan committee’s recommendations, which led to the 7.5% reservation for government school students in medical admissions. In his reply, advocate V. Raghavachari, representing Mr. Nagarajan, said, “All arguments against NEET have been taken into consideration by the Supreme Court and rejected. There is resistance to NEET only in Tamil Nadu. It is a political game, and must end.” Mr. Wilson accused the petitioner of having approached the court in the garb of a public interest litigation petition. He said: “This is an ideological clash in Tamil Nadu.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-ready-with-counter-affidavit-in-neet-committee-case/article35160384.ece
06 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Webinar on heart valve diseases on July 8||A webinar on ‘Transcatheter Technology: Repairing Heart Valves Without Surgery’ will be held on July 8 as part of The Hindu Wellness Series presented by Apollo Hospitals. Dr. G. Sengottuvelu, senior interventional cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, will be in conversation with Serena Josephine, special correspondent, The Hindu, at 11:30 a.m. The webinar will look at the advent of transcatheter technology. One of the latest advancements in the field of cardiology, it has been gaining momentum over the past few years. In this, diseased heart valves are replaced through a minimally invasive approach instead of an open-heart surgery in eligible patients. Conventionally, surgery has been the standard treatment for patients with valve diseases, such as aortic stenosis. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, also known as transcatheter aortic valve implantation, has enabled doctors to opt for a less invasive procedure for replacing the diseased valve by inserting a catheter, which carries the valve, most commonly through an artery in the leg, and is delivered to the heart.

06 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Central scheme ensures 16.5 lakh tonnes of free foodgrains to T.N., U.T.||The Central government has so far provided 16.5 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, estimated to cost Rs. 7,588 crore, to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry free of cost under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) as a relief measure for people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to R.D. Nazeem, Executive Director, south zone, Food Corporation of India (FCI). The quantity was in addition to the normal allotment under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The PMGKAY, which was in operation between April and November 2020, was being implemented again for the last two months. It would continue till November. Of the additional quantity supplied to the State and the Union Territory, rice accounted for 15.78 lakh tonnes and wheat 72,830 tonnes. “In Tamil Nadu, around 3.57 crore beneficiaries are covered under NFSA, and are provided an additional 5 kg of rice/wheat (per head) free of cost,” Mr. Nazeem said. In respect of those not covered under the NFSA, the FCI gave 10.09 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, costing about Rs. 3,354 crore, to Tamil Nadu. The price of rice, which was “a highly subsidised rate”, was Rs. 22 per kg, the official noted. [The State government was supplying additional entitlement of rice, too, free of cost to non-NFSA beneficiaries of the public distribution system.] The FCI was holding around 13.7 lakh tonnes of foodgrains [equivalent to about four months' requirement of Tamil Nadu] in its godowns. It had increased its capacity, and could hold up to 17.06 lakh tonnes. Besides, the State government had procured around 36.25 lakh tonnes of paddy, which would result in the delivery of 24.16 lakh tonnes of rice, Mr. Nazeem said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-scheme-ensures-165-lakh-tonnes-of-free-foodgrains-to-tn-ut/article35160421.ece

Status report The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy insisted on making the existing buildings disabled-friendly, and called for a status report from the State government by September 13. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by visually challenged advocate M. Karpagam through her counsel R. Prabhakaran. The judges said the status report filed by the government on Monday did not indicate whether all public buildings across the State could be accessed freely by the disabled. “The respondents are reminded that no new public buildings may be constructed or sanctioned or planned without providing access for persons with disabilities and ensuring toilets and other facilities for such persons. The official respondents, particularly the Public Works Department and its officials, should be acquainted with the governing statute and the national building code to ensure that the mandatory instructions therein are adhered to without any exception,” the court said. During the course of the hearing, the Chief Justice said he found that some court buildings in the State were not easily accessible to the disabled. Immediately, he ordered the provision of ramps and toilets for them. He also called for a district-wise access audit report of public buildings in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-public-buildings-should-be-disabled-friendly-hc/article35160540.ece

Murugan’s statement that the State was wasting Cauvery water by letting it drain into the sea. “Mr. Murugan has made baseless claims that Karnataka is sharing Cauvery water as per the final order and that it is Tamil Nadu that has been wasting the water for the last two years. He has especially claimed that following the setting up of the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), Tamil Nadu is getting Cauvery water without any problems. This is like hiding a full pumpkin in rice and is highly condemnable,” Mr. Alagiri said. He added that the Central government has not even appointed a full-time Chairman for the CWMA for the last three years. “There is absolute lethargy on the part of the Central government. Also, last April, the government brought the CWMA under the Jal Shakti Ministry, thereby infringing on the State’s rights and burying the federal structure of the country,” he said. The Congress leader also said the BJP-led Central government was deceiving Tamil Nadu on the issue and that the State BJP president must immediately withdraw his statement that is anti-farmer, especially against those belonging to the delta districts, or face severe consequences.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-slams-murugans-remark-over-cauvery-water/article35160411.ece

We are questioning the State government’s decision to form an expert committee since this is against the order of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench,” he said at a press conference. Mr. Nagarajan said the BJP was the only party concerned about the welfare of students and charged that the Congress, the Left and the DMK that had supported NEET earlier were engaged in “an eyewash on NEET now”.

06 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||TNAU experts identify native grasses, fodder trees to improve elephant habitats||A group of experts from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) and its Forest College and Research Institute (FC&RI) at Mettupalayam has undertaken a project to identify native grasses and trees palatable for elephants and standardise mass multiplication techniques. The Forest Department set up the eight-member group earlier this year after realising that the areas occupied by native grasses and fodder trees in the wild have been degraded. The team recently submitted an interim report after identifying 29 native grass species and 14 fodder tree species that are palatable for elephants and other herbivores. It also started a nursery for growing these species on the FC&RI campus. “The main objective of the project is to improve the quality of the elephant habitats by restoring them with native grasses and fodder trees,” D. Venkatesh, District Forest Officer of Coimbatore Forest Division. In the next level, the team will assess their nutritive value and to standardise mass multiplication technology for planting in the lower slopes of the Nilgiris and in Coimbatore Forest Division, fodder quality of which have been assessed to have degraded due to the spread of invasive species like the Lantana camara. “All the 43 species of grasses and trees identified by the team are palatable for elephants and other herbivores. Among these, the team will select those species with the highest nutritive value and standardise techniques for their multiplication for planting,” said K. Baranidharan from the Department of Forest Products and Wildlife at FC&RI, one of the principal investigators. Leaves and plant parts of the 29 native fodder grass species and 14 fodder tree species have been shade dried and powdered for characterising nutritional and anti-nutritional values. I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle), said that the reserve forests in the region had diversity of wild grasses which slowly degraded due to factors such as excessive grazing and spread of invasive species. “Sufficient grasslands and grass meadows should be available for the survival of a herbivore species. Once we identify the grasses and get an idea on the multiplication techniques, large scale sowing and broadcasting can be done to support various species,” he said. According to him, the Department did successful restoration of native grasses in Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve where it removed non-breakable coarse grasses and replaced them with browsable grasses in natural water pond areas. “The idea is to create small pockets of grasslands and meadows. Good diverse fodder availability will improve the health of the wildlife and they can withstand diseases, droughts etc.,” he said. K.T. Parthiban, Dean (Forestry) of FC&RI, M.P. Divya, R. Ravi, S. Manivasakan and M. Vijayabhama from FC&RI and S. Geetha and K.N. Ganesan from TNAU are other experts in the group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnau-experts-identify-native-grasses-fodder-trees-to-improve-elephant-habitats/article35160433.ece
06 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||TNSTC operates 534 buses||The Coimbatore Division of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) on Monday operated 534 buses in Coimbatore district, following relaxations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Officials said that 337 town buses and 197 mofussil buses were operated out of its total fleet of 1,012 buses. Mofussil buses were operated to districts such as Salem, Erode, Madurai, Theni, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tiruchi, Kumbakonam and Thanjavur, officials said. With the occupancy being capped at 50% for all buses to allow personal distancing, the demand for mofussil buses was not high on Monday. In the case of town buses, however, personal distancing norms went for a toss in a few buses. Many private bus operators chose not to operate their buses from Monday despite relaxations in lockdown. V. Duraikannan, president of Coimbatore District Bus Owners Association (South), said that only around 10 town and mofussil buses were operated in the district on Monday as most of private bus operators have submitted stoppage forms at the respective Regional Transport Offices during the lockdown period, which are yet to be revoked. The operators might not operate their buses with the 50% occupancy rule as it would not be financially viable amid the hike in fuel prices, he said. Echoing similar sentiments, R. Baskaran, president of Tamil Nadu Omni Bus Owners Association (Coimbatore), said the buses would likely resume operations only if the State government allows 100% passenger occupancy. In Tiruppur district, TNSTC officials said that around 333 buses, comprising 166 town buses and 167 mofussil buses, were operated on Monday .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnstc-operates-534-buses/article35160450.ece

06 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Uneven road surface from Kurichi to Eachanari, a risk to motorists||Motorists using the road from Kurichi to Eachanari have been facing the risk of accidents for more than a year now because of the uneven level of the road. The two-lane road, measuring seven metres wide, was widened in to a 10 metre stretch a few years ago. According to an official from the National Highways (NH) Department, Central government sanctions funds once in five years for the renewal of roads. Since the seven-metre-wide stretch was laid first, funds were given for re-laying it. The officials thus re-laid the road for seven metres and left the remaining three-metre portion unattended. “There is almost two inch difference in the height of the road on the same side as only part of it is re-laid. There have been several accidents involving two-wheelers,” said P. Nallathambi, president of the Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association. Similarly, when the road was widened, there are many places where it joins the side roads and these joints are also not on the same level, he added. The issue was pointed out at the recently held district-level road safety committee meeting. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said that the re-laid portion should have been levelled with the remaining part of the road. “We will take it up and the official concerned should be made accountable. It is unimaginable that such mistakes happen on an NH road,” he said. An official of the State Highways (NH) Department said the road would be levelled wherever there is a problem. Funds were given only to re-lay part of the road and not for the widened area, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/uneven-road-surface-from-kurichi-to-eachanari-a-risk-to-motorists/article35160436.ece

06 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TAMIL NADU||Telangana HC judge rejects AG’s petition||Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao of Telangana High Court on Monday rejected Advocate General B.S. Prasad’s request to recuse himself from hearing a writ petition filed by two farmers of Andhra Pradesh challenging a GO issued by Telangana government relating to usage of Krishna river water for power generation. When the writ petition came up for hearing in the morning, Additional Advocate General J. Ramachandra Rao appealed to the bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar that it should be heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice Hima Kohli as per roster of sitting arrangements. Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao said the bench would examine the issue when it would hear the matter during post-lunch session. Meanwhile, senior counsel Vedula Venkatramana appearing for the petitioners said the plea should be heard by the same bench since the petition involved issues relating to Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act. As per roster, AP Re-organisation Act matters are allocated to this bench, he contended. When the bench sat after lunch-break, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao said the bench had got clarification from the CJ office that it should hear the matter. AG B.S. Prasad immediately requested the judge to post it before the bench headed by the CJ. “When the matter was clarified by the CJ office, how can it be conveyed to them to hear the matter,” the judge said. Meanwhile, the AG made an appeal requesting Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao to recuse himself from hearing the writ petition without citing any reasons. “Why do you want me to recuse myself from hearing the petition...can you explain the reasons,..?” the judge sought to know. However, without justifying the request he had made, the AG repeated the request. “This is in poor taste...we don’t expect AG office to make such unreasonable request,” Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao said. He further said that such requests to recuse would amount to “bench hunting”. “This is like bench hunting...AG office is not expected to use such tactics,” he said. Finally, the AG dropped his request and the bench proceeded to hear the matter. As the petitioners’ counsel began to present contentions, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao said if the former was aware of Supreme Court verdict declaring that inter-State water disputes should not be heard by the High Courts. He cited the judgement of SC in a matter relating to Rajolibanda project. As the judge was giving information pertaining to the judgement, AAG J. Ramachadnra Rao tried to explain further details of the verdict. At this stage, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao said it was not correct on the part of AAG to represent in the matter when the AG is already appearing in the hearing. The bench made it clear to the AAG that it is not correct on his part to intervene when the AG was already representing the State in the matter. Meanwhile, senior counsel Vedula Venkataramana sought one day time to study the verdict. The division bench told all the counsels concerned to go through the judgment and come prepared to the court on Tuesday for presenting their contentions. The plea was posted to Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/telangana-hc-judge-rejects-ags-petition/article35160235.ece

Welcoming them, Mr Karti said that already the BJP had been sidelined in the State, as shown by the recent election results. Bad moves by the Union government had not only pushed the economy down, but wrong policies had resulted in dip in revenue. The bad times for the nation started with demonetisation. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements remained only on paper as the packages offered to bail out the entrepreneurs did not reach genuine beneficiariesd. Mr. Karti told mediapersons that there was nothing wrong in terming the Central government as ‘Union’ government. “When the ministers were addressed as Union ministers, there was nothing offensive in addressing as Union government," he added. On reason for meeting Chief Minister M. K. Stalin, he said that a representation was made to start a law college in Sivaganga and an agri-science college at Kanadukathan in Sivaganga district. The CM had assured to examine the modalities in this regard. On the rising petrol price, the Congress MP said that despite making appeals from every quarter, the BJP government appeared to remain firm not to reduce it. The consumers were agitated. Very soon it would reflect in the polls, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-functionaries-join-congress/article35160517.ece

06 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||It’s a jab well done||A month ago, when people were battling COVID-19 second wave inside hospital wards, a band of frontline health workers was diligently working outside to prevent a third wave. They are a team of doctors and nurses from Government Rajaji Hospital, who have been silently administering the potentially life-saving injection. “We have maintained a friendly atmosphere so that people are glad to be able to get their dose,” said ENT professor L. Arul Sundaresh Kumar, in charge of the city’s largest and the State’s first government vaccination centre, which was inaugurated on January 16 by the then Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswsami. His team comprising three more doctors as nodal officers, one medical officer, 15 staff nurses and 12 data operators, are the vaccinators who show no letup in their work and enthusiasm 25 weeks on. They waited patiently for the beneficiaries in the initial weeks, managed crowds when vaccine demand grew later, helped people fight injection panic, checked for AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunisation), managed vaccine logistics, coordinated organisational work, handled internet issues for data entry, skipped meals to accommodate more vaxxers, compiled daily reports and stayed beyond duty hours to complete the assigned tasks. “We fail to pay heed to their efforts and are happy with our selfies post-injection,” said S. Mallika, after her first dose last week at the Elango Corporation School centre. She was impressed with the neat and well-coordinated arrangements and friendly staff. “Vaccinating is a job of the public health department. With uncertainties around the new COVID vaccines, there was no volunteers for the jab initially and the responsibility fell on Madurai Medical College after general medicine professor K. Senthil led the State’s vaccination drive taking the first dose of Covishield. “The fear of the disease and new vaccines, and the need to follow appropriate protocols and behaviour makes the COVID-19 vaccination different from other innoculation programmes,” said S Wasimsha, one of the nodal officers. At 7 a.m. daily, 1,000 to 1,500 people gatecrash at the centre to get a token that are distributed till 7.30 a.m. on first-come-first-served basis. The token entitles people to enter the premises in batches during the allotted time slots. The team has administered close to 1 lakh doses in the last six months. Few takers earlier “Earlier when we had stock, there were few takers,” said Dr. Wasimsha. When vaccination opened up for those above 18 years, up to 1,900 people got inoculated in a day. “Vaccine hesitancy has reduced but so has the availability of vaccines now,” said Dr. Arul. Monday morning rush overwhelmed NGO worker P Manjunath who could not get a token. “I will try again tomorrow,” he said. “I am here because I have to take care of my family. Taking the vaccine was hassle-free and now I will send my family members,” said another beneficiary. “The feeling of trying to save a large number of people from possible complications is intoxicating,” said staff nurse M. Priya, who added: :I see this as an opportunity to play a small part in something big.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-a-jab-well-done/article35160708.ece
06 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Steps will be taken to improve infrastructure in Madurai jail’||Steps will be taken to improve the infrastructure and access to medical facilities for inmates of the Madurai Central Prison, said Law Minister S. Regupathy, here on Monday. He was addressing media persons, along with Finance Minister P. T. R. P. Thiagarajan, after inspecting the Madurai Central prison. Mr. Regupathy said that there were a total of 1,562 inmates, out of which more than 1,000 were remand prisoners. The prisoners also urged to improve their access to the Government Rajaji Hospital for medical treatment. Major portion of the infrastructure in the prison was old as it was built under Colonial rule. “In the last 10 years, there was no infrastructure development apart from the construction of an administrative block,” he said. “So, we will take steps to improve the infrastructure of the prison,” he added. When asked about the option of relocating the prison, Mr. Regupathy said that huge buildings like the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, District Court complex and the GRH are present in Madurai. “The cost of demolishing and rebuilding the prison at this location would mean a bigger cost than shifting the prison to a new location. We will inform the Chief Minister about this and he will take the final call regarding this,” he added. He said that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict R. P. Ravichandran has met the CM regarding the parole plea. His mother has been instructed to submit a memorandum for Mr. Ravichandran to the CM, Mr. Regupathy added. The Minister said that the A. K. Rajan Committee has been constituted to study the impact of NEET on medical admissions and report it to the judiciary. District Collector S. Aneesh Sekar and Madurai Corporation Commissioner K. P.

06 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Compensate mother of injured boy, HC directs State||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the State to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to the family of a boy who sustained serious injuries due to explosion of crackers that were illegally strewn in and around the place where he and his friends were playing in Uppathur, Virudhunagar district. The court was hearing the petition filed by Jeyarani, the mother of Pandithurai who sustained serious injuries in 2018 while he was playing with his friends. With her son having sustained over 50 % burn injuries, she sought compensation from the State. The woman said that she was working at a private mill. Her income was meagre and she was unable to meet medical expenses. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that the court could take judicial notice of the fact that frequent explosions from illegal firecracker units were taking place in Virudhunagar district. On such occasions, the government paid some compensation to the family of the deceased and the injured. It was not clear as to whether such cases were taken to its logical end.There was always excitement when such incidents happen and ultimately everybody forgets about it till the next incident takes place. “In the present case, it is brought to the notice of this court that the boy is virtually in a vegetative state and unless plastic surgery is performed, it will be a horrifying sight for the parent to keep watching a child with burn injuries all over the body”, the judge said. The court took note of the fact that the Collector and the Tahsildar recommended the payment of compensation from the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund. However it was rejected by the Chief Secretary on the ground that the claim would not strictly fall within the parameters. In the considered view of the court, the petitioner’s son is almost half dead and he was lying in a vegetative state. He was being taken care of by the parent. Therefore, the court has to give an expanded meaning for the purpose behind granting compensation from the Chief Minister's Public Relief Fund. The petitioner was very poor and she will not be able to sustain the medical treatment, unless the government comes to her rescue, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensate-mother-of-injured-boy-high-court-directs-state/article35160529.ece
06 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Filing of online application for RTE seats on||The filing of online application for 5,614 seats reserved under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, in 434 private schools in Madurai district began on Monday. According to the RTE Act, private schools have to set aside 25% of their entry-level seats for students from economically weaker sections of the society. An official from the school education department said that parents can file RTE seats applications till August 3. Several volunteers from Students’ Federation of India, Democratic Youth Federation of India and People’s Awareness Trust, are creating awareness about the RTE seats and helping parents fill the online application for RTE seats. However, volunteers highlight several issues while filing online applications. While the website shows schools that have seats reserved under the RTE Act, there is no mention of the number of seats available in each school, said K. Hakkim, an activist from the People’s Awareness Trust. “Until last year, the information on the number of seats reserved in each school was available for the public. But, it is only this year that this information is not available for the public,” he said. Mr. Hakkim alleged that many private schools reserve a lower number of seats under the RTE Act as compared to their actual strength. “Hence, it becomes very important to publicly list the available number of seats in each school on the website,” he added. R. Charles, a volunteer who assisted parents in filing the online RTE applications, said that the rule permitting parents to apply for schools within one kilometre radius from their residences was disadvantageous for rural students. “In rural areas, there are hardly any private schools within one-km radius from the residences of the students,” he added.  There is no mention of the number of seats available in each school. Until last year, it was available K.

06 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry trust to host event on sidelines of UN summit on July 8||The Trust for Youth and Child Leadership (TYCL), based in the city, has been chosen to virtually host a side event at the United Nations’ global summit that begins in New York on Tuesday. The TYCL will be hosting a panel discussion on “The COVID-19 and Youth Mental Health Recovery in Global South: A Way Forward for Local Action” on July 8 (5 p.m. IST and 7.30 a.m. EST in the U.S. and Canada) at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), scheduled from July 6 to 15. “This will be the third time we are hosting a side event at the UN after the TYCL was accorded Special Consultative Status with United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 2018,” said R. Suresh Krishna, TYCL administrator. However, this is the first time the focus is on mental health of youth, he said. The TYCL panel discussion via Zoom aims to bring together key stakeholders in youth development and mental health to reflect, connect, and act on (SDG 17) youth well-being to address the mental health challenges faced by them under the impact of COVID-19. It will lay emphasis on local action in creating a model programme to address mental health needs of young people in global south to mitigate pandemic-related distress as well as youth-centred mental health policy in their respective countries. Recovery plan The discussions will focus on developing a recovery plan, with emphasis on strengthening the voice of the youth and their mental health needs to enable a sustainable and resilient recovery from the pandemic. According to a TYCL concept note, after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, mental health issues spiked due to the loss of jobs and loved ones, and a lack of social lives. Prior to COVID-19, one out of every five youth in the world was suffering from mental health issues, most of which went unnoticed and/or unreported. Suicide by youth was the second leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 19. Majority of the world’s population lives in the global south, which has historically received only a tiny share of mental health resources. In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread quickly, and it will have a long-term impact on the youth. The pandemic was expected to have a negative impact on economic and social determinants of mental health in countries in the global south. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, anxiety, mood, trauma, and stress-related disorders were among the mental health conditions contributing to mental health illnesses globally. A worrying trend Most worryingly, the pandemic lays the groundwork for a potential global suicide rise among youth as a consequence of increasing exposure to significant risk factors such as financial stress, rising unemployment, social isolation, declined access to mental health support, and obstacles to mental health services. Similarly, long-term school closures were likely to have a considerable impact on the mental health of students. Schools played an essential role in shaping young people’s mental well-being by providing a structured and supervised space for socio-emotional development, friendship, social support networks, and protection from risky behaviours. The fear of SARS CoV-2, often fuelled by misinformation and rumours on social media, led to anxiety and depression, according to a report that was released by the World Health Organization (WHO). The TYCL says that with the emergence of high numbers of youth needing mental attention, it was clear that the healthcare systems of low- and middle-income countries were hard-pressed to offer sufficient mental care and support to the affected youth. As a result, there was a greater need for a long-term and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Post COVID-19, as governments plan to revive the economy, they should focus on creating mental healthcare institutions to address the youth, especially by leveraging the reach of digital tools. Youth-led dialogue The side event would follow the format of youth-led panel discussions involving stakeholders across the globe to explore themes, such as information status of low- and middle-income countries about the current state of youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 on youth in low- and middle-income countries, the impact of inadequate healthcare systems on the youth and the best practices and interventions, actions and policy recommendations needed to support long-term and resilient recovery of the youth from the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-trust-to-host-event-on-sidelines-of-un-summit/article35160776.ece

Communist Party of India (Marxist) district secretary K.S.

One of the labourers, Kannaiah, said: “After we started the work 20 days ago, we were given only Rs. 35,000 and we have been denied the remaining Rs. 11.55 lakh. When we asked the hirers to settle the amount, they threatened us and our complaint with the police elicited no response. Hence, we sought the help of CPI (M) workers, who have brought us to the Collectorate. The Collector should instruct the police to conduct an investigation and ensure early settlement, besides ensuring our security.” Seeking COVID-19 relief, village temple priests submitted a petition at the Collectorate on Monday.

06 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Impasse over transfer of road continues||Stalemate over transfer of Fort Station Road, near Maris Theatre, to State Highways by Tiruchi Corporation has raised concern among road users. A portion of the eastern arm of the road suffered extensive damage due to heavy rain in July last. Since it was found unsafe for movement of traffic, the civic body partially closed it. It has now been fully closed for the last six months to facilitate repairs. Though the civic body initially decided to rebuild the road under the Smart City initiative, it subsequently decided to hand over the operation and maintenance of the road to the State Highways (Project). The Corporation sent a proposal to the State government for formal handing over of ownership of the road to the State Highways. It was expected that the State government would pass a GO to that effect last year itself. But the State Highways is yet to take control of the road. “We are waiting for the formal procedure to be completed. It is under consideration of the State Highways. We hope that it will be done soon,” said S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation. However, he said, the Corporation had begun reconstruction of the retaining wall along Fort Station Road. A sum of Rs. 3 crore had been allotted for the project. It was aimed at strengthening the basement of the road. After completion of the work, a study would be carried out on the possibilities of resuming vehicular traffic on the road. Road users feel that it is time to rebuild the entire stretch of the road along with road overbridge, which is more than a century old. They demand that the transfer proposal be expedited so as to rebuild the RoB and the two arms of the road. “The volume of traffic on Karur Bypass Road has gone up manifold since closure of Fort Station Road. A year has passed since it suffered major damage and it is unfortunate that the departments concerned are yet to take a mutual decision on transfer of ownership of the road,” says N. Jamaludeen, a consumer activist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/impasse-over-transfer-of-road-continues/article35160507.ece

06 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Cooking channel’s subscribers cross 1 crore||The farmers-turned-YouTube stars who took their village, Chinna Veeramangalam in Pudukkottai district, to an international audience through traditional cooking videos have garnered one crore subscribers. The Village Cooking Channel was awarded a Diamond Play button by YouTube for its achievement. The group donated Rs. 10 lakh from their earnings to the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund (CMPRF) to aid the fight against COVID-19. “Ellarum vaanga, always welcomes you!” — this is how the enthusiastic team of six welcomes viewers to each video on the channel. The group, comprising cousins V. Subramanian, V. Murugesan, V. Ayyanar, G. Tamilselvan and T. Muthumanickam, and led by their grandfather and former caterer M. Periyathambi, began the channel as a way to pass time when they were not engaged in cultivating their agricultural lands. “We began this channel to pass time when we had no work, and to supplement our income. All men in Chinna Veeramangalam can cook, and we decided to show it to the world,” Mr. Subramanian, the team's in-house cameraman and tech expert, said. The team earns around Rs. 7 lakh a month from the advertising revenue generated by YouTube views. As viewership has increased, so has the quantity of food cooked in the videos. “We utilise at least one-fourth of the money we make on purchasing ingredients and preparing a feast,” Mr. Subramanian said. “We serve the food to our friends, relatives and other people in the village,” he added. “Amid the lockdown, we began serving food in old-age homes and orphanages,” he said. The team also credited the rise in its popularity to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's visit. “We used to get about 10,000 new subscribers a day. But since Mr. Gandhi's visit, we have been getting 30,000 to 40,000 new subscribers a day,” Mr. Subramanian said. The Village Cooking Channel is the first YouTube Channel from Tamil Nadu to have one crore subscribers. “We have seen videos of several YouTubers who have the Diamond Play button with their names engraved on it. They will be speaking in several languages, but never in Tamil. We are proud to hold this distinction, and we thank Tamil people for this,” the group said in a video uploaded to the channel. Periyathambi, better known as thaatha , or grandfather, tore up as he held the Diamond Play button. “It is amazing that a company from the U.S. is recognising our efforts in Pudukkottai. I can’t believe the videos we made here, in our village, have reached people across the world,” he said. “My advice is that we must believe in our abilities,” he added. To commemorate the achievement, the team donated Rs. 10 lakh to the CMPRF. “We were going to send it to the Chief Minister’s office, but we got an opportunity to meet him and personally hand it over,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cooking-channels-subscribers-cross-1-crore/article35160386.ece
06 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister condoles death of Fr. Stan Swamy||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Monday condoled the death of tribal rights activist and Jesuit priest Father Stanislaus Lourduswami (better known as Fr. Stan Swamy). In a tweet, he said: “I was shocked to learn of the demise of Stan Swamy, a tribal rights and human rights activist. Deep condolences. The tragedy that befell him, who fought for the downtrodden, should not happen to anyone.” Jesuit priests in Tiruchi, where Fr. Stan Swamy hailed from, described the late priest as a “martyr of justice” and a “role model”. “Fr. Stan Swamy worked really hard for the upliftment of Dalits and tribals. We are proud of his commitment to the cause of the downtrodden,” Rev. Fr. Leonard Fernando, rector, St. Joseph’s College in Tiruchi, said, paying tributes to the old student. Born on April 26, 1937, in Viragalur village near Pullambadi in Tiruchi district, Fr. Stan Swamy studied at St. Joseph’s College Higher Secondary School. He spent most of his life in Bihar, working among Adivasis, after joining the Jesuit order on May 30, 1957, when he was 20. He was ordained a priest on April 14, 1970. The Jesuit Provincial of India, Stanislaus D’ Souza, and the Provincial of Jamshedpur Jesuit Province, Fr. Jerry Cutinha, conveyed the deepest condolences to family members, friends, lawyers and well-wishers of Fr. Stan Swamy and all those who stood by him.  CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan, too, condoled the death of the activist. He said a false case was framed against the Jesuit priest and he was denied proper treatment. The CPI(M) will hold a protest in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday, seeking a CBI probe against those responsible for his death.  Fr. Stan Swamy worked really hard for the upliftment of Dalits and tribals.

The standard operating procedure was enforced by authorities. The footfall of devotees on the first day of reopening was moderate, they said. At the crack of dawn, devotees began to arrive at major temples in Tiruchi city such as Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, Jambukeswarar Temple at Tiruvanaikoil and Rockfort Thayumanaswamy Temple. Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR & CE ) Department officials said temple staff were deputed to ensure that devotees wore face masks and their body temperature screened with thermal scanners prior to being allowed inside the shrines. They were asked to maintain personal distancing while awaiting their turn to offer worship. They were told about the government’s instructions not to bring children below 10 years of age and senior citizens above the age of 65 to the shrines in view of the pandemic. Devotees themselves maintained personal distancing at the temples knowing well about the current situation, said the HR & CE officials. No archanas were performed in line with the government’s direction and breaking of coconuts was also not permitted. The standard operating protocols laid down by the government were duly complied with, the officials further said. Devotees patiently stood in queue and awaited their turn to offer worship. Screening of devotees using hand held thermal scanners was also done at Nagore Dargah in Nagapattinam district. Announcements were made appealing to devotees to follow the standard operating procedures of the government.

06 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Academics pitch for longer tenure for VCs||The concept of three-year tenure for Vice-Chancellors of State universities in Tamil Nadu has to be revisited since the duration is too short for the appointees to make any impact, according to academics. “When VCs in universities in neighbouring Karnataka have a four-year tenure and a good number of northern States appoint them for a five-year term, there is no reason why there should not be a re-think at the policy level on the issue in Tamil Nadu,” according to G. Thiruvasagam, president of Association of Indian Universities and Vice-Chancellor of AMET University, Chennai. Senior professors in the reckoning for Vice-Chancellorship point out that Central universities appoint VCs for a five-year duration. The same is the case with institutions of national importance under the purview of the Union Ministry of Education, including Indian Institutes of Management, Indian Institutes of Technology, National Institutes of Technology, where directors are appointed for a five-year duration. Mr. Thiruvasagam, who had earlier served as Vice-Chancellor of Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, and Madras University, says VCs, of State universities, in effect, have only a little more than a year to try out reforms. “The first six months are spent on understanding the system, and acclimatising with the Syndicate, Senate, Academic Council, and principals of affiliated colleges. The latter part of the third year is unconducive since they cannot take any policy decision for the last six months of their tenure," he points out, making a case for UGC to specify administrative credentials alongside academic accomplishments for VC aspirants. Five-year duration is the minimum required period to show tangible improvement. In State universities, VCs lose their hold in the third year, and the quality of administration would leave a lot to be desired, officiating Vice-Chancellor of Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, says. He adds: “Three years are too short a time to produce good results. There ought to be uniformity across the country for tenure of VCs.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/academics-pitch-for-longer-tenure-for-vcs/article35160512.ece

According to M. Mariappan, president of Tirunelveli District Folk Artistes’ Welfare Association, 150 artistes playing nagaswaram, thavil, pampai, panchavaadhyam, villisai etc., who would usually perform in temple festivals during this season, were starving as they were rendered jobless since March due to the lockdown. Since the government had banned all forms of celebrations in places of worship as part of the lockdown, they could not even feed their children whose education has been affected due to non-payment of tuition fee. As the State government had relaxed the lockdown to a great extent, the Collector should give permission for temple festivals and wedding celebrations, which were the prime sources of income for the folk artistes. Considering the miserable condition of the folk artistes, the State government should give them Rs. 10,000 a month as relief until the lockdown was totally lifted. Moreover, the government should give permission for folk artistes to perform in awareness programmes and the functions. Besides giving identity cards to the folk artistes through the Department of Art and Culture, the government should also give pension to artists who attain 45 years, Mr. Mariappan said. Free house sites A group of Thamizhar Viduthalai Kalam cadre, led by district president Muthukumar, submitted petition seeking free house sites for about 2,000 below poverty line families living in Narasinganallur near here.

06 July 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Gingee fort to be a tourist attraction||The Villupuram district administration, in association with the Department of Tourism and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), is working on a proposal to help put Gingee fort, a monument of historical importance, on the tourism map. The tourism potential of Gingee fort has never been utilised as it lacks basic amenities. The administration is now working on short-term and long-term plans to woo domestic and international tourists, official sources said. The package being readied by the administration will focus on cleanliness and take visitors through Rajagiri hills and the remnants of the structure that remains relatively unknown to most tourists. Known as the “Troy of East,” the fort was considered impregnable and is a symbol of the State’s glorious past. The Union government has sanctioned Rs. 9 crore to the ASI for taking up restoration and provide a facelift to the fort. The work includes the establishment of a cafetaria, toilet blocks and ticket counters and face-lifting by creating a lawn in front of the Rajagiri hills, restoration of the moat and the barracks. According to District Collector D. Mohan, the administration would be preparing a detailed plan in consultation with the Tourism Department and the ASI. “We have planned facilities to not just lure domestic but also foreign tourists and showcase the district’s architectural heritage. The idea is to ensure that Gingee fort is a must-see for tourists from Chennai and neighbouring Tiruvannamalai and Puducherry,” he said. Work had started on the toilet blocks with an architectural design befitting international standards. Similarly, the town panchayat will develop all connecting roads to the fort. The administration has planned boating facilities in the moat and a children’s park. This will ensure that the fort remains a recreational place for local residents and those visiting from neighbouring districts. The Department of Tourism will do a feasibility study on the illumination of Rajagiri and the lawns at night. The idea is to invite local tour operators and organise cultural festivals on the premises. Tourism corridor Tamil Nadu is the preferred destination for medical tourism in the country. With Vellore emerging as a hub for medical tourism in the State, there was immense potential to develop a vital tourism corridor connecting Vellore-Tiruvannamalai-Gingee-Puducherry, official sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gingee-fort-to-be-a-tourist-attraction/article35160538.ece

06 July 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Simplify licence procedure for cracker shops, say traders||Federation of Tamil Nadu Fireworks Traders has sought intervention of State Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu for simplifying the procedure for granting licence for permanent and temporary cracker shops. “Explosives rules have scope for authorities to give licence for permanent cracker shops for a period of five years. However, officials give the licences only for one to three years according to their whims and fancies,” said the Federation’s State president V. Rajachandrasekaran. This results in workload for officials and inconvenience for traders as officials keep them guessing for months whenever they go for renewal. “Applications that are given in as early as February or March are taken for scrutiny only a month before Deepavali,” he said. The licences for permanent shops having crackers up to 500 kg are given by Commissioner of Police in the city limits and by District Revenue Officers in rural limits. The licence for bigger shops having fireworks up to 1,500 kg are given by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization. “PESO usually gives license for up to five years,” he said. Stating that the last minute inspection of officials from village administrative officer up to District Revenue Officer takes a long time when the process was taken up at the last minute, the traders want the officials to clear the applications within a stipulated period. “When applications for licence are pending, traders are forced to keep their fireworks in unlicensed place as the festival day approaches. The traders remain in a dilemma as to whether they should proceed with their procurement, create infrastructure, find manpower and start other activities or wait for the licence first,” Mr. Rajachandrasekaran said. Similarly, the licences for temporary shops can be given one month ahead of Deepavali. However, the officials call for applications only 15 days ahead of the festival and the traders end up having actual sale for merely five days to one week. “This often affects sale during Deepavali,” he added. The traders have given a memorandum to the Minister on this regard and have also sought stringent implementation of ban on online sales of fireworks.  Applications given in February or March are taken for scrutiny only a month before Deepavali V.

Officials are conducting regular checks at shops for COVID-19 cases among the staff, he said. At the industries in the district, workers are returning to work. Many migrant workers who went home are unable to return because train services are curtailed. “There are no tickets for the next 20 days. So, many workers are booking private buses. It will take about two weeks for the industries to return to regular operations,” said M.V. Ramesh Babu, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association. Liquor stores of the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac) were opened after a gap of nearly two months in the district on Monday.

She sought a direction to declare the action of TANSIDCO in allotting plots to applications on outright sale basis dehors the procedure of plot allotment, as illegal. In her contempt petition, she pointed out that the authorities had stated that the allotment orders in favour of the selected candidates were despatched on February 26. But they were despatched by registered post only on March 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-statutory-notice-in-contempt-petition/article35160520.ece

Innocent Divya, said the district administration was awaiting orders from the State government to reopen tourist spots. While restrictions on the movement of visitors from other parts of Tamil Nadu had been lifted, visitors from other States, including Kerala and Karnataka, would still have to apply for e-pass. They will then have to await e-pass’ approval before entering the district, district officials said. Need for aid But with the COVID-19 lockdown severely affecting the finances of almost everyone, taxi operators like Abdul at the Seven-Road junction in Kodaikanal said the government should extend some assistance to them. “We expect the government to give us financial assistance and also waive the interest on EMI for car loans for a year,” Mr. Abdul said. Restaurants open Meanwhile, restaurants across Tamil Nadu resumed dine-in service after a long gap. Only 50% of patrons were allowed at a time, as per the Tamil Nadu government’s guidelines. Places of worship were thrown open to devotees after many weeks. Clubs and hotels, too, ushered in patrons. Long-distance bus services resumed across the State, with uniform relaxations being offered.

06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Active cases: Bengaluru Urban falls to second place in India||Bengaluru Urban, which had the highest number of active cases in the country for over two months, has finally managed to reduce its active caseload to 15,395 on Monday and has come down to the second position now. Pune, which was second so far, now has the highest number of active cases with 16,960 still under treatment. On April 23 with nearly 1.5 lakh active cases, Bengaluru Urban had become the district with the highest active caseload in the country, way ahead of Pune (1,16,602) then. The number of active cases crossed 1 lakh on April 19 and touched 1,49,624 on April 23. By April 30, the active caseload shot up to 2,59,058 and further rose to 3,66,791 by May 15. From then onwards, the number of new cases and active cases started plummeting, but the number continued to remain the highest in the country. Following the surge in cases during the peak of the second wave in mid-May, public health experts had recommended that Bengaluru needed a complete lockdown just to reduce the number of cases. They had also stressed the need to ramp up existing critical care facilities and increase the number of oxygen beds. “Patients should be stabilised in early stages of the disease as any increase in severity can overwhelm the city’s health infrastructure,” experts had said. The rise in caseload resulted in a huge demand for hospital beds and several patients dying at home due to non-availability of ICU beds and timely care. However, there was a rapid fall in cases since mid June and the demand for beds too decreased. Giridhara R. Babu, epidemiologist and member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said it was important to sustain the decline now. “With the unlock and offices and other workplaces opening, people from other places are returning back to Bengaluru. Strict measures should be put in place in identifying cases as early as possible, especially clusters. While aggressive testing should be continued, concurrent genome sequencing should be done whenever clusters are identified,” he said. Asserting on vaccinations, Dr. Babu said: “Employers/authorities should ensure that everyone is vaccinated at their workplaces, especially those who work in closed spaces.” BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said Bengaluru managed to bring down its active cases owing to the hard work by officials, medical professionals, and people’s cooperation. “We want to consolidate on the gains made. It is important now that people should remain vigilant and continue to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Now, with increased mobility, people should take care to check transmission of the virus. We cannot afford to see numbers rising again,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said authorities should continue to restrict all mass gatherings and ensure strict enforcement of mask wearing and other protocols. “We have to watch the disease pattern in our neighbouring States such as Maharashtra and Kerala because even during the first and the second waves, cases in Karnataka surged three-four weeks after an increase in those States. People coming from those States should be traced, tested, and treated on a regular basis,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/active-cases-bengaluru-urban-falls-to-second-place-in-india/article35160355.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||City unlocks; crowds are back||Monday morning traffic snarls were back as evidence of the city unlocking further after over two months, as footfall at metro stations and the Majestic bus stand also increased. After resuming services from June 21, on Monday Namma Metro for the first time recorded ridership of over 1 lakh. A total of 1,06,069 passengers travelled between 7 a.m and 8 p.m. Before COVID-19, over 4.5 lakh people were using metro services daily. Malls and places of worship opened their doors after the long break and both saw a steady stream of people. “By evening, Garuda Mall off MG Road had a footfall of over 3,000, compared to around 25,000 during weekdays before the pandemic. With theatres still being closed, such numbers are encouraging and gives us hope that it will improve further by the coming weekend,” said Uday Garudachar, MLA and owner of Garuda Malls. Multiplex theatres contribute nearly 30% of the footfall to malls, industry insiders said. Suhail Yusuff of Brigade Shops and Establishments Association said the start was optimistic and it will take a week for business to pick up. “We will know how it pans out in the weekend,” he said. The hotel industry, which is allowed to function with no restrictions on occupancy, is also enthusiastic about an uptick in business. “Now that there are no restrictions, we expect families to restart eating out. We are seeing a slow trickle of families dining out, which we hope will go up in the coming weeks,” said Chandrashekhar Hebbar, President, Karnataka Regional Hotels and Restaurants’ Federation. However, pubs remain shut. Other traders are happy with the extension of the deadline for the night curfew from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. In the wake of the State relaxing lockdown norms from Monday morning, the service hours of public transport systems too have been extended . Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is running trains from 7 a.m to 8 p.m., and Namma Metro services will be available even on weekends. City buses operated by the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) were available till 9 p.m. from Monday, and the corporation has planned to run 4,500 buses every day. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner (Traffic), Bengaluru, said with the resumption of public transport in full swing, they expect a reduction in the number of trips made by private vehicles . Staff of the BMTC monitoring movement of buses at Majestic were seen checking whether social distancing norms are being followed. As per the rule, standing and travelling were not allowed in city buses. However, following social distancing norms was not easy during the peak hours. The BMRCL is also allowing passengers to occupy 100% seats inside the metro coaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/city-unlocks-crowds-are-back/article35160338.ece
06 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Provide anganwadis with all infrastructure by Dec. 31: HC||Observing that infrastructure available at the anganwadis in the State was far from being satisfactory, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday set December 31 as the deadline for the government to provide electricity, fans and toilets to 14,948, 18,974, and 3,524 anganwadi centres, respectively. The court issued the directions while refusing to accept the government’s proposal to provide these facilities in a phased manner. There are a total of 65,911 anganwadi centres in the State, as per the data submitted to the court by the government. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice issued the directions during the hearing of a PIL petition, initiated in 2011 based on a letter written by B.L. Patil of Vimochana Sangha, a Belagavi-based NGO through which the court is monitoring steps taken for children suffering from malnutrition. However, the Bench granted time till June 30, 2022, for the government to provide toilets in the remaining anganwadi centres housed in buildings not owned by the government. Providing basic infrastructure to anganwadi centres is a constitutional and statutory obligation of the government, the Bench observed. It also directed the government to take steps to implement the interim recommendations of a committee, headed by retired judge A.N. Venugopala Gowda, set up to oversee the process of identification, medical exam, and treatment of malnourished children, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/provide-anganwadis-with-all-infrastructure-by-dec-31-hc/article35160365.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Political bitterness in sugar bowl spills over||The bitterly fought Mandya politics on Monday spilled over to Bengaluru as former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy asked MP for Mandya Sumalatha to sleep in front of the sluice gates of the Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) to prevent seepage, if any. “She is speaking as if she is the only protector of the KRS. If there is seepage, make her sleep in front of the gates and protect water from leaking. Mandya never had an MP like her nor will get one like her in future,” the former Chief Minister told reporters after meeting Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa here. The uncharitable remarks from the JD(S) leader came in response to concerns expressed by the actor-turned-politician earlier over illegal mining that threatens KRS and the seepage in the reservoir. Mr. Kumaraswamy said, “She has been elected on sympathy. Let her work properly. She will not get another opportunity like this. She is making statements out of personal hatred. People will not forgive her.” In response, the first-time MP, who defeated Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the JD(S) candidate and son of Mr. Kumaraswamy, said the words merely displayed the mindset of the former Chief Minister. “He is targeting women because they are considered a weaker gender. It proves his intolerance towards women,” she said. Ms. Sumalatha also met the Chief Minister here soon after Mr. Kumaraswamy attacked her. Defending her concern towards the nearly century-old reservoir, the lifeline of Mandya farmers, she said a report by the disaster management committee had also expressed similar concerns. She said she had raised the issue with the Union Jal Shakti Minister and during a discussion on the Dam Safety Bill in Parliament. Ms. Sumalatha added, “I have not taken anyone's name nor personally attacked anybody. Why is he reacting? Why is he taking this personally? He is making a personal attack against a woman.” She also said it was an “open secret” in Mandya who was involved in illegal mining. “I am not opposed to mining; I am against illegal mining. Let there be a probe on the reservoir issue,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/political-bitterness-in-sugar-bowl-spills-over/article35160371.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Private unaided schools lag in admissions||As the new academic year commenced on July 1, private unaided schools in the State are lagging in completing their admissions process. According to data by the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), as of July 5, only 50.4% of admissions across all school managements has been completed. On the other hand, admissions completed in government schools are the highest, with 66.9 % of them being fed in the Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS) portal. Aided school admissions stand at 64.9 %, while private unaided school admissions so far stand at 30.9 %. While many parents of children in private unaided schools have not completed the admission formalities as they are unable to pay the fees during the pandemic, many others are waiting for the State government to take a call on the fee structure . Last year, the government had stated that schools can collect only 70 % of the tuition fees of the 2019-2020 academic year. “Most parents had already paid the full fees by then and did not get a refund. So, many parents have not admitted their students and are adopting the wait and watch policy,” said Girish S., parent of a class VI student.   D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said many parents are not coming forward to complete the admission process as they are refusing to pay the fees. ‘Lot of pressure’ “There is a lot of pressure by officials of the department to complete the admission process. Last year too, many parents did not pay fees, but we admitted the students. We do not want to continue that this academic year,” he said. He also alleged that many government school teachers were “pressuring” parents of students, who were temporarily in their hometown during the pandemic, to admit them in the nearest government school even though they were on rolls in private schools in Bengaluru. V. Anbu Kumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that the department had decided not to automatically admit students . “We have asked all schools - even government school teachers - to admit students for all classes from I to X this year. Normally, they would only admit students for class I and the remaining students would be automatically promoted. But due to the pandemic, families may have migrated and we want to track all the students and ensure that the number of dropouts are tracked so that they can be re-enrolled in schools,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-unaided-schools-lag-in-admissions/article35160351.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HDK meets BSY over Mysugar||Just as eyebrows were raised over the meeting between Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy here on Monday morning, it turned out that the politics over Mysore Sugar factory (Mysugar) had reached the Chief Minister’s doorstep. While earlier meetings between the two leaders had led to speculation over political developments in the State, Monday’s meeting pertained to the reviving of Mysugar and the politics around it, sources in the Chief Minister’s Office said. The revival of Mysugar  is heating up after the privatisation of Pandavapura Sugar Mills in Mandya district ran into rough weather, sources said. The meeting also came close on the heels of Tourism Minister C.P. Yogeshwar, who has been critical of the two leaders cosying up in the recent months, on Sunday alleging in Mysuru that there has been adjustment in politics that is hurting several BJP leaders, including him. Also, BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal has accused Opposition leaders of being hand in glove with the Chief Minister. While Mr. Kumaraswamy, who was accompanied by legislators from Mandya, is opposed to transferring the sugar factory to private hands, he also indicated that the Mandya MP, Sumalatha, has favoured privatisation. “There are efforts to privatise the factory. The Chief Minister has assured me that it will not be handed over to private control,” he told reporters. He also termed Mr. Yogeshwar’s statement on reservation in taluk and zilla panchayats childish and said that he should know that reservation is done by the Election Commission. Meanwhile, Ms. Sumalatha, who also met the Chief Minister after Mr. Kumaraswamy, clarified that she was open to any model of revival. “I only want the factory to restart. I am not part of the government to say how it should be restarted. Any model that will enable reviving the factory would be good,” she said. She said that sugar factory officials themselves had indicated that the government cannot implement the revival of the factory. “What did he [Mr. Kumaraswamy] do to revive the factory when he was in power?” she asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-meets-bsy-over-mysugar/article35160367.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||As restrictions ease, waiting time for passport appointment rises||Amidst the furore over recognition of vaccines globally, the demand for passport-related services has seen an increase, prompting a longer waiting period.  According to officials of Regional Passport Office (RPO), Bengaluru, since the lockdown norms were lifted in June, passport services were opened gradually and partially, and have received a big response. Regional Passport Officer Bharath Kumar Kuthati told The Hindu that only 50% appointments are being given across Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) and Post Office PSKs. “The response has been good, and there is lot of waiting time now. People are forced to wait for 10 days for an appointment. Unfortunately, we have to cater only to half due to COVID-19 norms. For instance, we used to have 1,600 appointments in the Lalbagh PSK, but now we are giving only 800,” he said. Mr. Kuthati explained that reasons for the high demand are many: “For almost 1.5 years, services have been impacted. All those citizens whose passports have expired, were looking for the opportunity to renew them, which is the main reason. In addition, academic sessions are starting abroad, contributing to the demand. Those who generally want a passport too are taking appointments,” he said. Services were severely impacted last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns and restrictions, resulting in the Bengaluru RPO issuing only half the normal number of passports, and related services.  For those who wish, the Central government has facilitated the option of linking their passport number with their vaccination status by registering the number as the ID on the COWIN portal. “If you're travelling abroad, the receiving country should know that you are vaccinated. This can happen only by connecting through the passport,” Mr. Kuthati said.  Unfortunately, we have to cater only to half due to COVID-19 norms. For instance, we used to have 1,600 appointments in the Lalbagh PSK, but now we are giving only 800 Bharath Kumar Kuthati, Regional Passport Office||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-restrictions-ease-waiting-time-for-passport-appointment-rises/article35160349.ece

The Hanumanthnagar police, who are presently probing the case, wrote to the headquarters with the details and the magnitude of the case seeking consent to hand over the case to CID for a detailed probe on Friday. Till Saturday, the police recorded the statement of around 70 people and the amount involved was estimated to be around Rs. 11 crore. Even on Monday, the police got statements from around 15 people, sources said. As it is a financial fraud, the police had also written to the government to designate an auditor to probe and assist the ongoing investigation. “Some investors have said that they were being paid the interest till last November. The management claims that they could not give them money as many people who borrowed loans have turned defaulters. Whether the management cheated its customers and fraudulently gave loans to people and failed to recover needs to be analysed by experts and hence we sought technical assistance in this regard,” a police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vasista-credit-souharda-sahakari-case-likely-to-be-transferred-to-cid/article35160342.ece

There are two biodiversity heritage spots in the city – Roerich Estate and Gandhi Krishi Vigyan Kendra, University of Agricultural Sciences. Speaking to reporters after chairing the second meeting with the BBMP’s Biodiversity Committee here on Monday, Anant Hegde Ashisar, chairperson of the Karnataka Biodiversity Board, said that the meeting had discussed various ways to involve more local communities and organisations in protecting and preserving the city’s environment and biodiversity. Month-long campaign With a month-long biodiversity campaign that will be kicked off soon, Mr. Ashisar directed the civic officials to draw up special programmes at the ward level and involve the local communities in various activities, such as planting saplings or felicitating those who have actively protected the environment etc. He also said the meeting had discussed taking up a proper survey of lakes, protection of wetlands. Several lakes have been rejuvenated and are maintained by local communities and organisations, such as Jakkur Lake. ‘Replicate success stories’ Such success stories should be replicated across the city, he said and added that the civic body should also allocate special funds in its budget annually for protection and conservation of environment and biodiversity. Mr. Ashisar also instructed the BBMP to publish in the public domain the variety and species of saplings in its nurseries and where saplings have been plants. Officials were also directed to improve the green belt on the city’s outskirts, by roping in organisations and communities, by rejuvenating lakes, protecting the wetlands and taking up afforestation. While the civic body was routinely clearing encroachments on lakes, wetlands and storm water drains, he said these efforts should be properly documented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/biodiversity-panel-told-to-identify-more-spots-in-city/article35160340.ece
06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Poor safety precautions may see cases spike: BBMP||After three months of restrictions and lockdown, Unlock 3.0 has opened up a lot of sectors. With these relaxations, however, it is important to adhere to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) of wearing mask, maintaining social distancing, and frequently sanitising hands, said Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta here on Monday, warning that the positivity rate may spike again if CAB compliance is poor. “Cases have seen a drastic drop and citizens have cooperated to check the spread of the pandemic. While we may be heading to resume normal life, we must continue to adhere to CAB mandatorily if we do not want the cases to spike again,” he said. Vaccination is also equally important, he maintained, and said already 50% of the eligible adult population in the city had been vaccinated. Most of them will become eligible for the second dose in a couple of weeks. It has been proven that hospitalisations of those who have tested positive COVID-19 and have already been vaccinated is very less. The BBMP is now working towards ensuring that 70% of the adult population is vaccinated by July-end. “There is a lot of demand, but the availability has to improve. We believe that it will improve,” he said. The civic chief said that pregnant women, according to experts, could be vaccinated. “If required, we will consider holding special camps,” he said. The Centre had already announced that it will procure the vaccines and distribute it to States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/poor-safety-precautions-may-see-cases-spike-bbmp/article35160339.ece

06 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||110 kg of marijuana seized||A special squad of the Kengeri sub-division police, on Monday, caught two persons transporting 110 kg of marijuana into Bengaluru from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Based on specific inputs, a team intercepted an SUV near Nagarabhavi BDA complex and arrested two persons. Inside the SUV, the team found gunny bags, which were stuffed with the narcotic. The total value of the seized marijuana is estimated to be around Rs. 50 lakh, the police said. Initial probe revealed that the accused, Appanna and Subramani, are drug peddlers. They used to get the narcotic from their contacts in Andhra Pradesh but supply had been affected due to the COVID-19 lockdown and increase in patrolling. Unable to get consignments from their regular contacts, the duo allegedly approached sellers in Visakhapatnam and were transporting a consignment by road. The police received credible information that the accused had gone to Andhra Pradesh to get a consignment of marijuana and would be returning to Bengaluru in an SUV.

06 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Walk the extra mile to put in place medical infrastructure’||With experts predicting the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic, the Dharwad district administration has begun taking precautionary measures focussing more on treatment of children as they are considered more vulnerable to infection during the third wave. Chairing a preparatory meeting on steps to be taken to fight a possible third wave in Dharwad on Monday, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil asked the officials to walk the extra mile to ensure that requisite medical infrastructure is put in place in case of any such eventuality. The State government has already issued a series of guidelines to make necessary medical preparations with focus on treatment for children and the officials should ensure adherence to the guidelines, he said. Emphasising the need for ensuring strict adherence to COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour, Mr. Patil said that like before, stress should be on mandatory wearing of face masks, maintaining physical distancing and sanitising hands without fail. Priority should also be given to testing, tracking, tracing, triaging, treating and use of technology to contain the spread of the disease, the Deputy Commissioner said. As it had been done before, patients in home isolation should be provided tele-consultation and regular monitoring of their health condition should be ensured. In case of need, health assistants should hold counselling for such patients, he said. Mr. Patil briefed about the need for declaring a locality as a containment zone in case of more than five cases being reported. An entire floor or, if needed, the whole apartment should be declared as a containment zone in the event of more number of cases being reported from residential apartments Children wards Considering the possibility of children being more vulnerable during the third wave, already special children wards have been set up at the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi, the District Civil Hospital in Dharwad and all taluk hospitals to provide a total of 190 beds. Private hospitals too have set up special wards for children. They have made 346 beds available for the purpose, he said and asked the health officials to increase the total number of beds available to 750. Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Panchayat B. Susheela, Municipal Commissioner Suresh Itnal, Assistant Deputy Commissioner Shivanand Karale, Assistant Commissioner B. Gopalkrishna, KIMS Director Ramalingappa Antaratani, District Surgeon Shivakumar Mankar, District Health Officer Yashwanth Madinkar and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/walk-the-extra-mile-to-put-in-place-medical-infrastructure/article35160573.ece
06 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Protest staged against hike in fuel price, power tariff||Condemning the continued hike of fuel prices, soaring prices of essential commodities and permission to hike power tariff amid a pandemic, members of Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) staged a protest and burnt an effigy in Dharwad on Monday. Staging the protest in front of the office of Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad, the protestors condemned in strong terms the Union and State governments’ apathy towards the plight of the common man who was already under a lot of burden due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The protestors raised slogans against the Union and State governments for what they said failure to check the soaring prices of essential commodities and fuel and burnt “soaring prices” in an effigy to register their protest. Addressing the protestors, district secretariat member of SUCI(C) Laxman Jadagannavar said that at a time when the life of the people had become miserable due to the pandemic, more burden was being brought on commoners. The workers and the commoners had been pushed to the street as there was no work. The farmers were unable to get proper price for their farm yield and crores of people had lost their jobs due to the lockdown. Amid this misery, the governments had failed to take remedial measures to mitigate the sufferings of the commoners. What was even worse was that the governments had announced a pittance as compensation to the affected families and failed to fulfil their responsibility, he said. Mr. Jadagannavar said that while on the one hand, the Union government was citing funds crunch as the reason for not announcing adequate relief package, it was spending crores of rupees for building Central Vista, on the other. “During the pandemic, the State government has spent Rs. 13 crore for purchasing luxury cars for Ministers and officials. The Union government has waived huge loans running into thousands of crores of capitalists but has failed to check the soaring prices that affect the common people,” he said. He said that the governments should immediately take remedial measures to help the common people and initiate steps to check soaring prices. Otherwise, people will be forced to take the path of agitation to get their rightful demands met, he added. The protest was led by SUCI(C) office-bearers Deepa V., Sharanu Gonawar, Ramesh Hoasamani, Madhulata Goudar, Bhavani Shankar and residents of various localities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-staged-against-hike-in-fuel-price-power-tariff/article35160570.ece
06 July 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||New Panchamasali platform in the making?||While the Lingayat Panchamasali movement for reservation under 2A category in the OBC list in the State is yet to achieve its goal, a few leaders of the community have begun covert efforts to establish a platform, as an alternative to the existing two peethas (seat of religious knowledge) of the community. Nearly 30 seers of various mutts of the Panchamasali community recently met at the residence of a community member at Jamkhandi in Bagalkot district to draw up a blueprint. Prior to this, a preliminary meeting had been held at Kakamari Mutt in Athani taluk of Belagavi district where the idea was mooted. The seers, who participated in the preliminary meeting, reportedly expressed displeasure over the functioning of the two peethas and emphasised the need for a new platform as an alternative. The root cause of the development seems to be the embarrassment caused to leaders of the Lingayat Panchamasali community in the BJP-led government. Earlier, in February 2021, despite pleas from prominent Ministers and community leaders, the Panchamasali padayatra seeking 2A reservation for the community did not stop till it reached Bengaluru. Some believe that the anti-B.S. Yediyurappa faction in the BJP played a role by keeping the emotional issue alive and in the limelight. The Panchamasali community has two peethas in the State: one at Koodalasangama in Bagalkot district in North Karnataka and the other at Harihar in Davangere district in Central Karnataka. From the day of their establishment, these peethas have not seen eye to eye on various issues. Yet, during the Panchamasali movement in February 2021, heads of both these peethas came together burying their differences to pursue the demand for reservation. The movement put the ruling disposition in an embarrassing position with BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal taking Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa head on in the floor of the House. Despite pleas from Panchamasali Ministers, the agitation continued even after reaching Bengaluru. The agitation was suspended only after the matter was referred to the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission. According to sources, all these developments forced one of the Ministers, who had earned the wrath of the community during the movement demanding reservation, to embark on the creation of a platform to nurture his political aspirations. The presence of this Minister’s brother at the seers’ meetings in Jamkhandi and Kakamari mutt only strengthened this line of thinking. However, considering the sensitivity of the issue, political leaders and seers have refrained from commenting on the development. Meanwhile, there is speculation about the others who had a hand in making the two meetings happen. The participants of the meetings included Siddhalinga Swami of Shivanand Mutt of Nelogi, Mahadev Swami of Babaleshwar and Sanganabasava Swami of Managuli. Seers from branches of Veerashaiva mutts of Rambhapuri Peetha, who aligned with the BJP during the controversy triggered by Congress leader Siddaramaiah’s proposal for religion status for the Lingayat community, also participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-panchamasali-platform-in-the-making/article35160579.ece

With least regard for physical distancing, people swarmed the market places and consequently, traffic snarls were reported from many areas. On day one of Unlock 3.0, people came out in large numbers, took out their vehicles to the central business district, to places of religious worship and prayers and it appeared as if they have no fear of the pandemic any more. It was like free for all. Many did not even bother to use face masks and were seen roaming around in the market without any hesitation. The dug-up roads in various localities of the twin cities only added to the problems of the traffic police personnel. Especially in the central business district in Hubballi, traffic jams were witnessed at different points of time as people showed least regard even for traffic regulations. Most of the temples witnessed large number of people visiting for darshan. Although the management committees had made arrangements to ensure adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, they could not control the behaviour of the people. With restrictions being relaxed, people also thronged vaccine centres. The main vaccination centre in Hubballi, the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), witnessed serpentine queues for vaccination.

The woman, a resident of Belgavi, suffered a paralytic attack on the left side of her body and was air-lifted on June 11. The patient was earlier treated for mild COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms in her hometown. Consultant neurologist at the hospital Abhinay Huchche said that they found a clot in the right side of the brain of the patient who complained of severe headache and immobility in the left side of her body. “Blood thinners administered to the patient during COVID-19 treatment, and high blood pressure are probable reasons for the brain haemorrhage. Many young and middle-aged patients are developing diabetes and hypertension post COVID recovery. These complications could have adverse impact on an individual’s overall health. It is important for people to watch their vitals like diabetes and blood pressure levels, and ensure proper care is taken to avoid serious complications,” said Dr Abhinay. The patient was kept under observation for seven days and was discharged on June 18 after she was considered fit to return to her regular routine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/critical-post-covid-19-patient-treated-at-hyderabad-hospital/article35160360.ece

06 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Private bus operators not to collect enhanced fares for now||Deputy Commissioner and Chairman of the Regional Transport Authority K.V. Rajendra on Monday said that private city and service bus operators have to maintain status quo with regard to bus fares till the authority holds a meeting. In a statement here, Dr. Rajendra said that a meeting with bus operators here decided to keep in abeyance the revised enhanced fares (by 25%) till the RTA holds a meeting likely this week. “They have agreed to go back to fares in operation before the lockdown,” he said. Last week, responding to demands from operators to allow them collect 25% enhanced fares considering increased diesel price and the condition of 50% occupancy, the Deputy Commissioner had permitted it. However, he had put a rider saying that the enhanced fares could be collected either till normal occupancy was restored or the RTA meeting was held. Canara Bus Owners Association president K. Rajavarma Ballal said that since the June 2020 fare hike, diesel price has increased considerably. It is difficult to operate buses with such collection as the cost per kilometre has gone up to Rs. 1.82. Whereas, the fares, even after the present 25% hike, comes to around Rs. 1.75 km, he said. Though the government has allowed operators to carry passengers to the sanctioned seating capacity, passengers cannot travel standing on buses, he noted. The operators are expecting a notification from the State Transport Authority revising the fares upward, he added. Meanwhile, city, service and express buses gradually came on to the roads on Monday with the State government relaxing conditions regarding operation. However, many private operators are yet to deploy their entire fleet on permitted routes for several reasons, including getting surrendered permits released from Regional Transport Offices and getting parked buses equipped for operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-bus-operators-not-to-collect-enhanced-fares-for-now/article35160715.ece
06 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Wenlock gets more dialysis machines||The recent addition of four dialysis machines at the haemodialysis centre of the Government Wenlock Hospital here has helped more people access the free dialysis facility. The centre had eight dialysis machines and four more machines were donated between February and June this year. With this, the centre has been catering to an average of 60 persons per day since May, said the in-charge of the centre, which is run by Kolkata-based firm Eskag Sanjeevini. As many as 164 patients with renal problems, including 112 from below poverty line category, undergo dialysis at the centre. While 74 patients undergo three dialysis sessions per week, there are five patients who undergo two sessions per week. One machine caters to five patients and each dialysis session is of four hours. A total of 1,497 dialysis sessions were held in April. It increased to 1,548 sessions in May and further to 1,562 sessions in June. The centre in-charge said that the average waiting list per day has now come down to 30. There are 14 health workers attending to patients at the centre. The centre also does occasional dialysis sessions to those admitted in the hospital in case of poisoning, snake bite and those with obstructive uropathy. The hospital has placed four dialysis machines in the hospital’s COVID-19 block for dialysis for COVID-19 patients. The first of the four additional machines valued at Rs. 5.8 lakh was donated by president of Rotary Club of Mangalore Archibald Menezes to hospital Superintendent Sadasahiva Shanbhog in the first week of February. This was followed by donation of two machines by Rotarian Satish Kamath and by Rotary South District president Nandini Ramachandran. In June, Rotary District 3181 Governor Ranganath Bhat handed over to DC K.V.

06 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Private bus operators demand tax exemption for six months||The Karnataka State Bus Owners Federation has urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to waive road tax for six months for stage carriage buses that start operation post lockdown. A delegation of the federation comprising Kuyilady Suresh Nayak, Vikram Reddy, Ajjappa and Dilraj Alva met Mr. Yediyurappa in Bengaluru on Saturday and told him that the government might lose Rs. 72 crore by waiving road tax for six months. However, it would stand to gain Rs. 720 crore from taxes on diesel and other consumables used for private stage carriage buses during that period. The federation said that ever since the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, the financial condition of private bus operators was worsening because of non-operation, increased costs of operation following constant rise in prices of diesel and other consumables, road tax during non-operation period and the like. The condition has deteriorated during the lockdown to tackle the COVID-19 second wave, it said. The federation urged the government to constitute a committee to revise fares periodically on the basis of diesel price variation for private buses as well as State road transport corporation buses. Employees of private bus operators should also be given COVID-19 package on the lines of other similarly-placed sections of society, it said. It also asked the government to direct insurance companies to extend insurance cover commensurate with the lockdown period as buses were not operating during the period. The federation said that diesel was sold at Rs. 65 a litre prior to COVID-19 first wave and the price has now crossed Rs. 94 a litre at present. As such, there is a need for periodical revision of fares. Many other States had waived road tax for one year for public transport vehicles during COVID-19 first wave, except Karnataka. Hence, the government should waive tax at least for six months this year, the federation said. The federation pointed out that private stage carriages have been serving people for over a century while contributing to the growth of the nation.

Speaking at a meeting with industrialists at Nandikur Industrial Area in Udupi district, the Minister said that 800 acres have been proposed to be acquired in Balkunje, near Mulky in Dakshina Kannada, and 250 acres in Muluru near Kaup in Udupi district. He said that the government has constituted a task force committee for industrial development in the coastal belt. The committee is headed by Ullas Kamath, chairman of the Karnataka Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCI). It will submit its report on how to promote industries in the coastal area. The government will study the report and take steps required to be implemented for promoting industries in the region. The Minister said that for ease of doing business, the government has implemented single window clearance system. It is promoting industries in tier II and tier III cities by providing incentives as per the new industrial policy. Investors are coming forward to invest in such cities, outside Bengaluru. The thrust of the policy is to promote industries outside the State capital. Referring to gram panchayats demanding property tax from industries in addition to industries paying development fee to the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB), the Minister said that the matter will be discussed with departments concerned and the government will come out with a policy. Earlier, replying to questions from presspersons at Belapu Industrial Area, the Minister said that as per the new industrial policy, industries are bound to provide employment to local people. They should employ 80% of locals for class I and class II type jobs and 100% of local people should be provided employment for class III and class IV category jobs. If there are any specific complaints against any industry violating it, the government will examine the complaints and take necessary action against those industries violating the norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-proposes-acquisition-of-1050-acres-of-land/article35160721.ece

06 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Key tourist sites in Mysuru region reopen after a long gap||The management of Mysuru zoo that was closed for over two months due to the lockdown is strongly hoping for early revival of tourism as Mysuru’s key tourist destination was reopened for visitors from Monday, with restrictions on entry being eased. Mysuru palace, Karanji Lake Nature Park, Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills, among the other major places of tourist importance, were also reopened after a long gap. The zoo saw footfalls since morning though the numbers were less than 500. The officials were hoping to see improvement in the coming days. “We had about 400-500 visitors today. The number is good compared to the day when the zoo was reopened after the lockdown was lifted last year. The number exceeded our expectations. One of the reasons could be the vaccination and we hope the revival takes place at the earliest,” said Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni. He told The Hindu that the zoo had put in place all biosafety measures like it has been practising continuously since last year. “Wearing mask, social distancing, and sanitisation is a must. Our staff posted at various points in the 80-acre campus ensure that the visitors follow these precautions for their safety,” he said. The zoo has put up boards at over 12 places spreading awareness and highlighting precautions over COVID-19. Before entering the zoo campus, the visitors are supposed to dip their feet in the disinfectant solution mat and sanitize their hands. They are thermal scanned and sent inside. “We have kept sanitizers at various points and hand wash at all toilets. The zoo security staff will be present at places where crowding can happen, including the enclosure of chimpanzees. They ensure no gathering takes place and social distance is maintained.” The zoo animal keepers had been barred from interacting with visitors and are supposed to comply with the strict protocols since they get close to animals. “They cannot even socialise with our zoo staff. Such is the level of precaution at the zoo. I and our veterinarians monitor enclosures from footage retrieved from the CCTVs,” the director said. Masks are made available inside the zoo campus. The Mysuru zoo and other zoos in the State were in financial crisis as they were closed for over two months because of the pandemic. Even before they could recover from last year’s impact, they were hammered again by the pandemic. Thanks to actor Darshan’s appeal, thousands of people made donations and adopted animals in all the nine zoos. The Zoo Authority of Karnataka thanked the actor for his gesture. The visitors at the palace were few. Many devotees had darshan at the Chamundi temple. G.T. Deve Gowda and Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, MLAs, offered prayers.

Yogeshwar revived the debate on leadership change in Karnataka, dissident BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil Yatnal launched a fresh offensive against the government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Speaking to reporters after visiting Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills here, Mr. Yatnal accused his own party’s government of indulging in unbridled corruption in various issues, including tackling COVID-19, while making out a case for replacing the Chief Minister if the BJP is to be “saved” in the Karnataka. The BJP leader said the party high command was following the situation in the State closely and expressed confidence that a decision would soon be taken to change the leadership in the State. “It will happen soon. I am not a soothsayer,” he said, when asked when the high command would act. Mr. Yatnal accused Mr. Yediyurappa’s son and State BJP vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra of holding negotiations for “deals” in the “drawing room” behind ‘Cauvery’, the official residence of the Chief Minister in Bengaluru. While referring to the episode involving the arrest of Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu’s aide recently, he sought to know why the Central Crime Branch police in Bengaluru did not summon the complainant Mr. Vijayendra and raid the “drawing room” of ‘Cauvery’. He also accused Mr. Yediyurappa of conspiring to “finish” the emerging leadership in different communities, including the Lingayats, to promote his own son as his successor. “But the people of Karnataka will never accept such politics,” he said. Even though there is provision to file a B-report or closure report in the case registered against former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who resigned after a sleaze video involving him surfaced, the Chief Minister was not allowing it with the intention of “blackmailing” him, Mr. Yatnal alleged. Apart from Mr. Sriramulu and Mr. Jarkiholi, Mr. Yatnal said, Mr. Yediyurappa was also targeting Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa, a leader form the Kuruba community. Mr. Yatnal also trained his guns on the Opposition leaders for allegedly “joining hands” with the government in “looting” the State and against mutt heads for standing by Mr. Yediyurappa. “If the mutt heads were interested in playing politics, they should discard their saffron robes and don khadi clothes,” he remarked. He said the Opposition leaders were silent against the corruption in the government as they were also “party to sharing the spoils”. Saying that the “Opposition” in Karnataka was dead, he described himself, BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath, and Mr. Yogeshwar as the true opposition in the State. Later, Mr. Yatnal met Mr. Vishwanath at a hotel in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yatnal-launches-fresh-attack-on-bsy-govt/article35160363.ece
06 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||54 lakes to get water from Kabini dam||As many as 54 lakes coming under the command area of Kabini dam would be getting water from the dam with the Irrigation Consultative Committee (ICC) resolving to release water from Monday. Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar made the announcement after the meeting of Kabini dam’s ICC here on Monday. Minister in charge of Chamarajanagar district S. Suresh Kumar, elected representatives from Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts, and officials from the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam were present. “The dam’s current water storage and details of water released in the previous years were studied. The opinion of elected representatives and officials was also taken,” Mr. Somashekar said. He said Mr. Suresh Kumar had spoken to him on the issue since water has to reach the lakes located in the tail end of the canals. “I have told the officers to take up repairs of irrigation canals besides their de-siltation. The MLAs have warned of staging protests if water doesn’t reach the lakes in the tail end of the canals by July-end. I support their stand,” he told the officers and engineers. A total of 1 tmc ft of water would be released in the next 15 days. As on Monday, the dam’s storage stood at 14.5 tmc ft and nearly 5 tmc ft of water would be used for irrigation purposes.. Mr. Somashekar said the proposed botanical gardens at Kabini dam on the lines of Brindavan Gardens would be taken up on a PPP model. Irrigation works to the tune of Rs. 80 crore in Nanjangud taluk were now getting funds. Harshavardan, MLA, was making efforts since the last one year for the purpose, the Minister told the meeting. Mr. Suresh Kumar said water from Kabini dam would benefit farmers in Yelandur, Kollegal and Hanur taluks in Chamarajnagar district. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha;, N. Mahesh, Anil Chikkamadu, Ashwin Kumar, Harshavardhan, MLAs; Deputy Commissioners of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar Bagadi Gautham and M.R. Ravi; Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Chief Engineer Shankare Gowda, and MUDA Chairman H.V.

06 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Panchamasali Lingayats will revive stir for reservation: Jayamruthyunjaya Swami||The seer of Lingayat Panchamasali Peetha Jayamruthyunjaya Swami has threatened to revive their agitation for reservation if the State government does keep its word. Visiting Mysuru on Monday, he said efforts were under way to organise the Gouda Lingayats in southern parts of the State like Mysuru and Chamarajanagar to join the agitation. The community, called ‘Pancahmasali’ in northern Karnataka, is referred by the nomenclature ‘Gouda Lingayats’ in southern parts of the State. He recalled the earlier agitation by the community, which is seeking inclusion in Other Backward Classes’ (OBC) 2A category, which has 15% reservation, from the present 3B category, which has 5% reservation. “We took out a padayatra of 712 kms over 39 days before holding a dharna for more than 21 days in Bengaluru’s Freedom Park earlier this year,” he said and warned of mobilising a larger crowd in the State capital if the government did not keep its promise. He also claimed that the BJP suffered a setback in the recent elections in Belagavi and Maski because the party government had ignored the demands of the Panchamasalis. The Swami, who said reservations in education and jobs are more important for the uplift of the community, said BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had spoken about the community’s interests in the Legislative Assembly. When his opinion was sought on the campaign for change of leadership in the State and whether their demand will receive attention at such a juncture, the Swami said it was appropriate to ‘strike when the iron is hot’. However, he said he was neutral on the issue of change of leadership. “But, in the event of a change, a Lingayat from North Karnataka should be given the opportunity. For, the community has capable leaders”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panchamasali-lingayats-will-revive-stir-for-reservation-jayamruthyunjaya-swami/article35160577.ece
06 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Somashekar questions Yogeshwar’s claims on BJP govt. formation||Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar on Monday sought to question Forest Minister C.P. Yogeshwar’s claims of playing a role in the formation of the BJP government in the State. Hitting out angrily at Mr. Yogeshwar without naming him, Mr. Somashekar said the BJP had come to power on the strength of 104 party MLAs, who had won in the 2018 Assembly polls under B.S. Yediyurappa’s leadership, and the support extended by 17 MLAs from Congress and JD(S). Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Mr. Somashekar, who was one of the 17 MLAs, said the BJP government could not have been formed if 104 MLAs had not won under Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership. “Mr. Yediyurappa is a born activist, who has toured the length and breadth of the State and one cannot speak against him through the media every day.” If there is a complaint against Mr. Yediyurappa, the same should be brought up during the BJP Legislature Party meeting. Mr. Somashekar was reacting to the claims made by Mr .Yogeshwar in Mysuru on Sunday that his contribution to bringing the BJP to power in the State was being ignored. The Minister for Cooperation also sought to make it clear that the 17 MLAs did not join the BJP based on the assurances given by Mr. Yogeshwar. He also took a dig at Mr. Yogeshwar by questioning why he lost the Assembly elections if he were to be making such tall claims. “People cannot speak against Mr. Yediyurappa on the street everyday,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/somashekar-questions-yogeshwars-claims-on-bjp-govt-formation/article35160743.ece

Restrictions in view of COVID-19 were eased further as part of the government’s Unlock 3.0. The city’s commercial hubs were pulsating with activity. Rush was evident at most clothing shops which had been shut in Unlock 2.0. The key roads witnessed heavy traffic. There were traffic jams on some roads in the city centre. However, traders at the Devaraja Market staged a demonstration in protest over the closure of the market. When all other businesses had been permitted, why are we being singled out, they asked.

06 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vaccine for 7 lakh people in Chamarajanagar dist. by August-end||The Chamarajanagar district administration has prepared a strategy for vaccinating about seven lakh eligible population by August-end amidst the continuing fight against the pandemic. As many as 60 primary health centres (PHCs) in Chamarajanagar, Kollegal, Hanur, Gundlupet and Yelandur taluks; community health centes (CHCs) in Santhemarahalli, Kabballi and Begur; and taluk hospitals in Chamarajanagar, Kollegal, Hanur, Gundlupet and Yelandur have been tasked to meet the target for shielding the populations from the virus. Details had been worked out on immunising the remaining eligible persons taking data from hospitals and PHCs on the number of people who had received first and second doses and those who had been administered only the first dose so far. Accordingly, the administration was making preparations to intensify vaccination. In Chamarajanagar taluk, 1,88,070 people are now eligible for the first dose. For this, the district authorities have set a target of vaccinating at least 3,197 people daily to cover the entire targeted population by August 31. As many as 48,678 people are eligible for the second dose in the taluk and the health authorities have proposed to jab 828 people daily. “If the plan was successfully implemented, the first dose of vaccination for 5,74,643 people and the second dose for 1,30,904 persons would be done by the end of August,” a release said here.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Corridors||Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar(in picture)and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, not known to see eye to eye on many issues, do not seem to be on the same page even with regard to a possible re-induction of leaders who left the party and became Ministers in the BJP government. While the former Chief Minister has categorically said in the past that all those who quit the party and joined the BJP would not be inducted again, the KPCC president said recently that all those who are willing to accept the ideology of the Congress can apply to join the party and the party would consider all applications. “The party’s decision is more important than individual opinions,” Mr. Shivakumar said. He added, however, that none among legislators who left the party and became Ministers had contacted the party so far. “I am not addressing just those individuals. Anyone can apply,” he said. Going to another political party and returning to the parent party is common in politics, he added.    Former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, facing a probe in an alleged sex-for-job scandal, recently flew to Mysuru to meet the Suttur Mutt seer in his personal aircraft and flew back to Belagavi within four hours. While he left Belagavi, he did not speak to journalists, but in Mysuru he spoke in detail about his “disappointment” with some of his “friends in the BJP” and that he was considering resignation from membership in the Legislative Assembly. On his return to Belagavi, he took some questions, but left many unanswered. Mr. Jarkiholi said he wanted to resign from the Assembly but dropped the idea on the advice of some senior leaders. The former Minister said he was unhappy about “some issues”, but it was not over not being made Minister again. Mr. Jarkiholi also said he was let down by some BJP leaders and he would work to “send them home”, but refused to mention any names. “My adversaries may be thinking that by ending my political life, they will erase the Jarkiholi family from politics. But I have my brothers and children to challenge them,” he said.   Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda(in picture), who has got an injunction order against the media from publishing any “false, baseless and reckless” news, had ironically criticised six Ministers in the State Cabinet when they got a similar gag order in March earlier this year. Following the CD scandal that forced Ramesh Jarkiholi to resign, six Ministers — K. Sudhakar, S.T. Somashekhar, Basavaraj Bommai, B.C. Patil, A. Shivaram Hebbar, and K.C. Narayan Gowda — got an injunction order barring the media from publishing any unverified video or CD of them. Mr. Gowda had then said that such actions would only fuel more speculation and rumours, adversely impacting the reputation of not only these individuals, but also of the party and the government. He had said that while those in public life had to fear smear campaigns and protect their reputation, gag orders were not the best option. Less than four months later, he too has gone down the gag order route.

Suresh Kumar S., chairman of the samiti, said that the protest would be strengthened. “We will organise a mass protest proclamation on July 7. It will be attended by environmentalist C.R. Neelakandan, former High Court judge B. Kemal Pasha and others,” Mr. Kumar said. The samiti is demanding suspension of ‘sea-washing’ activity at Thottappally. “Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd. (KMML) and Indian Rare Earths Ltd. (IREL), which are engaged in mining and transportation of sand, have created pits in the sea close to the mouth. Sand will automatically fill in the pits, making the entire mineral sand-mining activity much easier. They tried sea washing at Alappad a few years ago, where it was later prohibited. They have shifted all machines here. Sea washing will be detrimental to the entire Thottappally coast,” Mr. Kumar said. After a period of lull, removal and transportation of mineral-rich sand from Thottappally pozhi (sandbar at sea mouth) were resumed in May. For flow of floodwater According to officials with the Irrigation Department, the sand is removed to ensure the smooth flow of floodwaters from Kuttanad into the sea. The sand removed is being transported to the KMML and the IREL. The protesters said they were not against dredging of the channel and removal of sand from pozhi in a limited way, which was an annual process, but were opposed to the transportation of mineral-rich sand to the KMML and the IREL units at Chavara. Local residents, especially fishers who are up in arms, allege that the government is engaged in large-scale mineral sand-mining in the disguise of flood mitigation. The coastline is prone to severe sea attacks and coastal erosion. Residents fear the sand-mining would prove detrimental to people living along the shorelines from Valiazheekal to Punnapra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mineral-sand-mining-stir-completes-26-days/article35160677.ece

06 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Call for Chathiath-Chennur road grows louder||In pursuance of their long-standing demand for a road linking Chathiath in mainland Ernakulam with Chennur, near North Paravur, through the string of islands located in between, the islanders have demanded that a portion of the around 15 lakh cubic metres of mud that will shortly be removed from the backwaters off Vaduthala, be used to build the road that was envisaged in the 1960s. The massive accumulation of mud and slush occurred since the construction firm, which built the railway overbridge to link the container transshipment terminal at Vallarpadam with the mainland, failed to demolish a temporary bund that it built beneath the structure a decade ago. A decision to demolish the bund was taken in June, since Kalamassery and Aluva were of late encountering flooding, with the bund obstructing free flow of water. With a high-level meeting to discuss issues regarding the Vembanad lake slated for Saturday, Francis Dianish, vice chairman of Pizhala Karamuttikal Samara Samithi, an NGO formed to catalyse the establishment of road connectivity with the isles, sent a memorandum in this regard to the Minister for Industries P. Rajeeve. “Around a lakh cubic meters of the total volume of mud that ought to be removed from here could be put to optimal use to build a 5.50-km road linking Chathiath with Chennur, through Thanthonni Thuruth, Korangotta, Moolampilly, and Pizhala islands. Apart from ushering in road connectivity to two dozen isles in the region where over 30,000 people live, the road will considerably lessen the Ernakulam city-North Paravur distance from 32 km to about 22 km,” said Mr. Dianish. The Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) had conducted a study on such a road corridor. A majority of the beneficiaries would be people who belonged to Scheduled Caste communities who resided in the islands through which the road would pass through, he added. Meanwhile, the Irrigation Department had begun probing the feasibility of the proposal, said official sources. “Among other aspects, the soil from the bund would have to be tested to ensure that it is fit for being used for road construction. Logistical aspects like how best to transport the mud to the isles too must be probed,” they added. Sources in GIDA said they had not received any official communication. The Kothad-Chennur bridge, Chennur-Pizhala bridge, and Chennur-Chariyamthuruth  bridges received administrative sanction earlier this year. “Lessening the road distance between the city and Paravur is in sync with our infra proposals in the isles. In many instances, bridges that are ready need proper approach roads. A case in point is the Valiya Kadamakudy-Chathanad bridge. Many such projects are suffering delay since they pass through ecologically-fragile regions,” they said. Water metro While it is true that Water Metro ferries are slated to link many of the isles, they are badly in need of road connectivity since transportation of goods in bulk is possible only through roads. Barges encountered difficulty in negotiating through shallow areas, said sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-chathiath-chennur-road-grows-louder/article35160629.ece

The Labour Department had issued a notice to the company while a group of MLAs, led by P.T. Thomas, had levelled charges of environmental pollution. Kitex Group chairman Sabu M. Jacob had accused the government agencies of hounding the company and holding nearly a dozen checks on the premises in June without intimation. He threatened to withdraw from making investments to the tune of Rs. 3,500 crore in two apparel parks and an industrial park in the State. However, the Industries Department reached out to him. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve said that surprise raids were not part of the government policy and Mr. Jacob’s grievances would be addressed. More than 10,000 employees have joined the protest, claims T. Sandhya, who works in the garments unit of the company. ‘Employees are happy’ The employees gathered at the Kitex Grounds in Kizhakkambalam, adhering to COVID-19 protocol, holding candles. Ms. Sandhya says the employees are happy. Those from outside the company are raising false allegations, she says. Sangeeta Barsar from Silchar, Assam, who has been working in the same unit for seven years, says she has not faced any problems. The salary is good and paid on time. Kitex Garments, established 26 years ago, has a strong presence in markets like the U.S. The company, with an annual turnover of around Rs. 1,000 crore, has complained of obstacles being raised by the local panchayat over the years. MD’s version Meanwhile, reacting to Industries Minister P. Rajeeve’s comments on Monday, Mr. Jacob reiterated that he had no official communication on the statements but stood by his earlier stand that he was being hounded and portrayed as a troublemaker. “Nobody is asking why I am withdrawing from further investments in the State,” Mr. Jacob said. He said the government was continually changing its stand on why so many raids were conducted on the company premises. “The government says that inspections were made on the basis of complaints by Benny Behanan, MP, and P.T. Thomas, MLA. This was not its earlier stance,” Mr. Jacob added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kitex-staff-back-management/article35160687.ece

The shooting of movies and television serials was suspended following the second wave on April 29. Livelihood hit Mr. Suresh Kumar said that nearly 60 movies were held up at various stages of pre- and post-production work. "The crisis has taken a toll on the livelihood of many workers in the industry. Their resources have drained up and we need to help them by resuming shooting," he said. Indoor work M. Renjith, president of the Kerala Film Producers' Association, said the producers were hoping that shooting would resume once the average test positivity rate drops below eight. "But it may take some more time to achieve it going by the current rate. Indoor works can resume if we get the permission from the government,” he said. On the relief package required to save the ailing industry, Mr. Suresh Kumar said a request had been submitted before the government to do away with the entertainment tax on tickets charged over and above the Goods and Services Tax. "The government had waived the fixed electricity charges for cinemas up to May, and we hope that it would be extended further in view of the continuing deadlock,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/film-industry-seeks-nod-to-resume-shooting/article35160642.ece
06 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Multiple gangs involved in Karipur gold case: Customs||Three gangs had reached the Karipur airport on June 21 to grab the 2.3 kg of gold worth Rs. 11 crore smuggled in a coffeemaker from Dubai by Mohammed Shafeeque, a Malappuram native, according to the Customs (Preventive), Kochi. The investigating team revealed the operation of multiple gangs in the smuggling racket while producing Shafeeque before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, after his custody period ended on Monday. The accused said a number of persons from Koduvally, Kozhikode and Kannur were involved in a well-organised smuggling network based in Dubai. The members of one gang recruit men from other gangs as informers. These gangs then deploy criminals to abduct the carrier and physically assault him to steal the smuggled gold. In this case, a gang from Koduvally and two gangs from Kannur were involved. ‘Threat to life’ Shafeeque told the Customs that he had faced threat to his life from the Cherupulassery gang (that was hired by the Koduvally gang to help it seize gold from Shafeeque) while he was in judicial custody at the Manjeri sub-jail. He identified from a photo the person who had threatened him against disclosing anything to the probe team. Shafeeque was later shifted to the sub-jail in Kakkanad. One gang was reportedly led by Yousuf of Kannur and they had reached the airport to seize the gold from Shafeeque. The other two gangs were led by Arjun Ayanki, a Kannur native and former member of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, and Soofiyan, a Koduvally native. Shafeeque stated that Arjun had promised him protection as he had the backing of ‘Kodi’ Suni and Shafi K.K., convicts in the T.P. Chandrasekharan murder case, against threats from the Koduvally gang. Wife questioned The investigating team questioned Arjun’s wife at its office here on Monday. It had earlier obtained documents and digital evidence linking him to the racket. He was arrested by the Customs last week. The officials expect to get leads into the financial sources of Arjun from his wife. He had initially claimed that his wife’s family had helped him financially. Car seized Meanwhile, Customs officials seized another car used by Arjun. He told the Customs that the car was used to escort gold smugglers. The car was identified after verifying CCTV camera footage. Police sources said the car belonged to K. Vikas, a native of Udinoor in Kasaragod district.

The pond was among the 100 water bodies rejuvenated under the “'Ente Kulam” project of the Haritha Keralam Mission. Pannikuzha Chira, spread over two acres, was rejuvenated at a cost of Rs. 30 lakh. Nearly 25 lakh was provided under the people's plan programme of the panchayat while Cochin Shipyard had given Rs. 5 lakh under its corporate social responsibility initiative. The pond was given a facelift after adopting environment-friendly methods such as wall strengthening and pond bank stabilisation efforts. The primary objective of the Ente Kulam programme was to enhance the overall ecosystem and improve the water quality in ponds to meet the increasing water scarcity in the summer season. The local communities were entrusted with the task of protecting water bodies from ecological deterioration, said Sujith Karun, district co-ordinator of Haritha Keralam.

She says she is awaiting the day when she will be able to harvest again the five acres that she inherited as part of family property in Maruvakkad in Chellanam panchayat, where the paddy collective extends over a total of 420 acres with around 260 acres identified as cultivable. Pokkali cultivation has been disrupted in the paddy collective for more than a decade, but Ms. Kalathungal’s indomitable spirit was evident during a brief birthday celebration, in which only a few people participated, restricted by the COVID-19 protocol.  Pokkali rice cultivation in the Maruvakkad paddy collective has caught attention with the Kerala High Court directing the district administration to make arrangements quickly to drain the fields to pave the way for rice cultivation. The directive came on a petition by farmer Manjadiparambil Chantu. After the court directive, revenue officials visited the paddy collective on Saturday to review the condition of the fields. Pokkali farmers have been appealing for intervention from the authorities to help maintain the traditional rice-and-fish cycle. Shrimp farming However, they had alleged that the lucrative shrimp farming had resulted in the rice cycle being abandoned midway or in pushing up the cost of cultivation. But farmers like Ms. Kalathungal is not put down easily. She is ready to take up cultivation if the fields can be readied for sowing. Pokkali rice is a saltwater-resistant variety that is grown along the coastal fields of Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur. The traditional farming cycle comprises one-rice-one-fish season, each spread equally over a period of one year. Over the years, shortage of labour, rising costs, and heavy rains due to substantially changed climatic conditions have resulted in rice cultivation taking a big beating.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/on-97th-birthday-pokkali-farmer-wishes-for-a-rich-harvest/article35160639.ece

The step, according to sources, followed the concerns flagged by KC(M) chairman Jose K. Mani over a perceived lack of CPI(M) support to the candidates in these two crucial seats, besides Piravom and Perumbavoor. “The KC(M)’s association with the CPI(M) was strong at the top, but at the grassroots, it was a different scene as evident from the clash that broke out between a KC(M) and a CPI(M) councillor in the Pala municipality just ahead of the Assembly election. In Perumbavoor, there were even complaints about a CPI(M) leader initiating a negative campaign against our candidate,” explained a KC(M) leader. The KC(M) workers, on the other hand, extended whole-hearted support to the Left party candidates elsewhere in Kottayam and Idukki, and at some locations in Malabar, he added. Besides the CPI(M) commission, a steering committee of the KC(M) that is slated to meet on Tuesday too will examine the setback to the KC(M) candidates, including its chairman in Pala. A proposed transition of the party structure with the appointment of full-time workers and changes in the nomination culture too are slated to come up for discussion in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/parties-to-review-kcms-loss-in-its-strongholds/article35160669.ece

In a statement issued here, Kerala Congress (M) general secretary Stephen George urged the State government to withdraw the statement and seek explanation from the lawyer who made such a highly irresponsible remark.

In its revised programme, the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has said that jobs for Saudi nationals will be applicable in legal advice, law firms, customs clearance, real estate, cinema sector, driving schools, and technical and engineering professions. Simplification of rules Sources said that the aim was to provide 3,40,000 jobs by 2024 and simplify compliance rules for businesses. Already, Nitaqat related programmes have enabled Saudis to secure jobs in the private sector, replacing Indians and other nationals from Pakistan and Bangladesh in the labour market. Several sectors such as commercial complexes, food and beverage industry as well as public education began enforcing the programme from last year. Last week, the Ministry commenced the process of verifying necessary skills workers have to possess in their field. The professional verification programme was part of a mandatory plan for all entities in Saudi Arabia. However, expatriates are concerned over it, a source said. As of now, persons could check their iqama (residençe permit) profession to see if they required exams or not (https://svp.qiwa.sa/en/test_taker/search ). If a ‘no data available’ is displayed, then the profession has not been included for professional verification exams. According to the Saudi Press Agency, ‘professional verification programme would ensure that the worker possesses the necessary skills by conducting practical and theoretical tests in the field of specialisation.’ 23 speciality fields The programme has targeted over 1,000 professions in 23 speciality fields as per the Saudi Standard Classification of Occupations. The programme, sources said, would adversely impact Indians seeking employment in Saudi Arabia. One of the aims of the verification programme is to examine professional workers before their arrival in that country. However, the examination was also to test professional workers currently in Saudi Arabia, sources said. The verification programme would begin with facilities having 3,000 or more workers, followed by other categories (500 to 2,999 workers) and (50 to 499 workers).

The civic body is planning to approach the State government for support, P.C. Rajan, standing committee chairman on public works, has said. The ambitious project was conceived around 10 years ago under the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project (KSUDP). However, it met with quite a lot of stumbling blocks due to the proximity of the land identified for the project to the Kottooli wetland, an eco-hotspot in the midst of the city. The local residents’ association and Kottooli Wetland Protection Committee came out in protest against the project alleging that it will disrupt the ecosystem in the wetland as well as the Conolly Canal that runs next to the plot. They approached the National Green Tribunal and the case went on for years, ultimately ending in favour of the corporation around a year ago. Meanwhile, the KSUDP became defunct and the funds were no longer available. “At the beginning, the cost of the project was estimated at Rs. 93 crore. But now it has doubled. We need at least Rs. 200 crore to complete the project,” Mr. Rajan, who headed the standing committee on development in his previous term as councillor, said. The pipelines for the project had been laid across the city at a cost of Rs. 17 crore even before the plant became an issue. The plot identified for the project spans 2.6 acres that belonged to the Kerala Water Authority. Devoid of any activities, the land is now covered in shrubbery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lack-of-funds-delaying-stp-project-near-sarovaram-biopark/article35160622.ece

Though more than 100 cases of biting by these carnivorous mammals have been reported so far from different parts of Mukkom and surrounding villages, the Forest Department is yet to find a lasting solution to the problem. Leaders of a local residents’ group complained that the traps set by the Forest Department had been found useless for addressing the menace. Afraid of the attack of these animals, people were not even in a situation to bath or swim in the river, they said. “The latest victims of the animal’s attack are three youths who were bathing in the river near Theyyathumkadavu in Kodiyathur last Friday. It is emerging as a threat and timely medication is also crucial for saving lives,” said members of “Ente Swantham Iruvazhinhi”, a collective of local environmental activists. “For more than a year, we have been facing this challenge,” they said. Fed up with the Forest Department’s laxity, the environmentalists’ forum submitted a memorandum recently to Minister for Forests, A.K. Saseendran. The main demand they raised was to declare this animal as vermin and adopt appropriate controlling measures. P. Unnikrishnan, a retired health inspector and social activist from Manassery, says the families residing close to the river could not even spend their leisure time on the river banks with the increasing attack of the animals. “The biggest trouble is obtaining the four shots of intradermal rabies vaccine.

An official said any relaxation of the limitations would hinge on a marked reduction in the test positivity rate (TPR). Moreover, the threat of a third wave driven by highly transmissible variants of the virus loomed. The government is under duress from various sectors, including retail traders, hotels, hospitality, tourism and the entertainment industry, to open up rapidly. Delay in vehicle repair Car companies in Kerala could open only on alternate days on weekdays. No sales are allowed. The companies have reported a mounting backlog of vehicles for service and repair. Citizens were finding it increasingly difficult to find a maintenance slot for their cars and two-wheelers. Car showrooms have approached the administration to permit them to resume minimum sales on select weekdays. Other sectors cratered by the pandemic are also pressing the government for a speedier opening up of the economy. Electronic service centres and mobile phone showrooms have requested permission to open on all weekdays. So have hairdressers and beauticians’ associations, and unions of street food sellers. Several district administrations were sceptical about dialling down the intensity of the curbs given the unyieldingly high TPR. The government has classified at least 90 local self-government jurisdictions as critical spread localities. The disease spread remained worryingly high in another 800 local bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-wary-of-spread-in-north-kerala/article35160689.ece
06 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Caution on surge during Onam||A two-member team from the Union Health Ministry, deputed by the Centre to assess the COVID-19 situation in the State, on Monday raised caution at the possibility of yet another surge in active cases during the upcoming Onam festival season. It stressed the need to strengthen contact tracing in Thiruvananthapuram district. The team comprised Ruchi Jain, public health specialist at the Regional Office for Health and Family Welfare in Thiruvananthapuram, and S. Vinod Kumar, Senior Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry. Visit to hospital The officials began their tour of the district with a visit to General Hospital, which has been functioning as a COVID-19 hospital. They later later interacted with District Collector Navjot Khosa and senior district health officials before proceeding for various containment zones, including those in Malayinkeezhu and Kalliyoor grama panchayats. The team also visited the Chala market for a first-hand view of the arrangements in the shopping centre that normally teems with traders and customers during festival seasons. Emerging from the meeting, District Medical Officer K.S. Shinu said that the Central team expressed its satisfaction with the district’s handling of the second COVID-19 wave and the medical facilities that were in place. The steady fall in caseload and test positivity rate (TPR) was also seen as a result of intensified containment activities. “They, however, expressed concern at the possibility of the case graph peaking by August end or September after plateauing currently. The phased return to normal life in view of the falling TPR could be marked by intense activity during the Onam season. Like last year, we cannot afford to celebrate with gay abandon. Such a stance could potentially lead to a hazardous situation during the third wave,” he said. Contact tracing Dr. Shinu also hinted at steps to intensify contact tracing that seemed to have lost steam during the last few months. The Central team is expected to visit Kollam and Pathanamthitta during the next days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/caution-on-surge-during-onam/article35160794.ece
06 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Rich tributes pour in for Stan Swamy||Religious leaders, social activists and leaders cutting across political lines in Kerala mourned the death of noted tribal activist and Jesuit priest Father Stan Swamy. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan tweeted: “Deeply saddened by the passing of Fr. Stan Swamy. Unjustifiable that a man who fought all through his life for our society’s most downtrodden had to die in custody. Such a travesty of justice should have no place in our democracy. Heartfelt condolences”. The 84-year-old priest, held in custody in connection with the Elgar Parishad case, had died at a hospital in Mumbai. ‘Unjustly incarcerated’ Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said Father Stan Swamy was the victim of State-sponsored murder. He was unjustly incarcerated in a UAPA case with little scope for bail. The ailing veteran’s suffering in prison was a blot on the country’s democratic credentials. Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC) said the priest was denied justice. He was incarcerated under a harsh law and suffered from ill-health in prison. Finally, the court intervened to rush Father Stan Swamy to the hospital. The KCBC said he was a champion of marginalised tribal communities in Jharkhand. His death has steeped the country in sorrow. Major Archbishop Cardinal Mar Cleemis, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran and persons from different walks of life condoled Father Stan’s demise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rich-tributes-pour-in-for-stan-swamy/article35160692.ece
06 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Centre undermining federalism: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday faulted the BJP-led Union government for muscling legislation on Concurrent list subjects through Parliament on the sheer weight of numbers and without an informed debate or consultation with States. Mr. Vijayan was chairing a meeting of MPs ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament. The Centre’s capricious actions undermined federalism and threatened to relegate States to a subaltern position. Mr. Vijayan said the Centre had passed laws liberalising the farm sector without any thought for the welfare of marginal farmers. It had brought the Centre into direct conflict with the States. Agriculture was a subject on the Concurrent list. Several States were constrained to pass laws to override the adverse consequences of the Central legislation. On State subjects The Centre encroached on State subjects such as education, ports, airports, power generation, transmission, and health. Mr. Vijayan said the MPs should persuade the Centre to relax the norms for drawing assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund. Moreover, the Centre should amend the Company Act to channel their social responsibility funds to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The Centre should meet its GST compensation liabilities. The meeting also flagged the Centre’s attempt to deprive States of their taxation powers systematically. Congress MP Kodikunnil Suresh walked out of the online meeting. He argued against the SilverLine semi-high-speed railway project, stating that the ‘quixotic’ scheme would displace more than 25,000 families. Mr. Vijayan said the government would go ahead with the project that would reduce travel time and open up Kerala’s hinterland for economic development.  At meeting with MPs, he says States are not consulted on Concurrent list subjects||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/centre-undermining-federalism-cm/article35160690.ece
06 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Lockdown pushes small enterprises to the brink||Last week, a 54-year-old man committed suicide in the capital after two of his business ventures failed in succession during the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Just before the pandemic hit, Nirmal Chandran had availed a loan to renovate his light and sound company. With events and festivals cancelled, he was left with no business. Recovering from the unexpected jolt, he had opened a chicken shop in the rural outskirts, which also failed to take off. For many who have been running small commercial enterprises, the mounting losses and unpaid loans have been a familiar story since last March. The periodic easing and tightening of lockdown restrictions too has brought in a lot of uncertainty for businesses. For the government too, it has been a tight situation, balancing the need to reduce the test positivity rate (TPR) and at the same time ensuring that the economy does not grind to a halt, pushing many to penury. Limited days “As motorcycle repair shops are now allowed to open only thrice in a week, it is hard for us to make enough profits to pay the workers. The work too keeps mounting, as all those who have kept their vehicles idle through the lockdown are bringing it for repair works, all of which we are unable to take up because we cannot finish it unless we can open the shop everyday,” says Renjith, who runs a workshop. The Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi has called for a shutdown of shops on Tuesday, demanding permission from the State government to open shops on all days. “Except the shops for essentials, all other establishments are allowed to function only on three days. This will only create more rush of shoppers, as evident during these days, especially on Fridays. In addition, There are several other types of shops, including those selling home appliances, furniture and other materials, which are not yet allowed to open. But the sale of such items continue in online shopping sites,” says Peringamala Ramachandran, vice-president of the Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi. He says that quite a few of the traders are deep in debt. Compensation One of the demands put forward by the Samithi to the government is a provision of compensation for the families of traders who have committed suicide. According to Mr.Ramachandran, the Samithi has been providing help at the unit level to traders who have been struggling during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lockdown-pushes-small-enterprises-to-the-brink/article35160766.ece

The test positivity rate also fell to 7.7% on the day. Thiruvananthapuram had last reported a lower figure in terms of daily case reporting when it registered 666 cases on April 14. With 1,209 people recovering from their illnesses, the number of active cases also decreased to 8,342.

This is something all public health experts had predicted, that the plateau in the second wave would be protracted and that the curve would settle at a higher plateau than it did in the first wave, post lockdown. Disease transmission now appears to rise in some parts of the State and if it is not contained in a timely manner, the surge can result in a third wave. TPR at 10.3% On Monday, the State reported 8,037 new cases when the samples tested in the past 24 hours dropped to 80,134. Test positivity rate (TPR) continued to remain around 10%, registering at 10.03% on Monday. The number of recoveries on the day was 11,346 cases. The State added 102 recent deaths to the official list of COVID-19 deaths on Monday. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals on Monday was 1,869.

Employees will be permitted to re-enter /amend their transfer-related options and a revised draft transfer list for 2021-22 will be published on July 12, the State-run water utility said in a July 5 order. This is the first time in the KWA that the general transfer process is being carried out online using the G-Spark software. The July 5 order noted that employees will be given the opportunity to re-enter their options by filing an application to their office heads. The latter are required to prepare the list of employees who have applied and submit before 5 p.m. on Tuesday. Individual applications will not be entertained, the KWA said. The employees who have their names in the list will be given time from 10 a.m. on Wednesday to 11.59 p.m. on Thursday to mention their options. Spate of complaints The July 2 draft list had triggered a spate of complaints and employee organisations in the KWA had demanded steps to redress the grievances. After the first draft was published, unions representing KWA officers and other staff had urged the KWA management to sort out the issues and give employees the opportunity to re-submit options. In a July 3 letter to the KWA managing director, the KWA Employees Union (CITU) pointed out that even staff who had not completed three years at a station had been listed for transfer to distant places although they had not requested it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plaints-over-transfer-list-kwa-issues-fresh-orders/article35160767.ece

As the State is set to observe yet another World Zoonoses Day on Tuesday, veterinarians, wildlife experts and pathologists have pushed for a coordinated response mechanism to mitigate the impacts of zoonoses and devise collaborative strategies to prevent their recurrence. “The recurrence of zoonotic events remains a mystery in the State,” says Nandakumar S. Nair, Disease Investigation Officer, State Institute for Animal Diseases, Palode. He attributed them to the failure to tackle such diseases by considering animals, humans and environment as inter-related. P.O. Nameer, Head of Wildlife Sciences, College of Forestry, Kerala Agricultural University, echoed the view while lamenting the lack of focus in ecological conservation. “Very often, we tend to ignore the health of the environment. Sadly, the scant regard towards the need to protect the ecosystem has led to long-lasting impacts on public health. Besides, diseases must no longer be viewed in a unidimensional manner. The root cause of most outbreaks were linked to human interventions on the nature,” he said.  The drivers of viral emergents will be discussed at the World Zoonoses Day commemoration being organised by the Indian Veterinary Association (IVA) Kerala on Tuesday. Animal Husbandry Minister Chinchu Rani will inaugurate a national seminar on ‘Multiple stakeholder approach in tackling emerging zoonoses’. Public health expert B.

Zoo keepers who reached the animal enclosure that morning were treated to the sight of a newborn, presumably born sometime in the night to Janavi, a 10-year-old leopard who was brought to the city zoo in November 2015 from the Meppadi forest range in Wayanad. The father is Shukkoor, a leopard brought to the Neyyar sanctuary initially from Kannur in mid-2017. Both the mother leopard and the cub are healthy, zoo authorities said. The cub, yet to open its eyes, and the mother leopard are housed in a separate enclosure, away from the other four male and one female leopard, and will remain like that till the cub is some months old at least, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/leopard-cub-born-in-zoo/article35160793.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A commendable attempt at shaking a societal norm||Dislodging ideas cast in stone requires more than a gentle push. In Sara's , director Jude Anthany Joseph and scriptwriter Akshay Hareesh attempt to shake from its foundation one such idea, which has been accepted as normal in society, and by extension in mainstream cinema. Sara (Anna Ben), an associate director in the film industry, wants to make a movie of her own. While working on the script for her dream debut, she meets Jeevan (Sunny Wayne) who is taking a break back home, away from the hectic life in the IT industry. They fall in love, with Sara especially being drawn to him for the fact that he shares her choice to remain child-free. But, as time passes, societal pressures begin to act on them. In his third outing too, Jude Anthany Joseph sticks to a woman-centric subject, but the similarity with the previous two films ends there, except for the relationship between Sara and her father, which is similar to the one in Ohm Shanthi Oshana . He also retains the somewhat light treatment that he gave for heavy subjects here too. It works at times, but at other times it leaves us wishing for something more concrete. What deserves applause though is the fact that the script never diverts from the central idea, which revolves around Sara's choice and her intense wish to become a filmmaker. The narrative is a deft balance between these two, for the societal pressures on her choice in turn has a bearing on her dream too. It also portrays her struggles to convince producers with her script, which we are told, does not have the elements expected from a mainstream film. As for Jude's film, the laudable progressive stand that it takes does not always make up for the plain, lazy filmmaking in some parts. Other than Sara's character, the rest of them appear hazy and stuck in a single tone. The transformation in some characters too appears quick and rather convenient. In real world, women like Sara will not have it easy, as the protagonist here has. Brave reversal Yet, this is a brave reversal of years of glorification of motherhood and looking down upon those who dare to take a path of their choice. It is a study in contrast to films like the Salman Khan-starrer Sultan , which had a woman wrestler who was working towards an Olympic gold, giving up the dream after she becomes pregnant, with the script glorifying it. Anna Ben's assured performance goes a long way in propping up the film even in places where it sags due to below-par writing. Despite the glitches, Sara's is a commendable attempt at course correction on some deeply set societal norms. S.R. Praveen    Film: Sara's Starring: Anna Ben, Sunny Wayne Direction: Jude Anthany Joseph||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-commendable-attempt-at-shaking-a-societal-norm/article35160627.ece

The DIG stamps in an official communique said that she was informed about the use of fake documents in a complaint by a person Tarimela Rajamohan Reddy of Hyderabad after he found the discrepancy in the sale deed agreement he had undergone on November 30, 2020, with one C. Chinna Nallapa Reddy, a resident of Nadimidoddi village in Narpala Mandal of Anantapur district. The fake non-judicial stamp papers were sold by stamp vendor A. Hameeda Banu in order to create a false sale agreement to register land in Sy. No. 428/1 with an extent of Ac. 5.18 cents of Peravali village, in collusion with some officials of the Registrar office at Anantapur. The complainant has also asked for cancellation of the sale deed No. 4776/2021 dated March 24, 2021. The complainant had said the stamps vendor allegedly cheated him by registering the said land in the name of J. Bala Narasimha Reddy on April 19, 2021 with a fake sale agreement written on the stamp papers (AN 545740 and AN 545752) with ante-dates. The complainant also stated that the stamp papers (AN 545740 and AN 545752) were sold by the vendor A. Hameeda Banu with ante-dates without entries in the sale register only to create the fake sale agreement. The same was established in the RTI replies furnished by the Registrar’s office. Moreover, as per the RTI replies the stamp papers were not issued in the name of A. Hameeda Banu and were issued in the name of S. Khadar Basha in 2012 whose license was cancelled in 2015. The Registrar has been asked to initiate a criminal case against S. Khadar Basha and A. Hameeda Banu after an inquiry and seizure of the entire stock of the stamp papers with them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/probe-ordered-into-fake-stamp-papers-case/article35160286.ece

Announcing the new school at Tumakuru on Monday, Mines Minister Murugesh Nirani said the detailed project report was already ready and the school would come up on 50 acres in Ballari. “Shortly, we will seek Cabinet approval for the new school, which will provide international level training to both owners and workers of mines,” he said, adding that the school would help prevent unscientific mining practices. The Minister also said the State would appeal before the Supreme Court to lift the ban on export of minerals from Karnataka. “The restriction has caused enormous loss to the State exchequer. The iron ore was being bought at a cheaper price and steel was being exported at a higher price,” he said.

Of the 316 cases, 80 cases came from two municipal corporations and six municipalities. Deputy District Medical and Health Officer (Deputy DMHO) P. Ravi Raju, who inspected the primary health centres in Narayanavanam mandal close to the Tamil Nadu border, said that though the number of daily COVID positive cases were under control in the urban areas, the rural side was still reporting a high number of infections. “During inspections in the rural areas, it is found that crowded get-togethers are being organised to celebrate family functions. Most of the guests who visit from neighbouring States are not following COVID protocols like wearing masks and sanitising their hands. This could again lead to a spurt in cases and cause a potential third wave,” he said. The Deputy DM&HO interacted with the medical and paramedical staff on COVID duties in the rural areas to promote public awareness on COVID protocols while attending the functions. “The breather in COVID cases in the second wave is being taken casually by the public in the rural areas. We have already initiated steps in coordination with the police to check overloading in auto-rickshaws and not wearing masks in areas bordering Tamil Nadu. The field staff have also been informed to dissuade organisers of social functions from encouraging mass gatherings,” Dr. Ravi Raju said. Meanwhile, senior police officials said that as the relaxation in curfew would be extended till 9 p.m., surveillance would be intensified at public places, particularly at bus stops, vegetable and meat markets and malls. “Areas with high positivity rate will continue to have restrictions,” DSP N.

It followed Telangana filing a contempt petition in the matter of RLIS works in NGT Southern Zone Bench at Chennai and writing letters to the Member-Secretary of Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of MoEF and Krishna River Management Board (KRMB). In his letter to MoJS Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy sought notifying the jurisdiction of KRMB covering all off-takes of irrigation and power on common reservoirs to stop indiscriminate drawal of water solely for power generation by Telangana and direct the river board to visit the sites of “unauthorised” projects of the latter first, before visiting RLIS site. Stating that Telangana continues to violate the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act blatantly, the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister said Telangana’s unilateral actions were causing distress and depriving AP of its rightful share in Krishna waters. In the letter to MoEF Prakash Javadekar, he requested the Union Minister to use his good office, intervene and issue necessary instructions for issuance of environmental clearance (EC) to RLIS early. Meanwhile, a few senior engineers in Irrigation Department of Telangana, who spoke to The Hindu , said the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister’s letter to MoEF amounts to openly influencing an independent committee (EAC) for taking decision in favour of Andhra Pradesh by intervening the proceedings of the panel and instruct it to clear the project (RLIS). In a letter to the Member-Secretary of EAC on River Valley Projects, Special Chief Secretary (Irrigation) of Telangana Rajat Kumar requested to consider facts such as want of water allocation by the Central Water Commission (CWC), the ground on which EC was not recommended to Sita-Rama LI of Telangana, while appraising RLIS for EC on July 7. He also brought to the expert panel’s notice that Pothireddypadu Head Regulator system itself was an unauthorised project not approved by CWC and its expansion along with RLIS would adversely impact the eco-system of the region as several wildlife sanctuaries – Rollapadu, Gundla Brahmeswaram, Lanka Malleswara, Penusila Narasimha, Rajiv Gandhi and others – exists within 10 km radius of the project canals. On the other hand, Telangana filed a contempt petition in NGT Chennai on Monday on RLIS works and requested physical inspection by the tribunal to view the aggravated form of the contempt, restrain AP for executing RLIS taken up without any approvals and EC and initiate action against the agency executing it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-telangana-row-over-krishna-water-intensifies/article35160234.ece

According to the State government, less than 29% of the R&R package was settled by the June-end. “We planned to leave for Vijayawada to take part in the deeksha on Sunday night, but were put under house arrest. Members of many adivasi associations and the cadres of the Left parties in Ramachandrapuram, Rajamahendravaram, Samarlakota, and Rampachodavaram were put under house arrest,” a release quoted CPI district secretary Thatipaka Madhu as saying.

06 July 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Son jailed in UAE for spying for India, says Kerala resident||A writ petition has been filed in the Kerala High Court by a woman from Thiruvananthapuram seeking a directive to the Union government to provide her necessary legal, diplomatic, and political support for bringing back her son who has been jailed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the charges of spying for the Indian government. In her petition, Shahubanath Beevi from Thiruvananthapuram said her son, Shihani Meera Sahib Jamal Muhammed, had been in the Abu Dhabi Central Prison, UAE, since his arrest in 2015 for the alleged offence. Her son was sentenced to 10-year jail term because of the failure of the Indian authorities to provide him effective legal support. The verdict of the UAE federal appeal court had been confirmed by the Federal Supreme Court on April 16, 2017. Her petition said the UAE court orders had specifically mentioned the particulars of Indian Embassy officials such as consular officer Anup Kumar Shrivastava, military attache Anrup Mukherjee and first secretary, Arun Jain, who had collected information from the petitioner’s son through emails and SMS. It was the bounden duty of the Indian government to save its innocent citizen from the clutches of a “blind and merciless” justice system, her appeal said.  ‘Tortured in prison’ The petition alleged that her son was subjected to third-degree torture by putting him in cellular burrows for months in extremely cold temperatures and fastening stun belts around the waist which delivered high-voltage shocks. His wife, brothers, and other relatives working in the UAE had tried to meet him, but to no avail. The petition is likely to come up before the court on July 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/son-jailed-in-uae-for-spying-for-india-says-kerala-resident/article35160240.ece

Yogeshwar revived the debate on leadership change in Karnatka, dissident BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil Yatnal launched a fresh offensive against the government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Speaking to reporters after visiting Chamundeshwari Temple on Monday, Mr. Yatnal accused his own party government of indulging in unbridled corruption in various issues, including tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, while making out a case for replacement of the Chief Minister if the “BJP is to be saved” in Karnataka. Responding to queries, Mr. Yatnal said the BJP leadership was viewing the situation in the State closely and expressed confidence that a decision would soon be taken for change in the State. He accused Mr. Yediyurappa’s son and State BJP vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra of negotiating “deals” in the “drawing room” behind ‘Cauvery’, the official residence of the Chief Minister. He accused Mr. Yediyurappa of conspiring to “finish” the emerging leadership in different communities including the Lingayats to promote his own son as his successor. “But, people of Karnataka will never accept such politics,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dissident-mla-yatnal-attacks-yediyurappa-govt-again/article35160233.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||LDF leaders should face trial, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not condone the behaviour of Kerala’s Left Democratic Front (LDF) leaders, including the current Education Minister V. Sivankutty, who created a ruckus and indulged in vandalism on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, disrupting the presentation of the budget in 2015. The televised images from the day of the incident, during the United Democratic Front (UDF) government’s tenure, show legislators coming to blows on the House floor and hurling chairs, computers and other public property, soon after the then Finance Minister K.M. Mani began his budget speech. The LDF MLAs were protesting against Mr. Mani, citing the corruption allegations against him. The MLAs are facing charges of criminal trespass, mischief and destruction of public property. The State government and the accused have separately appealed to the court for withdrawal of the case. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah, however, took a prima facie view against the conduct of the MLAs. Justice Chandrachud said legislators accused of destroying public property should face trial or there would be “absolutely no deterrent to this kind of behaviour”. During the hearing, the court disagreed with the Kerala government’s view that the then Opposition MLAs were only acting in “public interest” and exercising their “right to protest”. “What is the larger ‘public interest’ in obstructing the presentation of the State’s financial budget? Prima facie, we have to take a very strict view of such behaviour. We will not condone such behaviour by MLAs — throwing mics, chairs on the floor of the House,” Justice Chandrachud told senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, who appeared for the State. Justice Shah wanted to know what “message” the MLAs had intended to give the public with their behaviour. “These are people’s representatives. What will the people think seeing their leaders behave like this on the floor of the House?” Justice Shah asked. Locus standi questioned When Mr. Kumar said prior sanction of the Speaker was required before registration of criminal cases against the MLAs, Justice Shah questioned the State government’s locus standi in seeking withdrawal of the case against the legislators. “Why are you [the State] saying all this? It is for the accused to make the plea, and not for the State. The State cannot seek withdrawal of the case. That is the prerogative of the Public Prosecutor,” Justice Shah repeatedly pointed out.  Justice Chandrachud said the case would be listed on July 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ldf-leaders-should-face-trial-says-sc/article35160244.ece

06 July 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Dry land farming helps ryot survive drought||Rainfed agriculture has always been a gamble, given the erratic monsoon and it is more so in the drought-hit Prakasam district. Like his fellow farmers, K. Venkata Reddy was about to uproot the fruit-bearing trees in his farm at Tippayapalem, near Markapur, after his borewell dried up in 2017 after successive years of drought. Fortunes turned for the better for the progressive farmer as his crucial decision to dig a farm pond with a holding capacity of 3 crore litre paid rich dividends. He also installed drip irrigation system to ensure efficient use of water in his orchard. Convinced about the benefits of farm pond, he dug another farm pond of the same capacity. “Now, water scarcity is a thing of the past for me even during the peak summer,” says Mr. Venkata Reddy. Organic farm practices “Marketing of fruits including jamun, pomegranate, sweet lime and custard apple was not a problem even during the coronavirus pandemic as the upcountry traders kept thronging my farm, offering a premium price,” says the 57-year-old farmer, adding that he has struck a deal with a trader from Kolkata for a truck load of sweet lime. Mr. Venkata Reddy says he used to send his produce to Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad earlier. Now that I have taken to organic farm practices, traders from far and near approaching me. I am using fertigation with a network of pipes,” he says. The farmer also practises pisciculture in his farm pond. The fish prevent clogging of the pipes used in the drip irrigation system, he says, adding that he has adopted mulching technique and ZEBA, a starch-based super absorbent, for more efficient crop production. “Selection of drought-resistant varieties is important. I am using ‘Jeevamurtham’ comprising cow dung, cow urine, jaggery and gram flour which is being applied with water through the drip irrigation system in my orchard,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dry-land-farming-helps-ryot-survive-drought/article35160296.ece

Rajeeve clarified that the government carried out inspections in response to complaints from various quarters regarding the functioning of the apparel maker.

06 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan seeks early eco nod for RLIS||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has written a letter to Prakash Javadekar, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, requesting him to permit the execution of the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) works by making necessary amendments to the existing environmental clearances as a further delay would adversely affect the interests of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) due to the whimsical attitude of Telangana. He maintained that the RLIS did not involve any land acquisition, forest area and wildlife sanctuary and was located 10 km beyond the eco-sensitive zone. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy stated that the illegal drawing of water from the Krishna river by Telangana in blatant disregard to the protocols left A.P. with no option except to implement the RLIS in order to supplement 3 tmcft of water per day to the existing projects (Telugu Ganga, Srisailam Right Bank Canal, Galeru-Nagari Sujala Sravanthi) and drinking water supply to Chennai from a level of 800 feet. The DPR for RLIS and the additional information sought by the Ministry were already furnished. The Ministry’s Environmental Appraisal Committee was scheduled to meet on July 7. The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change should, therefore, give necessary approvals at the earliest to enable the A.P. government to take the project (RLIS) forward, the Chief Minister appealed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-seeks-early-eco-nod-for-rlis/article35160307.ece
06 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Krishna river dispute: HC rejects request for recusal||Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao of the Telangana High Court on Monday rejected Advocate-General (AG) B.S. Prasad’s request to recuse from hearing a writ petition filed by two farmers of Andhra Pradesh against a G.O. issued by the Telangana government pertaining to the usage of Krishna river water for power generation. During the hearing, Additional Advocate General J. Ramachandra Rao appealed to the bench of Justices Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar that the petition should be heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice (CJ) Hima Kohli as per the roster of sitting arrangements. Justice Ramachandra Rao said the bench would examine the issue in the post-lunch session. Meanwhile, appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Vedula Venkataramana said the plea should be heard by the same bench since the petition involved issues relating to Andhra Pradesh State Reorganisation Act, 2014 (APRA). As per the roster, APRA matters were allocated to the present bench. After the lunch break, Justice Ramachandra Rao said the bench got a clarification from the office of the Chief Justice that it should hear the matter. Mr. Prasad immediately requested the judge to post it before the bench headed by the Chief Justice. “When the matter was clarified by the Chief Justice’s office, how can it be conveyed to them to hear the matter,” Justice Ramachandra Rao questioned. The AG made an appeal for Justice Ramachandra Rao to recuse from hearing the petition without citing any reasons, to which the judge raised an objection, saying that it is in poor taste and that he did not expect the AG’s office to make such an unreasonable request. He further observed that such requests would amount to ‘bench hunting’. Finally, the AG dropped his request and the bench proceeded to hear the matter. As the petitioners’ counsel presented his contentions, Justice Ramachandra Rao sought to know if he was aware of the Supreme Court verdict that inter-State water disputes should not be heard by High Courts, citing the apex court judgment in a matter relating to the Rajolibanda project. The division bench of teh High Court asked the advocates concerned to go through the said judgment and come prepared on Tuesday (July 6) to represent their cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/krishna-river-dispute-hc-rejects-request-for-recusal/article35160309.ece

06 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||How illegal immigrants from Bangladesh sneaked their way into Andhra Pradesh||The illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, who were arrested by Andhra Pradesh police from two railway stations in the State recently, allegedly sneaked into the country through drainage pipes on the Indo-Bangladesh border, the investigation officers have said. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the police arrested eight illegal immigrants from Rajamahendravaram and Vijayawada railway stations a few days ago. The police received information from the intelligence officials that some Bangladeshi nationals had gained illegal entry into India and were travelling in the Howrah-Chennai Mail and Howrah-Vascodagama Amaravati Express trains. Now, investigation is under way to ascertain whether there are any drainage pipes along the international border as claimed by the arrested immigrants, or they gained entry into India through some underground passages. The Bangladesh nationals allegedly crossed the borders after the restrictions imposed during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic were relaxed. They reportedly settled down at different places in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and other States, and have been working as daily wagers in the construction sector since then. Fake identity cards The investigation officers say that many illegal immigrants do not have passports, but, they have fake voter IDs, Aadhaar and PAN cards which carry false addresses from Karnataka and other States. The intelligence officials, during the investigation, observed that a broker from Bangladesh, who has settled in West Bengal, had arranged the fake Aadhaar, PAN and other identity cards for the illegal immigrants. The police observed that the arrested Bangladeshi nationals were not using android phones. The seized mobile phones will be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to trace the contacts of the illegal immigrants, they said. Meanwhile, the police have apprised the Ministry of External Affairs, Bangladesh Embassy and the Indian Embassy in Dhaka of the arrests. They are planning to file petitions in the courts, seeking police custody of the immigrants. The police said many illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, in groups, allegedly crossed the international border and entered West Bengal during the night and the brokers in both the countries provided them shelter and arranged the fake identity cards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/how-illegal-immigrants-from-bangladesh-sneaked-their-way-into-andhra-pradesh/article35160303.ece

High Court led by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and comprising Justice N. Jayasurya on Monday indicated to the government that it should locate the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) within the State of A.P. They were hearing a petition filed by the AP Civil Liberties Association, which complained that the SHRC did not have an office of its own in A.P. several months after the High Court ordered that the government should reconstitute the SHRC in compliance with the Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Act, 2019. As a consequence, the aggrieved were forced to travel to Hyderabad to present their cases before the SHRC which is currently situated there. The court gave three weeks’ time to the government to file an affidavit mentioning the steps taken to set up SHRC in the State. On the lighter side, when the petitioner insisted that the government should move fast, Advocate General S. Sriram quoted his father as saying that ‘the horse which gallops gets beaten the most’, while pointing out that nothing was done between 2014 and 2019.

06 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Call to install rooftop solar plant to reduce power bills||An electricity consumer, who had installed a Roof Top Solar (RTS) plant atop his independent house at Vudanagar Phase-I at Kurmannapalem five years ago, has been saving around Rs. 2,500 a month on electricity bills during the peak summer months! Missed out availing of the benefit of installing an RTS plant in phase-I? Here’s another golden opportunity. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has sanctioned 8 MW capacity to APEPDCL in the residential sector under phase-II of the Grid Connected RTS programme with timelines for completion of the allocated capacity within 15 months. Interested consumers can apply for RTS on the online web portal of APEPDCL athttps://onlineapp.ap easternpower.com/ “We had installed a 2 KW RTS plant about five years ago at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh, which includes the cost of equipment, fixing and wiring. We had received a subsidy of Rs. 75,000,” Kanchumurthy Eswar, a retired Assistant General Manager of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant(VSP), residing at Vudanagar, told The Hindu on Monday. “While the saving on power bill is around Rs. 2,500 on an average for us during the peak summer months, during winter the savings average around Rs. 500 a month due to reduced consumption and also the decline in solar generation. I have never encountered any problem all these years, except a minor issue with the batter panel, which was done free of cost barring service charges as it was in the warranty period,” he said. “We had entered into a 25-year-contract with APEPDCL. During peak summer, our RTS plant generates 130 units a month. The solar units exported to the grid will be credited to my account. In addition to this, I am getting an annual subsidy from the government. Recently, I was given Rs. 200 as subsidy in my last bill,” says Mr. Eswar. “A total of 2,516 RTS connections had materialised in phase-I. The subsidy from the Centre was 30% and it was 20% from the State government at that time. The consumer had to pay the entire cost, and was later reimbursed the subsidy by the government. This had proved to be a burden on the average consumers in view of the high investment cost,” says an official of the EPDCL. “The initial cost of installing a 1 KW RTS plant ranged between Rs. 85,000 and Rs. 1 lakh in phase-I, has now come down by around 40% and is around Rs. 50,000,” the official said. V. Vijaya Lalitha, Chief General Manager, Energy Conservation, Energy Audit, Solar/APEPDCL, has appealed to consumers from Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East and West Godavari districts of APEPDCL jurisdiction to avail of the Central Financial Assistance by installing the grid-connected RTS plants at their homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/call-to-install-rooftop-solar-plant-to-reduce-power-bills/article35160784.ece

In a representation to the GVMC Commissioner, the ZGS members pointed out that in the new property tax proposal, the civic body has earmarked 8% as ‘Library Cess’ to be paid by the taxpayers, but there is no indication of remittance of the library cess, which has been pending since decades. B.L. Narayana, president of ZGS, said that the GVMC has been defaulting in remitting the Library Cess to the Zilla Grandhalaya Samstha (ZGS) for over two decades now. The total amount the GVMC owes to the ZGS is now around Rs. 90 crore. In such circumstances, the GVMC has no moral right to collect library cess from the people, as it does not intend to remit back the same to the grandhalaya, he said. He said that all the libraries in the district are neglected and are in a bad shape. The District Central Library lost its prime land and the building due to the neglect of the officials concerned, he said. For over a decade, the DCL has been functioning in a building meant for a commercial godown. Even though the land is restored to the ZGS, it had not been taken over from the CRPF and no efforts are being made to reconstruct the DCL building. Of the 16 branch libraries in the city, many of them are in a bad shape. The Children’s Library near Poorna Market area (Rangireeju Street) in One Town area may collapse anytime. The Gandhigram Branch Library needs to be relocated. The Bheemuni Gummam branch Library in Anakapalle is located in an old building, and not suitable for readers, he said. “We demand that the dues are remitted to the ZGS and only then the library cess be collected from people,” said the members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/zilla-grandhalaya-samstha-members-seek-library-cess-dues/article35160827.ece

A.P., Chennai hit Telangana was obstructing the build-up of water levels in the Srisailam reservoir and had utilised 19 tmcft for power generation out of 26 tmcft of inflows since June 1. As a consequence, reaching a level of 854 feet proved to be a herculean task and A.P. was unable to draw water through gravity for the schemes dependent on the Pothireddypadu head regulator. This was causing distress to Rayalaseema, Nellore and Prakasam districts and also Chennai city due to their dependence on Srisailam reservoir for their irrigation and drinking water needs. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy further said Telangana was doing hydel power generation from the NSP without the KRMB’s clearance and in violation of established protocols. Also, Telangana continued to draw water from the Pulichintala project without taking any release orders from the KRMB. The intention of Telangana had been to deprive A.P. of its due share of allocated water, as the drawals were delayed and water was being wasted into the sea. As such, it was already requested that the KRMB be directed to account for all these unauthorised drawals by Telangana against the agreed allocation of 299 tmcft to it. The KRMB is proposing RLIS site visit under the guise of the National Green Tribunal order ignoring the prior request of A.P. to visit the unauthorised project sites in Telangana which were in advanced stages of execution devoid of approvals and allocation of waters, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/visit-unauthorised-projects-in-ts-first/article35160317.ece

Members of Aman Vedika, a NGO, said that while those with Aadhaar card or other ID card were administered the vaccine, those who do not have an identity card were not given the jab. “We request Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to provide COVID-19 vaccine to people who do not have an identity card too,” requested R. Indiramma, project coordinator at the NGO. There are thousands without homes in Hyderabad. While some of them live at government shelter homes, others live on the streets. It was learnt that those staying at government shelter homes received the vaccine. “The mobile vaccination vans can be used to vaccinate the homeless. Government can take support of the NGOs which are working for people without homeless,” said Syed Feroz from Nirashraya Shramika Sangathan. The NGO runs a programme — Street Medicine — where people living on the roadside are checked for health issues. A health coordinator of the programme, K Paul Isaac, said that COVID-19 tests were conducted on people who had symptoms of the infectious disease, those who were set to get the vaccine, and at random too. “Around three people tested positive for coronavirus in the second wave,” Mr. Paul said. Ministry’s SOP Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in May first week has issued ‘SOPs on COVID-19 Vaccination of Persons without prescribed Identity Cards through CoWIN’. Some of the people who fall in the group listed in the SOP document were inmates in Mental Health Institutions, roadside beggars, people residing in rehabilitation centres or camps, citizens in old age homes, and others, age 18 years or more, and do not have any of the prescribed photo ID cards.

The LeT operatives Mohammed Nasir Khan alias Nasir Malik and his younger brother Mohammed Imran Khan alias Imran Malik, were arrested by the agency on June 30 for planting a chemical parcel bomb which exploded at Darbhanga railway station. Sources said that in the late hours of Monday the duo will be taken to their house at Mallepally, shops from where they purchased chemicals and even Secunderabad Railway station where they parcelled the bomb wrapped in a bundle of clothes.

06 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS writes to KRMB seeking full board meet after July 20||The Telangana government has requested the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to convene a full-fledged meeting of the board instead of the three-member committee proposed on July 9 to discuss issues concerning it. In a letter addressed to the Chairman of the river board on Monday, Special Chief Secretary (Irrigation) Rajat Kumar expressed dismay at the mention of only the issues raised by Andhra Pradesh and keeping silent on the issues raised by Telangana before and after AP’s letter to it. In his communication to the member States on the proposal to convene the three-member committee meeting on July 9, the Member Secretary of the river board has made no mention of the issues raised by Telangana. Several critical issues were brought to the board’s notice by Telangana in its letters dated February 14, 2020 and July 2, 2021 but they find no mention in the communication of July 2, he pointed out. The Special Chief Secretary reiterated that Telangana wants to discuss revision of Krishna water sharing ratio for the current year, steps to stop construction of the illegal Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) and Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) Right Canal taken up by Andhra Pradesh and steps to stop excess diversion of water from Pothireddypadu Head Regulator by AP to projects outside the basin. Further, Telangana wants to discuss reckoning of 20% of total water drawn in the Krishna Basin as usage towards drinking water supply and appropriation of water savings made by Telangana out of the total releases ordered by the river board. Power generation On power generation by Telangana at Srisailam reservoir, the Special Chief Secretary said both the Planning Commission and KWDT-I have held it as hydro-electric project without envisaging diversion of water to another watershed area. Lift schemes As the water supply systems in Telangana were predominantly dependent on lift irrigation schemes requiring huge energy inputs, the process of power generation at Srisailam would help meet the needs besides ensuring water supplementation for irrigation and drinking needs under Nagarjunasagar, he noted. “Under such circumstances the Telangana government is constrained to reject the request of AP to stop power generation,” the Special Chief Secretary of Telangana wrote to KRMB Chairman adding that the matter needs to be deliberated carefully by the full board instead of the three-member committee by convening a meeting on a mutually convenient date after July 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-writes-to-krmb-seeking-full-board-meet-after-july-20/article35160602.ece

06 July 2021||Mumbai,||It’s CBI’s duty to probe all in graft case, not just Anil Deshmukh: Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday said it is the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) duty to investigate not just former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, but everyone allegedly involved in the corruption case related to him. The court sought to know the progress of the probe against Mr. Deshmukh. A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar asked the CBI how far its investigation into an FIR registered against Mr. Deshmukh in April has progressed. “What is the progress of the investigation? We would like to see a progress report in a sealed envelope. We will read and give it back,” the court said. The Bench was hearing a petition filed by Mr. Deshmukh challenging the FIR registered by the CBI on April 24 on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The FIR was lodged after the CBI carried out a preliminary inquiry pursuant to directions from the court.  The inquiry was to be based upon a complaint lodged with the Mumbai Police by a lawyer seeking probe against Mr. Deshmukh in the aftermath of allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. On Monday, when senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Mr. Deshmukh, was arguing, the Bench asked whether at this stage, when the probe was on, the court should hear a plea for quashing the case. “Pursuant to HC directives, a preliminary inquiry was initiated and then the FIR was lodged. It would be the duty of the CBI to investigate everyone who was involved in this. Not just the petitioner. This may also include those who were in the committee that reinstated Sachin Vaze,” the court said. Mr. Vaze is in jail in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case and the killing of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiren. It is alleged that Mr. Deshmukh had asked Mr. Vaze, dismissed from police service in May after arrest in the Antilia-Hiren case, to extort crores off rupees rom bars and restaurants in Mumbai. The Bench noted that the HC, in its April 5 order directing the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry, used the words – “to instill public confidence in the administration”. “Therefore, it is not just limited to the petitioner but to all those who are involved in the allegations levelled in the FIR,” Justice Shinde said. ‘Unknown persons in FIR’ The Bench also sought to know from the CBI who were the “unknown” persons included in the accused column of the FIR. “Normally, unknown persons are there in the accused column in theft and robbery cases. But in this case, the FIR was lodged after a preliminary inquiry was conducted,” it said. Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for the CBI, told the HC that he would inform the court on these points on the next date of hearing. The court will continue hearing the matter on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/its-cbis-duty-to-probe-all-in-graft-case-not-just-anil-deshmukh-bombay-hc/article35160662.ece

Kulkarni was referring to the slum rehabilitation policies that granted statutory protection against demolition and eviction to slum tenements built prior to January 1, 2000, and are not higher than 14 feet. The Bench noted the June 9 collapse of a building in Malwani was an outcome of “pure greed” and suggested the authorities draw inspiration from the “Singapore model” of housing for the poor. “It is only in Mumbai that one encroaches on government land and in return is given free housing. I asked the Chief Justice [who was earlier at Calcutta HC] if such policy existed in West Bengal. The answer was a flat no,” Justice Kulkarni said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-mumbai-is-only-city-where-encroacher-gets-free-housing/article35160663.ece

The woman broke up with her boyfriend in January after a relationship of three years. While travelling in a local train in March, the complainant noticed an advertisement with the contact number of Baba Kabir Khan, who offered advice to mend personal relationships. She dialled the number and told the godman that she was depressed after her boyfriend left her. The godman sought Rs. 37,000 to purchase materials to offer a prayer at a dargah in Meerut. When the boyfriend failed to return, the woman called the godman again. He then demanded more money to perform an animal sacrifice. Over the next few months, the godman kept demanding money to perform special rituals to make sure that the couple patch up and their families are united. The complainant continued to transfer money through Google Pay. Her suspicions arose when she learnt that the payee’s name was Wasim Rahees Khan. She filed a written complaint with the Navi Mumbai police in May and an FIR was registered in July. When the godman learnt that the woman had lodged a complaint, he threatened to involve her in an accident using black magic. He also tried to convince her that his black magic would eventually pay off and work its charm on her boyfriend. The godman warned that he would cast a curse on her if she refused to pay him more money. “The accused has claimed to be in Rajasthan, but we suspect him to be in Mumbai itself. We are hunting for him,” an officer at Kharghar police station said. The godman has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, and the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/godman-dupes-woman-of-rs-457-lakh-by-promising-to-bring-back-estranged-boyfriend/article35160665.ece
06 July 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra records over 13,000 recoveries||While Maharashtra saw a rise in COVID-19 cases over the last few days, the trend was reversed on Monday with 13,027 recoveries being reported against 6,740 new cases as the active case tally dipped again to 1,16,827. However, the number of samples tested continued to be on the lower side, with less than 1.75 lakh tested as opposed to the daily average of 2.40 lakh. A total of 109 deaths have been added to the progressive death toll, with 44 of those occurring during the last 48 hours and just seven occurring during the past week. Another 55 deaths were added as per the ‘reconciliation’ process. The State’s total death toll has climbed to 1,23,136, with the case fatality rate standing at 2.01%. The State’s total cases have reached 61,04,917, while its cumulative recoveries have risen to 58,61,720, with the recovery rate rising to 96.02%. “Of 4,27,12,460 laboratory samples tested thus far, 61,04,917 (with the average case positivity falling incrementally to 14.29%) have returned positive, with over 1.70 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate. Pune sees dip in cases Pune reported 658 new cases, taking its total cases to 10,61,203. Twelve deaths were reported as the toll rose to 16,895. As per district authorities, the active case tally rose to nearly 10,400, while the total death toll reached 17,996. Mumbai reported 486 new cases to take its tally to 7,25,161, while active cases declined to 12,588. As many as 10 fatalities took the city’s death toll to 15,554. Kolhapur in western Maharashtra recorded the highest case surge among districts, reporting over 1,500 cases, taking its total case tally to 1,64,891, of whom 12,716 are active. As many as eight deaths saw the toll rise to 4,800. Neighbouring Sangli reported over 700 new cases and eight deaths. The tally stands at 1,58,860, with the active cases rising to 10,861 while its toll reached 4,223.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-records-over-13000-recoveries/article35160666.ece
06 July 2021||Kabul,||Over 1,000 Afghan troops flee to Tajikistan||More than 1,000 Afghan troops fled into neighbouring Tajikistan on Monday following clashes with the Taliban, as the insurgents amassed momentum on the battlefield. The exodus of troops followed another weekend of fighting across much of the northern countryside where the Taliban have overrun dozens of districts, spurring fears that Afghan forces are in crisis. “They did not want to surrender. They had asked for reinforcements but their call was ignored,” said Abdul Basir, a soldier based with a battalion in Badakhshan province that had members flee over the border. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had handed over Bagram Air Base — the centre of its operations — to Afghan security forces, effectively wrapping up operations in the country following nearly two decades of fighting. Tajikistan’s national security committee said 1,037 Afghan government troops had fled into the ex-Soviet country “to save their lives” after clashes with the Taliban during the night.  Counter-attack “Taking into account the principle of good neighbourliness and adhering to the position of non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the military personnel of the Afghan government forces were allowed to enter Tajik territory,” said the statement, published by Tajikistan's state information agency. Afghan troops had already crossed into Tajikistan following earlier clashes that saw the Taliban take control of a major border crossing between the countries. The Afghan government has vowed to launch a counteroffensive in the north. Hamdullah Mohib, the country’s National Security Advisor, told Russia's RIA news agency that an operation was “absolutely” in the works. Already thinly stretched with supply lines strained, Afghan security forces have been crumbling in the face of the Taliban onslaught, with several bases and outposts surrendering to the insurgents without firing a shot. “Afghan forces have lost their morale,” said analyst Atta Noori in Kabul. “They are confused — in almost every district that the Taliban capture, they send a team of elders to talk to the soldiers and get them to surrender.” “It is an emergency situation for the Afghan government. They need to step up their counteroffensive as soon as possible,” he added. With vital air cover from the Americans massively curtailed by the closure of the Bagram base, the Taliban pressed on with their offensive across the north over the weekend, seizing most of Badakhshan and Takhar provinces with government forces holding little more than the provincial capitals. The speed and ease of the Taliban's effective takeover of the provinces represent a massive psychological blow to the Afghan government. Both provinces had once served as the strongholds for the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance during the gruesome civil war in the 1990s and were never routed by the militants. The dire situation in the north was accompanied by reports that the Taliban were also inching closer to the provincial capitals in their southern strongholds of Kandahar and Helmand, with key districts on the outskirts of both cities taken by the group. “We are so tired of this war. At least today the right thing was done, and one side should take control,” said Shir Mohammad Barekzai, a resident of Helmand’s Nawa district that was seized by the Taliban early on Monday. Since May 1 when the U.S. military began its final withdrawal, Afghan troops and the Taliban have clashed fiercely across the rugged countryside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-1000-afghan-troops-flee-to-tajikistan/article35160177.ece
06 July 2021||Kaduna,||Armed men kidnap 140 school students in Nigeria||Heavily-armed men kidnapped 140 students from a boarding school in northwestern Nigeria on Monday, a school official said, the latest in a wave of mass abductions targeting schoolchildren and students. Criminal gangs often attack villages to loot, steal cattle and abduct for ransom in northwest and central Nigeria, but since the start of the year they have increasingly targeted schools and colleges. The attackers opened fire and overpowered security guards after storming the Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna state in the early hours of Monday, abducting most of the 165 pupils boarding there overnight. “The kidnappers took away 140 students, only 25 students escaped. We still have no idea where the students were taken,” Emmanuel Paul, a teacher at the school, said. “Tactical police teams went after the kidnappers,” he said. “We are still on the rescue mission.” Police said they had safely rescued 26 people, including a woman. Around 1,000 students and pupils have been abducted in Nigeria since December. Most have been released after negotiations with local officials, although some are still being held. Often, gangs target rural schools and colleges, where students stay in dormitories and security is light, allowing them to easily transport large numbers of victims to forest hideouts to negotiate ransoms. The kidnapping of Nigerian schoolchildren first made international headlines in 2014 when jihadist group Boko Haram snatched nearly 300 schoolgirls from a rural school in Chibok. Monday’s attack was the fourth mass school kidnapping in Kaduna state since December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/armed-men-kidnap-140-school-students-in-nigeria/article35160172.ece
06 July 2021||Jerusalem,||Israel looks to renew law that keeps out Palestinian spouses||Israel’s Parliament is set to vote on Monday on whether to renew a temporary law first enacted in 2003 that bars Arab citizens of Israel from extending citizenship or even residency to spouses from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Critics, including many left-wing and Arab lawmakers, say it’s a racist measure aimed at restricting the growth of Israel’s Arab minority, while supporters say it’s needed for security purposes and to preserve Israel’s Jewish character. The law creates an array of difficulties for Palestinian families that span the war-drawn and largely invisible frontiers separating Israel from east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories it seized in the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for a future state. “You want your security, it’s no problem, you can check each case by itself,” said Taiseer Khatib. His wife of more than 15 years, from the West Bank city of Jenin, must regularly apply for permits to live with him and their three children in Israel. “There’s no need for this collective punishment just because you are Palestinian,” he said. Israel’s dominant right-wing parties strongly support the law, and it has been renewed every year since being enacted. But Israel’s new government includes opponents of the measure, and the right-wing opposition led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned it won’t provide the votes needed to renew the law. Ahead of the vote, PM Naftali Bennett called on Mr. Netanyahu to join him in renewing the law. “Harming state security for a quarter of a political point is not the right thing to do,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-looks-to-renew-law-that-keeps-out-palestinian-spouses/article35160174.ece

Mr. Johnson said he would set out how the country would “learn to live with this virus” — a major shift in tone from a leader who has previously painted COVID-19 as an enemy to be vanquished. Before a televised news conference, Mr. Johnson signalled that mandatory measures would be replaced by personal choice after July 19, the date dubbed “freedom day” by Britain’s populist press. “As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from COVID and exercise judgment when going about our lives,” Mr. Johnson said. But public health officials have urged caution, saying ditching masks and social distancing altogether could be dangerous. Psychologist Stephen Reicher, a member of the government’s scientific advisory committee, said “proportionate mitigations” against the spread of the virus should stay in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/learn-to-live-with-virus-johnson-tells-britons/article35160176.ece

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||A virus, theories of origin, and a place for science||Imagine a town with a nuclear power plant close by. If its residents displayed signs of radiation sickness, the finger of suspicion will point towards the plant, however much the plant’s operator might swear to its safety. Mirroring a scenario Suppose the town was also home to a research centre where radioactive material was stored and used in experiments. The finger of suspicion would now waver between the nuclear plant and the research centre. To complicate matters, if nuclear waste from both the plant and the research centre was buried in an underground dump a fair distance away from the town, a third focus of suspicion would arise. Public opinion would be divided. Those suspicious of the nuclear power industry would be convinced that the plant was the source of their pollution. Little bits of circumstantial evidence would begin to circulate on social media as well as in the opinion columns of newspapers pointing to the power plant. The nuclear industry would fight back and accuse the research institute of causing a radiation leak. The scientific establishment would close ranks around the research lab and testify to safety standards in the laboratory as well as the quality of the researchers. A third group of people would probably accuse both the power plant as well as the research institute of poisoning the world by using and storing toxic nuclear waste. Each of these groups would believe they had the truth and others were wrong. They would be critical of any investigation that did not agree with their beliefs. Hypothesis and evidence The debate over the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, mirrors this scenario. One school of thought is convinced that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a leading coronavirus research centre, is responsible for introducing a new coronavirus that it was secretly creating in its laboratories. This hypothesis is driven by evidence ranging from reports of documents missing from the website of the Wuhan Institute, to the re-naming or re-numbering of a virus originally discovered in a mine in 2012 that is the closest known ancestor to SARS-CoV-2, to reports of researchers mysteriously falling ill at the Wuhan Institute in late 2019, and other reports of a researcher who has reportedly gone missing. The fact that the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, home to the institute, is seen as additional evidence of where the virus emerged from. This hypothesis is greatly favoured by those who believe China is responsible for the pandemic, but lacks evidence that would stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny. The second hypothesis is that the virus emerged through a natural “spillover” event, where a bat coronavirus jumped species and infected humans either directly or through intermediary animals that in turn passed it to humans. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the predecessor of this current pandemic, started similarly in late 2002 when a bat coronavirus probably infected animals and then humans in the markets of Guangdong province in southern China. New viral infectious diseases, whether it is HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or Nipah, have all arisen from spillovers of animal viruses to humans. As with SARS, many of the early cases of COVID-19 were associated with animal markets, particularly the Huanan market in Wuhan, which sold a variety of live and frozen animal meat. This could be one route the SARS-CoV-2 virus took. But no evidence has been found so far to support this hypothesis either. To find scientific proof of either hypothesis is a task as challenging as an archaeologist painstakingly digging through hundreds of metres of tightly packed layers of mud and stone and debris in the hope of recovering tiny clues to the existence of an ancient civilization. For virologists and molecular epidemiologists, the challenge is not sifting through earth, but finding virus samples from the earliest stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, reconstructing their genetic sequences, and then fitting them to a family tree that will hopefully lead to the common ancestor of the diverse strains and variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have spread globally. This could also provide clues as to whether this ancestor emerged in wildlife, in farms and markets, or from a laboratory. While this viral archaeology sounds simple, it is not straightforward. The earliest detected cases and the earliest viral samples came from those who were hospitalised in Wuhan in December 2019. But none of them is likely to have been patient zero, the first person to have been infected by the virus. Most people with COVID-19 display very mild or no symptoms, so for every hospitalised case, there are likely to have been many earlier cases that were not detected. It is known that two strains, an A strain and a B strain, were circulating in Wuhan in the early stages of the outbreak. But most of the samples and cases were of the B strain, which caused the first recognised disease cluster in people associated with the Huanan market, while the A strain could have been an earlier strain. These earlier viral samples would have helped build a clearer picture of how the virus emerged. But these cases were never identified or sampled, and they will forever remain unknown. The other source of evidence are samples from the live animals sold in all the markets in Wuhan in the last months of 2019; this too is also not available, since the animals have long been sold and slaughtered, and the markets more often than not sanitised. The samples that were collected in late December from the Huanan market did have the virus, but it is not clear whether the market was a source of the virus, or merely a place where it was amplified. The entry of politics So where does one go from here? The scientific unearthing and classification of viral samples in humans and animals to see where they lead is the only way ahead. But science is being elbowed aside by politics. Those who believe in a Chinese conspiracy are convinced that the truth will only come out after an investigation of the Wuhan laboratory and its staff by international investigators with a wide mandate to search the lab and question staff. This is not going to happen. China will no more allow this than India would allow international investigators to march through the National Institute of Virology in Pune or any other national laboratory in search of evidence of supposed wrongdoing. Chinese cooperation crucial The only solution is to work with China. The World Health Organization investigation into the origins of the virus, though rightly criticised for dismissing the laboratory leak theory with little explanation, did unearth evidence on the early stages of the pandemic and suggested a number of studies for the next phase. One important step would be widespread sampling of animals in farms across China that supplied the markets in Wuhan in the search of ancestor viruses to SARS-CoV-2. Workers in farms need to be tested as well for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses. Another suggested step is for blood banks across China to test blood samples from 2019 to see whether they carried antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. This could provide a clue to how early the virus was circulating in human populations. None of this can happen without Chinese cooperation. For this to happen, polarisation on political lines needs to be put aside, and space needs to be created for science to do its work.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Crafting a unique partnership with Africa||“A historical solidarity is today a modern partnership,” tweeted External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar during his recent trip to Kenya. Critical to its foreign policy matrix, New Delhi’s engagement with the African continent has been multifaceted, with projects implemented under Indian lines of credit, capacity-building initiatives, and cooperation in a range of sectors. As an importer of fruits, nuts, grains and pulses from the continent, Indian congruence with African countries in the agriculture sector is expanding. With 65% of the world’s uncultivated arable land, employing over 60% of the workforce, and accounting for almost 20% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP, agriculture is critical to Africa’s economy. The African Continental Free Trade Area agreement is expected to improve cost competitiveness by removing tariffs. As this relationship enters the post-pandemic world, it is vital to prioritise and channel resources into augmenting partnership in agriculture. This is crucial given its unexplored potential, centrality to global food security, business prospects and to provide credible alternatives to the increasing involvement of Chinese stakeholders in the sector. Analysing Chinese engagement Over the past few years, I have led and worked with different teams of experts from various African countries, conducting evidence-based studies at the grassroots level to demystify Chinese engagement in the region. Evaluating the approaches that Chinese corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs adopt has provided a layered perspective of the sociopolitical, economic and environmental impact of Chinese engagement. Today, China is among Africa’s largest trading partners. It is also Africa’s single biggest creditor. Its corporations dominate the region’s infrastructure market and are now entering the agri-infra sector. Increasingly critical to China’s global aspirations, its engagement in African agriculture is taking on a strategic quality. Therefore, dismissing Beijing’s engagement in African agriculture as inconsequential for New Delhi would be unwise. While access to Africa’s natural resources, its untapped markets and support for ‘One China Policy’ are primary drivers of Chinese engagement with the region, there are other factors at play. Chinese-built industrial parks and economic zones in Africa are attracting low-cost, labour-intensive manufacturing units that are relocating from China. Chinese engineers interviewed spoke of how their operations in Africa are important to accumulate global experience in management, risk and capital investments. Not only are they willing to overlook short-term profits in order to build ‘brand China’, but they want to dominate the market in the long term, which includes pushing Chinese standards in host countries. Chinese tech companies are laying critical telecommunications infrastructure, venture capital funds are investing in African fintech firms, while other smaller enterprises are expanding across the region. While many Chinese entities have been active in Africa’s agricultural landscape for decades now, the nature, form and actors involved have undergone substantial change. In Zambia, Chinese firms are introducing agri-tech to combat traditional challenges, such as using drone technology to control the fall armyworm infestation. They have set up over 20 Agricultural Technology Demonstration Centers (ATDCS) in the continent where Chinese agronomists work on developing new crop varieties and increasing crop yields. These ATDCs partner with local universities, conduct workshops and classes for officials and provide training and lease equipment to small holder farmers. Chinese companies with no prior experience in agriculture are setting out to build futuristic ecological parks while others are purchasing large-scale commercial farms. Furthermore, African agriculture experts, officials and farmers are provided opportunities to augment skills and be trained in China. The exponential growth in the China-Africa economic ties and the emergence of Beijing as an alternate to traditional western powers has motivated change in perceptions across groups. Governments and heads of state are recalibrating approaches, media houses are investing more resources for on-the-ground-reporting and artists like Michael Soi in Kenya are using satirical paintings to start a dialogue. Simultaneously, Africa-China relations are becoming complex with a growing, insular diaspora, lopsided trade, looming debt, competition with local businesses and a negative perception accompanied by greater political and socioeconomic interlinkages. Examining Chinese interactions also provides cues on what not to do. The Chinese and African experts working in ATDCs seemingly operate in silos. On occasion, there seems to be a gap between skills transferred in China and the ground realities in Africa. In some cases, the technology taught in China is not available locally and in others, there is inability to implement lessons learnt due to the absence of supporting resources. Larger commercial farms run by Mandarin-speaking managers and the presence of small-scale Chinese farmers in local markets aggravates socio-cultural stresses. Takeaways for India India-Africa agricultural cooperation currently includes institutional and individual capacity-building initiatives such as the India-Africa Institute of Agriculture and Rural development in Malawi, extension of soft loans, supply of machinery, acquisition of farmlands and the presence of Indian entrepreneurs in the African agricultural ecosystem. Indian farmers have purchased over 6,00,000 hectares of land for commercial farming in Africa. Sub-national actors are providing another model of cooperation in agriculture. Consider the case of the Kerala government trying to meet its steep requirement for raw cashew nuts amounting to 8 lakh tonnes a year with imports from countries in Africa to complement its production capacity currently limited to 0.83 lakh tonnes. There are also proposals to create a jointly-owned brand of Africa-Kollam cashews. Similar ideas could encourage State governments and civil society organisations to identify opportunities and invest directly. There is also promise in incentivising Indian industries to tap into African agri-business value chains and connecting Indian technology firms and startups with partners in Africa. The transformative power of innovative and disruptive technology has been evident in the African agri-tech sector as the startup ecosystem in the continent enjoyed a 110% growth between 2016 and 2018. In the past year, despite the pandemic, the sector witnessed a record increase in investments. A thorough impact assessment needs to be conducted of the existing capacity-building initiatives in agriculture for India to stand in good stead. This could include detailed surveys of participants who have returned to their home countries. Country-specific and localised curriculum can be drawn up, making skill development demand-led. While India’s Africa strategy exists independently, it is important to be cognisant of China’s increasing footprint in the region. Beijing’s model, if successful here, could be heralded as a replica for the larger global south. It is important to note, however, that prominent African voices have emphasised that their own agency is often overlooked in global discourse on the subject. In that sense India has consistently chosen well to underline the development partnership to be in line with African priorities. It is pertinent, therefore, that we collectively craft a unique modern partnership with Africa.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Gauging pandemic mortality with civil registration data||Over the last month, Indian journalists from across the country have accessed and reported on State-level all-cause mortality from the Civil Registration System (CRS), currently confidential and closed to the public. While India’s official death toll from COVID-19 has been suspect from the very beginning — for reasons that are partly institutional and partly new and specific to the pandemic — it was the second wave that made the scale of devastation hard to ignore. States and data Using the example set by those attempting to capture missed COVID-19 deaths in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Peru, journalists from a range of news organisations accessed all-cause mortality data from the CRS for Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and other States as well as for several Indian cities. This data has been able to show a large rise in excess mortality in the surge months of the second wave of April and May 2021 in particular, far in excess of the official COVID-19 toll for the same period. The increase in mortality ranges from reported deaths climbing to five times the usual monthly data in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (between 30-40 times the official COVID-19 toll for the same period), to more modest increases in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Sources of error While this data has added an important dimension to the question of undercounting of COVID-19 deaths in India and remains the best source of data on all-cause mortality, its continued use will require careful work on account of some known sources of error that exist with the data. The first is that these numbers are underestimates of total mortality. The Union government last published annual Civil Registration System data for 2019. This data shows that India registered 92 of every 100 deaths as of 2019, but there was large variation between States. Bihar, for instance, registered just half of all deaths. Additionally, the data currently available on State-level CRS portals (behind a login) miss even more deaths. The CRS moved online relatively recently (between five and three years ago in most States), and State-level portals now display data for every day from January 1, 2018 to the present day. For all States for which data is available except Kerala, the online portals show lower numbers than what was published by the Union government for 2018 and 2019. What this implies is that the data currently being used for analyses are an underestimate of total deaths, but should not by itself cause an inflation of the excess mortality estimates for the pandemic (since the online portal’s data was used for past and current years). What could, however, alter the magnitude of calculated excess mortality would be a second possible source of error — if mortality was either naturally increasing over time, or if registration was getting better, or if both were taking place. If any of these three phenomena were taking place, the magnitude of excess mortality in 2020 and 2021 could be moderated by these processes. On the first count, total estimated mortality (registered deaths plus those that are not registered) has actually been declining since 2013 (although there was an uptick in some States in 2019) according to the CRS. So, in the normal course of events (if there had not been a pandemic) we would not expect an increase in mortality Registered deaths, on the other hand, have been steadily increasing in four of the five States that we have detailed mortality data for (but fluctuating in Kerala). While this will mean that some of the excess mortality in 2020-21 will be accounted for by improved registration, this is not a complete explanation. The increase in registered deaths will not continue at the same pace in all States — once States begin to achieve full registration, increases should be more modest. In Madhya Pradesh, for instance, the level of death registration improved by over 21 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 to reach 89% in 2019. It is simply not mathematically possible for the level of registered deaths to continue to increase at the same pace for the years after 2019. For the most conservative estimate, let us assume that Madhya Pradesh achieved 100% registration by May 2021 (although we know from State level data that this was far from the case). Given the flattening of mortality in the State, let us assume that the total mortality in 2021 in ‘normal’ times would have been about the same as the total estimated deaths for 2019 — 5.53 lakh deaths. Even then, the numbers for Madhya Pradesh show over 1.18 lakh excess deaths in 2021, which is over 26 times the official COVID-19 death toll for the same period. The other States too show excess mortality in 2021 even assuming full registration. Moreover, single-month spikes in months like the one seen in May 2021 cannot be explained away by the gradual increase in registrations alone. Nor are these deaths that occurred months before. From Andhra Pradesh, for instance, we know that 98% of the deaths registered in May 2021 took place within the previous 30 days. An imperfect resource Taken together, these potential sources of error indicate that while the total number of deaths in India during the pandemic reported using Civil Registration System data might be an underestimate, a part of the increase in mortality can be explained by improved registration. However, the scale of excess mortality during the second wave in particular is undeniable, especially compared to the low number of COVID-19 deaths officially recorded in the same period. The Civil Registration System is an imperfect system, yet one that journalists are having to turn to in the face of the continuing refusal of the Union government to engage with the issue of the true extent of mortality. Acknowledging the gaps in the system will help journalists, but does not minimise the magnitude of the crisis.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Will a national judiciary work?||The Union government appears to be steadfast in its resolve to implement reforms in recruitment and appointment to the subordinate judicial services. In 2019, it spearheaded a consultative process for the creation of the All India Judicial Service (AIJS). Initially, only four States and two High Courts supported the proposal. Eight States rejected it, five suggested changes, and 11 are yet to respond. Recently, the Centre took the ordinance route to effect changes in the appointment of members to various tribunals. In a single stroke, it abolished several tribunals. The manner of appointment of members to the remaining tribunals underwent a sea change. It is likely that the ordinance may not pass judicial scrutiny in light of the Supreme Court’s judgment in Rojer Mathew v. South Indian Bank (2019). Constitutional perspective Article 233(1) of the Constitution lays down that “appointments of persons to be, and the posting and promotion of, district judges in any State shall be made by the Governor of the State in consultation with the High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to such State”. The 42nd Constitutional amendment in 1976 amended Article 312 (1) empowering Parliament to make laws for the creation of one or more All-India Services, including an AIJS, common to the Union and the States. However, Clause 3 of Article 312 places a restriction that such a service shall not include a post inferior to that of a district judge. The amendment also brought about a significant change in the Seventh Schedule — Entry 3 of List II in its entirety was placed as Entry 11A in List III. This paves the way for Parliament to enact laws with regard to ‘Administration of Justice; constitution and organisation of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts’. Post-Emergency, amendment to Article 312 (1) has escaped parliamentary scrutiny. A dichotomy exists with regard to Articles 233 and 312. What was essentially intended to be the prerogative of the State will now be the prerogative of the Union. If the fundamental power of the States to make such rules and govern the appointment of district judges is taken away, it may be against the principle of federalism and the basic structure doctrine. The First Law Commission deliberated upon this, but it was only in 1972 that the issue gained momentum. The views of the Chief Justice of India and the Law Commission reports perhaps paved the way to bring in the 42nd constitutional amendment. It was only in 1986 that the Law Commission resurrected the issue and deliberated upon the objections. The primary fear was that promotional avenues of the subordinate judiciary would be severely curtailed. Fifty per cent of the posts of district judges are to be filled by promotion from the subordinate judicial service, thus leaving open the remaining for direct recruitment. Another fundamental concern was the language barrier. The Union Law Minister has extolled AIJS to be an ideal solution for equal representation of the marginalised and deprived sections of society. Most States already have a reservation policy in force. Tamil Nadu provides for a roster-based reservation of 69%, of which 30% is for women. Uttar Pradesh merely provides 20% reservation for women and the AIJS may therefore benefit States like U.P. Arguments that the AIJS will reduce judicial delays do not hold water as the subordinate courts are the crucial point of delays owing to the existence of large vacancies. In the early 1960s, the issue was debated during the Chief Justices Conference and was favoured by the eminent body, but many States and High Courts opposed it. The First National Judicial Pay Commission found that it would be in the interest and the health of the judiciary to form an AIJS. The report supported and reiterated the recommendations of the 14th Law Commission. In the All-India Judges case in 1992 the apex court had opined that the recommendations of the Law Commission should be examined and implemented. The issue was again discussed in All India Judges Association Vs. Union of India (2002). The court accepted most recommendations of the Shetty Commission and directed the government to implement the judgment. Any groundbreaking reform is bound to receive criticism. The National Commission constituted for review of the Constitution headed by luminaries including Justice H.R. Khanna, Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy and K. Parasaran, the then Attorney General, had suggested a paradigm shift in the approach of the Union. The feasibility of the AIJS in the current context requires to be studied, especially when reliance is placed upon archaic reports of the Law Commission. It is for the Union to dispel doubts and at the same time give wings to the aspirations of all stakeholders when implementing the proposal. It, however, remains to be seen if the AIJS would be like the proverbial curate’s egg.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Inadequate promises for Punjab||During his visit to Punjab on June 29, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is voted to power in the 2022 Assembly elections, it would provide 300 units free electricity for each family and waive previous power bills. He did clarify that while the promise of providing 24-hour electricity would take time, waiver on power bills would be immediate. Days earlier, he had also said that AAP would project a Sikh as the chief ministerial face of his party. Not projecting a local Punjabi face was cited as one of the reasons for the party being unable to form the government in 2017, in spite of a groundswell of support. While projecting a local face is imperative, Mr. Kejriwal may have over-estimated the ability of doles to see the AAP through in the 2022 elections. While populism has worked in the past, there are other issues which need to be addressed. Issues that need to be addressed First, while many people look at the Delhi AAP government’s focus on health and education with interest, there is a clear understanding that there are significant differences between Punjab and Delhi in terms of the economic landscape. Second, there is a growing clamour for a government which gives primacy to the State’s long-term interests. Over the past two decades, when it was in an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had kept mum on important issues related to Centre-State relations. There has thus been a clear void as far as effective articulation of Punjab’s regional aspirations and a number of Sikh issues is concerned. The Chief Minister, Captain Amarinder Singh, in spite of his proximity to the Congress high command, was perceived to be vocal in safeguarding the State’s interests. His triumph in 2017 can be attributed to the same, though in his current tenure he has failed to live up to that reputation. It is true that after breaking its alliance with the BJP after the passage of three farms bills, SAD has been making the right noises on issues pertaining to federalism and also attempted to find common cause with other regional parties. But a large section of what comprised its core support base is still disenchanted due to the incidents of sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib and the killing of peaceful protesters during the tenure of the SAD government. While SAD has allied with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for the upcoming Assembly elections, there are murmurs that it could return to the BJP. Making inroads into Punjab If one were to look at the AAP, there is some interest in its governance model in Punjab. But there are concerns about its sidetracking of local leaders during the earlier election and its ambiguity on issues concerning Punjab, specifically on the river water issue. Apart from this, the high command culture of the party, like in other national parties, is not likely to go down well with voters. Third, from a political standpoint, the AAP has little support in the Malwa region, but no support in Doaba or Majha. It may be able to make some inroads into these regions if it ties up with a breakaway group of the SAD, the SAD (Sanyukt). Also, if the AAP can draw a sizeable chunk of urban votes, which generally go to the BJP or Congress, it could be in a pole position. Finally, there is a growing awareness about the pitfalls of populism. While there has been opposition to the farm laws, the detrimental impact of the current wheat-paddy cycle which has caused the water levels to drop and impacted the environment has not gone unnoticed. Punjab’s political landscape is witnessing an interesting churn. There is a general consensus that a futuristic vision for Punjab which gives precedence to the State’s interests is imperative. Unlike West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the regional party of the State which is best placed to do that, the SAD, has failed in recent decades.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Trump again||The Trump Organization, the company owned by former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been charged by authorities in New York state on 15 felony counts including for committing a scheme to defraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. Prosecutors have also brought charges against a “sweeping and audacious” fraudulent scheme involving the firm’s CFO taking more than $1.7 million in undeclared remuneration from the company for personal expenses. While Mr. Trump has not been charged in this legal salvo, it is possible that that might happen in the future, should the investigation determine that he engaged in criminal conduct. Already, Mr. Trump’s name was mentioned at several points in the indictment and the evidence at hand appeared to show that as the former CEO of the company, the 45th President of the U.S. had signed some of the illegal compensation cheques in the 15-year tax fraud scheme. There are also indications that the indictment might be the tip of the iceberg in relation to the extent of the New York District Attorney’s investigation of the corporate practices of Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization. In May 2021, legal filings in New York revealed that the office of the DA, Cyrus Vance, was arguing in court that Mr. Trump’s accountants were required to produce eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns in compliance with a grand jury subpoena. This hinted that what was originally suspected to be an inquiry into illicit payments made by Mr. Trump’s associates, prior to the 2016 presidential election, to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, had expanded into a far-reaching investigation relating to bank and insurance fraud. While Mr. Trump has characteristically attacked the ongoing indictment and broader case as a “political Witch Hunt by the Radical Left Democrats,” there is no escaping the reality that if the charges stick and the investigation continues to broaden its scope, he will be hobbled by a political distraction should he attempt a second presidential run in 2024. There have been troubling questions about his business activities ever since he entered office, including, given that his real estate holdings were used for U.S. government activities, whether he was in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The larger question, however, is the one facing the Republican Party as such: when the next presidential election rolls around, will it continue to place its faith in a man who despite claiming to be an outsider to Washington politics is evidently no different from any run-of-the-mill plutocrat or any networked member of corporate elite bent on maximising personal gain no matter the social cost? Should they do so for want of real leadership within their ranks, that would be a sad commentary on the state of and prospects for the conservative movement in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/trump-again/article35160153.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Heavy weight||The crisis in the Congress in Punjab has been smouldering beneath the surface for a long time, before the current eruption. Until a few months ago, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had appeared invincible and poised to lead the party to a second consecutive victory in the Assembly election due early next year. Rebel leader Navjot Singh Sidhu’s relentless open battle against the Chief Minister has now cast a long shadow on the party’s prospects. Mr. Sidhu, a party hopper driven by personal ambition, has by default become the champion of the resentment among party MLAs and workers against the Chief Minister’s unilateralism. Mr. Singh was the sole architect of the Congress victory in 2017. After winning 77 of the State’s 117 Assembly seats then, its victory march continued through the 2019 Lok Sabha and local body elections. But a streak of arrogance probably disconnected him from some sections of the party. His very strength — he is head and shoulders above any alternative, including Mr. Sidhu, within the Congress — seems to have opened up a weakness: so sure of his own indispensability, he had little time or patience for some of those in the lower rungs of the party. Congress MLAs complain of humiliation at the hand of bureaucrats and found their lives overshadowed by the giant figure of Mr. Singh. Also, the performance of the Government is coming under scrutiny too. High power tariffs, power cuts, a high unemployment rate and unchecked drug trafficking have exposed the chinks in the armour of the Chief Minister. Faced with bad options, the Congress central leadership appointed a committee headed by Mallikarjun Kharge. It met with around 150 party leaders and submitted a report but that has only opened a Pandora’s box. The Chief Minister took the committee deliberations as a slight, and his detractors, as an open season. Meanwhile, the unmistakable, though oblique, endorsement of Mr. Sidhu by the Gandhi family has complicated the scene further. The former cricketer is a recent entrant in Congress, after a cushy stopover in the BJP as Member of Parliament and contemplating a detour to the Aam Aadmi Party. As a life-long careerist with a reputation for a short temper, he is hardly the leader that critics of the Chief Minister yearn for. Punjab politics is in a churn due to the farmer agitation and an ongoing realignment of political forces. The SAD and BSP have formed a new alliance, and the BJP is left alone. Agitating farmers may have political plans in the coming months. The Congress central leadership and Mr. Singh must work together than at cross purposes to bring order within the party, so that the Government can steer the State’s progress without the dramatic distractions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/heavy-weight/article35160154.ece

The sources were commenting on the Pakistan Foreign Office statement on Friday alleging that India was holding back several Pakistani Government officials, businessmen and tea-estate owners who had sought shelter in India during the “disturbances in East Pakistan”. The Pakistani newspapers, television and radio had played up this allegation and Mr. Aftab Ahmed Khan, Director-General in the Pakistani Foreign Office, had also spoken about this to India’s acting High Commissioner in Islamabad. The Pakistani press had also reported that the Pakistan Government had approached the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, and “friendly governments to arrange relief and repatriation of the “East Pakistani nationals”.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/details-on-west-pakistanis/article35160162.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Services shrink most since July’||India’s services sector shrank the most last month since July 2020, with the survey-based IHS Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for services at 41.2, reflecting a second successive monthly contraction in new business and increased job shedding by firms. International demand for Indian services deteriorated further with new export orders falling for the sixteenth straight month. The sharp contraction in the June Services PMI, followed May’s 46.4. A reading above 50 denotes expansion and one below it signifies a contraction in business activity. “Business activity and new orders decreased in four out of the five broad areas of the service economy, with the fastest rates of contraction registered in consumer services,” IHS Markit said in a statement. “Transport and storage was the only segment to post growth,” the firm added. Jobs fell in tandem with new orders. “The fall in employment was the seventh in consecutive months and the fastest over this period. The decline in jobs was widespread across the five monitored sub-sectors, and led by consumer services,” it noted. “The overall level of business sentiment was down for the third month in a row in June, reaching its lowest mark since last August,” IHS Markit added, with the COVID-19 pandemic seen as the main threat to the outlook. Uncertainty weighs “Uncertainty about the path of the pandemic restricted business confidence among services firms, who were generally neutral in their forecasts for output in the year ahead,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. June’s manufacturing PMI had earlier slid to 48.4, and with services activity also retreating, the Composite PMI Output Index declined from 48.1 in May to 43.1, again registering the sharpest contraction since July 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/services-shrink-most-since-july/article35160136.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Policy black holes spook space investors||Potential foreign investors in India’s space sector are unsure if their licence applications would get ‘a fair consideration’ and are wary of a possible conflict of interest given that the Department of Space is both the sectoral regulator and a service provider by way of its role overseeing the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Observing that the reforms announced in June 2020 to open the sector to private investors were a significant departure from the ‘virtual monopoly’ of state-controlled ISRO and allied entities, the U.K. India Business Council said there was, however, a ‘lack of clarity’ about several aspects related to the procedures. Foreign Direct Investment up to 100% has been allowed under the government route in satellite-establishment and operation, subject to the sectoral guidelines of the Department of Space and ISRO. The processes for authorisation to launch a satellite, the frequency allocation mechanism and even the details of different agencies involved in these clearances were not clear, the Council said, calling for the regulatory structure to be refined. “Today, the Department of Space acts as the regulator, but since it is a major service provider through ISRO, there is scope for a conflict of interest,” the UKIBC said. “Service delivery and decision making are critical challenges. ISRO is a party involved in both, thus creating doubt in the mind of investors, if their licence applications will receive fair consideration,” it added. Emphasising that the private sector was concerned about sharing its intellectual property with the government, the business group said: “If ISRO is serious about partnering with the private sector, policymakers will have to view the industry as more than just a collection of manufacturers or service providers.” Global investors are also keenly tracking developments over the scrapped Antrix-Devas deal in the wake of the Indian government losing an international arbitration and Devas eyeing judicial enforcement of the arbitral award in overseas jurisdictions. Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), a newly created regulatory body, has received at least 26 applications from Indian and foreign firms that include proposals to set up ground stations and make and launch satellites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/policy-black-holes-spook-space-investors/article35160141.ece

(TVSM), a leading two-and-three wheeler maker, has raised concerns about its international operations following shortage of containers and the rapid spread of COVID-19 during the second wave in the company’s target markets. “Due to continued high traffic container movement from China to North America and Europe post COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a shortage of containers at Indian ports,” said Venu Srinivasan, CMD, in the company’s annual report. “This, clubbed with increased exports from India, is posing further shortage of space availability or availability at higher costs. This situation is expected to result in delayed supplies to global customers.” He also said that some of the company’s target markets/countries might witness a ‘rapid spread of COVID-19 second wave’ thereby lowering economic activity. A sustained drop in commodity prices and exports could reduce foreign exchange income in some of the export countries. On the shortfall in semiconductors, he said it was likely to continue and pose a risk to meeting demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/concerned-about-global-operations-tvs-motor/article35160131.ece

06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Global investors flag some AatmaNirbhar reforms||International trade and investment flows into India could be affected by several aspects of the AatmaNirbhar Bharat programme as they posed ‘perceived as well as real’ challenges for global investors, the U.K. India Business Council (UKIBC) said. The UKIBC stressed that some of the reforms announced under the programme could have ‘negative consequences for U.K. and all multi-national companies’, even as it took note of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that the self-reliant India program is about integrating with global supply chains, not isolating from them. Warning that the spate of ‘unexpected and sharp’ increases in import tariffs could be ‘counterproductive’, the UKIBC has suggested ways to mitigate the ‘new challenges’ posed by AatmaNirbhar Bharat and urged the government to correct course. U.K. businesses must not be affected by ‘restrictive measures’, they have pleaded, possibly by creating a ‘carve-out’ for them in the bilateral trade pact being negotiated. ‘Strengths, not tariffs’ “India should attract investors due to its strengths rather than by using tariffs as a tool to push international businesses to invest and make in India… Moreover, the Government of India should be flexible in its ‘vocal for local’ approach,” the UKIBC has underlined in a report highlighting British investors’ views on the Aatmanirbhar Bharat policy. “To be a manufacturing hub, India will need to be part of international supply chains, which will mean importing as well as exporting. If tariffs make manufacturing in India too expensive, investors will go elsewhere,” the report noted. Even if India chooses tariffs as a policy tool, it should signal how import duties will rise over the coming years so investors get an incentive and the time to create domestic supply chains, it added. “It has to be recognised that certain aspects of the initiative have the potential to curtail international trade and investment, such as increased tariffs, non-tariff restrictions on imports, and import substitution,” it emphasised. The ban on the sale of items such as Scotch Whisky in the CSD canteens sends a wrong signal, the Council said, stressing that some products simply cannot be produced in India. Attempts to renegotiate power purchase agreements and ad-hoc policy shifts are also unnerving for infrastructure investors, it indicated. While the campaign has opened up several sectors for foreign investors, including defence, atomic energy, agriculture, insurance, healthcare and civil aviation, the UKIBC has outlined concerns and challenges across sectors in its report titled ‘Road to a UK-India Free Trade Agreement: Enhancing the Partnership and Achieving Self-reliance’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/global-investors-flag-some-aatmanirbhar-reforms/article35160139.ece

06 July 2021||LONDON,||Ash Barty lays down a marker, in quarters for the first time at SW19||World No.1 Ashleigh Barty reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time on Monday, beating French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-3. The defeat brought an end to Krejcikova's 15-match winning streak. Barty may have won in straight sets, but that did not really tell the full tale of a hard-fought 95-minute encounter against an opponent who had yet to win a main draw singles grass match prior to Wimbledon. Barty's serve was once again her Achilles heel, being broken early in the first set and then again in the second while serving for the match. Fortunately for the Aussie supporters on Court No.1 – one of whom was holding a hand written card ‘It's Barty's Party' – she found the return game when she most needed it, including the final break of serve to take the match. “It was incredibly tough,” Barty said. "I found some good stuff when it was important. It’s down to the work myself and my team do in practice. It tastes sweeter when you win." Earlier, Ons Jabeur continued here historic run, reaching the women's last eight with a 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Poland’s 2020 French Open champion Iga Swiatek. The 26-year-old is the first Tunisian woman to reach this stage at Wimbledon and will face Belarusian second seed Aryna Sabalenka, who defeated Elena Rybakina 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Jabeur showed great poise after she let slip a 5-4 lead while serving for the first set. She broke her 20-year-old opponent in the first game of the second and never looked back, taking 11 of the next 13 games. Jabeur celebrated with a fist pump and a shriek of delight, but for once she was not a lone Tunisian voice, as some spectators burst out into a song, with Jabeur joining by cupping a hand to one ear. Marton Fucsovics became just the third Hungarian man to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals, after Bela von Kehrling (1929) and Jozsef Asboth (1948). The 29-year-old, ranked 48, blasted 41 winners to defeat fifth seed Andrey Rublev 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. Fourth seed Alexander Zverev was upset by 20-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-6(6), 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, with the German serving 20 double faults. The only remaining former champion in the women’s draw, Angelique Kerber, stopped the fast-rising American teenager Coco Gauff with her most assured performance yet, beating the 20th seed 6-4, 6-4.  Actually I got congratulated by Roger [Federer] after my match, which was amazing. I think now I'm good in my tennis career. He was very nice. He took the time to say congrats.

06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mary Kom, Manpreet Singh to be flagbearers at opening ceremony||Boxer M.C. Mary Kom and men’s hockey team skipper Manpreet Singh will be flagbearers for India at the opening ceremony of Tokyo Olympics, scheduled to get underway on July 23 . Wrestler Bajrang Punia will be the flagbearer at the closing ceremony on August 8. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has communicated the decision in this regard to the Organising Committee of the Games.  “It would be a huge huge moment for me given that it is my last Olympics. Who knows I might even get emotionally overwhelmed,” said Mary Kom. ‘Amazing’ “This is amazing, and I am speechless. I think it’s a huge honour to be named the flagbearer for the opening ceremony alongside the incredible Mary Kom," Manpreet was quoted as saying in a Hockey India release. The country’s lone individual Olympic gold-medallist Abhinav Bindra was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. Gender parity At its executive board meeting last year, the International Olympic Committee had made provisions for flagbearers from both genders at the opening ceremony. “The IOC Executive Board also decided that there should be — for the first time ever — at least one female and one male athlete in every one of the 206 teams and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team participating at the Games of the Olympiad,” IOC chief Thomas Bach had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mary-kom-manpreet-singh-to-be-flagbearers-at-opening-ceremony/article35160330.ece
06 July 2021||KOCHI,||Dhanalakshmi gets a ticket to Tokyo||The absence of the seasoned M.R. Poovamma, who won the 400m gold in five of the six meets this year, and the inclusion of Tamil Nadu’s S. Dhanalakshmi in the 4x400m mixed relay squad were the big surprises in the 26-member Indian athletics Olympics team announced on Monday. Poovamma, the 400m silver medallist with 53.54s at last week’s inter-State Nationals, was assured of a berth in the mixed 4x400m relay but surprisingly, the Karnataka athlete left the national camp and went back home. “(Her) back is bad,” Adille Sumariwalla, the Athletics Federation of India president, told The Hindu.  Meanwhile Dhanalakshmi, the inter-State National and Federation Cup 100m champion who had been hoping to go to Tokyo through the women’s 4x100m relay, got a surprise ticket in the 4x400m mixed relay after finishing third in the 400m trials in Patiala on Sunday. Athletics events begin on July 31. Well-prepared “We are happy that it is a well-prepared team, physically and emotionally, for the Olympic Games. The world has been through a lot and athletes have been challenged to stay in good shape, retain form and in good spirits,” said Sumariwalla. “We are pleased that our athletes have remained in training ever since lockdown was lifted,” he added. He said it was significant that as many as 12 individual athletes and the 4x400m mixed relay team had attained the entry standards, laid down by World Athletics, to secure automatic berths. Dutee Chand (women’s 100m and 200m), M.P. Jabir (men’s 400m hurdles), Gurpreet Singh (men’s 50km race walk) and Annu Rani (women’s javelin) were assured of entries on the strength of their Road to Tokyo rankings.  The team: Men: Avinash Sable (3000m steeplechase); M.P. Jabir (400m hurdles): M. Sreeshankar (long jump); Tajinderpal Singh Toor (shot put); Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (javelin throw); K.T. Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohilla (20km walk), Gurpreet Singh (50km walk); Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv, Muhammed Anas, Naganathan Pandi, Noah Nirmal Tom (4x400m Relay): Sarthak Bhambri, Alex Antony (4x400m mixed relay).   Women: Dutee Chand (100m and 200m); Kamalpreet Kaur and Seema Antil-Punia (discus throw), Annu Rani (javelin throw); Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (20km walk); Revathi Veeramani, Subha Venkatesan and S.

06 July 2021||London,||Italy appears to have the edge over Spain||Luis Enrique thought for a couple of seconds, looked straight back at the questioner, and gave the curtest of replies. “No,” said the Spain coach, with a blank look on his face, after being asked if he had seen a better team than his at the European Championship. An answer out of blind loyalty? Perhaps. Or was it the fact that Spain was the leading scorer at Euro 2020? Maybe. Or the fact that La Roja is on an unbeaten streak stretching back to October, a run of 13 games? Quite possibly. Spain’s opponent in the European Championship semifinals on Tuesday might have something to say about all that. Better run of form Italy, another of the continent’s traditional powers, brings an even better run of form to Wembley Stadium — a national-record 32 matches unbeaten, going all the way back to September 2018. Maybe Enrique isn’t aware, but Italy is rolling at the moment. Much has changed since Roberto Mancini took charge in May 2018, with the team having evolved into a high-energy unit that presses hard and attacks at pace. But the Azzurri’s defence needs little introduction. Formidable centre-backs Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini are still holding fort, like they have been for more than a decade, and Italy has conceded only two goals so far. Spain’s defence, on the other hand, is a work in progress while centre-back Aymeric Laporte integrates following his switch of nationality from France. In attack, striker Alvaro Morata continues to frustrate for Spain and Enrique has seemingly yet to settle on his preferred wingers. Italy, though, has had strong and reliable performances from striker Ciro Immobile and wide forward Lorenzo Insigne, the scorer of the decisive second goal against Belgium. It’s in midfield where Spain can seriously challenge Italy, potentially making it the department where the match could be won or lost. Jorginho, Nicola Barella and probably Marco Verratti for Italy versus Sergio Busquets, Pedri Gonzalez and Koke for Spain is a must-watch duel all by itself. Neither team has made it this far in a major international competition since 2012, when they met in the Euro final in Kyiv. Spain won 4-0. Two players remain from each country — Bonucci and Chiellini for Italy, and Jordi Alba and Busquets for Spain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/italy-appears-to-have-the-edge-over-spain/article35160253.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Phoenix Suns has the edge against injury-hit Milwaukee Bucks||The last time Phoenix Suns played in the NBA Finals was in 1993 when it lost to Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls. Milwaukee Bucks’ last Finals appearance goes back even further — 1974, three years after it won its only NBA title. That these two teams have made it this far in a pandemic-affected season is a tribute to their coaching staff and key players. Massive boost Point ‘god’ Chris Paul’s addition has been a massive boost to the Suns. Among the best guards in the league since 2005, he had never previously made the Finals — he has played in weaker sides and has also missed out because of injury in the past. He has added veteran poise to the Monty Williams-coached team. The Suns have a terrific backcourt with the Paul-Devin Booker combination. Paul orchestrates and uses his high IQ to break down even the most sophisticated half-court defence while Booker is a dead-eye mid/long-range shooter who can be a go-to weapon when the chips are down. Centre DeAndre Ayton plays sturdily in the paint and has a feathery soft touch at the rim that makes him a potent offensive weapon while young forward Mikal Bridges and gritty veteran Jae Crowder provide the three-and-defence nous to the outfit. The Suns also have good bench strength. Formidable threat The Bucks, however, will be a formidable threat, provided former MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo recovers from his knee hyper-extension problem. The side had to weather a tough challenge from the Brooklyn Nets in the conference semifinals and then had to reach deep within the roster when the ‘Greek Freak’ got injured. The Bucks are a versatile squad — point guard Jrue Holiday is a sturdy rock who can defend multiple positions, P.J. Tucker was outstanding against Kevin Durant in the semifinals and should take on the Booker assignment while Khris Middleton is an unsung Swiss Army knife who seamlessly shifts from the back seat to the closer option in crunch time. Centre Brook Lopez has his flaws (defending in space, which mid-range maestro Paul will do his best to take advantage of), but he is a good shot-blocker and has good shooting range. The Bucks are complete with Antetokounmpo, a freight train in the paint, an outstanding defender who plays with a relentless motor. If he remains injured, the Suns will be favourites, but if he risks playing, expect the coaches matching wits with subtle adjustments. The Finals are going to be a treat to watch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/phoenix-suns-has-the-edge-against-injury-hit-milwaukee-bucks/article35160147.ece
06 July 2021||BRASILIA,||Argentina looks to Messi to deliver||Argentina is enjoying the “Barcelona version” of Lionel Messi at the Copa America ahead of his 150th appearance for the national team. The 34-year-old Messi is still seeking his first major success with Argentina, not counting the Olympic gold in 2008. But with four goals and four assists in the tournament so far, Messi has led Argentina to the semifinals where it plays Colombia on Tuesday at the Mane Garrincha Stadium. The inspiration On Saturday he scored one goal and provided two assists in Argentina’s 3-0 win against Ecuador in the quarterfinals. It was Messi’s first game since his contract with Barcelona expired. Messi has played a record 149 matches for Argentina. His inspired performances in the last five are being compared to his best days with Barcelona, including his vision on the field, the quality of his passes and two goals from free kicks. “This is the best player ever we are talking about,” said Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni. His teammates have played their part in Messi’s resurgence for Argentina, which last won the Copa America in 1993. Messi seems driven to be at the July 10 final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, the same stadium where Argentina — and Messi as captain — lost in the 2014 World Cup final to Germany.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/argentina-looks-to-messi-to-deliver/article35160250.ece
06 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Geetha relives Olympics experience||For S. Geetha, daughter of a cycle spares shop owner in the obscure town of Marteru of West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, it has been a fabulous journey in the world of athletics —– with the distinction of representing India in the 2004 Athens and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. “When I look back, it all looks like a dream. Representing my country in the Olympics was something which I never ever thought of when I started off in athletics in the then AP Sports School (Hakimpet) in 1994,” recalls the 38-year-old Geetha, now settled in Guntur as OSD in South Central Railway. “I got the support at the right time from so many officials at APSS and I am thankful to many including PET Pradeep sir, SAI athletics coaches M. Ranga Rao and N. Ramesh and the Director Dr. N. Parameswara Ram,” she said in a chat with The Hindu , tracing her journey.  “Making debut in the Olympics in Athens itself was a huge honour for me. I was informed just after the warm-up that I would be competing in the 4x400m relay and we finished eighth in the finals,” said Geetha, who is married to former player and now secretary of Andhra Hockey Association G. Harshavardhan. “I was nervous and unprepared for the biggest experience of my career. But, somehow I could focus, tried to give my best when I ran the first lap,” recalled the 2006 Asian Games gold medallist in 4x400m relay. “In the 2008 Beijing Olympics, I was relatively relaxed but was disappointed finishing fourth in the semifinals (4x400m),” she said. Bright chance Geetha feels the current Indian athletes have very bright chance of winning medals. “Thanks to the exposure and the wonderful support from the federation, government and SAI, they have been doing really well and I am sure they are going to win some unexpected medals in athletics,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/geetha-relives-olympics-experience/article35160321.ece

In all, 17 A-division and eight B-division matches are remaining. BDFA Chairman, S.L.

Two teams will move up from A-division to Super Division. Because of logistical issues, this season's C-division will be conducted as a knockout tournament, beginning in the third week of July. The C-division will be taken up as a priority next season and is most likely to be the season-starter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bdfa-leagues-set-to-restart-tomorrow/article35160322.ece
06 July 2021||LONDON,||Anderson claims 1,000th First Class wicket||England paceman James Anderson claimed his 1,000th First Class wicket during a career-best spell of seven for 19 for Lancashire against Kent in the County championship on Monday. The wicket came in trademark fashion, an outswinger that Kent batsman Heino Kuhn edged behind at Old Trafford, with wicket-keeper Dane Vilas taking the catch. It was the 38-year-old paceman’s fifth scalp of Kent’s innings and saw him bring up another notable milestone in a career in which he has broken England Test records for appearances and wickets. Anderson finished the first innings with seven wickets from his 10 overs as Lancashire bowled Kent out for just 74 in 26.2 overs. He was given a standing ovation from the crowd. Greatest England Cricket tweeted an emoji of a goat, which has become shorthand for ‘greatest of all time’, adding: “Congratulations on 1,000 First Class wickets.” Anderson, who turns 39 this month, made his First Class debut for Lancashire in 2002. Most of his First Class wickets have come in Tests — he has 617 scalps in 162 matches, just two behind Anil Kumble, who is third on the all-time bowling list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/anderson-takes-1000th-first-class-wicket/article35160248.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Harika primed for World Cup in Russia||It was a profitable month of working from home for Dronavalli Harika. Finishing runner-up at the Women’s Speed Chess Championship on Saturday made her richer by Rs. 9.28 lakh. The superb performance has come as a huge morale-booster ahead of the World Cup, starting in Sochi, Russia, on July 10. “I am glad I could do well in a strong tournament like Speed Chess, in which most of the best players took part,” Harika told The Hindu over phone on Monday. “It is disappointing that I lost in the final to Hou Yifan, but it felt nice that I could put up a strong fight.” She certainly did! Her Chinese opponent is the world’s second-strongest woman player of all time. She went into the lead, fell behind considerably towards the end, but staged a splendid fightback. Technical issues Harika was troubled by technical issues during the final. “I lost internet connectivity for a brief while following a power failure and that cost me a game. But, in online tournaments, one should be prepared for such problems,” said the World No. 9. “It was an excellent tournament for me, as I was able to defeat some strong players like World blitz champion Kateryan Lagno and former World champion Alexandra Kosteniuk,” she said. Looking ahead to the World Cup, she said she was just happy that she would be able to get back into a tournament hall once again. “It is great to see that chess and the rest of the sporting world is returning to normalcy,” she said. “My last tournament was in Switzerland in March last year. I got home just before the entire world went into lockdown. “The last one year has not been easy, as I realised that chess need not always be the priority in life.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/harika-primed-for-world-cup-in-russia/article35160319.ece

06 July 2021||MUMBAI,||Ankola retained Mumbai chief selector||Salil Ankola has been retained as the chief selector while Sunil More has been recalled to Mumbai’s senior selection panel for the forthcoming domestic season. Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) secretary Sanjay Naik confirmed on Monday that the Cricket Improvement Committee (CIC), headed by former batsman Jatin Paranjape, finalised the list of all the selection panels after interviewing all the candidates that had applied for the posts. Lone exception Former India pacer Ankola, who returned to Mumbai cricket after more than two decades ahead of the last domestic season, was the only one persisted with from the last season’s panel. All the other members had indirectly revolted against the Mumbai Cricket Association set-up, alleging interference in selection by office-bearers. More, meanwhile, has returned to the selection panel after two years. The former Ranji Trophy champion was last part of the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel which resigned in controversial circumstances in March 2019. After finishing at the bottom of the group in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the start of the curtailed last season, Mumbai staged a dramatic turnaround to lift the Vijay Hazare Trophy. The other members of the selection panel are former Test batsman Ghulam Parkar, former pacer Prasad Desai and Anand Yalvigi, who made his First Class debut for Mumbai before winning the Ranji Trophy for Karnataka. Muzumdar head coach Former Mumbai captain and eight-time Ranji champion Amol Muzumdar has been appointed as head coach for the season.

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Good Earth and the suit reset||“There continues to be different struggles for women at work, however clothes are not one of them,” says Deepshikha Khanna. “Women don’t want to compete with men via structured suits any more. That story is over!” As creative director at Good Earth’s new FLOW, she has a tidy selection of contemporary basics to prove just that. Mixing her learnings from previous stints at Delhi Crafts Council and her position as the former head of apparels at Good Earth’s ‘Sustain’ since 2016, Khanna brings her personal brand of deviously easy and conscious fashion to Good Earth’s latest prêt line. In development since 2019, it involves craft cluster organisations like Khamir and Malkha. Khanna’s solid design background (a graduate of Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandise, San Francisco, running one of India’s first denim brands ‘Jealous Jeans’, a stint at Levi’s and her own brand ‘Caramel’) meant she could identify and plan a new vertical quite quickly within the Good Earth banner. The aim: everyday basics through the year.  Behind a mindful capsule  FLOW consists of seven suits (black, white and stripes among others) that are madeloungeyfor women, a single style of jumpsuit, blouses, slip dresses, and XL scarves in colours such as dove-grey sufa, hand-dyed indigo blue, neutral grey, khaki and Good Earth’s signature white —mogra. All the pieces are made with handloom textiles.  Khamir in Kutch, famous for their Kala cotton weave, rejigged their signature cotton with a linen blend specifically for FLOW to add durability, structure and plushness. It is perfect for suits, the pièce de résistance in the collection. Working with Malkha (known for their ingenious mix of mulmul and khadi) from Telangana also helped modernise stripes. The final result is a luxe, restrained-sexy look. It is this earthy palette and use of only handloom textiles that sets FLOW apart from Nicobar, Good Earth’s sister RTW brand.  When success is free-flowing  FLOW is a digital-first brand, and will connect with its audience via digital and social media sales and virtual appointments. It was planned as a brand for a woman in her 40s, an oft-ignored demographic. Women that wear many hats and juggle many things, while free flowing through all of them. Good Earth stores may thus chalk out a specially curated section within the stores, and in the future include accessories that are gathered or inspired from Khanna and the team’s travels to offer a complete look. The collection is to be sold as limited edition separates (only 20 pieces exist for each colourway) and future collections would follow a similar design language so buyers can continue to mix and match for years to come.   FLOW, Rs. 9,800 plus (dresses and wraps), Rs. 21,200 plus (suits), is at select Good Earth stores and at goodearth.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/good-earth-and-the-suit-reset/article35160651.ece
06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||June bugs||June was adopted as Pride month (I don’t know when, I do know why, but so does Google so, let’s not waste my time) and suddenly the world sat up, took notice and decided to rain on their parade. Which is ironic because normally that would have led to the most awesome rainbows in the sky, which would have only made the day more symbolic, but it didn’t. Instead, it is almost as if the hetero-tards decided to sabotage the celebrations by taking over the month with a gazillion other ‘Days’ to be commemorated. The result is a hodgepodge that runs all through the month, thereby rendering its special factor to an almost zero. Nothing makes a rainbow feel more weighed down than being clouded over. Father’s Day, World Music Day, Yoga Day, Milk Day, Environment Day... I can go on. There’s even Elderly Abuse Awareness Day (or, better put, Awareness to Stop Elderly Abuse Day, before you get any ideas, or a stick). There is Refugee Day on the 20th which comes a day after Sauntering Day, and I can’t help but chuckle silently about the dark joke embedded there. Music and Yoga share a day, but it’s also the longest day so there’s enough to pass around, I guess. The end of the month is Asteroid Day, which means our LGBTQI+ friends can’t have a stellar exit celebration to themselves. Instead, they are forced to share it paying respect to a gazillion other heavenly bodies that nobody save for the nerds in white lab coats care about. I think this Day thing is getting way out of hand. Well, I thought the matter was out of hand since my fourth birthday because no other day really mattered to me after that. Maybe a mid-week national holiday that meant getting to sleep in a bit, sans school. But if this keeps up, very soon we shall all know June as the month with no dates, just names for every day, multiple names in fact, or maybe AM- and PM-specific names. And depending on the time zone, you will have to refer to it appropriately. Business conversations will go, “Let’s meet for lunch on International Olympic Day” and someone will reply, “Oh, but it’s Widows Day where I am so I have to attend a service. How about we pencil in Autistic Pride Day for a quick coffee?” Leaves will be sanctioned based on who observes what with how much reverence. If you take International Picnic Day off then you will need to work on Olympic Day to compensate. And that’s not just June. I am merely citing June because not a day this month past did my morning alarm simply chime and say “Welcome to Tuesday”. Instead, it was a cafe-style menu of the ‘Days of the day’ that seemed to make each entity even more insignificant. A friend remembered to wish his father on Father’s Day, but forgot that it was also his old man’s birthday! Now that’s one way to reduce your inheritance. This day overload has to stop. Everyone and everything is unique and special to someone. But it shouldn’t mean we impose it across realms. World Bicycle Day and World Oceans Day mean a lot more to me than, say, Wind Day because I haven’t indulged in activities involving the latter half as much. While I am all for reducing this forced Happy Quotient, Hallmark will definitely disagree for this is the one month that they wish was lived 12 times a year. It gives them a raison d’être but more importantly, a chunk of their profits for the coming year. I wonder if they celebrate “Fooled the Public Yet Again” day at their offices? Hopefully, it’s not in June.  This column is for anyone who gives an existential toss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/june-bugs/article35160652.ece

06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lajpat Nagar market closed||The Delhi government has closed the popular Lajpat Nagar market in south Delhi till further orders for violation of COVID-19 norms, officials said on Monday. Sub-Divisional Magistrate, South East District, Padmakar Ram Tripathi said an inspection was carried out by the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour enforcement teams at the Lajpat Nagar market wherein “gross violations” of guidelines were observed. “It is, hereby, directed that Lajpat Nagar Central Market is closed with immediate effect until further orders,” the DDMA order said. Representatives of various trader bodies claimed that crowding is mainly due to the presence of street vendors and it is up to the administration to prevent it. The DDMA directed the market association to show cause on Monday as to why action as per the DDMA Act and other applicable laws should not be taken against them. The order also asked municipal officials and the Delhi Police to ensure no street vendors or unauthorised shops are functional within the market area.

06 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Kejriwal making false promises on free power’||Punjab Chief Minister Captain (Retd.) Amarinder Singh on Monday accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of failing to provide free power to the farmers in the national capital. He also accused the AAP supremo of making false promises on “free power” in Punjab with an eye on the 2022 Assembly polls. “The Kejriwal government has completely failed the people of Delhi on all counts, with no free power to the farmers in the villages located in the national capital and charging excessively high-power tariffs for the industry,” said Captain Amarinder, asserting that the people of Punjab have already rejected the pathetic Delhi model of governance on all counts. The Punjab Chief Minister termed the Delhi power tariff structure a case of organised loot by the AAP government, which was openly allowing private power distribution companies in Delhi, including the Reliance Group, to fill their pockets at the cost of the common man. “While Delhi is charging Rs. 9.80 per unit for industrial power, the Congress government in Punjab is levying a subsidised tariff of Rs. 5 per unit to attract industry, and the State has witnessed more than Rs. 85,000 crore worth of investment visible on the ground in the last 4 years. Subsidised power is being given to 1,43,812 industrial units with an annual subsidy of Rs. 2,226 crore,” he said in statement. “In sharp contrast to Punjab, where my government was giving free power worth Rs. 6,735 crore to 13,79,217 farmers, the AAP government in Delhi had made no effort whatsoever to extend similar support to the agricultural community there,” the Chief Minister said. Capt. Amarinder said the Delhi government was befooling the people by putting a small amount into one pocket, by way of 200 units of free domestic power, and taking away a higher amount from the other pocket by way of high tariffs being paid by the shopkeepers, industry and farmers for commercial and agriculture power. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Paty (AAP) Lok Sabha MP and Punjab president Bhagwant Mann blamed the ruling Congress government for ongoing power crises in the State. ‘Faulty power pacts’ He said the faulty Power Purchase Agreements implemented by previous Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government with the private power companies and continued by the present Congress government has led to the power crises. “AAP, if elected to power will cancel these agreements,” he said here at a press conference. Mr. Mann said that ahead of the 2022 elections, the AAP will come up with a road map for the people of Punjab so that the people would be economically prosperous and culturally rich.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kejriwal-making-false-promises-on-free-power/article35160470.ece
06 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC refuses to hear Gulfisha’s plea against ‘illegal detention’||The Delhi High Court on Monday declined to hear student activist Gulfisha Fatima’s plea against her alleged illegal detention in a Delhi riots case after taking serious note to her advocate Mehmood Pracha’s taking recourse to “heckling” during the hearing. A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani ordered that Ms. Fatima’s petition be placed before another Bench on Friday. “Instead of addressing us on merits, Mehmood Pracha is taking recourse to heckling and seeking to take recourse to facts not in the petition. List before another Bench..,” the court said. “We refuse to be addressed by someone who does not know the basics of law,” the HC remarked. Delhi riots case The court was hearing a plea by Ms. Fatima seeking for a direction to release her in an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case relating to alleged larger conspiracy that led to north-east Delhi riots in February last year. In the habeas corpus petition, Ms. Fatima claimed that her detention in judicial custody was illegal and invalid. Mr. Pracha argued that Ms. Fatima was in continued illegal detention and as per a Supreme Court decision, only a special court under the NIA Act, and not a Sessions court, had the power to extend remand. Mr. Pracha also claimed that as of date, there was no remand order in the present case. As the HC said that the remand order was not part of the pleadings in the case, Mr. Pracha urged the Bench to take his statement on record. To this, the Bench said, “You are not addressing a rally. You are addressing a court. Show us from your pleadings... File an affidavit to say there is no remand order today. You can’t argue statement of facts at the Bar.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-refuses-to-hear-gulfishas-plea-against-illegal-detention/article35160475.ece

06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Registration for UG admissions will begin in late July, says DU||Delhi University on Monday said the registration process for undergraduate admissions will begin from late July instead of July 15 as stated earlier as Class 12 board results are still awaited. Rajeev Gupta, Chairperson of DU’s admissions, told The Hindu: “The registration process for the undergraduate admissions is likely to begin from the third or fourth week of July. It will not begin on July 15 as the results will not be out by then. The Supreme Court has given a deadline of July 31 for the results to be declared so the process will also begin a few days before the results are announced.” “It will be started a few days before the results are declared so that aspirants can fill up basic details and then update other details once the results are declared,” said Mr. Gupta. Reacting to concerns from DU aspirants regarding the criteria to be used for admissions, Mr. Gupta said no decision was taken regarding the entrance test as it was to be decided by the Ministry of Education. Several students had earlier, taken to social media expressing concerns about the possibility of an entrance test this year. ‘Merit-based admissions’ “For now, we are going ahead with the merit-based admissions, and we are preparing accordingly like previous years. As for the CUCET, it is the Ministry’s call, and the decision will come from there. If they give the nod then DU will decide accordingly,” said Mr. Gupta.

06 July 2021||Ghaziabad,||Bhagwat’s outreach evokes mixed response||Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s outreach to Muslims evoked a mixed response from Muslim academics and activists. While some found it unprecedented, others termed it an old book in a new cover. However, most of them saw it as an attempt to reshape the RSS’s image according to changing global politics. “The fact that he accepted that lynching is an Indian reality and that Muslims are at its receiving end is something new,” said Mirza Asmer Baig, professor of Political Science at Aligarh Muslim University. He also pointed to Mr. Bhagwat’s acknowledgement of the need to appreciate the differences in worship and lifestyle of different communities. “Acknowledging the differences is the first step towards accepting the multiculturalism that has defined Indian society for centuries.” He said more than Muslims, Mr. Bhagwat seemed to be addressing the moderate/liberal Hindu voter who was shifting away from the BJP because of its relentless pursuit of hate politics. “Also, the global realpolitik has changed after the Democrats came to power in the U.S. and the Taliban got into ascendency in Afghanistan,” he said. Reminding that RSS leaders often spoke with a forked tongue, Prof. Mohammad Sajjad, professor of History at AMU, underlined that Mr. Bhagwat’s remarks will remain mere rhetoric unless the impact is seen on the ground. ‘Nothing new’ Requesting anonymity, a senior faculty from Darul Uloom, Deoband, said, except for the call for starting negotiation between the two communities, there was nothing new in what Mr. Bhagwat said. “RSS has been reiterating that all Indians have the same DNA. It is their way to call everybody a Hindu. I want to know if they believe that the DNA of the Aryans and the Dravidians is the same,” he said. On the negotiation part, he said Darul Uloom would soon come up with a response. Md. Zaheeruddin, a senior social activist from Dasna in Ghaziabad, said the speech has come as a relief in the tense environment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bhagwats-outreach-evokes-mixed-response/article35160472.ece
06 July 2021||New DELHI,||Plea alleges inordinate delay in reopening spas||The High Court on Monday asked the city government to respond to a plea claiming delay in issuing guidelines to reopen spa centres, which were closed in April due to the second COVID wave while salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed to be open. Justice Rekha Palli also issued notice to the Centre on the petition filed by owners of two spa centres here while posting the case for hearing on July 22. The court also remarked: “We are not living in ivory towers, we are aware of the situation. Hotels have opened in some States, we know. But I can’t direct them today to open spa centres. I have to hear them also”. The petition argued that even though the Delhi government has permitted gyms, ayurvedic centres and salons to open in Delhi in June, they have not passed similar orders regarding spa centres. Delhi government additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan said more than four lakh people died and the issue has to be holistically examined by experts of the field. The plea sought quashing of the June 26 order of Delhi Disaster Management Authority in relation to spa centres and urged the high court to direct for reopening spa centres in Delhi and permit their re-functioning in a time-bound manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/plea-alleges-inordinate-delay-in-reopening-spas/article35160476.ece
06 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘BJP is seeking revenge on farmers in agitation-related cases’||Terming it “vengeful”, the AAP on Monday accused the BJP of “attempting to replace” Delhi government-appointed lawyers with “its own” to allegedly harass and defame innocent farmers in criminal cases filed in relation to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha alleged the BJP wanted to replace the Delhi government’s lawyers not with the intention of bringing justice to the farmers but to “seek revenge”. “A few days ago, a virtual meeting took place between the L-G and the Delhi Home Minister, wherein BJP’s intentions became crystal clear,” he alleged. “The BJP’s appointee, the Lieutenant-Governor, said they will remove Delhi government’s lawyers and that they wish to get new lawyers as they want the farmers punished; that they wish to teach these farmers a lesson,” he also alleged. Valid request Senior officers present in the meeting between the L-G and the Delhi Home Minister said that apart from the earlier disagreement on file, the L-G on July 1 expressed his disagreement at the Home Minister's turning down of the “valid request” of the Delhi police for the appointment of special public prosecutors. Mr. Baijal, according to the officers concerned, then wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue on July 2. The cases in question related to incidents on January 26 in which as many as 394 police officers were injured. “Keeping in view the enormity and sensitivity of the matter, I had called the relevant file from the Home Department on March 24. The police have already given a detailed justification for the appointment of 11 special public prosecutors in these matters,” Mr. Baijal was quoted stated. “These cases require careful handling in a time-bound manner in view of the gravity of the offences and implications for law and order. Therefore, I see no reason why the proposal of the police should not be agreed to,” Mr. Baijal stated. There was, he also stated, “no reason to suspect” that special public prosecutors wouldn’t perform their duty fearlessly and impartially as officers of the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-is-seeking-revenge-on-farmers-in-agitation-related-cases/article35160477.ece

Justice Prateek Jalan said he was not going to allow students to dictate terms of examination of a professional course while hearing four petitions by students of second and final-year of Faculty of Law, Delhi University. Mode of exam The Law Faculty Dean said the examination was likely to be conducted in July and another round of exams would be held in September for the benefit of students who are unable to sit in the first round. DU’s counsel said the mode of examination — whether online, offline, blended or assignment-based — was left to the discretion of the institute concerned by the Bar Council of India. One of the final-year students had argued that online open book examination for last year’s intermediate semesters semester II and IV was not in the interest of students. The plea pressed for an assignment-based examination. The plea argued that the dates for the online open book examination might clash with the other entrance examinations that the final-year students might take for further studies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-declines-to-interfere-with-dus-exam-decision/article35160474.ece

06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Monsoon likely to reach city by July 10||The monsoon, which has currently stalled and is at the borders of Northwest India, is expected to revive over the weekend in Delhi, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday. “The southwest monsoon is likely to advance over remaining parts of western Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, and Delhi around July 10. The weather system is likely to cause increased rainfall activity over northwest and central India from July 10,” said a notice. This is predicated on a low-pressure area that is likely to form over the northwest Bay of Bengal off the north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts around July 11 in preparation of which rain-bearing winds are expected to establish from later this week. Delayed by over a week The normal date for the arrival of the monsoon over Delhi is June 30 with an error window of two weeks. However, the IMD had in early June said the monsoon could reach Delhi earlier by June 15 but this didn't happen. Typically the monsoon covers the entire stretch of India by July 8. Meteorologists have said the ongoing weak spell of monsoon started on June 19. Till then, the monsoon had made rapid progress since its advent over Kerala and progressed quickly, bringing in rain that was over 40% more than what is normal for the first fortnight of June. So far, India has got 20.7 cm of rainfall, slightly less than the 20.8 cm that is expected until the first week of July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/monsoon-likely-to-reach-city-by-july-10/article35160487.ece
06 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Cong. protests against rising fuel prices||The Delhi Congress on Monday protested outside the residence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal against the rising petrol and diesel prices, and demanded a reduction in value added tax (VAT). The Delhi police stopped the Congress workers from moving towards the Chief Minister’s residence. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that due to frequent hikes, a litre of petrol in Delhi costs Rs. 99.86 and diesel Rs. 89.36 per litre. The people also have no energy left to even protest against such inhumane acts by the government in the Centre as well as the State. “The Delhi government was getting 30% and 16.75% as VAT on a litre of petrol and diesel respectively. If the VAT is reduced, petroleum products can be sold at a much cheaper rate in the Capital. The Kejriwal government had collected over Rs. 25,000 crore in VAT in the last six years, and thousands of crores in GST, but when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the people, the Kejriwal government did nothing to help people out of their misery,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-cong-protests-against-rising-fuel-prices/article35160462.ece

06 July 2021||July 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Fashion editors’ e-commerce switch||You don’t have to be a fashion insider to know that the past few years have not exactly been easy on print publications. Within this segment, lowered ad budgets and dwindling subscriptions (with social media bringing brands and designers closer) have hit fashion magazines the hardest. Over the past two years, this has led to a few shutting shop in India, with veteran editors and journalists out of jobs. Amid all the gloom, those who once set trends and could make or break brands with their editorial power have found an unlikely refuge in e-commerce. Multi-brand e-tail destinations like Nykaa, Tata CliQ, Myntra, Amazon and Ajio, among others, now employ many whose bylines once populated the pages of Vogue , Harper’s Bazaar , Elle , Marie Claire and L’Officiel , to name a few. But what could mass e-retailers want from people whose sole job it was to talk to select audiences who would rarely, if ever, shop from such portals? The answer is simpler than the question makes it seem. For years, fashion editors and journalists have been walking a tightrope between their responsibilities to their advertisers and their readers. In an ideal scenario, readers would take precedence. But in the real world, where fashion titles in India came to rely heavily on ad-sales, their allegiance shifted to those paying the bills and salaries. They had to survive. Now, these writers who grew up knowing and understanding the Indian fashion industry and customer inside-out find themselves free from that insane balancing act. It is not surprising that the top people at India’s fast-growing e-commerce sites turned to them. Their reasons range from the social and cultural legitimacy that comes when on-boarding respected names, to utilising their clout and roster of contacts to expand retail categories. Former journalists also bring an editorial edge to the way such e-commerce giants talk about the products they sell.  Bringing in some heft  This isn’t new. Back in 2012, I was offered the post of fashion editor at Myntra when its founders were still running the company. Apart from overseeing the almost daily shoots for both clothes and accessories, one of my main roles was to suggest cool, young brands to on-board for the then-emerging category of homegrown designer labels with accessible price points. I was no path-breaking forerunner; it was too early in the day for that category to exist — no matter how farsighted the founders may have been. Besides, once there, I realised that I wasn’t ready or trained enough to bridge the divide between luxury fashion and e-retail. I also found it challenging to fit my style of working into the kind of detailed, structured way a corporate office is run. Used to taking decisions, and being responsible for them, it was hard for me to run my images and copy past the desks of those who specialised in data analytics and SEO/SEM, and had literally no connection to my dreamy world of fashion. For our recently-liberated friends, though, it could be said that they have trained for this. And it shows. Myntra has launched a successful video series with famous fashion and celebrity stylists; something I wouldn’t have thought they’d ever do because of the mass-oriented price points their merchandise represented earlier. NykaaFashion has an expanding array of brands as well as designer labels on one platform. Already, shoots, videos, and captions on social media, emailers, website banners, and even digital ads have begun looking better. E-tailers are now more responsive on social media, and take an interest in regional festivals and cultural high points, too. Ideas like inclusivity — in size, shape, gender and race — are coming to the fore, however tenuously. Ironically, even sustainability is being discussed, though we cannot be certain to what extent it is being inculcated. And this signifies that if not directly, these former magazine editors have definitely helped e-retail giants develop a new understanding of our very unorganised fashion industry.  Tackling the grind  But like anything that’s too good to be true, it raises the question: how long will these marriages last? Already there are murmurs within the inner circles that the hierarchical, corporate structure is proving difficult to navigate on a day-to-day basis, that editorial creativity may have taken a back seat to the realities of the retail cycle. Keep in mind that many of the former editors and journalists come from a monthly publishing cycle. E-commerce, by stark contrast, is a beast that never sleeps. A recent chat room on Clubhouse — that wonderful new app making audio addicts of us all — reminded me of the conversations I used to have with my peers at various fashion weeks. We spoke about designers, retailers, our editors and publishers, and the future of fashion in India. Too soon, it seems, the future is here, standing in front of us. Mais ou sont le nieges d’antan? Where are the snows of yesteryear, it asks, mockingly. It is here that I tell myself to have more faith in an industry that has become a major player in the world economy. In India, the domestic textiles and apparel industry contributes 2% to the GDP, 7% of industry output in value terms, and 12% of the country’s export earnings, according to government figures. In these significant numbers, all set to climb in the future, shines a silver lining. Former journalists may yet invent new forms of expression to meet growing necessities. Maybe the voices of my peers will come out stronger for having been honed by the needs of homegrown brands, labels, and companies that can no longer be ignored. The talk of locally-relevant material has been growing louder over the years; owned content that does not rely on inaccessible tastemakers is already being spoken of as the way forward. Who knows, we could even see new magazines coming out, funded by successful e-retailers. Perhaps this is the deep breath before the much-awaited plunge?
