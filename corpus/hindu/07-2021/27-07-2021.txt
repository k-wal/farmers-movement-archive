Yediyurappa on Monday submitted his resignation as Chief Minister to Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot, ending his fourth stint at the helm exactly two years after he took charge. This was the 78-year-old veteran leader’s fourth tenure as Chief Minister, none lasting a full term. With this, the stage is now set for a new BJP Chief Minister, and all eyes are on the party high command’s decision following a Parliamentary Board meeting in Delhi and the BJP Legislature Party meeting to be held in Bengaluru this week. Mr. Yediyurappa, who had been saying that he was waiting for the “high command’s message” on his future, announced his resignation teary-eyed at the end of an emotionally charged speech at a function to mark two years of his government in the morning. He said he had done it “happily and voluntarily”. Mr. Gehlot accepted Mr. Yediyurappa’s resignation, dissolved the Council of Ministers and asked Mr. Yediyurappa to continue till the process of appointing his successor is completed. This is expected to happen by the weekend, sources said. Shrouded in secrecy The name of the successor is shrouded in secrecy, with most State leaders also claiming to be “clueless” about what is on the high command’s mind while coming up with various formulae being considered. “The party’s parliamentary board will discuss the issue,” Arun Singh, in-charge of party affairs, Karnataka, said in New Delhi. The resignation of Mr. Yediyurappa could well draw the curtains on his nearly five decades of political career, during which he rose from the ranks of the RSS in Shikaripura in the Malnad district of Shivamogga to become the Chief Minister of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/yediyurappa-bows-out-suspense-rises-over-new-karnataka-cm/article35551777.ece
27 July 2021||MANGALURU,||City, mofussil and express bus fares enhanced||The Dakshina Kannada Regional Transport Authority on Monday enhanced fares on all private stage carriage buses — city, mofussil and express — with immediate effect. A notification from the member-secretary of RTA here said that the Canara Bus Owners Association and Dakshina Kannada Bus Owners Association, Mangaluru, and the Coastal Bus Owners Association, Udupi, had submitted demands for fare revision. In view of the enhanced costs of operation following increased costs of inputs, including diesel and the pandemic, it was found feasible to allow a fare hike, the RTA said. The fares allowed to be enhanced are independent of toll fee. All buses operating via toll plazas may collect additional toll fee of a minimum of Rs. 0.04 per km, the notification said. The notification is being issued under State Government Notification of July 29, 2020, that had prescribed maximum fares to be collected on stage carriage buses. The minimum fare on city buses is enhanced from the earlier Rs. 8 to Rs. 12; but the enhanced minimum fare holds good for the first two stages, that is, up to 4 km. Operators had demanded Rs. 12 for the first two kilometres and Rs. 14 for the first 4 km. Similarly, the minimum fare on express/mofussil services has been increased to Rs. 11 from Rs. 9, as against the demand for Rs. 15 from the owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/city-mofussil-and-express-bus-fares-enhanced/article35552209.ece
27 July 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal forms panel to look into snooping allegations||The West Bengal government on Monday set up an inquiry commission, comprising retired Supreme Court judge Madan B. Lokur and former Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, to look into the allegations of snooping on politicians, activists and journalists using the Israeli spyware Pegasus. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the Cabinet had approved the appointment of the commission. “Everyone is under surveillance… We had hoped the Centre will start an inquiry into the Pegasus row under the supervision of the Supreme Court. But this government did nothing even when Parliament is in session. Therefore, before going to Delhi, we took the decision to set up an inquiry commission. West Bengal is the first State to set up an inquiry commission in the Pegasus spyware row,” she said. ‘Phones tapped’ Since there were “aggrieved parties” in the State whose phones had been put under surveillance, the commission would investigate the matter, she added. Last week, Ms. Banerjee had urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the issue. The West Bengal government issued a notification for setting up the commission under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (60 of 1952) to “enquire into and report on inter alia the reported interception and the possession, storage and use of such information collected through such interception, in the hands of state actors and non-state actors.” The notification stated that the commission may submit its report embodying the findings and its recommendations thereon to the government within six months from the date of this notification (July 26). The announcement of the formation of the panel came just hours before the Chief Minister left for New Delhi. Ms. Banerjee is likely to remain in the national capital for the next few days, meeting leaders of the Opposition parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bengal-forms-panel-to-look-into-snooping-allegations/article35551787.ece
27 July 2021||MANGALURU,||City corpn. expects to save Rs. 11 lakh a month||Mangaluru City Corporation expects to save about Rs. 11 lakh a month on energy charges and get 65,870 conventional street lights in the city replaced with LED lamps for almost free when its street light replacement project under PPP gets completed this December. Project concessionaires Chatrubahave Electronics Business Solutions, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited and Annapurna Enterprises made a presentation to councillors on Monday offering finer details of the project. While Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. had initially taken up the project, the corporation took it over and signed an agreement with the concessionaires in February. Subhash Rathod, representing the consortium, told the meeting, chaired by Mayor Premananda Shetty, that the concessionaires will also maintain the project for seven years by establishing a Centralised Control and Monitoring System (CCMS). In return, the corporation will pay the concessionaires Rs. 89.6 lakh a month towards the cost of lights and maintenance. Responding to councillor Abdul Rauf, corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that the corporation was paying Rs. 1.51 crore a month towards energy and maintenance charges. Energy charges are expected to come down to Rs. 50 lakh a month and maintenance will be the responsibility of the concessionaires, he said. Thus, the corporation could save a minimum of Rs. 11 lakh a month besides getting LED lamps for almost free. Mr. Rathod said that the CCMS will not only help in effective monitoring of street lighting system but also reduce energy loss/theft and identify faulty lights quickly. Survey of existing street lights in 51 wards has been completed, while it is going on in the remaining nine. “We have so far mapped 53,983 street lights and installed 295 lamps,” he said. A list of places will be given to the corporation where new poles with earthing facility have to be installed. He said that the concessionaires have already procured 6,000 LED lights to replace 300 conventional lamps per day during the monsoon period. After the monsoon period, 1,000 conventional lights will be replaced a day. The entire work will get completed by December, he said, seeking cooperation from councillors. Responding to councillor A.C. Vinayraj, Mr .Premananda Shetty said that installing new poles with earthing facility will be taken up in phases, while empty poles too will get LED lamps. He concurred with councillor Praveenchandra Alva’s suggestion to give priority to rural areas while replacing conventional lights. Mr. Sridhar asked the concessionaires to provide councillors the weekly schedule of installation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/city-corpn-expects-to-save-rs-11-lakh-a-month/article35552210.ece
27 July 2021||MYSURU,||Boating at Ranganathittu bird sanctuary suspended||Boating at Ranganatittu bird sanctuary near Srirangapatna has been suspended following rise in water level in the Cauvery. The boating facility was withdrawn four days ago. Deputy Conservator of Forest Prashanth Kumar said “Only when the level drops will we take a call on resuming boating after taking all local factors into consideration.” The boats had been tied at the river bank following indefinite suspension. Mr. Kumar, however, said the sanctuary is open for tourists, who have access to all other facilities. As of now, there is no restriction on visitors to the sanctuary. Usually, when the water rises considerably after heavy discharge from the KRS dam, the sanctuary is closed for visitors since it gets flooded. Reopened in July The sanctuary was reopened in the first week of July after a long closure due to pandemic-induced lockdown, cheering bird enthusiasts. The Forest Department reopened the major tourist destination on Bengaluru-Mysuru National Highway on July 6 after the lockdown curbs were eased. The sanctuary was closed for a much longer time in the first wave last year like other tourist spots in Mysuru. The visitors had been asked to strictly follow COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour at the sanctuary which was sanitised before its gates were thrown open for visitors. The response from tourists so far has not been very encouraging and the footfall post-lockdown continues to be gloomy with tourism yet to revive in the region. The water level at KRS dam (measured at 6 p.m.) on Monday stood at 111.60 ft. as against the maximum of 124.80 ft. On this day last year, the level was 106.95 ft. The inflow on Monday was 27,836 cusecs while the outflow (to the river) was 9,611 cusecs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/boating-at-ranganathittu-bird-sanctuary-suspended/article35551813.ece

27 July 2021||Guwahati,||Six police personnel killed in Assam-Mizoram row||Six Assam police personnel were killed in an exchange of fire with their Mizoram counterparts after the protracted border row between the two northeastern States took a violent turn on Monday. The clashes in the border town of Vairengte also left at least 60 persons from Assam injured. The incident comes less than two days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting with the Chief Ministers of the northeastern States in the Meghalaya capital of Shillong for resolving the inter-State boundary disputes. The injured included Superintendent of Police Nimbalkar Vaibhav Chandrakant of Cachar district in Assam and the officer in-charge of the Dholai police station in the district. “I am deeply pained to inform that six brave jawans of @assampolice have sacrificed their lives while defending constitutional boundary of our state at the Assam-Mizoram border. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who also holds the Home portfolio, tweeted. Mizoram’s Home Minister Lalchamliana said the chain of events began at 11.30 a.m. when some 200 Assam police personnel came to the Vairengte autorickshaw stand and “forcibly” closed the duty post of the Central Reserve Police Force and a section of Mizoram police personnel. The CRPF has been deployed as a neutral force on disputed stretches along the 164.6 km Assam-Mizoram border. “The Assam police damaged some Mizoram-bound vehicles on the national highway and committed arson. They did not listen to our officials who tried to resolve the issue and lobbed tear gas shells and grenades and started firing around 4.30 p.m.,” he said. “Mizoram police responded spontaneously by firing back. The aggression of the Assam police started the unfortunate development. The Assam police withdrew and the duty post was handed back to the CRPF after the Union Home Minister spoke to the Chief Ministers of both the States,” he added. Officials in Assam, however, blamed the Mizoram police for the flare-up.

It also took disciplinary action against party leaders who failed to act on complaints about the fraud. Deliberations The district secretariat and the district committee meetings held on Sunday and Monday respectively took the decision. Party acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan and State secretariat member Baby John attended both meetings. The party expelled former bank director board president K.K. Divakaran and three accused in the scam — former bank secretary and CPI(M) Porathissery local committee member T.R. Sunil Kumar, former bank manager and CPI(M) Karuvannur local committee member Biju Karim, and former accountant and CPI(M) Thoduparambu branch member C.K. Jilse. Mr. Divakaran, CPI(M) Porathissery branch secretary, was expelled for his failure in unearthing the fraud. Demoted Two district committee members, Ullas Kalakkad and All India Democratic Women’s Association leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Irinjalakuda municipality K.R. Vijaya, were demoted to the area committee. Former district secretariat member C.K. Chandran, who had the responsibility of the bank, was suspended for one year. The party also removed K.C. Premaraj, Irinjalakuda area secretary, and P.S. Viswambaran, Karuvannur local secretary, from the respective posts. It also suspended bank board members M.B. Dinesh, T.S. Biju, Ambili, Mahesh, and N. Narayanan. The loan scam had put the CPI(M) in the dock. It was alleged that the party had failed to respond even after coming to know about the scam. The party, on receiving complaints, had reportedly appointed an inquiry commission a few months ago. Though the two-member commission handed over its report, no action was taken against the erring officials. Though there were reports that the Crime Branch had taken four of the accused in the case into custody, their arrests had not been recorded yet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/coop-bank-scam-cpim-expels-4/article35552091.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rahul drives tractor to House to protest farm laws||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, accompanied by his parliamentary colleagues, drove a tractor to Parliament on Monday to express solidarity with the farmers protesting against the three farm laws. Mr. Gandhi, along with Rajya Sabha members Partap Singh Bajwa (Punjab), Deepinder Singh Hooda (Haryana) and Lok Sabha member Ravneet Singh Bittu (Punjab), carried a banner and raised slogans. “We have brought the message of farmers to Parliament. A discussion is not allowed inside the House and the farmers are being suppressed. That’s why we are here and they [the Centre] will have to take back these black laws,” he said. ‘No benefit for farmers’ The tractor ride was also aimed at highlighting the cause of the farmers’ unions that have been protesting just outside the Delhi borders for over eight months now. “These laws are aimed at helping only two or three industrialists. The entire country knows for who and whom these laws have been brought about. These laws are not for the benefit of farmers and that is why they have to be withdrawn,” Mr. Gandhi said. His tractor drive from Moti Lal Nehru Marg to one of the peripheral gates of Parliament took the police by surprise, as the area was under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code and no gathering of more than four people was allowed. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and Youth Congress chief B.V. Srinivas and a number of party leaders were detained outside Parliament and taken to the Mandir Marg police station by bus amid sloganeering for the withdrawal of the farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rahul-drives-tractor-to-house-to-protest-farm-laws/article35551925.ece

27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.P. gets big chunk of Clean Ganga funds||The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), conceived as a Rs. 20,000-crore programme in 2014 to clean up the river, has so far been allocated Rs. 15,074 crore. Of this only Rs. 10,972 crore, or about two-thirds, has been released by the Finance Ministry to the NMCG, a body under the Jal Shakti Ministry, according to a response to a question in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. The NMCG further allocates the money to the riverine States. Gajendra Shekhawat, Jal Shakti Minister, said in a written response to a question by Congress MP Mallikarjun Kharge that several sets of interventions for cleaning and rejuvenation of the river had been taken up such as treating domestic sewage, industrial effluent and solid waste, river front management, maintaining ecological flow, rural sanitation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation, and public participation. The planned outlay for the Ganga clean-up mission, accounting for future costs, is well over Rs. 20,000 crore. Overall, 346 projects had been taken up at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 30,235 crore, out of which, 158 projects are completed, the reply said. An NMCG official told The Hindu that the agency had approached the Finance Ministry for funds to meet the sanctioned cost. “Some of the allotted funds reflect the investments in Ganga clean-up programmes all the way from 1985. The amount sanctioned is much higher because they are sewage treatment infrastructure projects with government support until 15 years from the present,” said D.P. Mathuria, Executive Director, NMCG. The funding is critical because as of June 30, Rs. 1,040.63 crore was available with NMCG under the Namami Gange Programme, said Mr. Shekhawat. Uttar Pradesh, at Rs. 3,535 crore, has received the most funds, followed by Bihar (Rs. 2,631 crore), Bengal (Rs. 1,030 cr) and Uttarakhand (Rs. 1001 cr). Sewerage projects for towns along the Ganga in Uttarakhand have already been completed for pollution abatement under the Namami Gange program and the Mission has been focussing on rejuvenation of tributaries of the Ganga with priority on the polluted stretches, said a statement from the NMCG on July 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-gets-big-chunk-of-clean-ganga-funds/article35551543.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Mamata in Delhi on five-day visit, will meet PM Modi today||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee landed in Delhi on Monday for a five-day visit. This is her first trip to the national capital after the Trinamool Congress’s victory in the Assembly election. Ms. Banerjee will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 4 p.m. on Tuesday. She has also sought time to meet President Ramnath Kovind. Trinamool parliamentary leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien told The Hindu , “This is an important visit of Mamata Banerjee and this is an important week for the Indian politics.” Asked if the visit indicates a more active role for Ms. Banerjee in the national politics, Mr. O’Brien said she was not seeking any chair or post. Significantly, key changes took place in the Congress and the Trinamool dynamics ahead of her visit, with the former showing willingness to make many concessions. Congress concessions The first step was to remove West Bengal Pradesh Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury from the equation, with whom the Trinamool was not willing to speak. Congress president Sonia Gandhi gave Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the responsibility to coordinate with the allies in both Houses of Parliament. Sources said senior leader Shashi Tharoor had now been enlisted to liaise with the Trinamool in the Lok Sabha. Mr. Tharoor met its parliamentary party leader Sudip Bandhopadhyay to convey this on Monday. The second step was the Congress had acknowledged that not only Rahul Gandhi but Trinamool general secretary Abhishek Banerjee too has been the victim of Pegasus cyber attack with a tweet from its official handle. It posted a picture saying Mr. Banerjee was targeted because of the West Bengal Assembly election. Ahead of Ms. Banerjee’s visit, the Trinamool Parliamentary Party discussed the strategy for the monsoon session. She is expected to meet a host of leaders during her visit. She will also be paying a visit to Ms. Gandhi. She will also spend a day in Parliament, where meetings with other Opposition leaders, including Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, and those of the DMK, the RJD and others are planned. The party remained tightlipped on whether she will host a joint Opposition meet or not.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-in-delhi-on-five-day-visit-will-meet-pm-modi-today/article35551569.ece
27 July 2021||Pune,||Death toll in rain and landslips climbs to 164 in Maharashtra||Maharashtra officials on Monday said that 164 persons had lost their lives while 100 persons were missing in the landslips and rain-related accidents caused by the unprecedented downpour that has lashed the western part of the State and the coastal Konkan region since July 22. In Raigad district alone, 71 persons died in the landslips which buried Taliye village in Mahad tehsil and Sakhar Sutarwadi and Kevnale in Poladpur taluk. Satara district reported 41 deaths in the landslips at Mirgaon and Ambeghar villages. More than 25,500 head of livestock have been engulfed by the floodwaters or buried. The scale of the destruction and loss is estimated to be even worse than the 2019 floods which ravaged Kolhapur and Sangli in western Maharashtra or the Malin landslip of 2014 when more than 150 persons were killed. It is estimated that 1,028 villages have been afflicted by the rain since July 22, with nearly 400 of these in Kolhapur district and 120 in Satara. A consolidated assessment of the damage in the Konkan, especially in Chiplun and Khed in Ratnagiri district which are among the worst-hit, is expected soon. Nearly 2.3 lakh persons have been evacuated, said official reports while the livelihood of 1.95 lakh people is said to have been hit in Kolhapur alone. The damage assessments from other districts in Konkan and western Maharashtra have yet to come in. After four days of arduous efforts in severely inclement weather, authorities have finally called off rescue operations in Taliye village with the 31 missing persons to be declared dead after due process. “After seeking the opinion of the NDRF, the SDRF and other rescue teams and respecting the sentiments of the survivors and relatives of the missing people, we have accordingly withdrawn our rescue teams from Taliye,” said Raigad Collector Nidhi Chaudhary. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who was due to visit rain-battered Satara on Monday, was compelled to abandon his visit after the helicopter in which he was travelling could not land owing to poor visibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/death-toll-in-rain-and-landslips-climbs-to-164-in-maharashtra/article35551721.ece

President Kovind, accompanied by senior Army officers, reached Baramulla from Srinagar after his chopper could not take off due to bad weather and difficult flying conditions around Zojila Pass in central Kashmir, officials said. He was scheduled to pay homage at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass on the 22nd Anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas.

27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Revenue from monuments down||Ticket sales at monuments fell from Rs. 336 crore in 2019-2020 to a little over Rs. 40 crore in 2020-2021, the year that saw the start of travel bans and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Culture Ministry data given to the Lok Sabha on Monday. In response to a question from MPs Chandeshwar Prasad, Vinayak Raut and Rekha Verma, Culture Minister G. Kishan Reddy’s written reply said there were 1.19 crore visitors at the Centrally-protected monuments and Rs. 40.32 crore in revenue in 2020-2021. In 2019-2020, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) monuments had seen 4.82 crore visitors that brought in a revenue of Rs. 336.23 crore, while in 2018-2019 there had been 5.31 crore visitors and Rs. 317.20 crore in revenue. While the ASI maintained 3,693 monuments across the country, 143 of them were ticketed, an ASI official said. Replying to another question by MPs Bhagwant Mann and Vijayakumar alias Vijay Vasanth, the Minister said the Centrally-protected monuments, including the World Heritage sites, were closed for 61 days from April 16 to June 15 during “lockdown 2.0 in view of COVID-19 situation”, referring to the second wave of the pandemic earlier this year. Funding ideas A “pay as you wish” entry fee at monuments and outsourcing the maintenance of archaeological sites were among the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture in its report on the condition of museums in the country. The panel’s report, which was presented in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha on Monday, acknowledged the inadequate budget of the Culture Ministry as one of the biggest stumbling blocks. “The committee feels that it is imperative for the Ministry to seek the participation of private sector in order to have the necessary investment needed to make our museums and archaeological sites/monuments at par with international standards...,” the report said. The committee that is headed by T.G. Venkatesh recommended that donation drives, including allowing visitors to pay what they wish, beyond a minimum amount, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives be taken up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/revenue-from-monuments-down/article35551711.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Tiruchi plane crash probe a cover-up’||The report of the investigation into the 2018 Air India Express plane crash in Tiruchi is a cover-up to exonerate the pilots, says aviation safety expert Captain Mohan Ranganathan. Not only did pilot error result in insufficient thrust, but the cockpit crew also endangered the passengers’ lives by continuing to fly for close to four hours despite a damaged aircraft in order to ensure that crucial data recording was deleted, he alleges. On October 11, 2018, the flight from Tiruchi to Dubai with 130 passengers hit the airport boundary wall and the antennas of a ground-based navigation aid during take-off, resulting in a gaping wound in the aircraft belly. Despite the ATC informing the pilots of the damage, the crew continued to fly till Muscat airspace, where they were ordered to make a landing in Mumbai. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in its report made public recently has blamed a snag in the pilot-in-command (PIC)’s reclining seat for the incident. Captain Mohan Ranganathan, a former member of the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council and former airline instructor pilot on Boeing 737NGs, says the probe has been whitewashed to ensure pilots go scot-free. “The report fails to fault the pilots for continuing to fly. This is a criminal act,” he alleges.  “The thrust lever moving back to 75% thrust is an indication that it wasn’t the backrest that reclined inadvertently, but in fact the pilot failed to lock his seat and the entire seat moved backwards,” he notes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tiruchi-plane-crash-probe-a-cover-up/article35551546.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lok Sabha passes two Bills amid protests by Opposition||Both Houses of Parliament saw repeated adjournments on Monday, as Opposition members continued their protests over allegations of snooping using the Israeli spyware Pegasus and the controversial agricultural reform laws. The Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day after it cleared two Bills, amid the din. The Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the National Institutes of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management Bill, 2021, were passed by voice vote. The proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were adjourned five times before being called off early for the day, as Opposition members continued raising slogans against the government. Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu said the persistent disruptions had cost the members their opportunity to raise issues of public importance. Mr. Naidu said important matters about COVID-19 vaccines, the alleged attacks on press freedom and even the chance to seek clarifications from the government on the Pegasus issue were denied. He said 57 matters raised by 63 members had been permitted last week but none of them could be taken up due to the disruptions. On Monday, too, there were 12 matters admitted for Zero Hour. “We are becoming helpless day by day,” Mr. Naidu said. In the Lok Sabha, discussions on the two Bills could not take place as the Opposition members raised slogans demanding a discussion on the Pegasus issue and the farmers’ demand for the repeal of the three farm laws. Rama Devi, who was chairing the proceedings, urged protesting members to return to their seats and participate in the discussions. When that did not happen, she went ahead with the consideration and passing of the Bills. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi and Minister of State Arjun Ram Meghwal also urged members to return to their seats and participate in the discussions. Factoring regulation While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke before moving the Factoring Regulation Bill, giving a bit of background on why the amendments were being made, Food Processing Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras simply moved the Bill for consideration and passing. The Factoring Bill, Ms. Sitharaman said, was for the benefit of the Medium and Small Scale Enterprises (MSME) and that the Bill had accepted all the changes suggested by the Standing Committee which went into its details. Earlier in the day, the House saw repeated adjournments and when it met at 2 p.m. and ran for a few minutes, papers were laid on the table and Ms. Sitharaman introduced the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lok-sabha-passes-two-bills-amid-protests-by-opposition/article35551770.ece
27 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Land use change disrupted Kinnaur’s ecology, says study||After nine people lost their lives in a landslip in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur district, a debate surrounding the degradation of environment in this ecological sensitive hill terrain is bound to gain momentum. A recent study suggests that both hydropower projects and afforestation efforts, carried out as compensation for the forest land diverted for hydropower projects in the name of ‘mitigation’, have altered land-use and are negatively impacting the forest ecosystems. The study, titled ‘Mitigation or myth? Impacts of hydropower development and compensatory afforestation on forest ecosystems in the high Himalayas’, was undertaken by Manshi Asher and Prakash Bhandari, environmentalists associated with the Himdhara Environment Research and Action Collective. It was published in the Land Use Policy journal of January 2021. The study, conducted between 2012 and 2016, uses information from government records and ground research to examine the extent, nature and impact of forest diversion for hydropower projects in Kinnaur. “Our study found that not only have construction activities for hydropower projects impacted existing land-use, disturbed forest biodiversity and fragmented the forest landscape, but the related compensatory afforestation plantations are also ridden with problems. These include abysmally low presence of surviving saplings [up to 10%], inter-species conflict, infringement on local land usage and damage by wildfires and landslips,” said Ms. Asher. She said studies show that the tunnelling in mountain areas will result in the risk of more landslips as large amounts of water percolates into surfaces. “The use of dynamites for blasting through the surfaces and underground components of the projects disturb existing slopes and the fragile geology.” Shanta Kumar Negi, president of the Kinnaur-based environment conservation organisation Hangrang Sangharsh Samiti, told The Hindu that over the years climate change is visible. “The conditions of Kinnaur are not favourable for hydropower projects. Construction activities include blasting, which has to be done in scientific manner, but the ground reality is that there’s hardly any check on the frequency of blasting. We are not against development, but Kinnaur is environmentally fragile, and this fact should not be ignored. Development at the cost of human lives is not acceptable,” said Mr. Negi. Nine tourists were killed after boulders fell on their vehicle in a landslip near Basteri in Kinnaur district on July 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/land-use-change-disrupts-kinnaurs-ecology-says-study/article35551723.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBSE, UGC asked to assess vaccination rate among staff||Educational bodies under the Central government have been asked to assess the status of COVID-19 vaccination among staff and teachers in schools and colleges, according to a senior Education Ministry official. This comes amid demands from a section of faculty, parents and students that vaccination be made a pre-requisite for reopening educational institutions to ensure that the infection does not spread on campuses. The official said the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) were among those who had been asked to make such an assessment regarding vaccination of both teaching and non-teaching staff in institutions under their purview. Such data could be key to decisions regarding reopening campuses. These regulatory and administrative bodies have also been asked to provide top-down encouragement and pressure to speed up the rate of vaccinations and move quickly toward 100% coverage. However, the official said that there is no move as of now to set a formal deadline for mandatory vaccination of teachers. At a press conference last week, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava had urged that not only teachers, but also all support staff such as school bus drivers should be vaccinated on a priority basis. He had suggested that it would be wise to reopen the primary school sections first, once staff are vaccinated, as young children are at lower risk of infection. Many States have begun reopening schools this month for the higher classes, especially Classes 10 and 12. Several States have already taken steps to encourage vaccination among educational staff. The Delhi government set up a special vaccination centre for teachers and their families, while the Goa educational department warned teachers that if they do not get vaccinated or do not have a medical exemption, they may be required to produce negative RT-PCR tests on a weekly basis. Karnataka has launched a drive to vaccinate all college-going students and higher education faculty by the end of July. The Education Ministry is likely to convene a virtual meeting of education officials in States — including those in charge of schools, higher education, technical education and skill development and vocational education — after Independence Day to take stock of the current situation after 16 months of school closure. However, Education Ministry officials emphasised that the onus for reopening schools as well as for assessing learning gaps caused by the extended closures largely rest with State governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbse-ugc-asked-to-assess-vaccination-rate-among-staff/article35551718.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Rajasthan Cabinet reshuffle likely in mid-August||The Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan is all set for a Cabinet expansion by the second week of August, a well placed Congress source said on Monday. The source told The Hindu that party general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal and the general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Ajay Maken, are learnt to have firmed up a peace formula between Chief Minister Gehlot and his former deputy, Sachin Pilot, who had rebelled against Mr. Gehlot last July. Resolving factionalism in Rajasthan is first priority for the party and Mr. Maken is scheduled to visit Jaipur again on July 28 and 29 to have discussions with MLAs. While some of Mr. Pilot’s supporters will find a place in the Council of Ministers, Mr. Pilot himself is likely to be drafted as a general secretary in the All India Congress Committee (AICC). Two different sources said that apart from accommodating Mr. Pilot’s supporters, the Congress leadership is looking to reward some of the independent MLAs that support the Gehlot government as well as the former Bahujan Samaj Party lawmakers who merged their party with the Congress. Hence apart from a Cabinet rejig, in which non-performers may be dropped, the Congress will also consider appointing chairpersons to various corporations boards and commissions along with new Ministers. Currently, there are nine vacancies in the Council of Ministers but it is not known how many of them will be given to the Pilot camp. There is a reported tussle over it. Supporters of Mr. Gehlot are not keen that the party concedes too many seats to MLAs whose rebellion had threatened the stability of the Congress government a year ago. Those supporting Mr. Pilot, however, argue that their fight was never about ministerial berths but about giving dignity to leaders who worked hard to bring the party to power in 2018. Amid claims and counter claims, top Congress sources indicated that all the ministerial vacancies may not be filled up in one go and a few vacancies may be there even after the reshuffle exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-cabinet-reshuffle-likely-in-mid-august/article35551766.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm laws: ‘Women and men stand shoulder to shoulder’||Among those who were members of the Mahila Kisan Sansad here on Monday were an Assistant Professor from Punjab, wife of an Army officer and a homemaker who occasionally works towards women empowerment in her village in Haryana. Amandeep Kaur Sandhu, 32, Assistant Professor at a college in village Baba Sang Dhesian, said back home, people used to believe that women should stay indoors. But during the protest against the farm laws, women and men shared the stage and continued the agitation shoulder to shoulder. “Women here spoke for their rights and so articulately, one can’t imagine. This women led parliament has built confidence in them,” she said. The 40-year-old wife of an Army officer, a resident of Mohali who didn’t wish to be identified, said she is here to express solidarity. “Women need to get out of the comfort of their homes and be a part of the movement. I have come here because this is the need of the hour. I am an Army wife and we all stand with the farmers,” she said. Ramkali Jangda, a 57-year-old housewife who works with a local NGO working towards women empowerment in a village in Haryana, said the Mahila Sansad should have happened on day one but she is glad it has happened. At the ‘parliament’, speakers and deputy speakers included CPI leader Annie Raja, Jagmati Sangwan, national vice-president, All-India Democratic Women’s Association and activist Medha Patkar. In two of the three sessions, an “agriculture minister” was also to made to sit and speak. Resolutions passed Ms. Raja told The Hindu that three resolutions were passed on Monday. “Women should be given 33% reservation in Parliament. This Bill has been pending. We have passed a resolution here. It’s high time it was passed in the Lok Sabha as well,” she said. Ms. Sangwan said the ‘parliament’ was essential because women shared issues on the three farm laws which will impact them directly. “We spoke about how we should be given land rights because we don’t have any rights whatsoever. A woman will have to repay the loan in case her farmer husband takes his life but is not allowed to take loans,” she said. “Their labour, hard work, skills and knowledge should be taken on board by people’s movements,” said Samyukta Kisan Morcha referring to a resolution passed in the Mahila Kisan Sansad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/women-hold-parliament-at-farmers-protest-site/article35551558.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||India ‘engages Taliban’ but questions Pakistan’s support||India is engaging all stakeholders in Afghanistan, including some parts of the Taliban, as part of a “multi-track” strategy necessitated by the advance of the Taliban militants on the ground, according to official sources, who for the first time confirmed the talks are ongoing. The talks with the militant group don’t dilute India’s concerns over the Taliban’s recent military gains, and Pakistan’s support to Taliban fighters, but signify that a negotiated power-sharing agreement is now seen as the “best case scenario” for Afghanistan. “We support the Afghan government. We deal with them irrespective of who is in power. We are in constant touch with Afghan leaders from all ethnic backgrounds. We have participated at the Doha [conference inauguration] and later on also have been in meetings [with the Taliban]. We believe Afghans deserve peace, and if we have to be in touch with all stakeholders and regional countries, we will be,” the sources explained. Purported hold According to the government’s latest assessment, the Taliban is attempting to acquire territory to the south and border posts of Afghanistan, and will accelerate its efforts to take major cities once the U.S. completes its pull-out of troops at the end of August. In particular, the assessment has found that while the Taliban holds territory considerably less than media speculation of “85%”, and pegs its reach to only about “45-50%”, it is in a position to establish control of one or more of the southern provinces including Kandahar, Helmand, Ghazni and Paktia. The detailed assessment does not predict the fall of Kabul at present, but that the next three or four months will be crucial to decide Afghanistan’s future. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is expected to share this perception with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Wednesday in Delhi, pointing out that the U.S. air support and international financial assistance would be necessary to stave off the Taliban’s onslaught against the Afghanistan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), along with a check on Pakistan’s continued support to the Taliban. He would also discuss the outcome of his recent visits to Doha, Dushanbe, Moscow, Tehran and Tashkent, all of which focused on the situation in Afghanistan and India’s concerns about Pakistan’s role. In particular, the sources cited recent reports from international news agencies and videos that showed Taliban fighters being treated in Pakistani hospitals, and identified hospitals in the border town of Chaman and Quetta as places where those injured in the fighting with the ANDSF near the border post at Spin Boldak were brought. The sources said many of those killed and injured also held Pakistani identity cards, which was one of the reasons Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani had, at a conference in Tashkent this month, openly blamed Islamabad for failing to stop the flow of “10,000” jihadis, who he said had entered Afghanistan from Pakistan and other countries in the past month. Pressurising Pakistan On Sunday, MEA officials involved in the planning of talks during Mr. Blinken’s visit had also said they would discuss the “the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan on terror financing and terror havens”. However, it is far from clear how much the U.S. will be willing to criticise Pakistan publicly, given that it is deeply engaged with its military and political leadership on pushing the Taliban towards some sort of a “face-saving” peace agreement before the U.S. pulls out all its troops. Earlier this month, the U.S. also announced a new connectivity ‘Quad’ comprising U.S.-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan. In New Delhi, the move is seen as part of the U.S.’s search for a role in Afghanistan post-pullout, amidst reports that American officials are discussing acquiring a base in Central Asia, and also negotiating shelter for those in Afghanistan who have helped their forces and hence, targeted by the Taliban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-engages-taliban-but-questions-pakistans-support/article35551567.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Bills passed without discussions as Oppn. protests||The government on Monday pushed its legislative agenda in Lok Sabha as the House passed two Bills amid uproar by Opposition members over the Pegasus row and the farmers’ issue. The Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the National Institutes of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management Bill, 2021, were passed by voice vote. These are the first two Bills to be passed by the Lok Sabha in the monsoon session which began on July 19. However, discussions on the two Bills could not take place as the Opposition members continued their protests. Rama Devi, who was chairing the proceedings, urged protesting members to return to their seats and participate in the discussions. When that did not happen, she went ahead with the consideration and passing of the Bills. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi and Minister of State Arjun Ram Meghwal also urged members to return to their seats and participate in the discussions. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke before moving the Factoring Regulation Bill, giving a bit of background on why the amendments were being made, Food Processing Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras simply moved the Bill for consideration and passing. Earlier in the day, the House saw repeated adjournments and when it met at 2 p.m. and ran for a few minutes, papers were laid on the table and Ms. Sitharaman introduced the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2021. In the Rajya Sabha, the Pegasus issue loomed large. Deputy Chairman Harivansh asked the protesters to return to their seats and allow Question Hour to be held, before adjourning the proceedings till 2 p.m. Upon reconvening, protests disruted the discussion on the Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021. The House agreed to withdraw the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Amendment Bill, 2012, as moved by Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani. Proceedings were adjourned within minutes each time the House reconvened: first at 3 p.m., then 4 p.m. and then 5 p.m., when the House was adjourned till 11 a.m. on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bills-passed-without-discussions-as-oppn-protests/article35551554.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||T.N., U.P. acquired land for defence industrial corridors||Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have acquired land for the Defence Industrial Corridors (DIC). Tamil Nadu has acquired 283.28 hectares and Uttar Pradesh 196.7 hectares in 2020-21, the government said on Monday. “As on July 19, 2021, the investments made by the public and private sector in the TNDIC and the UPDIC are Rs. 2,252.28 crore and Rs. 1,236.10 crore respectively,” Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.

The UPDIC has six identified nodes — Agra, Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Kanpur and Lucknow. Both the DICs are in their formative stages, the reply said. “In the TNDIC, Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), the nodal agency, has signed 22 MoUs with private/public industries, worth potential investments of Rs. 4,800 crore.” The U.P. Expressways Industrial Development Authority has signed 55 MoUs with private industries, worth potential investments of Rs. 7,449.33 crore.

27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC turns down plea of Gambhir foundation||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea by BJP MP Gautam Gambhir’s foundation to stay the proceedings in a case of illegal procurement and distribution of COVID-19 drugs, saying individuals cannot monopolise the distribution of drugs during the pandemic when medicines were scarce. “People were going helter-skelter to procure drugs during the second wave. And then suddenly, one person started distributing drugs. This is not done,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud observed orally. Justice M.R. Shah, also on the Bench, objected to the submissions of the foundation’s lawyer, senior advocate Kailash Vasdev, that his client was working for people. Mr. Vasdev sought a stay of the proceedings initiated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. “We saw how the common man was suffering. Individuals cannot distribute drugs... Do you want us to go into the merits of this case?” Justice Shah asked the lawyer. The Bench advised the foundation to move the Delhi High Court for relief. Mr. Vasdev withdrew the case. The Delhi government’s drug controller had accused the foundation in the High Court of unauthorisedly stocking, procuring and distributing the Fabiflu medicine for COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-turns-down-plea-of-gambhir-foundation/article35551713.ece

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar was hearing an appeal filed against the rejection of his temporary bail application. The appeal mentions, “On August 15, 2020, Mr. Gadling’s mother died at Nagpur. After two days, he filed a temporary bail plea before the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai. He sought temporary bail for three weeks to perform the last rites of his mother as his brother could not attend them because he was COVID-19 positive. However, on September 11, 2020, the petition got rejected. He then moved the High Court in appeal, challenging the order of rejection.” National Investigation Agency’s counsel Sandesh Patil opposed the plea, saying he is not required to attend the funeral anymore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-hc-reserves-order-in-gadlings-plea-for-temporary-bail/article35551551.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Yediyurappa bows out, suspense over new CM||“The party’s parliamentary board will discuss the issue,” Arun Singh, in-charge of party affairs, Karnataka, said in New Delhi. The resignation of Mr. Yediyurappa could well draw the curtains on his nearly five decades of political career, during which he rose from the ranks of the RSS in Shikaripura in the Malnad district of Shivamogga to become the Chief Minister of the State. In this period he emerged as the tallest leader in the Lingayat community, which is among the biggest voter base for the saffron party in Karnataka. At what turned out to be his farewell speech in Vidhana Soudha to mark the second anniversary, an emotional Mr. Yediyurappa broke down as he recounted his work in building the party in the State and took not so veiled potshots at the party high command. He recalled his bumpy ride into the office during his fourth term and obliquely expressed his displeasure towards high command for forcing his hands. “I had to face a lot of challenges when I formed the government. The high command did not allow me to form the Cabinet for one and a half months despite floods and rains in Karnataka. I had to roam around [the State] like a mad man. Last one and a half years I had to fight COVID-19,” he said. Mr. Yediyurappa breaking down has now become a subject of political debate. While state Congress chief D. K. Shivakumar said the tears only indicated he was forced to step down, a prominent Lingayat seer Dingaleshwara Swamy of Balehosur Math said Mr. Yediyurappa’s tears would “ruin” the BJP in the days to come. Amid speculation over his replacement in the last 15 days, Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp had also tried to grab the Lingayat political optics as Lingayat-Veerashaiva seers and the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha rallying behind the leader, urging BJP not to dislodge him. On his part, Mr. Yediyurappa thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J.P. Nadda “for having allowed me to be in office for two years despite the rule of no power for those above 75 years.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yediyurappa-bows-out-suspense-over-new-cm/article35551536.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||6 policemen killed in Assam-Mizoram row||Mizoram’s Home Minister Lalchamliana said the chain of events began at 11.30 a.m. when some 200 Assam police personnel came to the Vairengte autorickshaw stand and “forcibly” closed the duty post of the Central Reserve Police Force and a section of Mizoram police personnel. The CRPF has been deployed as a neutral force on disputed stretches along the 164.6 km Assam-Mizoram border. “The Assam police damaged some Mizoram-bound vehicles on the national highway and committed arson. They did not listen to our officials who tried to resolve the issue and lobbed tear gas shells and grenades and started firing around 4.30 p.m.,” Mr. Lalchamliana said. “Mizoram police responded spontaneously by firing back. The aggression of the Assam police started the unfortunate development. The Assam police withdrew and the duty post was handed back to the CRPF after the Union Home Minister spoke to the Chief Ministers of both the States,” he added. Officials in Assam, however, blamed the Mizoram police for the flare-up. They also blamed people in civilian clothes armed with telescopic rifles. “They opened fire,” Cachar Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli said when asked what triggered the trouble. Assam officials also said their team had gone to evict encroachers from Mizoram. Assam claims Mizos have been squatting in areas some one to three kilometres from the inter-State border while Mizoram groups claim Assam has pushed its people 10-12 km inside its territory. As the border clash intensified on Monday, Dr. Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga traded charges on Twitter while tagging the Prime Minister’s Office and Mr. Shah. Pointing out that the vehicle of a Mizoram-bound couple was attacked, Mr. Zoramthanga sought Mr. Shah’s intervention. “How are you going to justify such violent acts?” he asked. However, Dr. Sarma told his Mizoram counterpart that his officials were being threatened with violence until they “withdraw from our post”. In another tweet, he said he spoke to Mr. Zoramthanga. “I have reiterated that Assam will maintain status quo and peace between the borders of our State. I have expressed my willingness to visit Aizawl and discuss these issues if need be.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6-policemen-killed-in-assam-mizoram-row/article35551548.ece

While no date for a Legislature Party meeting has been set, it will be sooner rather than later. Sources said while many names were floating as a replacement for Mr. Yediyurappa, the priority would be to choose from among the existing MLAs. Only if a consensus after consulting MLAs was not arrived at, would someone other than an MLA be considered. “We are to face elections after two years, and the leadership should be such that would run for the next five years, that is why Yediyurappa (78) has been asked to resign,” said a source. Among the Lingayat contenders, sources said, were Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, Mines Minister Murgesh Nirani and Home and Law Minister Basavaraj Bommai. If the consensus is not reached around these candidates then another candidate would be proposed. If a Brahmin candidate is to be brought forward, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and Speaker Vishweshwara Kageri’s names are popping up in discussions. In any scenario, the situation in Karnataka has become a little more complex than in other States where the BJP effected a change in leader, as Mr. Yediyurappa mustered a show of support from Lingayat Mutts and leaders and also declared his intention to stay active in politics. Later on Monday night, RSS leaders had a meeting in Bengaluru, which was attended by party national organisational general secretary B.L. Santosh among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/action-shifts-to-delhi-on-karnataka-cm-options/article35551549.ece
27 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Plea to acquire papers of Bhagat Singh’s trial||Chaman Lal, a former senate member of Panjab University and honorary adviser, Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre, Delhi, has urged the Punjab government to take up the issue of acquiring files relating to the court cases of Bhagat Singh now at the Punjab Archives in Anarkali tomb in Lahore. Professor Lal, in a letter to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh through Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, said, “Scholars, including me, visiting this archive have not been shown these files. However, situation has now changed for the better. On March 23, 2018, for the first time Lahore archives held a month-long exhibition of more than 200 items from the Bhagat Singh files. Professor Lal said it was a happy situation that Pakistan was preserving the legacy of Bhagat Singh. “But this is as much a fact that Bhagat Singh enjoys a special status in Indian Punjab as their most beloved revolutionary hero. So, it is most appropriate that, the records of his case files are kept in one of important archives of Indian Punjab,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-to-acquire-papers-of-bhagat-singhs-trial/article35551552.ece

27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. sets 2 conditions for House to function||A discussion on the Pegasus cyberattack in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, followed by a judicial probe, are the pre-conditions for Parliament to function, the Congress said on Monday. This was to counter criticism from the government, which accused the Opposition of disrupting Parliament for the sixth day in a row in the ongoing monsoon session. ‘Legitimate demands’ Congress Chief Whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh said in a tweet, “The entire Opposition is united. 1. Have a discussion on Pegasus snooping issue in presence of the Prime Minister or Home Minister. 2. Announce a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry into the scandal.” Parliament, he stated, was not functioning because the government was not agreeing to these legitimate demands. Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien, concurring with Mr. Ramesh, said this was exactly what was needed. “We need this. Not green tea at Piyush Goyal’s office. Thanks. But no thanks,” he tweeted, quoting Mr. Ramesh’s tweet. JPC demand Since the Pegasus issue broke, Congress leaders, including Rajya Sabha member Shakti Sinh Gohil, had demanded an investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). The party, though now has finalised its stand that a JPC will be ineffective since it has limited powers. Senior party leader Shashi Tharoor, who also heads the Standing Committee on Information Technology, which has had a few meetings on Pegasus, had said that merely summoning witnesses would not suffice in investigating a case of this magnitude. On Monday, he tweeted: “Opposition's demands have been clear from the beginning: discuss #PegasusProject w/ Prime Minister or Home Minister present, not just IT Minister, & conduct a Supreme Court-monitored investigation to establish the facts. Then Parliament can do the rest of its work undisturbed!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-sets-2-conditions-for-parliament-to-function/article35551565.ece

A discussion is not allowed inside the House and the farmers are being suppressed. That’s why we are here and they [the Centre] will have to take back these black laws,” he said. The tractor ride was also aimed at highlighting the cause of the farmers’ unions that have been protesting just outside the Delhi borders for over eight months now. “These laws are aimed at helping only two or three industrialists. The entire country knows for who and whom these laws have been brought about. These laws are not for the benefit of farmers and that is why they have to be withdrawn,” Mr. Gandhi said. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and others were detained by the police outside Parliament and taken to the Mandir Marg police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-gandhi-drives-tractor-to-parliament/article35551769.ece

27 July 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Acid attack offenders don’t deserve mercy: HC||Observing that imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the court responds to society’s cry for justice in acid attack cases, the High Court of Karnataka declined to reduce the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on a man convicted for throwing acid on a girl for refusing to marry him against wishes of her family members. While upholding the life sentence imposed by a sessions court in Davangere in 2016 on Mahesha of Honnali taluk in Davangere district, the High Court directed payment of Rs. 9.75 lakh to the victim girl out of the Rs. 10 lakh fine imposed on the convict. “Justice demands that the courts should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime,” observed a Division Bench comprising Justice B. Veerappa and Justice V. Srishananda, while declining to reduce the sentence imposed by the trial court. ‘Consider age’ Also, the High Court directed the Davangere District Legal Services Authority to consider the young age of the victim, who was a teacher, corrosive injuries suffered by her and the huge amount spent for plastic surgery, while deciding the quantum of compensation for her under the victims’ compensation scheme. “The accused might have felt that his ego had been hurt by such a denial to the proposal marriage or he might have suffered a sense of exaggeration... or might have been guided by the idea that revenge is the sweetest thing that one can be wedded to when there is no response to the unrequited love; but, whatever may be the situation, the criminal act, by no stretch of imagination, deserves any leniency or mercy,” the Bench observed. Heartless crime “The case in hand is an example of an uncivilized and heartless crime committed by the accused. It is completely unacceptable that concept of leniency or mercy can be conceived of in such a crime...,” the Bench said while pointing out that trial court was right in imposing life imprisonment based on evidence and damage caused to the victim girl and a minor boy, who was accompanying her when acid attack took place in January 2014. Noticing an increase of instances of accident attacks on women in India over the last decade, the Bench observed that “a crime of this nature does not deserve any kind of clemency. Emphatically one has to say that it is individually as well as collectively intolerable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/acid-attack-offenders-dont-deserve-mercy-hc/article35551728.ece
27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Study finds heavy metals in ambient air in city||The presence of heavy metals, including nickel, manganese and silica, in the ambient air has technically put Chennai in the ‘unhealthy’ category. Air samples were collected in 20 locations across the city during February-March 2021. Out of that, samples in 19 locations contained heavy metals, according to Health Energy Initiative (India). “These heavy metals cause irreversible damage to human beings. And they are not confined to any particular geographical area but present in 19 of the locations that we sampled,” said Vishvaja Sambath, a city-based air pollution researcher. From the samples analysed at a U.S. lab, it was found that the presence of silica, manganese and nickel were beyond the annual average level of exposure. Citizens living in the 19 locations, where levels of silica were high, are at risk of chronic lung problems. Manganese is a known neurotoxin that affects the neuro-behavioral functions and prolonged exposure can cause permanent brain damage. Manganese exceeded safe limits in 12 sampling locations. Nickel, which is a potent carcinogen can also affect the respiratory and immune systems in the body. The group has been conducting air pollution studies since 2017, except for 2020 due to the pandemic. “We chose to take samples during different seasons and found that there was not much change in the parameters except for some places in north Chennai,” she said. The study, which primarily studied PM 2.5 levels (particulate matter below 2.5 micron size), found that it exceeded the Indian 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM 2.5 of 60 microgram/cubic metre by 1.1 to 3.8 times. Locations sampled included neighbourhoods that are industrial, commercial and residential in nature. The results of the study indicate that there is a need to develop a local-level air quality monitoring and plan to control air pollution and protect public health. Tirusulam (near airport), Parry’s corner and Vyasarpadi (near fishing harbour) had levels of PM 2.5 between 228 and 176 microgram/cubic metre, which is categorised as ‘very unhealthy’ by the U.S. EPA. “People living around these sampling locations seem to have lost their right to clean air. Despite the pandemic, every single breath of polluted air taken by people in these regions has an added danger of lowering their lung capacity and eventually reducing their life expectancy. This can increase the hospital admissions, emergency visits and fatalities which can be identified only through a health assessment in the areas concerned,” said Gajapriya, an air pollution researcher with Healthy Energy Initiative (India).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/study-finds-heavy-metals-in-ambient-air-in-city/article35551879.ece
27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||OPS, EPS meet Prime Minister in Delhi||The talk of accommodating former interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala in the AIADMK was revived again as party co-ordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Monday. While there was no word from the Prime Minister’s side on what transpired at the meeting that reportedly lasted 20 minutes, Mr. Palaniswami told reporters that he and Mr. Panneerselvam only raised issues of importance to Tamil Nadu. The former Chief Minister did not reply to a question whether the matter of accommodating Ms. Sasikala was discussed. This was the first meeting of the two leaders with the Prime Minister after their party lost power in the State. In the first part of the meeting, a delegation of MPs and MLAs along with the two leaders met Mr. Modi for about 10 minutes. Among them were M. Thambi Durai, A. Navaneethakrishnan, P. Ravindhranath, S.P. Velumani, Manoj Pandian and Thalavai Sundaram. The meeting was preceded by a couple of events over the past week. On Sunday evening in New Delhi, there was a meeting between Mr. Panneerselvam and L. Murugan, Union Minister of State for Fisheries and Information and Broadcasting. Five days ago, in Chennai, K. Annamalai, the newly appointed president of the BJP in Tamil Nadu, had one-on-one meetings with the two AIADMK leaders separately. While some sources in the AIADMK said a rapprochement with Ms. Sasikala had been hinted at by the BJP, a senior leader of the national party said his party did not pursue the matter after Mr. Palaniswami expressed reservations about taking her back into the party, and what Mr. Modi wanted was that the AIADMK should become stronger than what it was. In the run-up to the Assembly election, the BJP tried to rope in the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), led by Ms. Sasikala’s nephew T.T.V. Dhinakaran, into the AIADMK-led front, but the AIADMK and Mr. Palaniswami, in particular, opposed the idea. In the last two months, Ms. Sasikala, who declared in early March that she would step aside from politics, has been reaching out to her supporters through telephone conversations, audio clips of which are being released by her office almost daily. She has also given interviews to a few media organisations and sought to portray herself as a seasoned politician. Mr. Dhinakaran, whose AMMK tasted defeat in the election, on Sunday announced that he would lead a demonstration in Thanjavur on August 6 on the Mekedatu issue. Among the issues raised by Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam while meeting Mr. Modi were the adverse consequences of granting permission for Karnataka to go ahead with the Mekedatu dam project, the need for supplying sufficient doses of COVID-19 vaccine to the State, the importance of expeditious linking of the Godavari with the Cauvery and the problems faced by fishermen in the Palk Strait region. Asked whether the exit of several functionaries and former Ministers from the party was a sign of their dissatisfaction with the leadership, Mr. Palaniswami said those who did not get the nomination in the Assembly election had left the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ops-eps-meet-prime-minister-in-delhi/article35551856.ece
27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A threat to residents from above||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) is taking steps to bring the overhead power lines underground. But residents in various parts of the city grumble about the growing menace of overhead cables of telecom and satellite companies. Thousands of interior streets are crowded with iron poles, and their skyline is cluttered with overhanging cables. The menace has become more pronounced in the past few years: several telecom and cable television networks have put up poles to carry their cables. These are in addition to the Chennai Corporation’s street-light poles used for carrying cables. The overhanging cables are an eyesore. They also pose a threat to residents. T. Abishek, a resident of R.A. Puram, points out that with work-from-home being the norm, telecom cables have become indispensable for Internet link. But the civic body has to regulate the installation of the poles and work out rules for the maintenance of cables that hang on avenue trees or street-light poles at most places. Residents say the streets are already filled with overhead electricity lines and street-light poles and the installation of huge poles for carrying the telecom cables is adding to their problems because they are being erected without any regard for safety. A senior Corporation official says the power to grant permission (‘right of way’) for laying underground Internet cables and television cables on arterial roads rests with the Bus Route Department. And the Electricity Department will have to grant permission for stringing the cables overground through street-light poles. The civic body grants the permission after collecting the annual track rent for using the street-light poles. The rent for 2021-22 is Rs. 63,236 per kilometre, he says. The Corporation has been able to collect the track rent from the telecom companies. But it is unable to regularise the stand-alone poles put up by the fiber-optic cable operators because the State government is yet to fix the annual rent. ‘File is pending’ The civic body recommended Rs. 4,500 in annual rent for the erection of a single pole by fiber-optic cable companies on February 3 last year. A senior official says the regularisation scheme for the poles installed by the fiber-optic cable operators could not be implemented as the Information Technology Department “advised a one-time payment of Rs. 3,000 for a single pole”, which was not acceptable. The file was kept pending. The delay in the regularisation of the poles was also causing the civic body a huge revenue loss, the official says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-threat-to-residents-from-above/article35551890.ece
27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on to bring back idols: ADGP||Additional Director-General of Police (ADGP), Idol Wing CID, Abhay Kumar Singh on Monday said efforts are on to bring back antique idols of Tamil Nadu temples which have been traced to foreign countries by the special wing. Steps were being taken through Indian missions in the respective countries. Following credible information on illegal export of stolen antiquities from the city, the officers of the special wing conducted a search at Selva Exports in Aravamudhan Garden, Kilpauk, on Monday. They seized two stone idols, a metal idol and a painting of Lord Krishna from inside wooden articles on the first floor of the premises. The police registered a first information report and arrested B. Subramaniam, 58. Mr. Singh told presspersons that since last year, the special wing had booked 17 cases and arrested 18 persons, besides seizing 40 stolen idols across the State and 74 idols from Jean Paul Rajarathinam in Puducherry. Three idols of Sri Rama, Lakshmana and Sita, which originally belonged to Rajagopalaswami temple, Anandamangalam, were recovered from a museum in London and they were restored to the temple. Steps have been taken to bring back an idol of Hanuman traced to Singapore, he said. Explaining the progress in a few cases, the ADGP said a case was registered at the Kadayam police station in connection with theft of five idols from Sri Narasimmanathar temple, Alwarkurichi, in 1985. Two of those idols, namely Adhikara Nandhi and Kangala Nathar, were recovered through the Antiquities Trafficking Unit, New York. Soon, they would be brought back to the State, he said. Similarly, six idols, which went missing from Sri Vishwanathar temple, Vikrapandiam, Thiruthuraipoondi taluk, and another six idols, which went missing from Veera Cholapuram temple, Kallakurichi district, were traced in the U.S. and efforts were on to bring them back, he said. Mr. Singh said during the lockdown, Col. Matthew Bogdanos, Assistant District Attorney, New York, appeared through video conference before the special court in Kumbakonam in connection with the examination of a witness in a case registered in 2008.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-to-bring-back-idols-adgp/article35552194.ece

27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No traffic diversion in Porur due to Metro Rail work for now||Commuters travelling through areas like Poonamallee and Porur can heave a sigh of relief as there is no immediate plan for traffic diversion although Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) has started the phase II project work. The phase II project will have three corridors of Poonamallee-Light House, Madhavaram-Shollinganallur and Madhavaram-SIPCOT, running to 118.9 km. CMRL started work on the Poonamallee-Porur stretch a few weeks ago. The contract to build the elevated stretch on the Poonamallee-Porur line has been awarded to Hindustan Construction Company Ltd. (HCC), in a joint venture with KEC International Ltd. (KEC), and the test piling work started recently. Barricades have been placed at various points near Poonamallee bypass, Porur bypass and a few other locations as well for this work. Many commuters were apprehensive that the project work would shrink the road space, necessitating long detours in their daily commute. CMRL officials are in talks with contractors and are in the process of finalising the traffic diversion plan, which could take some time. “There was also a meeting with the traffic police in this regard. We have informed that we will finalise and submit it to them soon. After a discussion with them, the final plan will be given to the public before implementation. We will try to make it hassle-free for the public as far as possible. Commuters need not worry about traffic diversion for the next three months, at least,” an official said. For now, barricades have been put up in the middle of the road and since it is a wide road between Poonamallee and Porur, it will be possible to manage traffic congestion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-traffic-diversion-in-porur-due-to-metro-rail-work-for-now/article35551874.ece
27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police unearth job racket in Tiruvallur; man arrested for cheating 18 persons||The Tiruvallur District Cyber Crime Wing has arrested a 25-year-old accused for allegedly cheating job aspirants. The name of the arrested man was given A. Aravindhan of Thirupachur colony. The police said G. Parthasarathy, 21, of Nadukuthagai village in Thirunindravur, had appeared for written exam for the post of police constable in 2020 and approached Aravindhan, who claimed to be working in the department. A few days later, Aravindhan called Mr. Parthasarathy and informed him that he was not selected. He told the candidate that he could get him the job of an office assistant in the District Police Office and collected Rs. 4,67,207 through mobile wallet and other transactions. He issued fake appointment orders to Mr. Parthasarathy. The crime came to light when Mr. Parthasarathy sent the appointment order to the Superintendent of Police, Tiruvallur, through WhatsApp helpline number 6379904848. Immediately, a Cyber Crime Wing team arrested Aravindhan. A cellphone, two SIM cards and incriminating documents were seized from him. Police investigation revealed that Aravindhan applied to the Home Guards in 2020 and used to visit the District Police Office regularly when he reportedly developed acquaintance with some staff in the department. He misused their name and cheated 10 persons with the promise of a job in the Police Department and eight more with the promise of getting placements in Hyundai. He was remanded in judicial custody. Further investigation is on. The role of the staff working at the District Police Office in connivance with the suspect is being probed. Superintendent of Police V. Varun Kumar advised job aspirants to try on merit and not fall prey to fraudulent calls and messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-unearth-job-racket-in-tiruvallur-man-arrested-for-cheating-18-persons/article35551882.ece

27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Master plan ready for Kapaleeswarar Temple||Finding parking space near Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore is a nightmare for devotees. But this is set to change soon with the temple authorities planning to pull down old buildings adjacent to the temple and build a multi-level parking lot. On ordinary days, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the temple used to get around 1,500 visitors on weekdays and 5,000 on weekends. Now, the numbers are higher on the weekends. As part of a master plan, a wedding hall, a library, a nandhavanam (garden with flowering plants/trees to be used in the temple), prasadham stall and a ‘kaarya mandapam’, where rituals relating to last rites can be conducted, will be constructed. “All this will come up within walking distance of the temple and there will be access from the temple to this space. At present, 68 houses are occupied, including by 38 retired staff of the temple. Those who have been paying rent would be provided alternative accommodation. A staff quarters will come up on this property,” said Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Minister P.K. Sekarbabu, who inspected the temple recently. The work is expected to commence in six months. “The construction will be done keeping in mind the aesthetics of the temple. We want to provide proper facilities to devotees who visit the temple, which is the wish of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin as well,” he said. Wedding hall Kapaleeswarar temple is one of the few temples in the city where marriage certificates are issued. During pre-pandemic times, at least four weddings used to be held daily. Now, there are applications for seven to eight weddings a day. It has two mandapams — one a fully air-conditioned facility on Greames Road and another near Venkatesa Agraharam. In the second phase, on 30 grounds of land near Venkatesa Agraharam, retrieved from a private school in the area, a play ground would be built. In the third phase, on land in front of the the MRTS Thirumayilai station, a small shopping complex and parking lot has been planned. Mr. Sekarbabu said tenders would be called for experts to study the temple tank. “It got a clay base in 2004 but over the last few years, the tank’s capacity to retain water seems to have dwindled. We want to restore that now.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/master-plan-ready-for-kapaleeswarar-temple/article35551881.ece
27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||2.1 lakh govt. school teachers to be taught basic computer skills||More than 2.1 lakh government school teachers across Tamil Nadu will be taught basic computer skills over the next month. They will be trained in handling computers and mobile devices, working on the platforms meant for virtual classes, searching for educational resources, using hi-tech labs at schools and using the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) portal. As part of the exercise, organised by the Tamil Nadu State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) and Samagra Shiksha, a five-day programme for 420 master trainers began on Monday. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said 2.1 lakh teachers would be trained for a month in August. “This is an extremely important module as teachers have to take classes online on account of the pandemic. The training will help them in the task, besides enabling schools and teachers to effectively use and build the EMIS portal as a database,” he said. The master trainers are from a joint resource pool that includes teachers chosen for their experience and knowledge of information and communications technology. The five-day training programme will have four components. Training schedule The first day of training will cover the basics of computers, while the focus would be on how to effectively use the infrastructure at the hi-tech labs on the second day. A session on the basics of using the Internet will be held on the third day and a session will deal with how to use the EMIS portal the next day. The fifth day will be dedicated to a revision of all the components. “Apart from the training sessions, time has been set aside every day for assessment... Every teacher will be given a unique identity for logging in and completing the assessment. It will help the Department plan any subsequent training programme,” said R. Sudhan, State Project Director, Samagra Shiksha. He said 6,029 high and higher secondary government schools had hi-tech labs. Training in using the EMIS portal would help teachers understand various components of school, student and teacher data, Mr. Sudhan added.

27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vendor licensing to regulate sale of tobacco products in Tamil Nadu yet to take off||A plan to introduce tobacco vendor licensing to regulate sale of products is yet to take off in the State. The Health Department, in coordination with the Police and Local Administration Departments, has launched a two-month drive to check the sale of banned, chewable tobacco products, such as gutka and pan masala. In this line, the need to implement vendor licensing is being reiterated as it was the next step in tobacco control. An earlier proposal to roll out a licensing mechanism for vendors is yet to materialise. Recently, the Tamil Nadu People’s Forum for Tobacco Control submitted a memorandum to the Health Minister to bring in vendor licensing among a number of other demands. This was a licensing formulation for shopkeepers through which they would not be permitted to sell any product other than tobacco. This would reduce the availability and accessibility of tobacco products and also limit the density of tobacco retailers in the community, schools, colleges, parks and hospitals, the forum said. S. Cyril Alexander, State convenor of the forum, said vendor licensing would help in sustaining the enforcement measures. It would cover sections 4 (prohibition of smoking in a public place), 5 (prohibition of advertisement of cigarettes and other tobacco products) and 6 (prohibition of sale to a person below the age of 18) under Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. “Vendor licensing is nothing new. It is in force in a number of countries, such as Hungary, Australia, Canada, Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam and some States in the country such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam and West Bengal. This is the next move in tobacco control. It will cut children’s access to tobacco products. There will be no shops selling tobacco near schools as licences will not be given. Smoking in public places will be reduced to a large extent,” he said. V. Surendran, associate professor and head of Psycho-Oncology and Resource Centre for Tobacco Control, Cancer Institute (WIA), said, a few years ago, they had submitted a representation to the State government requesting to introduce vendor licensing. “Any shops that sell candy, biscuits or any child-related product cannot sell tobacco. The only issue is that the government should decide who will issue the license — the Public Health Department or Municipal Administration. If brought in, it will be a great achievement,” he said. “We are technically exploring the possibilities of vendor licensing and cessation services in view of the potential benefits expected out of this in tobacco control activities,” T. S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vendor-licensing-to-regulate-sale-of-tobacco-products-in-tamil-nadu-yet-to-take-off/article35551869.ece

27 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Decision on OBC quota in AIQ medical seats in a week, Centre tells HC||The Centre on Monday told the Madras High Court that a decision on implementing reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in medical and dental seats contributed to the all-India quota (AIQ) by the State government-run medical and dental colleges every year was at an advanced stage and it would be spelt out within a week. Appearing before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged the court to grant him a week’s time so that he would be in a better position to report progress on the issue. The judges accepted his plea and directed the High Court Registry to list the matter again on August 3. The submission was made during the hearing of a contempt of court petition filed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), through senior counsel P. Wilson, against top Central officials for the delay in implementing the reservation for OBCs despite a specific order passed by the court on July 27, 2020, to implement it from academic year 2021-22. Passing interim orders on the contempt petition last week, the first Division Bench, led by the Chief Justice, made it clear that the Centre could not delay the implementation indefinitely.

27 July 2021||KOTTAYAM,TAMIL NADU||Row over Kerala church’s scheme for large families||Even as the controversy over the measures to curb population growth in Uttar Pradesh continues to rage, a Catholic Church diocese in central Kerala has announced a welfare scheme for families with five or more children. The initiative, launched by the Family Apostolate of the Pala diocese under the Syro-Malabar Church, seeks to offer a monthly financial assistance of Rs. 1,500 to couples married after 2000 and have five or more children. Women delivering their fourth child onward will be given free delivery care at a hospital run by the Church while children born as the fourth or subsequent in a family will be given scholarships at an engineering college run by the Church. The scheme, announced as part of the Year of the Family celebrations by the Church, has gone viral on social media and evoked mixed reactions from the public. Confirming its authenticity, Fr. Joseph Kuttiankal, Director of the Family Apostolate, said the scheme was planned as an assistance to large families, especially in the post COVID-19 scenario. “This is being planned as a minimal assistance to the families that might be finding it hard to make both ends meet. The actual number of families who are eligible for the benefits are yet to be ascertained,” he said. As to why the year 2000 was set as the lower ceiling, Fr. Kuttiankal said such young families would be the most vulnerable as they mostly had only one earning member. “The elder children of couples who started a family before that year must have completed their education and begun contributing to the family,” he said. The announcement of the scheme, meanwhile, has evoked some sharp reactions from the public with a section of them terming it as a deliberate attempt to raise the community’s strength. The Church authorities, however, have sought to dismiss the allegations and held that they did not want to respond to such irresponsible remarks. Two-child norm The proposals in the draft Kerala Women’s Code Bill 2011, which sought to penalise families violating the two-child norm, had created a furore in the State with various religious organisations, including the Catholic Church, protesting against it. In 2019, a pastoral letter issued by the Changanassery Archdiocese suggested that the share of the Christian population in Kerala had dwindled over the years, creating an “alarming situation” for the community. “During the formation of Kerala, Christians were the second-largest community. But now, the community is only 18.38% of the State’s total population,” read the letter, issued by Archbishop Mar Joseph Perumthottam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/row-over-kerala-churchs-scheme-for-large-families/article35551735.ece

27 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco must take steps for a turnaround, says HC||Taking cognisance of a report released by the Ministry of Power that showed Tamilnadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) was ranked 39 among 41 power companies or boards that were rated, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that this was a wake-up call to the Corporation. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that unless some effective steps were taken to achieve a financial turnaround, reduce the power purchase cost and bring down the dependency on government subsidy, it was only going to move from bad to worse. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by the AMRL Hitech City that has set up the multi product Special Economic Zone in Tirunelveli district measuring about 2,518 acres. It entered into a lease agreement with (Tangedco) for establishing an electrical substation. A portion of land was given for establishing an electrical substation in order to cater to power demand of factories in the Nanguneri SEZ. A route map was also approved for transmission lines. Since the lines would cut across the company property, deviation of the line was sought. The petitioner company was asked to pay the defrayment cost for deviation in approved line otherwise the lines would be laid as per the approved route. The petitioner company filed the petition challenging this communication. The court said the matter involved an area of expertise and it was completely ill-equipped to deal with the same. The court directed the petitioner to make a representation to the Ministry concerned and find a solution to the issue.

27 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Residents against mobile phone tower in their area||A section of residents of Teachers Colony in Pillar Salai near Nagamalai Pudukkottai staged a demonstration in front of Madurai Collectorate here on Monday against setting up of a mobile phone tower on their area. The protesters, who submitted a petition to the Collector, said that children, elders and pregnant women were among the vulnerable sections of people who reside in the area. A home for elderly patients and a tailoring institute were also present in the area. Work was under way for setting up a mobile phone tower of a private telecom company on Thaninayagam Adigal Street of Pillar Salai. The residents said that they had initially thought that the ongoing work was for constructing an underground car parking and only later they realised that it was for setting up a mobile phone tower. If the mobile phone tower came up, it would pose danger to the residents in its vicinity. It would lead to several health complications. Hence, the authorities must intervene and stop the construction of the mobile phone tower in their area, the protesters said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-against-mobile-phone-tower-in-their-area/article35552013.ece
27 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC asks college to pay costs to facilitate refund of fees||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to immediately initiate penalty proceedings against Immanuel Arasar JJ College of Engineering in Kanniyakumari district for admitting students without getting approval. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh directed the institution to pay a cost of Rs. 25 lakh to the Director / Commissioner of Technical Education. The money shall be utilised to refund the fee of those students who underwent Mechanical Engineering diploma course from 2015-2018. The judge took into account that there were several litigations in the past regarding the issue and observed that it was brought to the notice of the court that out of 120 students who were admitted to the course during the academic year 2015-2016 without any approval, nearly 85 students managed to complete the course by virtue of interim orders. ‘Technique’ The future of nearly 85 students hangs in the balance. Obviously, submissions were made before the court by projecting the interests of 85 students. This technique is adopted by many institutions, which admit students , without authorisation, make them write examinations through interim orders and ultimately plead before the court by using students as a shield. The judge said that the Supreme Court had made it clear that once the admissions were made without any approval, the courts should not regularise or sanctify such admissions due to misplaced sympathy and the courts must impose heavy costs against such institutions. In the present case, the college continued to commit illegality, the judge said. This is a case where the students have been admitted without any approval from AICTE and hence the very course conducted by the institution is non-est in the eye of law. Unfortunately the students had undergone the course and the court can only sympathise with the students and no relief can be granted to those students as claimed by them, the judge said. The judge dismised the petitions filed by the institution and students who sought course completion certificates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/college-told-to-pay-costs-to-facilitate-refund-of-fees/article35551997.ece

27 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai hospital comes up with an angioplasty solution||Doctors of Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre, Madurai, has recently treated a 50-year-old man using a 45 Mhz ultrasound catheter for producing high-definition images of plaques blocking blood flow in arteries to ensure better outcome of an angioplasty. A press release from the hospital said that the procedure was done using High-Definition Intravascular Ultrasound Catheter and Instant Flow Reserve to assess the abnormal narrowing of the blood vessel, and its effect on limiting the blood supply. The patient had undergone an angioplasty a month back. But it was found that his left anterior descending artery had two blocks. He needed another angioplasty to restore blood flow to his heart. However, the ability of his heart to withstand even this minimally invasive procedure was uncertain. In this circumstance, the medical team headed by R. Sivakumar, Senior Consultant – Interventional Cardiology, used both IVCS and iFR to more accurately analyse the form of plaques, the quantum of the plaque burden, and to map the exact area (minimal luminal area) in the artery that required stent support. Based on this, the team designed a highly optimal angioplasty solution, eliminating all unnecessary stress to the heart. Dr. Sivakumar said that IVUC and iFR helped them understand the significance of the lesion as well as the mapping of coronary physiology prior to deciding on the plan of the surgical intervention. “For the angioplasty, we took not only the cosmetic aspects but also the hemodynamics factors into account, and thus increased the effectiveness of the intervention,” he said. The treatment helped the patient to recover completely, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madurai-hospital-comes-up-with-an-angioplasty-solution/article35552203.ece

He added that they did not receive any feed or other goods from Kerala to farms here.

27 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry will get second City Livelihood Centre soon||The territorial administration is all set to roll out the second City Livelihood Centre (CLC) in Puducherry, under the Centrally-sponsored National Urban Livelihoods Mission, with the aim of improving the quality of life of the urban poor by enhancing their skills, and providing them access to the market. After the launch of the CLC by the Oulgaret Municipality in February 2020, the Pondicherry Municipality initiated the process to establish another under the public private partnership mode. Commissioner of Pondicherry Municipality S. Sivakumar said a request for the proposal had been floated to select an agency to establish a permanent service providing centre, offering a gamut of fee-based services to residents by engaging the local urban poor. “The basic idea is to offer various services to residents by roping in skilled manpower available among the poor in urban localities. The entrusted agency will conduct a survey and create a database of electricians, plumbers, painters, caterers, etc. The call centre at the CLC will function as a link between residents and the selected urban service providers,” he said. “The centre will also act as a training hub for self-help groups (SHGs) and market their products,” he told The Hindu . G. Saravanan, assistant project officer, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission, Oulgaret Municipality, said since the civic body started the initiative a few days before the first wave of COVID-19, the survey to identify the service providers could not be completed. “The local body had already collected a database of 45 service providers, including plumbers, and their vetting by law enforcement agencies had been completed. The survey would be launched again along to identify potential housemaids and home nurses to support elderly people,” he said, adding, “The CLC rose to the occasion during the pandemic by using the services of SHGs in the municipality.” “A few were given training to manufacture sanitisers with the help of faculty from the chemistry department of Kanchi Mamunivar Centre for Postgraduate Studies. Around 1,000 litres of sanitiser was produced and supplied to healthcare professionals and frontline workers,” Mr. Saravanan said. “The CLC has opened a call centre, and used SHG members to home deliver grocery and food items,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-will-get-second-city-livelihood-centre-soon/article35552288.ece

27 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Students body seeks govt. intervention against engineering college’s exam rules||The Puducherry Union Territory Students’ Federation has sought the intervention of the Lt. Governor and the Chief Minister in issuing directions to the management of Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College (SMVEC) to withdraw the “irregular” conditions it set for students to take the semester examinations online. In a memorandum, with copies marked to the Chief Secretary and other officials, the federation stated that while the government had been considerate in heeding the COVID-related concerns of students and permitted the online mode for exams, the SMVEC had set additional stipulations that were not only ultra vires of powers of an autonomous institution, but also compromised the safety of the students. C.S. Saminathan, president of the federation, and Tr. Gayathri Srikanth, founder, Iraivi Kuzumam, pointed out that though the stipulations set by the university for the online mode were simple and did not even require full-time connectivity, the SMVEC management had issued orders directing students to give an undertaking to install an app, and submit that he/she be monitored throughout. Students are being insisted upon to mobilise laptops/desktops with a camera, microphone, uninterrupted internet — broadband or 4G hotspot — and over three hours of back-up power. Non-existent powers “Though the SMVEC is an autonomous college, the principal cannot arrogate themselves against students’ rights and welfare during the pandemic, with non-existent powers, and add more conditions to those stipulated by the UGC or those that are at variance with the AICTE guidelines or notifications,” the memorandum read. Compelling students to arrange next-to-impossible infrastructure at such short notice was tantamount to denying many the opportunity to take the examination and a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, the federation said. Other unauthorised conditions set by the college include stipulating that the student take the examination in a secluded room, which was impossible for students living in small apartments or hostels, and precluding any claim for re-valuation or special examination in the event of any obstacle in taking the online proctored exam. The student federation urged authorities to direct the college to withdraw the stipulations that were against the welfare of students during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-body-seeks-govt-intervention-against-engineering-colleges-exam-rules/article35552285.ece
27 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Lt. Governor briefed about local body poll preparations||State Election Commissioner Roy P. Thomas called on Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan at Raj Nivas on Monday to discuss the measures in place for the conduct of the local body elections later this year.  A press note from Raj Nivas said Mr. Thomas briefed the Lt. Governor on the preparations under way for the local body elections in compliance with the orders of the Supreme Court. The local body polls were last held in 2006 in the Union Territory, with the term of office of the then elected municipalities, commune and village panchayats ending in 2011. Since then, the process has been in a state of deep freeze with the ward delimitation exercise hit by delays. The Supreme Court had intervened repeatedly, through a series of orders, to put back on track the conduct of the local body elections. In 2018, the court directed the Union Territory to hold the panchayat and municipal elections expeditiously, and most recently in an order dated March 5, directed the government and the State Election Commission to complete the delimitation exercise within two months. The elections are to be conducted within four months of completing the delimitation exercise, the top court directed. Meanwhile, DMK (North) convener S.P. Sivakumar has urged the SEC to foolproof the voter list by conducting door-to-door verification, through booth-level officers, for the local body elections, scheduled to be held shortly. In a letter to the State Election Commissioner, Mr. Sivakumar flagged several discrepancies in the present voter list, including illegal entry of voters residing in other constituencies and a number of voters residing in the same address. If the poll panel wanted to hold the local body elections in a fair and free manner, the voter list had to be corrected, Mr. Sivakumar said. The Union Territory has five municipalities — two in Puducherry and one each in Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam enclaves. Besides, there are 10 commune panchayats (five each in Puducherry and Karaikal), in addition to 98 village panchayats across the four regions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lt-governor-briefed-about-local-body-poll-preparations/article35552284.ece

27 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Upgrade facilities at additional Primary Healthcare Centre’||The tribal population living atop Pachamalai Hills look for upgrade of facilities at the additional Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) located in Top Sengattupatti. The Public Works Department has a role to play, they say. The additional PHC is attached to the Uppiliyapuram PHC, where the doctors refer most patients, even for something as basic as a blood test. The trip takes over an hour and requires travelling through hilly terrain and 11 hairpin bends. "The additional PHC has facilities for childbirth and emergency treatment. But, for blood tests and other care, the patient is referred to Uppiliyapuram," a resident said. Speaking to The Hindu , Sampath Kumar, Medical Officer Incharge, said that the PHC had the capacity to admit three patients. However, all three beds were in the labour ward. "Regardless of what treatment the patient requires, they need to be admitted in the labour ward as it is only there that we have space for beds. More often than not, it is occupied by pregnant women in labour, in which case the other patients suffer," he said. The additional PHC at Top Sengattupatti PHC also serves villages on the hills under the jurisdiction of Salem district. "Those under jurisdiction of Salem administration would otherwise have to travel an additional 22 kilometres to a PHC pertaining in their district," Dr. Sampath said. In the second wave of the pandemic that has hit villages, the importance of these centres has multiplied manifold. PHCs have been central to Covid-19 management in the state and are crucial in testing and vaccinating people. However, the PHC did not have a separate place to admit or isolate patients either. There is no lab technician or equipment either. "Even for simple tests such as blood cell count, which is important to detect and treat dengue, the patient has to travel to Uppiliyapuram," a staff member said. "We have submitted a written proposal to the Public Works Department to construct a separate maternity block for us. Within the block, we can have a laboratory, labour room, wards, and also a chamber for the medical officer and for the Village Health Nurses," he said. The building currently being utilised as a labour ward has six rooms, with attached bathrooms. Three of the six rooms are being used as rooms by staff. "The staff do not have quarters but the amount to be deducted as rent continues to be deducted from their salaries," a staff of the PHC said. Staff quarters for the nurses, pharmacist and health inspector lies in a dilapidated condition and has been in disuse for over five years. Amid the COVID-19 lockdown, the staff members had to travel from Thuraiyur to Top Sengattupatti on their own as even bus services were suspended. "Had there been adequate facilities, we would have stayed here and served the people," another staff nurse said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upgrade-facilities-at-additional-primary-healthcare-centre/article35551989.ece

27 July 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers send petition to PM against Mekedatu Dam project||Demonstrating in front of the Collectorate here on Monday, members of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam submitted a petition to be forwarded to the Prime Minister through the Collector in protest against the Karnataka government’s move to construct a dam at Mekedatu and seeking removal of the check-dam constructed across the Markandeya that brings water to the South Pennai river. The petitioners, led by former MLA and district president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam S.V. Krishnan and district secretary P. Perumbadaiyar, said the inter-State river of Cauvery, which was feeding the ranches of 12 tail-end districts of Tamil Nadu and quenching the thirst of several crore population in a few more districts also, should not be treated as the property of Karnataka though it originated in the State. Even as sharing of the Cauvery water was still an issue with Karnataka for Tamil Nadu, as the neighboruing State had not honoured any of the verdicts relating to it in letter and in spirit, the Karnataka government had announced in the State Assembly that it would construct a new dam across the river at Mekedatu in the guise of resolving drinking water crisis in Bengaluru. “The Karnataka government has not released the share of Tamil Nadu this year even after an order from Cauvery Water Management Authority causing irrigation and drinking water crisis in our State. The kuruvai paddy cultivated in the delta region is withering due to water scarcity. If this new dam is built across the Cauvery, it will further worsen the situation. Karnataka, which should respect the riparian rights of Tamil Nadu farmers, is adamant in going ahead with the proposed Mekedatu dam as it has submitted an application seeking permission for commencing the construction The Union gGovernment should reject the plea,” said Mr. Perumbadaiyar. The protesting farmers also said the Karnataka government had constructed a 164-foot-tall and 1,410 foot-long check-dam across the Markandeya that brought water to the South Pennai river, which would wipe out farming operations in eight districts of Tamil Nadu and a few parts of Puducherry. “When the Karnataka government tried to construct the dam across the Markandeya in 2007, the Tamil Nadu government petitioned the Supreme Court that directed the Union government in 2019 to form a Central committee to resolve the inter-State river water sharing issue. Even as the formation of the Central committee got delayed, the Karnataka government has built the check-dam. Hence, this illegal structure should be removed,” said Mr. Perimbadaiyar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-send-petition-to-pm-against-mekedatu-dam-project/article35552338.ece

27 July 2021||TIRUPATTUR,TAMIL NADU||Bus services resume in Tirupattur district||The State-run buses used to be the lifeline of S. Kathirvel, a 52-year-old coconut farmer in Vellakuttai village near Vaniyambadi in Tirupattur district, all these years. He travelled to Chennai by bus, at least once a week, with bags of coconuts from his grove to sell at the Koyambedu market. On other days, he would send the coconuts to Chennai for the traders to pick up at Koyambedu. Life was easy for Mr. Kathirvel until a-year-and-a-half ago. After the pandemic, his business nose-dived with most of his produce ending up at the common market in Vaniyambadi, around 10 km from his village, for throwaway prices. On Monday, the State Transport Department resumed three bus services to Chennai and Hosur via Vellakuttai village on a daily basis, giving him hope. “Cheap transportation, especially through State-run buses, is key to reviving local business and the economy. In that context, bus services were resumed to connect small villages with big towns and cities,” said Amar Kushwaha, District Collector, Tirupattur. Bus services resumed on these routes from Monday: Ambur-Vellakuttai (12 trips), Alangayam-Hosur via Vellakuttai (4 trips) and Tirupattur-Chennai via Alangayam and Vellakuttai (2 trips) every day. After the pandemic, farmers at Vellakuttai had to travel 9 km to reach Alangayam bus terminus to go to places like Vaniyambadi, Ambur, Tirupattur, Hosur, Arcot and Chennai.

On April 11, a burglary attempt was made at two farmhouses in Manjakollai Pudur village on the Yelagiri Hills, one of which belongs to the Minister.

27 July 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||DMK’s contention on Jaya varsity untenable, says C.Ve. Shanmugam||Former Minister and secretary of Villupuram AIADMK North district C.Ve. Shanmugam on Monday dubbed as untenable and fictitious the contention of the DMK government that it had no funds to spend for the Jayalalithaa University, proposed by the previous AIADMK government in Villupuram. Leading a demonstration at the Old Bus Stand, he said when there was enough provision for starting a Rs. 200 crore library in the name of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in Madurai, how could there be a shortage of funds for the university named after Jayalalithaa. Mr. Shanmugam said the intention of the DMK government was to ensure that no university came up in the name of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The previous AIADMK regime had initiated the necessary logistics to start the institution. The Governor’s approval was also obtained on February 25 and as a follow-up, a Vice-Chancellor was also appointed for the institution. But the model code of conduct that was enforced in the context of the election stood in the way, he said. Mr. Shanmugam pointed out that merely because the university was named after Jayalalithaa, the DMK was scuttling its implementation. “If you do not want the name of Jayalalithaa, you (DMK government) could instead name it as Dr. Ambedkar University. Our intention is that higher education should not suffer a setback. I would only appeal to the government not to sabotage the establishment of the university,” he said. Mr. Shanmugam said that the Minister for Higher Education K. Ponmudi should know quite well that higher education should be promoted in an educationally backward region like Villupuram. The government should not have a short-sighted approach on the issue, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmks-stand-on-jayalalithaa-varsity-untenable/article35551981.ece

27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP proposes hospital in every Assembly constituency||As the pandemic exposed how the city was inadequately prepared to tackle it, given the lack of quality public healthcare, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has proposed to upgrade health infrastructure. It has submitted a proposal for Rs. 1,242.27 crore to the State government. Apart from setting up PHCs in 57 wards that don’t have one, the BBMP has also proposed setting up a hospital in every Assembly constituency in the city. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said there were just 141 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and seven referral hospitals that mainly cater to maternity and women’s health issues under the civic body. As per the proposal submitted, the tentative cost to set up 57 new PHCs will come up to Rs. 115.5 crore and 12 new secondary healthcare facilities at Rs. 349 crore. That apart, four new multi-speciality hospitals are being planned at Rs. 238.2 crore, while paediatric care facilities will be created in the seven referral hospitals at Rs. 10.61 crore. Physical Triage Centres have been proposed in 31 PHCs at Rs. 1.63 crore. The capital cost for infrastructure upgrade, including one-time equipment installation of Rs. 115.7 crore, will come up to Rs. 714.94 crore. Sources in the BBMP’s Health Department stated that of the four new multi-speciality hospitals proposed, a 300-bed hospital is under construction at Yeshwantpur. A tertiary facility of 300-bed capacity is being planned at Shantinagar Maternity Home in east zone at a cost of Rs. 65 crore. The location for two other facilities have been finalised at M.C. Layout, Vijayanagar, in west zone (250 beds at Rs. 55 crore), and Bannerghatta Road, Puttenahalli in Bommanahalli zone (300 beds at Rs. 65 crore). Once established, along with 1,000 beds in Victoria Hospital and 600 beds in Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, there will be 2,750 beds available. “The proposal is before the Urban Development Department and Finance Department.

27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mixed response registered on day one of on-campus classes||There was mixed response to classes resuming on college campuses on Monday after a span of four months. Some colleges saw over 70% student attendance, while some registered less than 40%. Most college managements expected high attendance on Monday as majority of students had been vaccinated and were more confident of attending classes. However, they anticipate better attendance later this week as many students from other States found it difficult to book return tickets on short notice. The colleges were closed in March due to the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Many universities like Bengaluru Central University welcomed students back to campus with flowers, masks, and sanitisers. Producing vaccination certificates and consent letters from parents was mandatory to enter the college or university premises. Many students who did not carry their vaccination certificates were asked to come back on Tuesday. C.B. Annapurnamma, principal, National College, Basavanagudi, said they saw 70% attendance. “Students are more confident this time as they have had at least one dose of vaccination,” she said. She added that colleges were focusing on practicals first so that students are able to comprehend key concepts. However, many students said that the attendance will improve only when hostels reopen. “Students outside Bengaluru are not attending classes as hostels remain closed. Some have to travel around 200 km a day to attend classes. As this is not feasible, they have skipped classes,” said a final-year B.A. student of Bangalore University. Many colleges are conducting classes in shifts as they have to follow the SOPs and maintain physical distance. As the examinations for final-semester students started from Monday at Visvesvaraya Technological University, the attendance of other semester students for offline classes was around 38%. K.R. Venugopal, Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University, said average attendance in 85 of their colleges surveyed was 52%. The university has 300 colleges affiliated to it. “We have told colleges to focus on laboratory work for science students as it is crucial that students get hands-on experience,” he said. He added that there would be a delay in foreign students and students from other parts of the country attending classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mixed-response-registered-on-day-one-of-on-campus-classes/article35551819.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No question of retirement from politics, says Yediyurappa||The future role of B.S. Yediyurappa has been a subject of intense speculation in party circles, even as the veteran leader tried to chart out its contours himself in his articulations on Monday. Minutes after he tendered his resignation to the Governor, Mr. Yediyurappa ruled out retirement from active politics and said he would work to bring the BJP to power in the next elections. “I will stand with the people of the State and the workers of the party,” he said. On Sunday, the 78-year-old said he would work to strengthen the party for the next 10-15 years, indicating that he would remain active in the State’s politics for the foreseeable future. His close associates continue to see him as a factor in the 2023 Assembly and 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “His command over the Veerashaiva-Lingayat vote bank was demonstrated over the past week,” said a leader associated with him. A different role Sources in the party said the highcommand was keen to pack him off in a gubernatorial position as his continued stay in the State might end up as a thorn in the flesh of the new Chief Minister. “The party has seen how he tried to dominate the government under the chief ministership of D.V. Sadananda Gowda and Jagadish Shettar. So it is keen on working out a clearly defined role for him,” a senior party functionary said. ’  However, when asked on Monday whether he would accept a Governor’s role, Mr. Yediyurappa ruled it out. “Years ago, I had an offer to become a Union Minister from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which I turned down to stay in the State. Now also, I will remain in Karnataka and work for the party,” he said. “He is a people’s person and is not comfortable in any language other than Kannada. If sent as a Governor, it might be difficult for him. Given hisage, he also prefers to stay with his family and his people,” one of his close associates said. “He is not the first person to go through this phase in their political life. Being an elderly statesman, he will likely lead a semi-active political life like H.D. Deve Gowda andS.M. Krishna from now on.”  Years ago, I had an offer to become a Union Minister from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which I turned down to stay in the State. Now also, I will remain in Karnataka b.s. yediyurappa, outgoing Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/theres-no-question-of-retirement-from-politics-says-yediyurappa/article35551831.ece

The class XII student of National Public School, Koramangala, who represented India at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), brought laurels to the country by bagging the gold medal. Due to the pandemic, the competition this year was held remotely from St. Petersburg, Russia, last Monday and Tuesday and the medal announcement was made on Saturday night at the closing ceremony.

On his experience at the IMO this year, Pranjal said: “The paper was extremely difficult, especially on day one of the competition.” IMO tests four different skill sets - algebra, combinatorics, number theory, and geometry – in a mixed bag of questions over two days. The top 8% scorers are awarded the gold medal. “Becoming an IMO champ is possible only if you have a deep love for the subject and are ready to invest in exploring it,” Pranjal said. He acknowledged the constant support and encouragement received from his parents and school. Pranjal’s immediate goal is to pursue mathematics in higher studies and in the long term, he may pursue algorithms or computer science.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/city-student-bags-gold-at-international-math-olympiad/article35551812.ece

27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No clarity on Vijayendra’s future||One of the key concerns of B.S. Yediyurappa during his exit as Chief Minister was reportedly the future of his son B.Y. Vijayendra, whom he is keen on grooming as his political successor. However, the BJP high command has not given any concrete assurance to the father-son duo, party sources said. While Mr. Vijayendra had been camped in New Delhi for the past three days lobbying hard, reportedly to be anointed one of the Deputy Chief Ministers in the new government, the high command is unlikely to do so, sources said. A senior part leader alleged that though Mr. Vijayendra had shown promise with his election management in K.R. Pet and Sira, he had done “much damage” to the party and its government’s image with allegations of interference and corruption being levelled against him. Moreover, in a party that makes opposition to dynastic politics one of its main planks, he has to come up the hard way, another senior functionary argued. Mr. Yediyurappa’s elder son B.Y. Raghavendra is already a two-time MP from Shivamogga, they point out. To send out a message, Mr. Vijayendra might not be accommodated immediately and would have to wait for his turn, some speculated. “If the party is generous, he may either be made a Minister in the new government or elevated as the party’s general secretary in the State in the near future, but not immediately,” a senior leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-clarity-on-vijayendras-future/article35551835.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||In emotional speech, BSY recalls ‘trial by fire’||Outgoing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa may have insisted that he was exiting the post happily, but he was unable to hide his emotions during his speech at the Banquet Hall on Monday. For the most part of the last couple of days, as speculation was rife that the BJP central leadership was set to replace the ageing Lingayat leader, he had offered to resign if the high command chose to ask him, sending a subtle message to his followers and the party that he would not do so voluntarily. The 78-year-old leader, in a speech marking the second anniversary of his government — and one that also turned out to be a farewell speech — was unable to hold his emotions in and broke down more than once. He traced his political career and reminded everyone of his contributions to the party’s growth. He also made no bones about his uncomfortable relationship with the central leadership as he said that he had passed “trial by fire” at each stage. Recalling his bumpy ride into the office after an ‘Operation Kamala’ triggered the collapse of the Janata Dal(S)-Congress coalition, he obliquely expressed his displeasure towards the high command. “I had to face a lot of challenges and passed through trial by fire at each stage. The high command did not allow me to form the Cabinet for one and a half months despite floods and rains in Karnataka. I had to roam around [the State] like a madman. The COVID-19 pandemic threw a challenge in the last year and a half,” he said. In the same breath, during his over-20 minute speech, he also thanked the central leadership for making him Chief Minister, bypassing the informal 75-year age rule for party leaders. Later, at Raj Bhavan, where he formally tendered his resignation, he painstakingly responded to a volley of questions over the circumstances that led to his resignation and tried to convince everyone that the decision, which brings down the curtains down on his over four-decade-old political career, was to give a chance to a new person to helm the government. He, however, did not elaborate on the chronology of events that ultimately led to his ouster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/in-emotional-speech-bsy-recalls-trial-by-fire/article35551839.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police crack elderly woman’s murder case||The city rural railway police on Monday cracked the murder case of a 70-year-old woman who was allegedly strangled to death by her daughter-in-law and paramour. The accused dumped the body on the railway track on the outskirts of Tumakuru to make it look like an accidental death, the police said. They also dumped the severed head of the deceased in a tiles-laden truck, which was later found in Ilkal, 350 km away. Detailed investigations led the police to zero in on M.B. Balachandra, 42, a bus conductor from Tumakuru, and Latha, daughter-in-law of the deceased, and recovered gold valuables belonging to the deceased and Rs. 6,000 cash. ADGP railways Bhaskar Rao said the deceased, Ningamma, a resident of Tubinakere in Mandya district, was missing since July 19 after she went to her daughter-in-law’s house to collect her dues. The police recovered the highly mutilated body the next day, and got it identified by the deceased’s second son T.M. Satish from Tubinakere. According to the police, Latha, aged around 40, a resident of Kyathasandra, held a grudge against Ningamma and owed her Rs. 1.5 lakh and monthly maintenance from the property belonging to her husband. After the death of her husband, Latha was in a relationship with Balachandra and Ningamma objected to it. Unable to bear this, Latha hatched the plan with Balachandra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-crack-elderly-womans-murder-case/article35551809.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ED files complaint against man for defaming agency||Officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have alleged harassment by a person who was accusing them of corruption and filing a series of online complaints with Central agencies, after he was allegedly denied “reward prize” in return for a complaint he filed against a company involved in money laundering. Based on a complaint filed by Sheshadri M., sepoy attached to ED, the Wilson Garden Police last week registered a case against Rakesh Verma, charging him with intentional insult, forgery, and cheating. Mr. Sheshadri, in his complaint, said that Rakesh filed an online complaint in 2019 against a company alleging that it was involved in converting Rs. 53 crore black money into white. The complaint was forwarded to the I-T Department for further investigation. Meanwhile, Rakesh allegedly started demanding a reward for which the ED officials clarified that there was no such provision. He allegedly accessed information about the Director and Joint Director of the ED and filed complaints with Central agencies that they had taken a bribe from the accused company for not investigating the matter. “This is not only defaming the agency but also defaming and demoralising the officials,” Mr. Sheshadri said in his complaint. The police are trying to track down Rakesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ed-files-complaint-against-man-for-defaming-agency/article35551814.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Defectors jittery as BSY steps down as CM||With the exit of B.S. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister, the most jittery lot seemed to be the defectors who crossed over in order to topple the JD(S)-Congress coalition government and bring the BJP to power in the State. Many fear for their future under a new Chief Minister and are doubtful if they will be taken into the Cabinet again. Mr. Yediyurappa on Monday sought to reassure them that the party would take care of their future. “It is because of them that the party could come to power in the State. I am confident that the next Chief Minister will also honour the party’s commitment to them and provide them opportunities to serve the people of the State,” he said. The defectors had recently been huddled with Mr. Yediyurappa, concerned over their future, and he had assured them that their interests would not be hampered, sources said. Multiple defectors, such as K. Sudhakar, said they would abide by the party high command’s decision. However, party sources said that not all defectors — 11 of whom were Ministers till Monday morning — would be re-inducted into the State Cabinet. “Those who have joined the party cannot continue to claim they are a separate group whose terms are not negotiable at all. The party will likely carry out a review of their performance, both in terms of administration and political activity, and some are likely to be dropped,” a senior BJP functionary said. Sources said that of the 11, only six or seven would likely be made Minister again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/defectors-jittery-as-bsy-steps-down-as-cm/article35551832.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Will there be a purge of seniors from govt.?||With the resignation of B.S. Yediyurappa, BJP circles are abuzz about the possibility that the high command will go for a purge of senior Ministers and effect a “generation change” in the government. A recent audio clip, allegedly of BJP State chief Nalin Kumar Kateel — which he has vehemently denied — indicated that “seniors such as Jagadish Shettar and K.S. Eshwarappa and their teams” would be removed. “With ‘Operation Kamala’ and the induction of several defectors during both tenures, our cadre has been starved of opportunities. With several seniors occupying key positions in both governments, we have not been able to provide opportunities for other deserving youngsters. This is unsustainable. So it may not be just Yediyurappa retiring this time, but several others as well,” said a senior party functionary. Another leader said the party was looking at the next two decades and wanted to build a new leadership base in the State. “With the next Chief Minister likely to be in his or her 50s, many seniors may also find it embarrassing to work under them. A similar generation shift is under way in both the Congress and the JD(S), and we need to respond.” Only Govind Karjol may survive being axed as he is the only senior leader of stature from the key Dalit community, sources said. Mr. Eshwarappa had recently indicated that he would not be surprised if such a shift happened. “I am 72 years old now and if the party asks me to go, I will relinquish office gladly,” he had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-there-be-a-purge-of-seniors-from-govt/article35551833.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||JD(S) keeps silent on BJP’s ‘internal issue’||As outgoing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa made an emotional parting speech at a function held to mark his government’s second anniversary, he also recalled the bitter parting of the Bharatiya Janata Party with the Janata Dal (S) in 2007. “The father-son [former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy] came up with new conditions for transfer of power, denying me the Chief Minister’s role in 2007,” he said. While there is some speculation of a political realignment with the JD(S) and the BJP coming together, JD(S) leaders on Monday maintained silence on the change of guard by saying it was the BJP’s “ internal issue”. However, the JD(S) reacted sharply to Mr. Yediyurappa’s reference to 2007. “It was the then BJP leadership in Delhi that made the transition difficult. The reference was unnecessary,” party spokesperson T.A. Sharavana said. Different tune Party sources also pointed out that Mr. Yediyurappa had been changing his statements depending on the prevailing political climate. “He became Chief Minister in 2008 raising the plank. However, in 2013 when he floated Karnataka Janata Paksha, he went to town criticising the central leadership,” Mr. Sharavana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-keeps-silent-on-bjps-internal-issue/article35551840.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||DA restored||In what could bring cheer to more than 4 lakh State government employees, the outgoing government headed by B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday restored the hike in dearness allowance (DA) for employees. The DA had been frozen since May 2020. It increased the rate from 11.25 % to 21.5% of the base salary. In the middle of the pandemic when the revenues to the state’s coffers had dried up due to lockdown, the State government had in May 2020 frozen the DA for the period between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. The Order stated that the lifting of DA freeze would help pensioners, family pensioners and those in aided educational institutions also. It said that the revision of DA would be applicable on the basis of revised salaries of 2018, and the revision will be applicable from July 1, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/da-restored/article35551817.ece

27 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Decision delayed||With the political drama unfolding in the State, the decision on reopening of schools is likely to be delayed. The Department of Public Instruction submitted a report to the State government on Monday. Contrary to the interim report submitted by the committee formed by the government to look into the issue, the Commissioner for Public Instruction, who heads the committee, has said that higher classes (six and above) should reopen in the first or second week of August and the lower classes should start a week later. The committee had recommended that schools reopen from August 1, and that anganwadis and all classes should reopen from classes one to X. The committee had suggested that if there was a need to open schools in a phase-wise manner, they could reopen classes one to five first, followed by classes six and above a week later. Last week, S. Suresh Kumar, former Primary and Secondary Education Minister said that a decision would be taken on Monday or Tuesday. With the council of Ministers dissolved after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa submitted his resignation to the Governor, the process is likely to be delayed further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/delay-likely-in-decision-on-school-reopening/article35551821.ece

Several shopkeepers pulled down shutters, closing business for the day. “Mr. Yediyurappa has built the party in the State.

In some colleges, up to 50% of students turned up, while in a few colleges, particularly in rural areas, attendance was unimpressive. The Department of Collegiate Education has instructed the colleges to allow only vaccinated students attend the classes. The colleges and post-graduate centres were closed for students for nearly three months, following the pandemic. The department had conducted a vaccination drive to cover all students earlier this month. Some colleges in Hassan and Shivamogga districts have achieved 100% vaccination coverage among students. “There were a good number of students in the post-graduation centres of Kuvempu University at Shankaraghatta, Kadur and Chikkamagaluru”, said a press release issued by the university on Monday. The number of students could increase in the next two three days. The colleges and centres had taken enough safety measures to avoid the spread of the infection, the release said. The university staff had sanitised classrooms, hostels, laboratories and offices. So far 85% of students had been vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/attendance-in-rural-areas-of-hassan-poor/article35552236.ece

Yediyurappa has not gone down well with the religious heads of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, many of whom had, through a convention in Bengaluru, vociferously demanded his continuation as Chief Minister of Karnataka. Dingaleshwara Swami of Balehonnur Mutt, who coordinated the convention of seers in Bengaluru, told presspersons on Monday that he did not believe that Mr. Yediyurappa resigned on his own accord and was “forced” to do so. “For a person who spent his whole life building the party in the State, he has been given pain by the BJP on the day he completed two years in office. And the community is pained by this,” he said. Dingaleshwara Swami also said that while the Congress had earlier unsuccessfully tried to divide the Veerashaiva- Lingayat community, the Bharatiya Janata Party had divided the community in a systematic manner. “We strongly condemn the way Mr. Yediyurappahas been treated, the way he was made to shed tears.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/community-is-pained/article35551836.ece
27 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Colleges reopen, but not many students come||Various degree colleges in Dharwad district reopened on Monday as per the direction of the government. However, not many students attended classes on the opening day. The government has permitted offline classes as the number of COVID-19 cases has reduced drastically and also a large number of students have been vaccinated through special drives. There are 263 colleges affiliated to Karnatak University in Dharwad district and all of them reopened on Monday. These colleges have recorded 99% vaccination among students and on Monday, classes were held in accordance with COVID-19 protocol. According to university officials, hostel wardens have been instructed to keep the rooms clean after sanitisation for accommodation of students from other districts. As per the protocol, wearing face masks is compulsory and hand sanitisers have to be kept in front of every classroom. Strict instructions have also been given to the staff running the hostel mess to ensure that physical distancing is maintained while serving food. The hostel staff have also been directed to sanitise rooms twice every day, according to university authorities. As per the protocol, the classrooms have to be sanitised everyday before classes start and also after classes end. However, despite assurance by college authorities about strict adherence to COVID-19 protocol, many students seem to be hesitant in attending offline classes. Meanwhile, some of the private colleges are continuing with online classes along with offline classes for the benefit of students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/colleges-reopen-but-not-many-students-come/article35552043.ece
27 July 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||No loss, no gain for State, says Siddaramaiah||The resignation of B.S. Yediyurappa is no loss to Karnataka, but the arrival of a new BJP Chief Minister will bring no benefit either, said Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Monday. Speaking to reporters in Gadag, he said that unless the party itself was thrown out of power, there would be “no solace” for the State. In a tweet, Congress State in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “The stark reality is that Modiji habitually insults and compulsorily throws senior BJP leaders in the dustbin of history. Modiji’s record is replete with the painful and forcible retirements of Advaniji, M.M. Joshiji, Keshubhai Patelji, Shanta Kumarji, Yashwant Sinhaji and many others.” He called Mr. Yediyurappa the latest entrant to the “forced retirement club”. In Gokak, KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi said Mr. Yediyurappa had become the victim of a conspiracy, with hardcore right-wingers in the BJP “insulting a mass leader and forcing him to resign”. He added that he felt bad about the manner in which Mr. Yediyurappa was treated. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, meanwhile, said that the way Mr. Yediyurappa wept while announcing his resignation indicated his pain. He urged him to reveal what had caused this pain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-loss-no-gain-for-state-says-siddaramaiah/article35551828.ece

Chancellor of Sharnbasva University Dr. Sharnbaswappa Appa has said that the Energy Engineering course is at present offered by very few institutions of higher studies, including the Indian Institute of Technology, and a few private and conventional universities in the country. In North Karnataka, Sharnbasva University is the first higher education institution to introduce this new course. The degree will help one find wide opportunities in the job market. Emerging science Energy Engineering is considered in the academic circles as one of the most coveted and emerging branches in the contemporary era of technology and a melting pot of all engineering programmes. If energy is the future of humanity, energy engineers are the hopes of the future. With the imminent exhaustion of fossil fuels sooner or later, the world will face a severe crisis of non-availability of energy sources. Hence, the need for research and development in the field of alternative sources of energy has become inevitable, he added. One of the main features of the course is that it is multi-disciplinary covering all other engineering branches.

(KRCL) to restoring the Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur Tri-weekly Special between Mangaluru and Karwar, elected representatives, including Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Welfare Shobha Karandlaje, have shot off letters to the Railways seeking immediate resumption of services. Ms. Karandlaje has, in her letter to Minister of State for Railways Darshana Vikram Jardosh on Saturday, said that the train was partially cancelled in view of the pandemic. Now, people in the region have requested restoration of the services, she said urging the Ministry to instruct the concerned to take appropriate action. In his recent letter to the South Western Railway that owns the train, Uttara Kannada MP Anantkumar Hegde said that the train was the lifeline of coastal Karnataka, particularly his constituency. KRCL has already restored many trains between Madgaon and Roha following improvements in the COVID-19 situation. As such, the Karwar-Yeshwantpur Special too should be restored to avoid further inconvenience to the general public, he told the General Manager. It is not just MPs from Uttara Kannada and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru who wrote to the Railway Ministry seeking restoration of the train, MLAs from the region too have exerted pressure on the authorities.

Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar told The Hindu , “We wrote to NHAI to take this [building cross drains] up. Since we didn’t have any response, the corporation has taken it up to avoid public inconvenience.” The work started on Saturday and it is expected to be completed in a couple of days. NHAI’s Mangaluru Project Director Shishu Mohan during a recent DISHA meeting chaired by MP Nalin Kumar Kateel had brushed aside water-logging as a mere creation of the media. “There could be small water puddles here and there which are zoomed in by the media to show there is flooding,” he had told the meeting and blaming it for exaggerating the issue. Mr. Sridhar said that concrete drains with precast slabs are being constructed on both sides of Pumpwell Circle to drain rainwater and to avoid water stagnation. Perforated plates would be fixed atop the drains for speedy dispersal of water, he said. The Project Director had also spoken about clogging in the nearby major storm-water drain, which actually falls within the scope of the four-lane highway and the flyover. The corporation has also taken up work to remove silt from the drain near the flyover again, the commissioner said. Corporation Executive Engineer S. Ravishankar said that two cross drains, one on the city side and the other on Padil side, will be constructed to drain rainwater. Rainfall in the past two days has affected the work a little bit. The drains, covered by heavy duty perforated sheets, will open into the storm-water drain on the left side of the flyover, he said. The commissioner has instructed the Engineering Department to seek reimbursement of the cost incurred in constructing the drains from NHAI, Mr. Ravishankar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/after-nhai-apathy-corpn-starts-work-to-drain-water/article35552222.ece

27 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Colleges in Mysuru reopen||After a long gap, all first-grade colleges, constituent colleges of University of Mysore, and the post-graduate (PG) centres reopened on Monday for running physical classes that were suspended in view of the second wave of pandemic. The reopening marked the beginning of the new academic year since the government waited for giving its nod for the offline classes as it wanted to vaccinate the students as a safety precaution. The students who had received the first dose of vaccine were allowed to attend the classes as per the government instructions. The colleges had been asked to run the classes in accordance to the SOPs issued by the government and it was a must for students to follow the COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour. However, the government has not made it mandatory for the students to attend the offline classes. The online classes would be continued if students wished not to attend the physical classes. Many colleges reported an attendance of about 50 per cent on day one and the authorities said more students were expected to attend in the coming days although it’s not compulsory. Students were seen excited as they arrived to attend classes after nearly a gap of three-four months. They were happy to meet their friends and their teachers, who were so far teaching them in the online mode to ensure continuity in learning. University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar said the university has taken all measures for the safety of students and classes would be run as per the government guidelines. Registrar Shivappa said nearly 62 per cent of the students of colleges coming under the university’s jurisdiction had been vaccinated and nearly 50 per cent of the students attended classes on day one of the reopening. “We are also conducting vaccination drives at the health centres in Maharaja’s College and also on the Manasagangotri campus to facilitate students getting the jab. We had received nearly 600 doses of vaccine on Monday and the same was administered to the students,” he said. Prof. Shivappa said the University had mailed a questionnaire to the students seeking details on their vaccination before the reopening of the colleges. Most of them who responded to the mail said they have received the jabs. Those who haven’t received the shots so far can get it done at the earliest since vaccination is a must to attend the offline classes. The Registrar said more students were expected to report to physical classes once the hostels resume canteen facility from August 1. Seventeen hostels in the campus had to be shut after the COVID-19 cases went up here and the students returned to their hometowns. Before the reopening, the classrooms in colleges and universities were sanitised for the safety of students. At a college in Mysuru, students’ vaccination certificates were checked before they were allowed to enter the classes. Common contract The University is mulling over giving a common contract for running canteens in its 17 hostels, including 15 on Manasagangotri campus, instead of awarding hostel-wise contracts. Though the hostels had also been opened with the reopening of the colleges and the campus on Monday, mess facilities were yet to resume since the previous contracts had expired and the university had invited offers for running the canteens for the current academic year. Mr. Hemantha Kumar said the University was considering awarding a single contract for running the hostel canteens for better supervision. “We are hoping that the contracts would be awarded before August 1 since the mess facilities have to resume with students permitted to return to their respective hostels with the start of offline classes.” The University had temporarily closed down its in view of the second wave of COVID-19. The students and research scholars were asked to return to their hometowns as a precautionary measure against the spread of the virus and also because of the announcement of lockdown. The 17 hostels house nearly 4,000 students and research scholars. The University had earlier requested the government to ask the Department of Social Welfare to operate their hostels as well since some of its students had taken shelter in those hostels. The reopening would benefit them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/colleges-in-mysuru-reopen/article35552239.ece
27 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Fitness enthusiasts yet to return to gyms||Even though three weeks have lapsed since the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted in Mysuru, fitness enthusiasts are yet to return to gyms and fitness centres in the city in full measure. The gyms and fitness centres now see barely a fourth to a third of their regular customers walking into the premises. It is not clear whether fitness enthusiasts are waiting for the COVID-19 cases to decline further. But, the Mysuru Gym and Fitness Centre Owners’ Association in Mysuru has told patrons that they are following all safety measures including sanitising the equipment and maintaining social distance. “Many gyms have their trainers wear shields,” said Harsha, association president. According to him, the poor response has more to do with the lackadaisical approach of patrons to exercise. They may have been lulled into laziness due to the extended period of lockdown. With a view to encouraging people to return to the gyms and fitness centres, the association has launched an awareness campaign called “Fit Mysuru” on the lines of Fit India campaign launched by the Government of India. Body builder and actor Gym Ravi addressed a press conference convened by the association in Mysuru on Monday to drive home the importance of fitness to keep ailments at bay. “Our call to the public is to keep aside at least one hour a day for physical workout. Exercise is essential part of one’s lifestyle”, said Mr. Harsha. “There are around 250 gyms and fitness centres in Mysuru now. People need not go far away. They can go to facilities near to their houses in their neighbourhood”, he said. Pointing out that absence of exercise may lead to ailments such as diabetes, blood pressure and obesity, which are among the co-morbidities that pose a threat to the lives of COVID-19 patients, Mr. Harsha emphasised the need for people to become fit. When the gyms reopened after the first lockdown last year, he recalled that the response was similarly poor. “People started coming to gyms only after we organised awareness programmes and motivated them to return”, he said. Many gyms offer not only weight-lifting exercises, but also yoga, Zumba, aerobic exercises, and dance classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fitness-enthusiasts-yet-to-return-to-gyms/article35552047.ece
27 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Question mark over fate of heads of boards, corporations||A question mark has come to hang over the continuation of chairpersons for various boards and corporations in Mysuru region in their respective posts in the wake of B.S. Yediyurappa’s resignation as Chief Minister. Though a change of guard at the helm need not necessarily end the tenures of the chairpersons, the incumbents are hoping to continue in their posts on the premise that the BJP will continue to hold the reins of power. But, sources in the BJP said the chairpersons, who are appointed by the government, occupy the posts at the pleasure of the Chief Minister and their continuation will come under review by the new regime. Chairpersons of boards and corporations in Mysuru region include H.V. Rajeev, chairman of Mysuru Urban Development Authority; Jungle Lodges and Resorts chairman M. Appanna; chairman of Zoo Authority of Karnataka L.R. Mahadevaswamy; chairman of Karnataka Exhibition Authority Hemanth Kumar Gowda; chairman of D. Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation Kautilya Raghu; chairman of Paints and Varnishes Ltd. N.V. Phaneesh; and the recently appointed chairman to Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation Kapu Siddalingaswamy. Meanwhile, Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar has already thanked Mr. Yediyurappa and the BJP leadership for giving him an opportunity to serve the people of Mysuru as Minister in charge of the district. Soon after Mr. Yediyurappa’s resignation was accepted by Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot, who also dissolved the Council of Ministers headed by him, Mr. Somashekar issued a statement listing out his contribution to Mysuru. He said he considered it a pride to have been given the opportunity to have served Mysuru district, which has earned a unique place for itself in the field of culture and education. Meanwhile, a booklet on two years of the Yediyurappa government was brought out by the Department of Information and Public Relations in Mysuru on Monday. Mr. Somashekar released the booklet in the presence of BJP MLA L.

27 July 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||SHRC registers case against police for action on protesters||The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC) has registered a suo-moto case in connection with the police action against members of the Karimanal Ghanana Virudha Ekopana Samithi during a protest against mineral sand-mining at Thottappally last week. KSHRC member V.K. Beenakumari on Monday directed Alappuzha District Police Chief G. Jaidev to investigate the incident and submit a report in three weeks. The KSHRC registered the case after a video showing police personnel beating up former deputy tahsildar Bhadran went viral on social media. On July 23, protesters blocked trucks transporting mineral sand beyond the permissible limit from Thottappally to Chavara. It had resulted in caning by the police, in which seven members of the samithi and two police personnel were injured. The police’s use of excessive force has come under scrutiny with many condemning the actions. Suresh Kumar S., chairman of the samithi said the police excess had only increased their resolve. “The police unleashed violence without any provocation. They did it to spread fear and scuttle the ongoing protests. We are protesting for a cause and we will not back out. The government should stop mineral sand-mining at Thottappally,” Mr. Kumar said. Satyagraha The indefinite relay satyagraha being staged under the aegis of the samithi against mineral sand-mining completed 47 days on Monday. Meanwhile, a protest march was organised by the Janakeeya Samara Samithi at Thottappally on Monday. It was inaugurated by Congress leader M. Liju. The protesters who blocked trucks carrying mineral sand were arrested by the police. After a period of lull, removal and transportation of mineral-rich sand from Thottappally pozhi (sandbar at sea mouth) were resumed in May. The sand is being transported to the Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd (KMML) and Indian Rare Earths Ltd (IREL). Local residents, especially fishers who are up in arms, allege the government is engaged in large-scale mineral sand-mining in the disguise of flood mitigation. The coastline is prone to severe tidal wave attacks and coastal erosion. Residents fear the sand mining will prove detrimental to people living along the shorelines from Valiazheekal to Punnapra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-registers-case-against-police-for-action-on-protesters/article35552178.ece

A decision in this regard was taken by the District Disaster Management Authority, following the observation that many panchayats had failed to meet the COVID-19 testing target. District Collector Bhandari Swagat Ranveer Chand told The Hindu that as a result of that, the test positivity rate (TPR) was above 50% in many panchayats, and that they were under complete lockdown after they fell under the ‘D’ Category. “People are coming out for vaccination but are not interested in undergoing test. This has led to a spike in the number of cases,” the Collector observed. She said vaccination was administered to people who had received COVID negative certificate 15 days before the jab. The system was first implemented by Chemmanada panchayat, and it has been successful. Meanwhile, COVID-19 Special Officer P.B. Nooh said it had been decided to increase the number of testing centres from 42 to 72 in the district in a week.

27 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Short film by police turns heads||Social media manipulation has reached a point where even senior law enforcement officials are not being spared. Recently, a few persons were arrested on the charge of creating fake Facebook profiles of senior police officials like Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Vijay Sakhare and Inspector General (IG) P. Vijayan. Fake profiles The widespread creation of fake profiles coupled with the increasing instances of the honey trap where gullible victims are trapped over social media have prompted the State police to create awareness about the need to be circumspect while using social media. A short film directed and scripted by serving police personnel and uploaded over the social media handles of the police has drawn considerable attention attracting over four lakh views. The film is being made both in English and Malayalam. Impersonation “Impersonation through fake social media profiles by criminals has become quite rampant. The film sought to alert people against it,” said Mr. Vijayan. The film revolves around the investigation into the mysterious death of the fictitious character of a retired colonel who falls victim to a honey trap over social media. Presented by SPC  Presented by State Police Chief (SPC) Anil Kant, it has Mr. Vijayan as the creative head and K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural), as the project consultant. It is directed by Arun Viswam and scripted by Prasad Parappuram and Sarath Kovilakam. It has the voice-over by actor Prithviraj who has shared it on his Facebook page while the camera is donned by cinematographer Sujith Vasudev. Ernakulam “There have been quite a few cases of honey trap in Ernakulam rural alone in recent times. Many cases go unreported, as the victims are way too embarrassed to lodge a complaint considering their impact on their societal status and family lives. While social media presents an easy way to reach out to others, people should be discreet enough to establish the credibility of the ones they are interacting with. Strangers should not be entertained remains the bottom line,” said Mr. Karthik.

27 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Veterinary association ready to take up ABC programme||The Kerala chapter of the Indian Veterinary Association (IVA) has said it is willing to take up animal birth control (ABC) programme in the State after the High Court issued an order about a fortnight ago barring local self-government bodies from transferring funds to the Kudumbashree Mission, which had earlier been engaged by the State government to carry out the programme. The proposal assumes significance amidst allegations that the Thrikkakara municipality in Ernakulam district resorted to engaging dog-catchers to kill strays. The allegations are still under investigation. Municipal chairperson Ajitha Thankappan of the United Democratic Front (UDF) denied the allegations. She said she came to know of the alleged killing of dogs through news reports. But the Opposition has accused the ruling coalition of not following rules governing the control of stray population. V.K.P. Mohankumar, general secretary of IVA Kerala, said on Monday that the veterinary association was in the process of forming a society based in Thrissur to take up the ABC programme. Team of veterinarians The IVA is an association of professional veterinarians and there are around 4,000 members. The proposed society would have to set up facilities and form a team of veterinarians to take up the programme, he said. Ambili Purakkal, coordinator and founder member of Daya, an organisation engaged in animal welfare and rescue in Muvattupuzha, said the number of dogs on the streets of Kerala could be as high as one million. She said a survey of stray dogs in the country had shown that Kerala had around eight lakh stray dogs in 2019. Given the present conditions, it was safe to estimate that their numbers had increased to a million, she added. Ms. Purakkal also said that the number of distress calls for animal rescue had increased substantially over the past months, to five per day on an average. Animal Husbandry Department sources said the control of the street dog population was guided by the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001. The dogs are to be sterilised, vaccinated, and released in the areas from which they were picked up. Expertise  The rules also specify that ABC programmes should be handed over to establishments with expertise in the area, approved by the Animal Welfare Board. Kudumbashree did not qualify for the role, said Ms. Purakkal. The Kudumbashree Mission was launched for women empowerment and poverty eradication, she added. Animal Husbandry Department sources said the onus of controlling the stray population was on local bodies. A division bench of the High Court had ordered the stopping of fund transfers to Kudumbashree under the ABC programme till it was decided whether the Mission had the expertise and facilities to carry out the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/veterinary-association-ready-to-take-up-abc-programme/article35552142.ece
27 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Both INL factions claim majority support||A day after the split in the Indian National League (INL), the two party factions were busy ensuring the support of party workers and leaders. Following a scuffle between party workers in Kochi, leaders of the two factions expelled each other on Sunday and also claimed the support of party workers and leaders. Dismissing reports of split in the organisation, the faction led by general secretary Kasim Irrikur maintained that the “Koduvally gang” and State president A.P. Abdul Wahab had been ousted. The party national president expelled Mr. Wahab and seven others and there was no split in the party, he said. Party leaders and most of the workers from 13 districts, majority of the working committee and State committee members, and the frontal organisations were still with the party, Mr. Irrikur said. The faction also elected V. Hamza Haji as the working president. The party would focus on the ongoing membership campaign. Strengthening and restructuring of the organisation was the agenda before the party, a constituent of the Left Democratic Front, as the term of the party committees had expired, said Mr. Irrikur. Incidentally, Ports Minister Ahamed Devarkovil has aligned himself with the faction led by Mr. Irrikur . Workers’ support At the same time, Mr. Wahab said the majority of party workers had pledged their support to the faction led by him. In districts where some leaders aligned themselves with the other faction, the majority of workers had joined hands with the organisation, he claimed. Mr. Wahab, who expelled Mr. Irrikur from the post, said the all-India president’s decision to expel him from the party was unacceptable to him.

The convict was identified as Benny Yohannan, 58, of Kadavoor village. Additional District and Sessions Judge K. Soman found the accused guilty under Sections 7 (sexual assault) and 11 (sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and sentenced him to five years and three years respectively. The sentence will run concurrently. The verdict pertains to a case registered by the Pothanikkad police on March 27, 2018. The convict was engaged by parents for the conveyance of their children to and from the school. On the fateful day, the victim was the last person in the cab, taking advantage of which the convict sexually assaulted her, the police found. Though the convict pleaded leniency citing that he was a heart patient and had been engaged in the transportation of children for 15 years, the judge found that his case was not fit for invoking the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-gets-eight-years-ri-for-sexual-assault/article35552145.ece
27 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Answer sheets found, but questions remain||A bunch of 276 answer sheets of the third semester M.A. Sanskrit Sahitya exam of the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit has reportedly emerged as mysteriously as they had disappeared. On Monday, the Kalady police were told by the university officials that the missing answer scripts were found in the exam wing of the university. “We have not yet seen the papers and, therefore, cannot assure whether they are the ones that had gone missing. The answer papers will be examined in the presence of fingerprint experts and dog squad on Tuesday,” said P.A. Davis, Sub Inspector, Kalady. Though the answer scripts had gone missing months ago, the university authorities had lodged a petition only a week ago. The varsity Syndicate had suspended Sangamesan K.M., a senior faculty member of the department, holding him responsible for the loss. He had denied the charges, saying that the answer scripts and grade sheet were handed over to the head of the department on March 17. Prof. Sangamesan said the discovery of the answer scripts from the exam wing vindicated his position. “Their mysterious disappearance and sudden discovery along with my arbitrary suspension reek of conspiracy,” he said. Vice Chancellor P.K. Dharmarajan said it was yet to be confirmed whether the answer scripts found were the ones that had gone missing. He, however, refuted the allegations that the suspension was without due diligence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/answer-sheets-found-but-questions-remain/article35552133.ece

The deceased was identified as Raja Das, 28, of Assam. The police suspect that he might have been bludgeoned to death using a spade in the early hours of the day. Deepan Kumar Das, a co-worker from West Bengal and a potential suspect, has gone missing. It is suspected that the incident might have taken place between midnight and 6 a.m. The police have recovered the spade suspected to have been used for the crime. According to the police, the deceased and the suspect were the only outsiders working at the unit, and they used to stay together in a room. The rest of the employees were local women who happened to spot blood when they turned up for work. The blood trail led to the heap of sand and discovery of the body, which was found wrapped in a sack. The police said both the workers had been employed at the unit for nearly a month, and the employer had not observed anything suspicious about them. Surveillance The police have started surveillance of bus stations and railway stations to track down the suspect. Searches were held at Muvattupuzha and Perumbavoor.

Raghavan, Kozhikode MP, at an online meeting chaired by Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas gave hope that the decade-old proposal is finally starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. Questions, however, are being raised on entrusting the project again to Krishna Mohan Construction (KMC) Private Limited, the Hyderabad company which failed to go ahead with the project even though the company secured the contract in April 2018. As per the contract, the construction of the six-lane bypass should have started in August 2018 and the work completed in April 2020. But the company then failed to secure a bank guarantee of Rs. 85.50 crore. At the same time, Mumbai-based Welspun Enterprises Limited, which constructed the Delhi-Meerut Expressway in record time, was roped in to take over the project last month. On Thursday, Mr. Raghavan said that Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had assured him that the projects’ construction activities would begin before August 10. This was after Mr. Gadkari rang up M. Vikram Reddy, managing director of KMC, which had secured the contract for the widening of the 28-km corridor from Vengalam to Idimuzhikkal in 2018. Mr. Raghavan also attributed the three-year delay in executing the project to the financial crisis of the company and the inexperienced INKEL Limited, a public-private partnership company promoted by the State government, getting a stake in the Special Vehicle Project. Meanwhile, the meeting chaired by Mr. Riyas on Friday decided that KMC would not be allowed to take up the project if the company failed to begin the work by August 24. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) member (projects) E.K. Pandey and NHAI Kozhikode project director Nirmal Manohar Zade and District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy took part in the meeting.

The protest was organised in the wake of the pandemic-induced financial crisis in the sector, which kept more than 1,000 buses off the road in Kozhikode district alone. The protest was inaugurated by Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary P.M. Niyas. Bus operators complained that they were suffering huge loss due to the frequent cancellation of services because of pandemic restrictions. Organisation State secretary K. Radhakrishnan and district vice-president M.E. Gangadharan said the government should seriously consider the request to revise bus fare in the wake of rising fuel prices. Some of the bus owners spoke about the shrinking number of experienced labourers in the sector. Noticing the looming job crisis and poor daily returns, many of them have already moved in search of better jobs abroad and in other States. Bus operators also pointed out that they were yet to get any interim relief from the government to tide over the financial crisis. According to them, the government could have considered some ESI benefits or one-time financial allowance from the welfare fund to protect ailing workers in the sector. The district-level protest was organised by complying with COVID-19 protocol. Mr. Radhakrishnan presided over the protest meet. State leaders of the organisation P.K. Moosa, K.P. Mohammed, and P.P.

It was in April, 2019, that Shalu, a native of Kannur, was found strangled to death on UKS Road in the city. Though the local police handed over the case to the District Crime Branch after long months of probe, it failed to find any evidence in the case. A seven-second blurred visual from a closed circuit television camera was the only material that the police had secured. The police, however, failed to zero in on anyone using it. “We have been after this case and meeting senior police officers and government functionaries at various times. No one turned down our demand, but there was no progress in locating suspects,” said a transgender activist from the city. In the post-mortem report, doctors had confirmed that it was a case of strangulation. The purpose behind the crime, according to the preliminary investigation team, was to rob the woman.  Special team sought Meanwhile, Cicily George, a member of the District Transgender Justice Board, said it was the frequent transfer of senior police officers that hit the pace of probe. “Within the last two years, six officers who were part of the investigation were transferred from the city.

K.P.

A majority of building owners are reluctant to reduce the rent. Power bills and other charges too are proving to be a burden,” he said. Mr. Iqbal said the centres could conduct regular classes only for three months from January this year. “They are now functioning only through the online mode. Many aspirants are not keen on online classes,” he added. In a memorandum submitted to Minister for Education V. Sivankutty, the association demanded that the government allow coaching centres and science tuition centres to function in line with the pandemic protocol. The functionaries pointed out that the coaching centres were unable to hold online classes in time, as some schools were found conducting online classes at odd hours.

27 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Varsity makes last-ditch efforts for recognition||Calicut University authorities are making last-ditch efforts to restore University Grants Commission (UGC) recognition for its School of Distance Education (SDE), which has not been admitting new graduate and postgraduate students for over a year now. According to sources, one of the reasons for the SDE losing UGC approval was the lack of full-time faculty for the programme. The university had been managing with part-time teachers for preparing study materials and other works. Now, it has been decided to appoint teachers on a three-year contract. They will be relieved for a short period after three years and the contract will be renewed. Another issue was the lack of a full-time director. R. Sethunath, who was with the Department of Hindi, was recently appointed as the head of the SDE. Technical lapses It is learnt that the university officials had also made some technical lapses earlier while uploading the documents required to restore the recognition to the UGC website. Now, the sources said that they have been corrected. Mr. Sethunath told The Hindu on Monday that the UGC had given university time till July 31 to submit details for restoring its approval. He claimed that a clear picture might emerge within a week after that. Private registration The SDE right now has only those students who had registered before the recognition was lost. With thousands of students waiting to register for graduate and undergraduate courses under this stream, and the Sree Narayana Guru Open University also not getting UGC approval, the authorities recently decided to admit them under the private registration system. July 31 is the last date to apply. A Syndicate sub-committee that met last week also decided to allow those under private registration to shift to the SDE once the UGC approval is restored. However, with the certificates under the private registration system not recognised by many universities outside the State, students hope that the SDE recognition is restored as early as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/varsity-makes-last-ditch-efforts-for-sde-recognition/article35552109.ece

27 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Surendran still in heist case ambit: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday told the Assembly that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran still risked prosecution in the Kodakara hawala heist case. Mr. Vijayan was replying to an Opposition notice seeking leave for an adjournment motion, accusing the Left Democratic Front (LDF)government of saving BJP leaders from the hawala case as a quid pro quo for the Centre’s help in letting Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders of the hook in the UAE gold smuggling racket case. Speaker M.B. Rajesh rejected the United Democratic Front (UDF) demand, prompting Opposition legislators to walk out of the Assembly in protest. In his reply, the Chief Minister said the hawala agent, who reported the loss of the unaccounted money to the Kodakara police in April, had deposed that Mr. Surendran, BJP organising secretary M. Ganesh, and State office secretary Girishan Nair were in the know. The Kodakara case investigation was far from complete. The police had merely filed a preliminary chargesheet. They had named BJP leaders as witnesses in the case. At some stage, the BJP men would have to explain their knowledge of the crime. The police could prosecute some of them as suspects, he said. Mr. Vijayan asked the UDF not to draw a parallel between the Centre’s investigation in the UAE gold case and the State police probe into the Kodakara hawala heist. The UAE gold case probe was mere bluster. Central agencies had sent notices to State officials. They then leaked them to the press to accord a political advantage to the Congress and the BJP in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections.  Non-partisan probe In stark contrast, the Kerala Police probe in the hawala case was professional and politically non-partisan. The police found that the BJP had moved large sums of unaccounted money from Karnataka to Kerala to influence the outcome of the State elections illegally. They had reported the matter to the Election Commission of India, Enforcement Directorate, and the Income Tax Department. Mr. Vijayan said the Congress in Kerala had become the ideological echo chamber of the BJP. It trusted the CBI while the party’s national leadership damned the agency as a political tool of the ruling BJP. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said Mr. Vijayan waved a magic wand and made the case against Mr. Surendran disappear “just like that”. The rapprochement between the CPI(M) and the BJP had occurred when Mr. Vijayan called on “his dear friend and role model” Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The leaders had made a trade-off behind closed doors. “The Centre promised to ease off the gold case probe in return for the CM’s help to save the BJP leadership in Kerala from prosecution in the Kodakara case,” he said. Mr. Satheesan said within hours of Mr. Vijayan’s return to Kerala, the Centre transferred Customs Commissioner, Preventive, Sumit Kumar to a relatively less important post as GST Commissioner in Bhiwandi. “The BJP-CPI(M) nexus is clear,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/surendran-still-in-heist-case-ambit-cm/article35552154.ece
27 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||NCP sees plot to unsettle govt.||On Monday, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) strongly suggested that the allegation that Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran had attempted to shield an alleged sex offender from prosecution smacked of a well-entrenched conspiracy to unsettle the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. By some accounts, the Kollam police have also reportedly raised a similar doubt in a confidential communique to the State Police Chief. An official said the development could be the precursor of a more detailed probe. NCP State president P.C. Chacko said the party was yet to get to the bottom of the plot. An enquiry was on at multiple levels. Mr. Saseendran had intervened in the issue believing it to be essentially an intra-party dispute. However, the so-called survivor’s father, an NCP worker, had recorded the Minister’s telephone call and leaked it to the media. The worker also claimed that Mr. Saseendran had persuaded him to prevail on his daughter, a BJP activist, to withdraw her complaint against her alleged aggressor, an influential NCP leader at Kundara in Kollam. Many suspended For now, the NCP has suspended a slew of party members suspected to have some role or other in the scandal. They include NCP State working committee member Padmakaran, NCP trade union leader Rajeev, NCP Kundara block panchayat president Benedict, NCP State committee member Pradeep, NCP women’s wing State vice-president Hani Vitto and NCP youth wing district president Biju. The NCP felt Mr. Saseendran had done no wrong. However, it counselled him to be cautious in his public dealings in the future.  The NCP also formulated a code of conduct for party members. For one, regional and district leaders should make official demands to the Minister only via the State committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ncp-sees-plot-to-unsettle-govt/article35552156.ece
27 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Lists set to expire, PSC rank holders on the warpath again||With the validity of 493 rank lists of the Public Service Commission (PSC) set to expire on August 4, aspirants for various posts are yet again on the warpath demanding that the State government extend the validity further, at least till the publication of the next rank list. Prominent among the various rank holders’ associations leading the protests are the All Kerala Teachers’ Rank Holders Association, the Women Civil Police Officer Rank Holders’ Association, the Kerala Higher Secondary Teachers’ Union and the LGS Rank Holders’ Association, who are all now sitting on protest in front of the Secretariat. Assembly polls Ahead of the assembly elections earlier this year, the State Cabinet had on February 3 decided to extend the validity of rank lists by six months, till August 4. As the date of expiry of the list neared, demands were raised from various quarters for further extension, as the next rank list, after the completion of the newly introduced two phase examinations is expected to come into force only after a few months. However, earlier this week, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the assembly that the government saw no reason to extend the validity of PSC rank lists beyond August 4. Though aspirants on some of the rank lists like those of last grade services and LD clerk got the benefit of the six month extension, some others, especially on the Women CPO rank list, which expires in August, did not get the benefit of the same. “Unlike the other rank lists, which were in existence since 2018, our police rank lists have a validity of only one year. Only less than 600 persons out of the 2000 people in the rank list have got advice memo till now. In the past seven months, no new vacancies were reported for recruitment from the WCPO rank list. The government has not kept its promise to increase the strength of the women’s battalion. We did not get a single extension either. Our only wish is for the list to be extended by at least six months,” Parvathy, a rank holder who is protesting in front of the Secretariat, told The Hindu . Huge blow For the school teachers, the lack of recruitments in the pandemic year has come as a huge blow. According to the association office-bearers, a large percentage of the new vacancies are set aside for inter-district transfers. “Due to the pandemic, the creation of new divisions as per the increased student strength has not happened. This is despite the fact there has been a huge increase in student strength in government schools over the past few years. For us to get the benefit of these, our rank lists have to be extended at least by one academic year. Each subject has got a separate list, and only some of them got the benefit of the previous extension. Another of our demands is that advance recruitment from the existing list should be made to the posts which will fall vacant next year due to retirements,” says Aneesh, convenor of the Teachers’ Rank Holders Association. The aspirants in the Last Grade Rank list, which is one of the jumbo lists, began their protest on Monday. According to the protesters, only up to 6,000 recruitments have been made from the list till now, unlike the 11,000 recruitments from the previous list. Pandemic delays list The PSC and the government have been maintaining that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the holding of examinations in a time-bound manner, which has delayed the publication of a new rank list too. The government had also asked department heads to report vacancies held up by seniority disputes, court cases and absence of staff eligible for promotion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/psc-rank-holders-on-warpath-again/article35552115.ece

The Parishad, in a statement on Monday, sought the revamp of the panel alleging that two of the members in it have a background of ‘'anti-environmental’ activities. One member, who heads a Delhi-based institution which carries out environmental impact assessments, acts as consultant and advisor to real estate and quarry owners. Another member regularly appears in court on behalf of people involved in environment violations, Parishad president O. M. Sankaran and general secretary P. Gopakumar said. Neither of them are in any way connected to the fisheries sector, coastal regions or coastal zone management, the Parishad said, adding that it nonetheless welcomed the State Environment Department’s decision to form the committee to scrutinise the draft. However, except for the official member in it - the Additional Chief Secretary (Environment) - the composition of the panel cannot be justified, it added. The government should urgently revamp the panel by including experts on the fisheries sector and coastal ecosystems, the Parishad said. Scrutiny The panel is tasked with scrutinising the draft submitted by the National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) and submitting recommendations to address any flaws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kssp-seeks-revamp-of-czmp-study-panel/article35552314.ece

27 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State seeks speedy takeover of PSU||The State government has demanded the Union government to take steps to complete the proceedings for Kerala’s takeover of the Central public sector enterprise Instrumentation Limited, Palakkad, Industries Minister P. Rajeeve told the Assembly on Monday. The Minister sent a letter in this regard to the Union Minister of Corporate Affairs on July 9, to which a reply was still awaited. Asset valuation The delay is over a demand made by the Union government to include the cost of the land as well in the asset valuation. The State government did not approve of this demand as the land was provided by the State free-of-cost in 1964 for starting the company, and because the Union government had not raised such a demand initially. As per the initial valuation, the total asset cost was put at Rs. 43 crore. But, with the Union government raising disagreements over the amount due to some outstanding payments to be made to the company, a re-valuation was done in March 2017, in which the total asset cost was put at Rs. 53.02 crore. Revaluation With the Union government approving this, the State government issued an order fixing this asset value in July 2018. However, an understanding was again made to conduct a revaluation as per the takeover date of September 30, 2018. It was after this that the Union government demanded that the land cost also be included in the asset valuation, which the State government has disagreed with, said Mr. Rajeeve, in reply to a submission made by A. Prabhakaran, MLA.  The delay is over a demand by the Union govt. to include the cost of the land as well in the asset valuation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-seeks-speedy-takeover-of-psu/article35552104.ece
27 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State running out of vaccine stock||The State’s COVID-19 vaccine stock is at a near-zero situation and many districts have already run out of stock Having distributed a record 4.88 lakh doses on Saturday and 1.87 lakh doses on Monday, the State is just scraping at the bottom, with vaccinations all but cancelled in districts such as Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Thrissur, and Kozhikode. According to the Centre’s vaccine despatch schedule, Kerala’s next stock is due only on July 29. Health Minister Veena George said the matter had been brought to the attention of the Centre. Kerala had requested 60 lakh doses for August. Over 50% of the State’s population was still susceptible to COVID-19, according to ICMR’s sero prevalence study, she said. Though the State received 1.66 crore doses from the Centre, 1.87 crore people had been inoculated, with zero wastage. In the 45-plus age group, 76% of the target population had been given the first dose and 35%, the second dose. In Kasaragod and Wayanad, 100% of the target population above 45 years had been administered the first dose. Earlier in the Assembly, replying to a calling attention motion by Saneeshkumar Joseph, Ms. George said population-wise, Kerala has administered the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine to 36.95% and the second dose to 16.01%, which was much above the national average of 26% and 7% respectively. All healthcare workers and front-line workers had received the first doses and it was only because of the longer inter-dosage interval of 12 weeks that their second dose coverage had remained at 82%. In the 18-45 age group, 21% had received the first dose and the majority were not due for the second dose. She said the State had received the maximum vaccine supply from the Centre last week, because of which, between June 18-24, over 18 lakh persons could be administered the vaccine. Ms. George said that though the State required 60 lakh doses for August, the Centre had promised only 30 lakh doses, of which, 22 lakh were for administering second doses. Hence, only 8 lakh doses would be available for the State to administer the first dose to over one crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-running-out-of-vaccine-stock/article35552105.ece

The pilot launch will be limited to ten wards. Initially, only non-biodegradable waste will be collected. The civic body will be deploying Kudumbashree volunteers for the purpose. Meeting A meeting of the councillors from the various wards will be held this week ahead of finalising the plan. The Corporation has over the past few years, ever since the closing down of the centralised waste treatment plant at Vilappilsala, been concentrating on decentralised waste management practices including aerobic bins and biogas plants. Low rank But in the Swachh Survekshan rankings put out by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs last year, this lack of door-to-door waste collection had led to the civic body scoring a low rank. But even in the absence of an official collection mechanism by the Corporation, private groups have been collecting waste for a fee in some wards. Often, these are not taken for processing or for recycling, and are dumped in public spaces or in water bodies. With the Corporation taking back charge of waste collection at the doorstep, these unauthorised collection mechanisms can be controlled. In some wards, private agencies or NGOs contracted by the Corporation have been handling the Haritha Karma Sena activities, including the collection of non biodegradable waste. Plastic waste Meanwhile, the Corporation has begun clearing up the plastic waste which has been piling up at various collection points and material recovery facilities of the civic body ever since the outbreak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quite a considerable part of it is unsegregated, as the pandemic had affected the cleaning and sorting activities too. These are now being taken by an agency based in Tamil Nadu. Over the past two weeks, a few loads of plastic waste have already been transported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-to-restart-waste-collection-from-houses/article35552319.ece

27 July 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||High drama at Karuvannur coop. bank||Activists of the Youth Congress and the Yuva Morcha conducted separate protest marches to the Karuvannur Service Cooperative bank on Monday. Inaugurating the Youth Congress march, State vice president K.S. Sabarinathan sought to protect the investors’ money even though this required attachment of the property of the CPI(M) district committee office. “It’s cheating by the CPI(M). Not only the bank officials, but also the CPI(M) leaders are involved in the scam. The bank should return the hard-earned money of the depositors. The victims should be relieved of the illegal revenue recovery process,” he said. The Youth Congress demanded government support for the family of T.M. Mukundan who committed suicide allegedly after receiving revenue recovery notice. “The CPI(M) should stop protecting the culprits. The properties of the accused should be attached and the stolen money recovered,” said an activist. Yuva Morcha activists too took out a protest march to the bank, led by the organisation’s Thrissur district committee. They demanded a CBI investigation in the case. Demands action The activists also demanded police action against Biju Karim, T.R. Sunil Kumar, C.K. Jilse and Bijoy for “abetment and suicide” of Mukundan. The organisation sought an investigation of the Left leadership in connection with the scam. Yuva Morcha National secretary P. Shyamraj inaugurated the march. After visiting the relatives of Mukundan, who was a Congress block committee member, senior Congress leader M.M. Hassan said that this was one of the biggest scams the State had ever seen. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy too sought action against the culprits. “It is difficult to believe that it was a fraud committed by just a clerk and a cashier. Those who siphoned off crores of rupees deposited by the common man should be brought under the law,” said Mr. Chandy. CBI probe sought BJP leader Sobha Surendran also sought a CBI investigation. She alleged that the CPI(M)’s party branches were functioning above the Crime Branch. “Therefore, only an investigation by a central agency can bring out the truth,” she said after visiting the kin of Mukundan. Token system Meanwhile, depositors who were waiting to withdraw their money from the bank clashed with each other on the day. The cooperative bank was issuing 150 tokens a day and it was disbursing Rs. 10,000 per token. Those who were issued token on Sunday night and others standing in queue from early morning were involved in the scuffle on Monday. Others who had received token for cash withdrawal the following week too were queuing up. The bank had stopped the distribution of tokens after reaching the daily limit, which reportedly led to an agitation by the depositors. The police faced a tough job in pacifying the agitators. The police had already deployed a contingent at the spot owing to the protest march by Youth Congress and Yuva Morcha activists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-drama-at-karuvannur-coop-bank/article35552274.ece

Mr. Srinvasulu said the Centre and State governments were minting money in the form of taxes on diesel and petrol, which should be stopped and taxes reduced at least by Rs. 10. “The State government can give a concession of Rs. 5 and the Centre can match that to reduce the burden on the common man At a time when the crude oil prices were plummeting, the Indian government was increasing taxes on fuel. Out of Rs. 100, more than Rs. 60 was being changed in the form of State and Central taxes,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-seeks-reduction-of-fuel-prices-by-rs-10-a-litre/article35552302.ece

27 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||A CM who never completed a full term||B.S. Yediyurappa, who holds the record of being Chief Minister of Karnataka four times, could not complete the full term even once. Two of the terms were short, as he failed to muster the support of an adequate number of MLAs to sustain the government. But he failed to complete the other two terms because of bickering in his own party, which he had built brick by brick in the State. Clear signs A close look at the turn of events, particularly in the past two years, shows that there was a clear indication of him not completing the term this time too as the gulf between him and the party cadre, as well as the high command, had begun widening from the very beginning. Also, past mistakes, particularly with respect to administration, continued this time too, with his own partymen raising allegations of corruption and nepotism. But unlike his previous stint when he had stepped down unceremoniously following a report on illegal mining, the 78-year-old Mr. Yediyurappa had a honourable exit this time. The five-decade-long political saga of Mr. Yediyurappa, who began his public life as president of the Shikaripur taluk unit of the then Jan Sangh in 1972, was marked by constant struggle and firefighting. Despite endearing himself to party workers and occupying prominent posts, such as that of Leader of the Opposition, president of the party’s State unit, and Deputy Chief Minister, Mr. Yediyurappa had not emerged strongly in the State’s political spectrum till 2008.  The failure by coalition partner JD(S) to transfer power to the BJP in 2008 changed the political fortunes of the BJP as well as Mr.Yediyurappa. The party’s campaign, led by Mr. Yediyurappa on the theme of “deception” by the JD(S), was not only received well by the public, but also elevated the political stature of Mr. Yediyurappa and turned him into a towering Lingayat leader. But despite making a quantum leap in terms of seats won, the party marginally fell short of the majority mark. That is when Mr. Yediyurappa resorted to the controversial strategy of getting several Opposition MLAs to quit their Assembly membership and re-contest on BJP ticket — a move codenamed ‘Operation Kamala’. Though it helped Mr. Yediyurappa fulfil the arithmetic requirement and form the first ever BJP government in a southern State, the strategy boomeranged on him as the “outsiders” were seen as more loyal to him rather than the party cadre. Finally, he was surrounded by a coterie of his supporters. Allegations of corruption and various scandals coincided with claims by the opposition that a huge amount of money was spent on ‘Operation Kamala’ — a charge constantly denied by Mr. Yediyurappa and the party. History repeats itself In the 2018 Assembly elections, the BJP again fell short of majority. Once the Congress and JD(S) cobbled together a coalition and formed government, Mr. Yediyurappa again resorted to ‘Operation Kamala’. He persuaded 16 MLAs from the Opposition to quit and managed to catapult the BJP to power in 2019. This paved the way for a repeat of history as the party’s old guard again raised the banner of revolt after missing out on ministerial berths. Also, Mr. Yediyurappa’s fourth stint in power was marked by alleged interference in the administration by his younger son B.Y. Vijayendra, which rubbed many the wrong way. It now appears that what is often called “subversion of democracy” in the form of ‘Operation Kamala’ was the origin of troubles for the BJP stalwart, who has now had to step down despite taking the party to its peakin Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-cm-who-never-completed-a-full-term/article35551730.ece
27 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Veteran actor Jayanthi passes away||Veteran actor Jayanti, 76, who passed away on Monday, was one of the most popular and critically acclaimed female actors of her time. Born as Kamala Kumari in Ballari on January 6, 1945, she was groomed by her mother Santanalakshmi to become a classical dancer from a very young age, for which she shifted to Chennai, then Madras. But it was movies that became her calling. Small roles as a teenager As a student at a dance school, the teenage girl acted in small roles with other girls, including Tamil veteran actor Manorama who was her batchmate. Spotted by filmmaker Y.R. Swamy, she debuted in Kannada cinema with the screen name he gave her — Jayanti. Jenu Goodu in 1963 was her first film and she never looked back. Her second film Chandavalliya Thota opposite Dr. Rajkumar was a huge hit and she also won a national award for it. She started acting in both Tamil and Telugu films. She has acted in more than 500 films in five languages — Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi. She was paired onscreen in several films with matinee idol Dr. Rajkumar in Kannada and did the most number of movies with him. She acted with N.T. Rama Rao in Telugu and Gemini Ganesh in Tamil. She also had long collaborations with important filmmakers of the time — Puttanna Kanagal in Kannada and K. Balachander in Tamil. However, all awards for her performance were for her work in Kannada films — four times best actor, twice best supporting actor and two Filmfare awards for best actor. A critically acclaimed actor, she was called ‘Abhinaya Sharade’ by Kannada film connoisseurs. Glam avatar What cemented her place in the Kannada film pantheon as a star was the 1965 film Miss Leelavathi , where she was introduced in a glamorous avatar. It was in this film that a Kannada actor first wore a swimsuit on screen. The film, much discussed for its bold portrayal of women's sexuality, won a national award and remains a cult classic even today. Nearly a decade later, she essayed a similar role in Eda Kallu Guddada Mele in 1973, for which she won her first State award for best actor. In her later years, she graduated to essaying supporting roles across films in four languages, and also in a few tele-serials. Troubled life Jayanti often spoke of how stardom did not come easy to her. She was often derided for being ‘overweight’ and this gave her a complex. Jayanti had a turbulent personal life too. She was married to Telugu actor and filmmaker Peketi Shivaram, but the couple soon separated. Jayanti suffered from asthma for over 35 years and often developed respiratory issues and had serious bouts of illnesses in 2018 and earlier this year. BSY’s condolence Outgoing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa condoled her death and described Jayanti as an actor who could take on wide-ranging roles with ease. Many from the Kannada film industry have mourned her passing away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veteran-actor-jayanthi-passes-away/article35551740.ece
27 July 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Oppn. parties uniting to fight Modi: CPI leader||Communist Party of India (CPI) national secretary K. Narayana said many prominent political parties were slowly tilting towards forging an alternative to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government at the Centre in the 2024 general elections. The CPI would primarily focus on attacking the ‘autocratic’ policies of Mr. Modi, and the Centre’s attempts to weaken State governments by taking away rights on water, power and legislation. Addressing a press conference here on Monday, the CPI leader said that regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee had already initiated efforts to defeat the BJP government at the Centre. “Though the Left parties remained at arm’s length with the Trinamol Congress, we are ready to work together for a common cause,” Mr. Narayana said. “We are also hoping to field a candidate in the Presidential elections,” he said. On August 2 and 3, the CPI would organise an agitation through the Joint Action Committee on the Visakha Steel Plant issue. “There is absolutely no political commitment on the part of the YSR Congress Party government to stop the privatisation of the steel plant. Though the plant is worth over Rs. 2 lakh crore, the Centre is manipulating the deal to sell to sell the property to the private sector at a meagre Rs. 5,000 crore,” Mr. Narayana said. Criticising the Centre for a spree of hikes in oil prices, the CPI leader said that though the crude oil prices slumped to $70 a barrel, its price skyrocketed to Rs. 110 in India, as against the reasonable price which should be at Rs. 40 a litre. Referring to the spat between rebel YSRCP MP Raghurama Krishnam Raju and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, Mr. Narayana said that both were in the grip of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, whose decision would be vital for the disqualification of Mr. Raju, or cancellation of bail to the Chief Minister over the CBI and Enforcement Directorate cases against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/opposition-parties-uniting-to-fight-modi-cpi-leader/article35551791.ece

The carbon composite, stronger than steel, based fuselage is among eight contracted to be made by the firm involves fusion and precision of about 1,595 parts inspected at every stage before being assembled. It has also been approved by defence quality control authorities. Five other firms are partnering in making the front and back portion of the fighter plane, avionics, landing gear, wings and the tail, said HAL chairman and managing director R. Madhavan and congratulated VEM Technologies for doing an “excellent job as it was not easy and took almost five years in making including time lost due to COVID”. “While HAL has been involved in every stage, it is not a small operation but very complicated one as it has match to other two sections plus ensure these are aligned correctly along with connections for fixing with wings and under-carriage,” he explained. HAL is looking for more private sector participation in making full fledged structures in LCA-Tejas space and other defence related products. Aerospace eco-system sector still has a long way to go although outsourcing work began from 2011. “Right now, we are making eight aircraft a year and will double that number. We plan to make 24 aircraft a year for which we are setting up parallel production lines and will also be sourcing out more work to our partners,” he said. The CMD expected the speed of making of structures to increase in a couple of years bringing in more efficiency into the systems. “We are looking at second and third level of outsourcing from partners to supply end products to us rather than we totally controlling the supply side. We want lead integrators so that we can do final assemblies and certification, of course the design should be with us,” said Mr. Krishnan. The public sector giant is also looking at sectors like avionics where partners can come out with end units certified by themselves for use straight away rather than depend on foreign products. VEM Technologies chief V. Venkata Raju said the three-decade old firm with 1,300 staff, half of them into design, has been partnering with HAL for over two decades on all their major platforms.

He said the TDP and YSRCP governments had been allowing two persons from another faith to run shops in the temple complex areas, which shows the both the governments’ ‘lack of concern for protecting the rights of the Hindus’. “The State government is giving salaries to pastors and muezzins, but was not protecting the right of SCs to retain their religion (Hinduism),” Mr. Veerraju said. BJP activists also protested construction of houses for people from other faiths in the Srisailam temple complex areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/protect-rights-of-hindus-in-temples-bjp/article35552270.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC says CBI should collect its own evidence in ISRO case||The Supreme Court on Monday recorded that the CBI had registered an FIR against former Kerala police officers who allegedly framed space scientist Nambi Narayanan in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage case of 1994 after perusing a report filed by the court-appointed Justice D.K. Jain Committee. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said the CBI probe would proceed in accordance with law. The CBI should not let the committee report either overwhelm or influence its independent investigation. The report was only meant as an “initial basis” for the court to better understand the case. The CBI probe should not be coloured by the committee report. The agency should collect its own evidence, the Bench said. It said that while the committee report need not be made public, the FIR registered by the CBI ought to be uploaded on the website. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta orally undertook to publish the FIR in the course of the day. In April, the court asked the CBI to look into the committee report on the roles of senior Kerala police officials in the case.

Vijaya Sai Reddy met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Delhi on Monday and submitted a memorandum requesting her to accord investment clearance for the Polavaram project as recommended by the Polavaram Project Authority (PPA) and Central Water Commission and accepted by the technical advisory committee of the Ministry of Jal Shakti at 2017-18 price level of Rs. 55,656.87 crore at the earliest to facilitate the completion of Land Acquisition (LA) and Relief and Rehabilitation (R&R) works by June 2022. The MPs also requested the Union Minister to reimburse the expenditure incurred by the State government on the project, without restricting funding to component-wise eligibility and to consider the reimbursement as per the actual costs of LA and R&R compensation for the project-affected families under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The MPs stated that the Government of Andhra Pradesh is only an executing agency of the project which was declared a national project under Section.90(1) of the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014 (APRA) and that a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was created in May 2014 for executing the project through State government’s departments and other expert agencies. The investment clearance was originally given on the basis of the 2010-11 price level and the A.P. government had submitted revised cost estimates at the 2017-18 price level on being asked by the PPA to do so. The MPs observed that over seven years have passed since the enactment of the APRA but the project has not picked up pace due to the Centre’s apathy in approving the second revised cost estimates. The Centre should, therefore, give investment clearance without further delay, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mps-submit-memorandum-to-union-finance-minister-on-polavaram/article35552150.ece

27 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Outfit urges Centre to rectify ‘lapses’ in gazette notification||A discussion forum organised by ‘Andhra Pradesh Samagra Abhivriddhi Adhyayana Vedika’ here on Monday demanded the Central government to rectify the ‘lapses’ in two gazette notifications for jurisdiction of the Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards. Speakers at the forum expressed the view that water allocations should be made as per the Bachawat Tribunal Award. The speakers, while welcoming the gazette notification, said that it would help in restraining the Telangana government in going ahead with projects that were not approved by the Apex Council. Also, it would serve as a shield for Andhra Pradesh in protecting the rights over its river waters. However, there was also a view that there were lapses in the gazette notification. For instance, the gazette notification failed to make a mention of the Veligonda project, which was discussed in Schedule 11(10) of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, they said. The speakers stressed on the need to stop the projects being constructed by the Telangana government on Palamuru-Ranga Reddy, Dindi, Thummilla and Bhakta Ramadasu irrigation projects. Direct control sought Drinking water supply to Chennai, SRBC, KC Canal, Telugu Ganga, Galeru-Nagari, and Pothireddipadu head regulator can be brought under the Board. Banakacherla cross regulator, SRBC main canal upto Owk, and Velugodu reservoir can be exempted from the gazette. The Andhra Pradesh government should make efforts to see that the river management boards have direct control over the projects, they said. Former Minister Vadde Shobanadreeswara Rao and Vedika convener T. Lakshmi Narayana were among the speakers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/outfit-urges-centre-to-rectify-lapses-in-gazette-notification/article35552272.ece

27 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Flouting of safety norms shocks doctors||A number of doctors in the city have expressed concern over the rush at RK Beach and shopping malls in the city, especially during weekends. And they were appalled to see that many of the beachgoers and shoppers at the malls, were going around blissfully without wearing a mask and not caring to maintain the basic social distancing norms. Speaking to The Hindu , District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar said that if the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour is not followed by the people, then it would be really difficult to break the chain of spread of the virus. The second wave is yet to die down and if people tend to flout the norms then the advent of the third wave will be earlier than anticipated, he said. According to him, if things are not brought under control, then by mid of August, the district can witness the third wave. The medical fraternity expressed concern on the Delta variant that ravaged the city and the district during the second wave. “This variant is still present among us and the cases that we are receiving, even till date, is due to this variant. This variant is currently causing a lot of problem in the USA and within a short time, it has shot up from 54% to 80%,” said Dr. Sudhakar. Wearing of masks and keeping away from crowded public places is the order of the day and it should be enforced by the district administration. The authorities concerned should impose fines not only on the individuals but also the shopping malls and establishments for not keeping things under control, said a senior doctor from the CSR block of KGH. The district administration along with the police and the GVMC has already decided to impose Rs. 100 as fine on people not wearing masks and Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000 on commercial establishments. This apart, if the establishments fail to enforce, then the shops will be closed for one or two days. Meanwhile, GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana confirmed that as part of the vaccination drive 1,00,600 persons were vaccinated on Monday. There are 164 vaccination sites in the district, which includes 147 in the government sector and 17 in the private sector. So far, 20,01,445 persons were inoculated, including 15,44,931 who have received the first dose and 4,56,514 the second dose.

27 July 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sub-registrar offices struggle to enforce COVID protocols||Officials are struggling to enforce COVID protocols at sub-registrar offices in the district, where visitors are turning up in large numbers without wearing masks or following physical distancing. Buyers and sellers of land, real estate brokers, and document writers are crowding offices every day. Only some of them are seen wearing masks and using hand sanitisers. Physical distancing is almost non-existent in the sub-registrar offices. A majority of the staff of sub-registrar offices have been infected by COVID-19 in the past, and had to spend a lot of money on treatment. For instance, seven employees of Dasannapeta-Vizianagaram sub-registrar office were affected by COVID-19 during the second wave. A similar situation prevailed at sub-registrar offices of Cantonment-Vizianagaram, Parvatipuram, Bobbili, Saluru and other places. Banners put up “We are unable to control the public despite repeated announcements through loudspeakers stressing the importance of following COVID protocols. We have also put up banners but in vain. We are unable to spare extra employees to control the public as almost all are busy with designated work right from morning to late night,” said S. Mohana Rao, sub-registrar of Vizianagaram. All the sub-registrars brought their grievance to the notice of District Registrar M. Srujana who in turn requested the Collector and Superintendent of Police to take necessary action to control the public at sub-registrar offices. ‘Allocate guards’ “Employees are scared of discharging their duties due the continuous presence of a large number of people in the offices. They will work in a confident manner only when they can be assured of their safety. We requested higher authorities for allocation of guards who can allow buyers and sellers only when their presence is required,” she told The Hindu over phone. Real estate consultant M. Ramgopal said that the property buyers and sellers were also putting themselves at risk if they failed to understand the importance COVID-19 protocols. “Staying closely for hours together will certainly lead to a renewed spread of the virus. That is why we are calling them into the office only when their signature is needed on the documents,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sub-registrar-offices-struggle-to-enforce-covid-protocols/article35552296.ece

27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Quota for SCs in allotment of shops||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the State government will extend reservations to SCs in allotment of licensed business like rice mills, fertilizer, medical and liquor shops. Addressing an orientation programme on `Dalit Bandhu’ for about 450 SC people from various villages in Huzurabad Assembly constituency where the programme will be implemented on a pilot basis, Mr. Rao asked officials to identify similar economic generation activities where reservation can be extended to SCs. The eight-hour meeting which was also attended by MLAs and MLCs of TRS belonging to SCs, Mr. Rao said the government will extend investment support to eligible beneficiaries in industrial, agricultural and employment generation sectors. They include purchase of power tillers, harvesters, autorickshaws, tractors, poultry farms, tent houses, dairy farming, oil mills, flour mills, brick kilns, hotels and others depending upon their preferences. In addition to Dalit Bandhu, the government will also set up a parallel “Dalit Security Fund” on a permanent basis with the contribution of beneficiaries. It will be monitored by committees headed by district Collectors. The members include some beneficiaries. The government will deposit a nominal amount in the fund every year. Mr. Rao said the beneficiaries of Dalit Bandhu will be provided ID cards that will have bar coded electronic chips which can be used to pass on information about the implementation of the programme. The meeting was marked by an interactive session where the participants expressed how they proposed to invest the money under the scheme. The public representatives who were present clarified their doubts with Mr. Rao. An illustrative note on business and service activities in rural and urban areas that can be explored was circulated to participants. Mr. Rao initiated the meeting stoking the hidden strength in Scheduled Castes and how it can be harnessed for their economic development. He asked the SCs to emerge as a business community making use of the programme. They should become money lenders to other communities in villages. Dalit Bandhu should run concurrently with resolving land issues of SCs and creation of basic infrastructure in their residential areas. The scheme was aimed to liberate SCs not only from economic but social injustice and enhance their self-respect, he said. He added that the success of the programme in the State depended on the result from the efforts put in at Huzurabad. He appealed to SCs to withdraw police cases between themselves. They should work with mutual cooperation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/quota-for-scs-in-allotment-of-shops/article35552085.ece

27 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Distribution of food security cards gets under way||Distribution of food security cards — ration cards — for supply of essentials like rice to eligible families, started on Monday. The State government selected over 3.09 lakh food security cards to eligible families. The new ration cards would take the number of families covered through public distribution system to over 90.5 lakh. Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, Ministers, MLAs and other people’s representatives participated in the programmes organised for distribution of food security cards in their areas. Participating in the programme at Nasrullahbad mandal headquarters, the Speaker said the government took care to provide food security cards to a majority of deserving families in the State. The government was committed to ensuring that no family suffered because of hunger and, hence, all eligible poor families were brought under the PDS. He recalled that the previous governments had distributed rice at 4 kg per person subject to a maximum of 20 kg to each family. The TRS government had increased the quantum to 6 kg a person irrespective of the number of members in the families. The government was spending Rs. 2,766 crore a year to meet the requirements in this regard, proving its commitment to the cause of the poor. Elsewhere, Ministers G. Jagdishwar Reddy, T. Srinivas Yadav, Vemula Prashanth Reddy and Satyavati Rathod distributed food security cards to eligible families. A meeting convened in Suryapet district witnessed ruckus as Congress MLA K. Rajagopal Reddy alleged that the officials concerned had not invited him to the meeting, violating the protocol norms. The meeting witnessed slogan shouting by Mr. Rajagopal Reddy’s supporters for some time, but normalcy was restored soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/distribution-of-food-security-cards-gets-under-way/article35552083.ece
27 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||What UNESCO tag means for Ramappa Temple||As the euphoria of inscription of Ramappa Temple as a UNESCO World Heritage Site spreads, it’s natural to question what the tag would mean. Will it lead to the world body giving the temple authorities more money? Will the UNESCO have a say in how the temple is run? Questions like this are being asked by lay people. But what is the truth? “It will galvanise national and international tourism not only to Ramappa but other historical sites in Telangana,” says B.V. Papa Rao of Kakatiya Heritage Trust, who successfully steered the nomination of the Kakatiya-era temple to the coveted tag. A higher number of tourists automatically translates into better amenities and more money for the community where the heritage site is located. According to a report, the number of foreign tourists as well as domestic visitors has gone up by more than 10% after Ahmedabad clinched the World Heritage City tag in 2017. “Once a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation. Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties. A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites,” reads a UNESCO statement. The funding ranges from $75,000 received for a management plan for Hampi under World Heritage Site in Danger to $10,000 assistance for installing signage within the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway World Heritage site. The inscribed site also gains protection under Geneva Convention against destruction during war. But the prestige associated with a heritage tag can just as easily by stripped by the world body leading to a setback to local infrastructure. At this edition of the meeting, Liverpool was deleted from the world heritage list. “Due to the irreversible loss of attributes conveying the outstanding universal value of the property,” said the world body about, ‘Liverpool — Maritime Mercantile City’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/what-unesco-tag-means-for-ramappa-temple/article35552062.ece
27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Water Hyacinth back in lakes||Water hyacinth continues to plague the city lakes notwithstanding the crores of rupees spent on removal of the weed every year. As GHMC prepares to call for another round of tenders for removal of the invasive species from 20 more lakes, water bodies from last year’s drive are full of the weed yet again. Water hyacinth proves to be one of the major reasons for spread of mosquitoes in the city, as Culex mosquitoes breed heavily on the weed. After getting the scourge removed manually for years, the corporation called for tenders for mechanical removal last year. A total of 39 lakes with heavy spread of water hyacinth were selected last year, and tenders were awarded to the tune of Rs. 31 crore for its removal. As per the agreement, the selected agencies had to remove the weed, transport it to the Jawahar Nagar dumpyard, and maintain the water bodies for the coming three years without the weed growth. Notwithstanding any agreement, the weed is now back in the lakes which were part of last year’s tenders. While the work was to be taken up before the onset of monsoons, thick growth of the plant can be noticed now well in the midst of rainy season when mosquito breeding is the highest. The weed can be noticed covering almost entire water bodies in several instances — Shah Hatim Talab, lake inside the Jalagam Vengal Rao Park, and Banjara Lake to name a few. All the three lakes were part of the weed removal package last year. This year, 20 more lakes have been chosen for the project, including Nagole Lake, Kummari Kunta, Errakunta, and Ramantapur Pedda Cheruvu in L.B. Nagar Zone, Malkam Cheruvu and Singoji Pond in Charminar Zone, Regula Kunta, Kotha Kunta, Bakshi Kunta, Mysamma Cheruvu and Krishna Kant Park pond in Serilingampally zone, IDL Cheruvu, Yellamma Cheruvu, Bheemuni Kunta, Vennelagadda Lake, Khaja Kunta, Lingam Lake, and Bharat Nagar Lake in Kuktapally Zone, Katora Houz and JVR Park lake in Khairatabad Zone. Interestingly, quite a few lakes from last year’s package have found place in the current year’s package too, which include JVR Park Lake, Katora Houz, Mysamma Cheruvu, and Yellamma Cheruvu. Officials said lakes with heavy growth of water hyacinth were listed, and final decision is yet to be taken with regard to final tenders. Agencies from last year are said to have refused to remove excessive growth citing higher costs and unwieldy location of the weed for removal. Talks are on with the contractors, officials said. The authorities are also considering procurement of Floating Trash Collectors for removal of the weed. However, officials on the condition of anonymity admit that as long as garbage dumping and sewage flowing into the lakes is not arrested, weed removal will amount to nothing but money spinner for the agencies. A project for rejuvenation of lakes which envisages diversion of sewage from lakes, stands temporarily suspended as the work has been clubbed with the Strategic Nala Development Programme, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-hyacinth-back-in-lakes/article35552071.ece
27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Chest Hospital doctors shun elective duty||Around 50 doctors at the Government General and Chest Hospital, Erragadda, boycotted elective duties for six hours on Monday in protest against an attack on their colleague the previous day. They resumed duty after hospital superintendent Mahaboob Khan assured to improve security measures. Second year post graduate student Krishnan Namboothiri E. on Sunday said that six attendants of a 52-year-old patient, suspected to be suffering from COVID-19, attacked him. The incident The attendants were allegedly provoked when he asked the patient what medicines she was taking for hypertension, Dr Krishnan said, adding that the attendants told him that he was supposed to know better. “I asked him (the attendant) to leave when he shouted. He came back with at least five more people and all of them started to interrogate me. I remained silent and started to walk out. They dragged me outside the ward, tore my mask, slapped me, and hit on my ribs. I fell down. Two ward boys pushed the attendants away,” Dr Krishnan had said on Sunday. On Monday morning, the junior doctors and senior residents boycotted elective duties and staged a protest outside the main gate. After the superintendent intervened, they shifted the protest to the hospital campus. Slogans demanding justice, a complaint to police from the hospital administration and a ban on ‘VIP culture’ were raised by the protestors. Doctors’ demands “Our demands include releasing of CCTV footage to police to speed up the legal process, deployment of Special Protection Force (SPF) at the hospital, bringing all wards under electronic surveillance and recruitment of more counsellors to explain the medical condition of a patient to attendants,” said Sameena, a PG student. President of Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA)-Osmania Unit P. Rahul said the boycott was called off as an FIR has been filed and they have received a written assurance from the superintendent assuring better security measures at the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/chest-hospital-doctors-shun-elective-duty/article35552053.ece

27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Eatala dares CM to arrest him||Former health minister Eatala Rajender dared Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to put him behind bars if he was really involved in illegal occupation of land as he removed him from the TRS Cabinet on this charge. “What happened to the charges against me? After working for 18 years, he threw me out making baseless charges. Mr. Rao has no morals or ethics and has been running after money since 2014. He has been forced to come out of his comfort zone now because of us. Shouldn’t the CM meet people?” he questioned during the course of his ongoing ‘Praja Deevena Yatra’ on Monday. Mr. Rajender, now with the BJP, charged the government with hounding his supporters making use of the police and official machinery threatening them with jail on the basis of old cases. “We are not going to be cowed down by your threats or political tricks. I had won six times from here without distributing money or liquor. You (Mr. Rao) can throw as much money as you wish but people will be with those who stood by them during hard times,” he said. He also appealed to people to stand by him for justice as he alone could not be expected to withstand the full might of the official machinery, liquor lobby and money power. Ethanol policy In a separate development, senior BJP leader Gudur Narayana Reddy demanded that the government announce the ‘Ethanol policy’ like Maharashtra and Karnataka which got the ethanol manufacturing units coming up in those states. With public sector oil companies blending the petrol with ethanol, it was being sourced from other States in TS as it was not available. The Telangana Sugar Mills Association had requested the government for such a policy but no steps had been taken. In fact, the ethanol manufacturing units set up had been unable to start production as the government did not give permissions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-dares-cm-to-arrest-him/article35552080.ece
27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Dos and don’ts for use of CDP funds||The State government has prohibited taking up construction of residential buildings belonging to Central, State and local governments as well as their departments/agencies as also public sector undertakings and commercial organisations through the funds granted under the Constituency Development Programme (CDP). The government has issued a series of guidelines relating to dos and don’ts under the scheme. The development follows the enhancement of allocation from the existing Rs. 3 crore to Rs. 5 crore each to MLAs and MLCs from the current financial year. This is the third enhancement under the scheme since the formation of the State with the government increasing allocation under CDP from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 1.5 crore in 2014-15 and Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 3 crore in 2016-17. MLAs and MLCs could recommend works with an emphasis on creation of durable assets in the constituency to serve the needs of larger sections of people like drinking water facilities, public healthcare buildings and infrastructure in government educational institutions among others. Each MLA and MLC should necessarily propose 40%of the amount, at least Rs. 2 crore, towards providing infrastructural facilities in government/local body schools. The guidelines pertained to nature of works that can be taken up under the CDP and the District Collector, assisted by the Chief Planning Officer, would be responsible for execution of works. The Collector should accordingly identify the implementing agency in line with the government rules/guidelines applicable for the purpose. The guidelines also specify the administrative expenses, accounting procedure that should be adopted and completion of works/settling the accounts. The Collectors should ensure that there is no overlap of works proposed by the MLAs and MLCs and should maintain constituency-wise asset creation register for the works to be carried out by CDP funds. The first instalment of the fund should be released only after obtaining copies of the M-book, utilisation certificate for the previous releases, completion certificates and photograph of the completed works from the implementing agencies concerned. While field inspection of at least 10% of the works sanctioned is made mandatory, the government made it clear that certain works are prohibited under the programme. These include works involving commercial establishments/units, grants and loans, contribution to any Centre and State/UT relief funds, acquisition of land or payment of compensation to acquired land. The CDP funds should not be utilised for creation of assets for individual/family benefits, construction of swagat dwars/statues and execution of works in unauthorized colonies. Execution of works in private/individual places has been prohibited except in cases where the individual/private agency donates land for public purposes and legally hands over the place to local bodies/State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dos-and-donts-for-use-of-cdp-funds/article35552081.ece

27 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Two from UP held for cheating octogenarian woman||Two persons from Uttar Pradesh, who cheated an octogenarian woman saying reversal bonus points and loyalty bonus points can be claimed over her insurance policies, was arrested by Hyderabad cybercrimes police. The victim was duped to the tune of Rs. 15.37 lakh by Devansh Rastogi (27) and Imran Khan (22), both residents of Ghaziabad. On March 3, a 80-year-old woman from Begumpet approached police stating that in October last she received a call from a person who introduced himself as Rajeev Agarwal, working as clerk in a Life Insurance company and informed her that if she takes insurance policies, she can get huge bonus and convinced her to believe his version. The woman took four policies on her name. Later, in the name of processing fee and other charges to claim the loyalty bonus, reverser bonus, the fraudster collected Rs. 15,37,622 from her. “Even after paying such huge amounts, she has not received any bonus or her insurance policy amount and still they are demanding her to pay more. So she realised that she was cheated by fraudsters on pretext of getting bonus on her insurance policies,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said. Based on her complaint, a case was registered and the duo was arrested. Police seized 10 mobile phones, five debit cards of different banks, three bank passbooks, a cheque book and two stamps. According to Mr. Mohanty, Devansh Rastogi hails from Bareilly and met his childhood friend Manjeet Choudary, who also worked in insurance sector like him. “As they both were in deep financial crisis, they hatched a plan to cheat the gullible policy holders of the Insurance company,” he said. He cautioned public not to transfer funds/amounts in advance responding to online fraudsters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/two-held-for-cheating-elderly-woman/article35552068.ece

27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Assess crop damage, pay compensation’||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy has demanded that the State government take up assessment of crop damage due to the recent spell of heavy rains, particularly in North Telangana, and provide seed, fertilizer and input subsidy for raising crops afresh. In an open letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday, Mr. Reddy explained that the farming community had suffered a heavy loss due to the recent rains and floods and investment of thousands of crore had been washed away or submerged in the rains/floods. On similar occasions in the past, the State governments had requested the Central teams to visit the State to assess the extent of crop damage and ensure that the farmers got some compensation at least in the form of input subsidy. However, after formation of Telangana, the TRS government had never taken up such a measure, he alleged. As if that were not enough, the TRS government had stopped implementing Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and other crop insurance schemes such as modified weather insurance scheme for the simple reason that they had the component of a share of premium to be borne by the State government, Mr. Reddy said. The only crop insurance scheme being implemented in the State was ‘varsha bima’ (rain insurance) was, however, covering only seven crops being raised in the State, that too with the complete premium paid by farmers. On the other hand, most of the farmers were unable to get institutional credit as the loan waiver up to Rs. 1 lakh per farmer announced before the 2018 elections to the Assembly was yet to be fulfilled. The Chief Minister appeared to be interested more in winning the by-election by spending Rs. 3,000 crore, than sparing spare at least Rs. 1,000 crore to provide relief to farmers, he said. He demanded that the government take up crop damage assessment immediately, extend Rs. 15,000 per acre compensation and implement all crop insurance schemes with the government bearing the premium and release funds immediately for crop loan waiver up to Rs. 1 lakh as promised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/assess-crop-damage-pay-compensation/article35552077.ece

27 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Orders on eligibility clause reserved||Telangana High Court on Monday reserved orders in a writ appeal challenging a single judge order which upheld Telangana State Public Service Commission’s notification that only those having experience as regular lecturers were eligible for posts of residential school principals. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy heard contentions of the counsels of the petitioners and the government. TSPSC notification mandated that, along with the required educational qualifications, the candidates should have teaching experience as junior lecturers for at least five years. With the Commission rejecting their applications despite they clearing qualifying exam, eight candidates moved the HC. After hearing their contentions, a single judge upheld the Commission’s decision that candidates must have experience as regular lecturers. The candidates filed an appeal which came up for hearing before the division bench led by the CJ. The petitioners’ counsels contended that part-time lecturers fulfilled all eligibility conditions. They discharged duties on a par with regular lecturers. Rejecting their applications as their certificate indicated them as part-time lecturers was against principles of natural justice, the counsel said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/orders-on-eligibility-clause-reserved/article35552078.ece

Jagadish Reddy and Congress legislator from Munugode Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy were engaged in a heated exchange of words on the dais, at a programme organised to distribute food security cards, in Choutuppal on Monday. Congress cadre and followers of Mr. Rajagopal Reddy, who alleged protocol violation by the government, erupted in sloganeering as soon as the Minister arrived at the venue. With slogan-shouting, the programme was briefly halted. Only after the police removed the group of enraged people were the proceedings continued. But soon, when Mr. Reddy took the microphone and began addressing the gathering, on the welfare and successes of the TRS government, Mr. Rajagopal Reddy stood up and took a microphone to make his point. The police and the hosts on the dais tried to intervene, when both leaders stood face to face and exchanged words. The Congress leader later grabbed the Minister’s microphone too. The MLA said he was not invited to the programme that was organised in his constituency. “Even without basic intimation to the local legislator (me), how can he come to the constituency? People of Munugode are waiting for resolution of pending issues, not new programmes,” he said, later speaking to media persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/minister-cong-mla-in-a-war-of-words/article35552308.ece

27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women hold ‘parliament’ at farmers’ protest site||Among those who were members of the Mahila Kisan Sansad here on Monday were an Assistant Professor from Punjab, wife of an Army officer and a homemaker who occasionally works towards women empowerment in her village in Haryana. Amandeep Kaur Sandhu, 32, Assistant Professor at a college in village Baba Sang Dhesian, said back home, people used to believe that women should stay indoors. But during the protest against the farm laws, women and men shared the stage and continued the agitation shoulder to shoulder. “Women here spoke for their rights and so articulately, one can’t imagine. This women led parliament has built confidence in them,” she said. The 40-year-old wife of an Army officer, a resident of Mohali who didn’t wish to be identified, said she is here to express solidarity. “Women need to get out of the comfort of their homes and be a part of the movement. I have come here because this is the need of the hour. I am an Army wife and we all stand with the farmers,” she said. Ramkali Jangda, a 57-year-old housewife who works with a local NGO working towards women empowerment in a village in Haryana, said the Mahila Sansad should have happened on day one but she is glad it has happened. At the ‘parliament’, speakers and deputy speakers included CPI leader Annie Raja, Jagmati Sangwan, national vice-president, All-India Democratic Women’s Association and activist Medha Patkar. In two of the three sessions, an “agriculture minister” was also to made to sit and speak. Resolutions passed Ms. Raja toldThe Hinduthat three resolutions were passed on Monday. “Women should be given 33% reservation in Parliament. This Bill has been pending. We have passed a resolution here. It’s high time it was passed in the Lok Sabha as well,” she said. Ms. Sangwan said the ‘parliament’ was essential because women shared issues on the three farm laws which will impact them directly. “We spoke about how we should be given land rights because we don’t have any rights whatsoever. A woman will have to repay the loan in case her farmer husband takes his life but is not allowed to take loans,” she said. “Their labour, hard work, skills and knowledge should be taken on board by people’s movements,” said Samyukta Kisan Morcha referring to a resolution passed in the Mahila Kisan Sansad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/women-hold-parliament-at-farmers-protest-site/article35551947.ece

A Ramsar site is a wetland area designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. Virendra Tiwari, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Mangrove Cell, announced the move at the 4th Climate Resilient Maharashtra Townhall. “A proposal to declare Thane creek as a Ramsar site has been submitted and we are working on it with the Environment Department,” he said. The Mangrove Cell is awaiting approval from the State Wetland Authority, which is headed by Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, and is closely working with the Environment Department for its speedy approval. “Following this, it can be sent to the Central government,” Mr. Tiwari said. The townhall was organised by Climate Voices, a collective of three organisations — Purpose, Asar and Climate Trends — along with the Environment and Climate Change Department’s Majhi Vasundhara initiative on Monday, which was observed as International Day for Conservation of Mangroves. Task force to be set up Manisha Patankar-Mhaiskar, Principal Secretary, Maharashtra Environment and Climate Change Department, said the department would be setting up a task force to conduct a fresh exercise to identify, demarcate, and preserve wetlands left out of coastal zones and inland areas in the State. “We will be looking at all the wetlands [even those that may have been left out] for our latest inventory in an attempt to protect as many wetlands as possible across Maharashtra.

27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jam-packed metro coaches on Day 1 of new travel guidelines||The Delhi Metro on Monday resumed operations with 100% seating capacity, permitting 50 commuters to travel in each coach. With entry continuing to be restricted at stations, as standing travel is not permitted, queues were seen outside some stations. In a notification issued on Saturday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had permitted the operation of metro trains with 100% seating capacity but specified that no standing travel would be permitted. However, on the first day of operations, several passengers were seen standing during the metro journey in crowded coaches. Stating that flying squads were present for enforcement across the network, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that several people were not “fully aware that the metro is offering only 20% of its passenger capacity” and not 100%.  With the revised guideline, the DMRC can accommodate 50 passengers seated next to each other and 80% of its carrying capacity, which constitutes of around 250 people who can stand and travel, are still out of bounds. DMRC Spokesperson Anuj Dayal said: “Some people are still under the impression that alternate seats are not to be occupied and preferred to stand during travel causing such a temporary situation in certain trains in some sections. DMRC has taken note of such a situation arising in morning peak hours and to avoid recurrence, will further strengthen its regulated entry and also advise public to occupy all seats during travel and abstain from travel by standing as it is still not permissible according to guidelines.” “The public are advised to avail metro services only when absolutely necessary to adhere to the prevalent guidelines,” Mr. Dayal said. Strict enforcement Several experts said strict enforcement of the guidelines was of prime importance while relaxing the norms. Sewa Ram, Head of Transport Department at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said: “In a way we can say that there has been an upgradation with the relaxation but it is still far less than the actual capacity. Since only sitting has been permitted, we should not be that concerned. However, some kind of social distancing has to be ensured. The DMRC should ensure that there are people monitoring as there needs to be strict enforcement. Even though people are sitting next to each other, they are not facing each other and hence, the impact might be less.” Vaccinated commuters can also be incentivised in some manner, suggested Amit Bhatt of the WRI, while stating that people sitting next to each other “defeats the whole purpose of social distancing.” “We have to incentivise people who are vaccinated either through some kind of preference in terms of easy check-ins or discounts. The question is how to do that. These are mass transit systems and there is only a certain amount of relaxation one can do. It defeats the purpose if these systems are treated like private vehicles. How to strike a balance is what is important and needs to be thought of,” said Mr. Bhatt. Further Mr. Bhatt added, “Typically how ticketless people are fined, the same kind of mechanism should be adopted. Some standing commuters on earmarked places should also be permitted.” Ridership The DMRC said that the average passenger journeys with full seating and no standing travel till 8 p.m. on Monday was approximately 17.5 lakh. Since the resumption of services on June 7 with the stipulated 50% capacity, Delhi Metro had witnessed around 16 lakh passenger journeys on an average till July 25, officials said. Between June 7 and July 25, the daily average number of commuters who were counselled and penalised stood at 470 and 285 respectively,officialssaid. With nine flying squads deployed on Monday, across the metro network, 432 passengers were deboarded from trains and 159 commuters were penalised for flouting norms, the DMRC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jam-packed-metro-coaches-on-day-1-of-new-travel-guidelines/article35551959.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Restrictions eased, but most cinema halls remain closed||Though the decks have been cleared by the Delhi government for the reopening of cinema halls at 50% capacity, many theatres in the city are taking it slow with most of them staying closed on the first day of operations. While a few film buffs landed up outside theatres on Monday morning hoping to catch a film on the big screen, owners said they are waiting for a big-ticket film release, 100% vaccination of employees and proper sanitation of their premises before welcoming audiences. Private screening A spokesperson from INOX, which runs several screens across the Capital, said they would open their cinemas on July 30 with 100% of employees vaccinated with the first dose. INOX also plans to introduce private screening, where guests can reserve an entire auditorium for a private show and choose the content, either from the current playlist, or an old blockbuster. “INOX believes the new and innovative offering full of delights would be safe and secure, and will become a new way of celebrating special occasions. With simple and easy pricing, and a convenient booking process, INOX aims to curate memorable banqueting experiences with features like welcome message on the screen and other personalised services,” the spokesperson said. Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Limited, said the company is aiming at 100% vaccination of its employees before reopening, apart from following all standard protocols issued by the government, and conducting deep EPA-approved ULV sanitisation at cinemas to make them safe. “We are hopeful to receive a positive response from the audience as the content pipeline for Bollywood, Hollywood and regional languages is promising for the year ahead,” Mr. Dutta said. Film buffs disappointed A few film buffs eager to watch a film in a theatre were seen outside a cinema hall in Jangpura early in the day but were disappointed to find the ticket counter shut. “We could not find tickets online so decided to give it a shot at the ticket window, but it is not open. I was really looking to do something different as I am an avid movie watcher,” said Aarav Singh, a student. Another moviegoer at Connaught Place said he had hoped to catch a movie before an appointment later in the day but was left disappointed. Online bookings and app-based bookings have not started yet with sources from app-based ticket booking companies saying that they are waiting for information from cinema hall owners to provide their schedules before going live.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/restrictions-eased-but-most-cinema-halls-remain-closed/article35551956.ece

The women’s panel sought the implementation of schemes announced by the Delhi government for financial aid to such families. The DCW said 79 Mahila Panchayats under the Commission carried out surveys in their respective areas to collect the data. According to the data provided by the DCW, 92.79% of the widows were in the 18-60 years age group, while the rest of them were senior citizens. The report added 774 women had children. In its letter to the WCD department, the women’s panel said that around 384 women had up to two children while over 45% of women had three to five children. The DCW stated that the survey showed that 28.57% of the widows had no source of income and were financially dependent on their husbands. Also, the family income of 60.93% of the women was Rs. 15,000 or less. DCW Chairperson Swati Maliwal said: “We are sending a detailed social survey report to the government so that the benefits of the scheme can be passed on to these women.” In the letter, Ms. Maliwal said: “The WCD department is requested to ensure that the schemes of the government, especially the ‘ Mukhyamantri COVID-19 Parivar Arthik Sahayta Yojna’, reach them. It is also requested that the District Magistrates concerned be given instructions to ensure the vaccination of these women on priority.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dcw-writes-to-government-on-scheme-for-widows/article35551954.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||BJP demands relief for COVID-19 victims’ kin be raised from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 10 lakh||The BJP termed Delhi government’s Rs. 50,000 compensation to families of those who died due to COVID “an insult to the memory of the dead”. The party demanded that the compensation be increased to Rs. 10 lakh. ‘Transparent policy’ Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the sum being distributed is inadequate. He also said a discriminatory policy is being followed in giving compensation and demanded a completely “transparent and streamlined policy” be put in place. “During the second COVID wave, Delhi’s healthcare facilities had completely crumbled, and the hospitals proved to be inadequate to deal with the situation. A large number of citizens had to go to Haryana, Rajasthan, and Punjab for treatment,” Mr. Bidhuri said. He added: “If someone from Delhi has died in these States, then their families should also be paid compensation as per a transparent policy. There cannot be discrimination over the distribution of compensation as all of those who died in Delhi or outside were citizens of the Capital.” Mr. Bidhuri said the second wave unleashed its wrath on people in a way that had ruined them emotionally and financially. In such a situation, the Delhi government “should not play politics or take arbitrary decisions” but instead be compassionate in its approach to compensate the impacted families, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-demands-relief-for-covid-19-victims-kin-be-raised-from-rs-50000-to-rs-10-lakh/article35551952.ece

The report submitted to the Union Ministry of Jal Sakti also stated that in the absence of a “minimum environmental flow” (flow of water) of the Yamuna in Delhi, it is very difficult to achieve even bathing quality standards of the river water. “Minimum environmental flow for the dilution of the polluted water in the Yamuna in Delhi is required to meet the desired water quality levels in the river for bathing purpose i.e. BOD<3 mg/l and DO>5 mg/l,” the report read. For bathing in a river, the desirable level of fecal coliform in the water is 500 MPN/100 ml or lesser, as per the Central Pollution Control Board. But the level was as high as 1,40,000 MPN/100 ml — 280 times the desired level — at Okhla Barrage, a point along the river in Delhi, as per the report. Over 80% polluted The 22 km stretch of Yamuna from Wazirabad to Okhla in Delhi, which is less than 2% of the river length, accounts for about 80% of the pollution load in the river. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an environmental flow is the water provided within a river, wetland or coastal zone to maintain ecosystems and their benefits where there are competing water uses and where flows are regulated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/microbes-from-human-animal-excreta-found-above-desirable-limits-in-yamuna/article35551963.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||AAP alleges graft in BJP-led civic bodies||The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday alleged corruption in the BJP-governed municipal corporation in processing of waste using machines and it runs into “crores of rupees”. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said the municipal corporation is renting machines to process waste at landfills but the rent is more than the machine’s cost. “Trommel machines help in processing the garbage and reducing the height of the garbage pile [in landfills]. According to that report of the Chief Auditor of the civic body, the corporation has taken these trommel machines on rent. The price of these machines, as stated in the audit report, is Rs. 17.7 lakh. But, the municipal corporation has taken these machines on rent for Rs. 6.3 lakh/month. That means within three months, the rent of these machines surpasses the actual price of these machines...interestingly, the civic body has spent Rs. 26 crore rupees till now to pay the rent,” Mr. Bharadwaj said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP is tring tried to “mislead people” on the issue. “What AAP calls rent of Trommel machines is actually its operation cost...,” Mr. Kapoor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-alleges-graft-in-bjp-led-civic-bodies/article35551950.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Over 45,000 construction workers get Rs. 5,000 each||The Delhi government distributed one-time COVID-19 relief of Rs. 5,000 each to 47,996 construction workers who are registered with the government, said authorities. “I urge all construction workers to get registered with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board to avail the benefits of welfare schemes for education, marriage, maternity, pension, etc,” said Deputy CM Manish Sisodia. In April, the government had paid Rs. 5,000 each to 2,16,602 construction workers as a one-time relief. The 47,996 workers are people, whose applications were approved between May 28 and July 18, said the government. “When the first lockdown was imposed, the Delhi government was one of the first governments to grant relief disbursement to all the 39,600 workers who were registered with the Construction Board in March 2020. We have carried a series of reforms in the Labour Department and as a result of this, within 8 months the number of workers registered with the board has increased to 3 lakhs,” Mr. Sisodia said. Delhi government has also started a 24×7 helpline for construction workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/over-45000-construction-workers-get-rs-5000-each/article35551960.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||City continues to face vaccine shortage, sees 39 new cases||The Capital continues to face a shortage of COVID-19 vaccines and stock is likely to last for less than a day, according to a bulletin released by the Delhi government on Monday. The city has been facing a similar situation for more than two weeks. The Health Minister had, earlier this month, said 500 vaccination centres were shut due to the shortage. On Monday morning, the city had only 70,900 doses of Covishield and 2,16,140 doses of Covaxin, as per the data. Till now, 96,84,216 doses have been administered in the city. Also, 10,614 doses were administered in the city on Sunday. Fewer people are vaccinated on Sundays as government centres are shut. The city reported 39 new COVIDcases in 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,35,949, according to the government bulletin. There was only one death reported and the total number of deaths stood at 25,044. A total of 56,435 tests were done in a day and that test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.07%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/city-continues-to-face-vaccine-shortage-sees-39-new-cases/article35551961.ece
27 July 2021||Pune,||First in country: Maharashtra fully vaccinates over one crore people||Maharashtra on Monday became the first State in the country to fully vaccinate more than one crore people against COVID-19. The number of people who had been administered both doses had reached 1,00,64,308, said additional chief secretary (Health) Dr. Pradeep Vyas. Officials said 3,75,974 people had been vaccinated through 4,100 inoculation centres in the State till 4 p.m. on Monday. “The State has set a record after more than one crore people have been administered both doses of COVID-19 vaccine and they have been given full protection against the virus,” Health Minister Rajesh Tope said. Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Despite tremendous natural calamities, today Maharashtra set a benchmark of being India’s first and only (as yet, and we hope for many more states soon) to have fully vaccinate 1 crore people. Congratulations to our doctors, nurses, medics and other officials for this!” Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported a robust 11,077 recoveries against 4,877 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, causing the active cases to dip sharply to 88,729.

27 July 2021||Tunis,||Tunisian President sacks government||Street clashes erupted on Monday outside Tunisia’s Army-barricaded Parliament, a day after President Kais Saied ousted the Prime Minister and suspended the legislature, plunging the young democracy into a constitutional crisis. Mr. Saied sacked Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi and ordered Parliament closed for 30 days, a move the biggest political party Ennahdha decried as a “coup”, following a day of angry street protests against the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Soldiers from early Monday blockaded the Assembly in Tunis while, outside, the President’s backers hurled stones, bottles and insults at supporters of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha, whose leader was barred entry to the complex. Troops also surrounded the office of Mr. Mechichi who was yet to officially react to the events rocking the North African country. On Monday afternoon, the presidency announced the dismissals of Defence Minister Ibrahim Bartaji and Hasna Ben Slimane, the acting Justice Minister. Mr. Saied’s move — a decade on from Tunisia’s 2011 revolution, often held up as the Arab Spring’s sole success story — comes even as the Constitution enshrines a parliamentary democracy. It “is a coup d’etat against the revolution and against the Constitution,” Ennahdha, the lead party in Tunisia’s ruling coalition, charged in a Facebook post, warning that its members “will defend the revolution”. Months-long deadlock The crisis follows months of deadlock between the President, the premier and Ennahdha chief Rached Ghannouchi, which has crippled the COVID-19 response as deaths have surged to one of the world’s highest per capita rates. The rivalry has blocked ministerial appointments and diverted resources from tackling economic and social problems. Mr. Saied declared that he had “taken the necessary decisions to save Tunisia, the state and the Tunisian people,” after a day where street protests over COVID-19 flared in multiple cities. The President, who under the Constitution controls the armed forces, warned his opponents against taking up arms, threatening that if anyone “fires a single bullet, our forces will respond with a rain of bullets”. Tunisian police also shuttered the local bureau of Qatari-based Al Jazeera television, the network’s Tunis director Lotfi Hajji said, warning that “what is happening is very dangerous, it is proof that freedom of the press is threatened”. The President’s power-grab sparked jubilant rallies on Sunday by thousands of his supporters who flooded the streets of the capital, waving the national flag and sounding their car horns as fireworks lit up the sky. But the shock move was criticised abroad, with Germany urging a rapid “return to constitutional order”. The Foreign Ministry in Turkey, where the government supports Ennahdha, said it was “deeply concerned” and called for “democratic legitimacy” to be restored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tunisian-president-sacks-government/article35551530.ece
27 July 2021||COLOMBO,||Solih asks Maldivians to rise against extremism||Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih on Monday called upon citizens to rise against religious extremism, in order to safeguard the country’s independence and sovereignty. In a special address to mark the Indian Ocean island nation’s 57th Independence Day, Mr. Solih said some “erroneously” believe in and “propagandise bloodshed” in the name of Islam. “Everyone of us who wish to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Maldives must readily rise against this dangerous movement,” he said, adding, “those countries, particularly a number of Islamic countries embattled by war and unrest have been swept by this very extremist ideology.” The President’s reference to threats of religious extremism comes weeks after Parliamentary Speaker and former President Mohamed Nasheed urged him to “course-correct before it is too late”, amid a growing rift between the two leaders from the country’s ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). Mr. Nasheed is currently in the U.K, recovering from the multiple injuries sustained in an explosion targeting him in Male on May 6. Maldivian police who termed the incident a “terror attack” have so far arrested 10 persons in connection with the case. No evidence of a direct link between them and ISIS has been found yet, the police chief told a media conference on Saturday. However, the suspects “support ISIS”, and are involved in “propagating the terror group’s ideology” in the Maldives, he said. Recurring concern Religious extremism has been a recurring concern in the Maldives, from where dozens are known to have joined the Islamic State terror group as fighters in Syria and Iraq. Further, extremist groups in the Maldives have in the past been linked to the murder cases of dissident journalists and bloggers who sought to challenge their ideology. While acknowledging the problem in his speech on Monday, President Solih emphasised that legal actions alone will not solve the issues of religious extremism, or blasphemy directed at Islam that caused “social discord”. “The lasting solution to these two issues is instilling Islamic faith in our children,” he said. His government “exploring options” within the education system to resolve the matter. “As long as such divisive forces exist in our society, our peace and harmony will be at persistent risk of disruption. Our position to manage other major crises will be consequently weakened if we allow our national affairs to spiral to that extent,” President Solih said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/solih-asks-maldivians-to-rise-against-extremism/article35551528.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Stalemate’ in ties as U.S., China officials trade barbs||Monday’s talks between senior American and Chinese officials in the city of Tianjin underlined a “stalemate” in relations, officials said, as both sides traded barbs and demands with little prospect of either appearing willing to concede any ground. Chinese officials for the first time presented “two lists” of demands to visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, while the U.S. side repeated its concerns over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and other Chinese actions — concerns that Beijing has rebuffed as “interference” in its internal affairs. China’s Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng slammed U.S. calls for a “rules-based international order” — calls also voiced by the U.S., India, Australia, Japan Quad grouping — describing it as “an effort by the United States and a few other Western countries to frame their own rules as international rules and impose them on other countries”. “The purpose is to resort to the tactic of changing the rules to make life easy for itself and hard for others, and to introduce 'the law of the jungle' where might is right and the big bully the small,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry quoted him as saying. China put forward “two lists” during the talks, called the “List of U.S. Wrongdoings that Must Stop” and the “List of Key Individual Cases that China Has Concerns With”, the South China Morning Post reported. In the first, Beijing demanded Washington “unconditionally revoke the visa restrictions over Communist Party of China (CPC) members and their families, revoke sanctions on Chinese leaders, officials and government agencies, and remove visa restrictions on Chinese students”. Beijing has also asked the U.S. to revoke the extradition request for Chinese tech giant Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wangzhou, also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, who has been under house arrest in Canada pending extradition. Downturn in relations While the Chinese side entirely blamed the U.S. for the downturn in relations, with Mr. Xie accusing the U.S. of “treating China as an imagined enemy,” Ms. Sherman underlined U.S. concerns “about a range of PRC actions that run counter to our values and interests and those of our allies and partners, and that undermine the international rules-based order,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. “In particular, she raised our concerns about human rights, including Beijing’s anti-democratic crackdown in Hong Kong; the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang; abuses in Tibet; and the curtailing of media access and freedom of the press,” he said. “She also spoke about our concerns about Beijing’s conduct in cyberspace; across the Taiwan Strait; and in the East and South China Seas.” The Deputy Secretary also raised concerns “about the PRC’s unwillingness to cooperate with the World Health Organization and allow a second phase investigation in the PRC into COVID-19’s origins”. She also “affirmed the importance of cooperation in areas of global interest, such as the climate crisis, counternarcotics, non-proliferation, and regional concerns including DPRK, Iran, Afghanistan, and Burma,” the State Department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/stalemate-in-ties-as-us-china-officials-trade-barbs/article35551531.ece
27 July 2021||Kabul,||‘Afghan conflict is having devastating impact’||The United Nations warned on Monday that Afghanistan could see the highest number of civilian deaths in more than a decade if the Taliban’s offensives across the country are not halted. Violence has surged since May when the insurgents cranked up operations to coincide with a final withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces. In a report released on Monday documenting civilian casualties for the first half of 2021, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said it expected figures to touch their highest single-year levels since the mission began reporting over a decade ago. It also warned that Afghan troops and pro-government forces were responsible for a quarter of all civilian casualties. “Unprecedented numbers of Afghan civilians will perish and be maimed this year if the increasing violence is not stemmed,” UNAMA head Deborah Lyons said in a statement. “I implore the Taliban and Afghan leaders to take heed to the conflict’s grim and chilling trajectory and its devastating impact on civilians.” During the first half of 2021, some 1,659 civilians were killed and another 3,254 wounded, the UNAMA report said — a 47% increase on the same period last year. The rise in civilian casualties was particularly sharp in May and June with 783 civilians killed and 1,609 wounded, it added. “Particularly shocking and of deep concern is that women, boys and girls made up of close to half of all civilian casualties,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-conflict-is-having-devastating-impact/article35551535.ece

The move could see China General Nuclear (CGN) excluded from several projects, including a consortium planning to build a nuclear plant on the Suffolk coast in eastern England, according to the Financial Times newspaper. British government sources said the decision could also impact another planned plant in Essex, southeast England. It comes as U.K.-China relations have become increasingly strained on issues ranging from espionage and cyberattacks to human rights and Hong Kong. CGN is already working with France’s EDF in the construction of a nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, in southwest England.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-could-bar-china-firm-from-nuclear-projects/article35551534.ece

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Evaluating India’s options in Afghanistan||It is not a coincidence that the United States is exiting Afghanistan at the same time that the focus of its foreign policy is shifting to East Asia. There is growing consensus in Washington DC that the U.S., instead of staying engaged in the lost wars, which adds little value to American power, should now urgently prepare itself for the unfolding geopolitical contest with China. America’s strategic response to China’s rise is its Indo-Pacific strategy, which seeks to build a bloc of Indian and Pacific Ocean democracies aimed at containing China’s rise and challenging its high-functioning single party dictatorship. The U.S. wants India to play a key role in this bloc, which along with Australia and Japan, make up the so-called Quad grouping. But there is one problem. India, unlike the other members, is the only continental Asian power in the Quad, which shares a contested land border with China and is vulnerable to the geopolitical changes in the Eurasian landmass. The U.S. may have retreated from Afghanistan as part of a grand strategy to take on China in maritime Asia, in which it needs India’s involvement, and India might find it tempting to join the ranks, especially after China’s aggression on the Line of Actual Control last year. But the irony is that the American withdrawal and the vacuum it leaves in Afghanistan and continental Asia in general — which is being filled by China and Russia — is reinforcing India’s identity as a continental Asian power. Barring a brief interregnum in the 1990s, India has historically enjoyed good ties with Afghanistan, which go back to the 1950 Treaty of Friendship. Indian interests and influence suffered when the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, captured Kabul in 1996. But India was back in action as soon as the Taliban were ousted from power after the U.S. invasion in 2001. It has made huge investments and commitments ever since, which run into over $3 billion, and cultivated strong economic and defence ties with the Afghan government. Now, it is again staring at uncertainty with the U.S. pullback having effectively changed the balance of power in Afghanistan and the Taliban making rapid territorial gains. The U.S.’s strategic objectives in Afghanistan were limited, as U.S. President Joe Biden himself pointed out earlier this month — killing Osama bin Laden and disrupting al-Qaeda networks. Defeating the Taliban and nation-building were part of the neoconservative ideological project, which has evidently failed. This means, the U.S., having met its realist objectives, can abandon the Afghan government and exit the theatre — which is what Mr. Biden is doing. But India cannot. It has to protect its investments, prevent Afghanistan from becoming another safe haven for anti-India terrorist groups, and also check Pakistan deepening its influence in Kabul. Talking with the Taliban So what should India do? One option, as many commentators have already pointed out, is to hold talks with the Taliban. India has already established contacts with the Taliban in Doha. Talking to them would allow New Delhi to seek security guarantees from the insurgents in return for continued development assistance or other pledges (in the 1990s, India had backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance) as well as explore the possibility of the Taliban’s autonomy from Pakistan. At this point, talking to the Taliban looks inevitable. But India should not overlook the deep ties between Pakistan’s security establishment and the Haqqani Network, a major faction within the Taliban that’s driving the successful campaigns on the battlefield. The U.S. overlooked it while fighting the Taliban along with Pakistan, and it paid a heavy price for it. There is no guarantee that India’s quest for engagement with the Taliban would produce a desirable outcome. So India should broad-base its options. While talking to the Taliban to protect its interests, New Delhi should also enhance aid to Afghanistan’s legitimate government and security forces and work with other regional powers for long-term stability in the country. Kabul versus the Taliban True, the Taliban now control or contest most of Afghanistan’s countryside. But still, it is not a foregone conclusion that they could take Kabul easily. The Afghan military has some 200,000 battle-hardened soldiers, including the highly trained special forces. In the cities, which saw relative freedoms and rights compared to the dark period of the Taliban regime, the government, despite its infighting, corruption and incompetence, still commands support. There is no Northern Alliance this time. The Taliban have already taken northern districts, including Badakhshan and Takhar. The only force that is standing up to the Taliban is the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. India should urgently step up training Afghan forces and provide military hardware, intelligence and logistical and financial support so that Kabul can continue to defend the cities. New Delhi should also coordinate with other regional powers to support the Afghan government because if the government forces crumble before the Taliban, the prospects for a political settlement would be narrowed. Why should a winning Taliban make concessions? Regional solution There is a convergence of interests between India and three key regional players — China, Russia and Iran — in seeing a political settlement in Afghanistan. These three countries have already opened public, direct talks with the Taliban. But these contacts are largely tactical in nature. For China, whose restive Xinjiang province shares a border with Afghanistan, a jihadist-oriented Taliban regime would not serve its internal interests. Russia, which fears that instability would spill over into the former Soviet Republics, has already moved to secure its Central Asian perimeter. For the Shia theocratic Iran, a Sunni Deobandi Taliban with which it had almost gone to war in 1998, will continue to remain an ideological, sectarian and strategic challenge. None of these countries would like to see the Taliban taking over Kabul militarily, which means there would be an isolated Sunni Islamist regime in a country with fractured ethnic equations. There would neither be legitimacy for a Taliban regime nor peace in Afghanistan. India, to break this impasse, should take a layered approach. Its immediate goal should be the safety and security of its personnel and investments. The long-term goal should be finding a political solution to the crisis. And if a political solution is not achieved, it should seek non-conventional methods, like what it did in the 1990s, to offer support to its allies within Afghanistan and retain some influence. None of this can be achieved unless it works together with the regional powers. Russia has cultivated links with the Taliban in recent years. India would need Russia’s support in any form of direct engagement with the Taliban. When it comes to Afghanistan, Iran is an irreplaceable country. It shares a long border with Afghanistan and has built contacts through several stakeholders in the country, especially the ethnic minorities. The original objective of India’s Chabahar project in Iran was to create a direct access to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. This direct access is critical for India in all different scenarios — move supplies to Kabul in larger quantities, retain its presence in the event of a civil war or carry out covert operations if the Taliban take power by force. But India, under pressure from the U.S., slowed down on the Chabahar connectivity projects, which finally prompted Iran to drop India and go ahead. Building strategic ties with Iran, irrespective of the U.S.’s policy towards the Islamic Republic, is essential for India’s Afghan bets. Finally, India should talk with China, with the objective of finding a political settlement and lasting stability in Afghanistan. Central to this approach is India striking the right balance between its continental realities and the U.S.’s pivot to maritime Asia. The U.S., and the West in general, are done with Afghanistan. India, as one of the countries that would be impacted by the consequences of American withdrawal, has to work with Eurasian powers to protect its interests and stabilise Afghanistan. stanly.johny@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/evaluating-indias-options-in-afghanistan/article35551509.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Did ‘Orange’ counter ‘Saffron’ in Karnataka?||Why was it so difficult, but necessary, for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to retire an old warhorse such as B.S. Yediyurappa? After all, he clearly defied all that the party publicly stands for. He shows no distaste for engaging in old-style corruption, and has even paid the price for it. He makes no bones about extending his ‘rule by next-of-kin’ in promoting the de facto power of B.Y. Vijayendra. But above all, he showed a degree of fairness to the Muslim population of the State (approximately 13%) when he categorically stated, at the height of the pandemic in 2020, that ‘no one should say a word against Muslims; this is a warning’. Such fairness is quite alien to many other members of the party, which obliges its members to foster a hatred of Muslims. His warning flew against the successful ethnic profiling of Muslims following the Tablighi meeting at Nizamuddin Markaz in March 2020. Naturally, it only earned him greater displeasure. He has symbolically ended two years of a troubled time as Karnataka’s Chief Minister in a blaze of advertisements recounting his achievements. As he counts his days to the Margdarshak Mandal , or to a safe sinecure elsewhere, Mr. Yediyurappa has revealed his capacity to rally support from the local men in orange – the mathadishas (head of mutts) of several Lingayat (and a few other) mutts, of which Karnataka has a dense and active network. Small groups meeting in his support coalesced into a gathering of about 450 who convened at Bengaluru’s Palace Grounds on Sunday. Generous grants Mr. Yediyurappa had inaugurated his last victory in 2008 with generous grants to these mutts. Between 2008 and 2013, the BJP government had granted at least Rs. 152 crore to 20 named institutions. In his new, though illegitimately obtained, time in power, he steered Karnataka’s decades-long legacy of development in completely new directions through the creation of caste-based development corporations – one of which was the Veershaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation that was endowed with Rs. 500 crore last year. Mr. Yediyurappa made development all about caste. But did the men in orange come out on the streets of Karnataka to express their gratitude for this largesse? The public engagements of the mutts, particularly in the world of education, have been about a century in the making, when Lingayat mutts first began to build institutions to serve those of their own caste, and later, a much larger community of Kannadigas. From the 1970s, they have expanded their educational engagements to set up professional colleges and related facilities. Today, for instance, the Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara (JSS) group of institutions number close to 350 educational institutions, while the Sree Siddaganga Mutt at Tumkur has an enviable 125. To add to their institutional strength, there has been an increased involvement of mutts and mathadishas in all parts of Karnataka in the developmental works of their regions. This may range from building bridges and irrigation works. They are even involved in establishing a balance between new livelihoods and ecological sustainability. For example, making iron ore mining companies in Chitradurga more accountable to the communities that they have thoroughly ravaged. The Karnataka mutts have been, as M.M. Kalburgi so well described it, an ‘unauthorised government’. Wielding a moral, rather than a legal authority, mathadishas of especially the Lingayat mutts have long established themselves as the arbiters of everyday life in Karnataka. What of their engagement with the world of electoral politics? It could consist of nudging adherents towards a particular candidate. Former Karnataka Chief Minister S. Nijalingappa was a ‘victim’ of this process. Participating in public protests became common as mathadishas and political representatives together demanded Other Backward Class (OBC) reservation for the Vokkaligas and the Lingayats in the late 1980s. In 2017, they demanded separate religious status for the Lingayats. This engagement has gone further today. Attempts are being made to reduce the cacophony and expense of electoral politics, particularly in local body elections, by urging electorates to ‘unanimously’ choose one or another candidate, who then wins without a contest. This does not bode well for a democracy, but reveals the mutt’s formidable local political power. Current assertion What of the current assertion by the men in orange in support of Mr. Yediyurappa or another Lingayat leader? Is it to enlarge the powers they already enjoy, free of the accountability of the elected representative? Or has the promised ‘double-engine sarkara ’, in fact, shown signs of disobediently pulling in a direction quite opposed to the Union government? Ironically, the power of the mathadishas , strengthened no doubt by the wider political climate that privileges all men in orange, may precisely be that which undermines the homogenising Hindutva project. It was the dangerous threat to Hindu unity that was exposed in the 2017 campaign for the recognition of the Lingayats as belonging to a separate religion, a demand that was successfully beaten back — at least temporarily — by the Union government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Minister were able to get away with yoking ‘ sanatana ’ (eternal or absolute dharma) to ‘ pragathipara ’ (progressive) when inaugurating the renovations to Anubhava Mantapa at Basavakalyan in Bidar – a move that sent up a futile cry of protest among those who saw this as a contradiction of Basava’s ideals. But again, it was the radical heterogeneity of the mutts that came into public display for three months after January 2021, when the mathadishas of a sub-sect of the Lingayats, the Panchamasali Lingayats, marched towards Bengaluru, demanding a rearrangement of reservation categories to better represent their sub-caste. Mr. Yediyurappa was himself besieged in this war that broke out between the castes and sub-castes. The second wave of COVID-19 arrived as a grotesque succour, but he still had to claw back the dangerous tilt in power towards the men in orange when he physically rapped the wrist of Vachananda Swami, after the latter publicly asked him to accommodate more Panchamasali Lingayats in his Cabinet. We have, therefore, witnessed the contradictory process by which the unity that the Union government strives for is continually undermined by the fractious struggles of the region and its castes. Karnataka’s mathadishas – whom no political party can do without – are a mixed bunch. Some such as the then Nidumamidi Swami, and the current Nijagunananda Swami, have publicly campaigned against the BJP’s communal politics.

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||An emigration Bill that does not go far enough||In early June 2021, the Ministry of External Affairs invited public inputs to the Emigration Bill 2021 (https://bit.ly/2VerwzX andhttps://bit.ly/2ULrNdS). The Bill could be introduced in Parliament soon and presents a long overdue opportunity to reform the recruitment process for nationals seeking employment abroad. Exploitative conditions For years, independent investigations into migrant worker conditions have underlined serious exploitative practices which include large recruitment charges, contract substitution, deception, retention of passports, non-payment or underpayment of wages, poor living conditions, discrimination and other forms of ill-treatment. In recent months, media reports have highlighted how the majority of migrant worker deaths in the Arab Gulf States/West Asia are attributed to heart attacks and respiratory failures, whose causes are unexplained and poorly understood. Labour migration is governed by the Emigration Act, 1983 (https://bit.ly/3i4gfvd and https://bit.ly/2VcJm6s) which sets up a mechanism for hiring through government-certified recruiting agents — individuals or public or private agencies. It outlines obligations for agents to conduct due diligence of prospective employers, sets up a cap on service fees, and establishes a government review of worker travel and employment documents (known as emigration clearances) to 18 countries mainly in West Asian states and South-East Asian countries (https://bit.ly/2WmmfHp). Improvements, drawbacks The Emigration Bill 2021 is an improvement over the 1983 Act. It launches a new emigration policy division, establishes help desks and welfare committees, requires manpower agencies to conduct pre-departure briefings for migrants, and increases accountability of brokers and other intermediaries who are also involved in labour hiring. But the Bill does not go far enough. First, the 2021 Bill’s purpose “to consolidate and amend the law relating to emigration of citizens of India”, lacks a human rights framework aimed at securing the rights of migrants and their families. Progressive labour regimes do so. For example, in a country such as the Philippines, it explicitly recognises the contributions of Filipino workers and “the dignity and fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Filipino citizens”. Another significant drawback is that the Bill permits manpower agencies to charge workers’ service fees, and even allows agents to set their own limits. International labour standards such as International Labour Organization (ILO) Private Employment Agencies Convention No. 181 and the ILO general principles and operational guidelines for fair recruitment recognises that it is employers, not workers who should bear recruitment payments including the costs of their visas, air travel, medical exams, and service charges to recruiters. Large-scale surveys by the ILO and the World Bank show that Indian workers pay exorbitant charges for their jobs and that poorer workers pay progressively larger fees — Indians in Saudi Arabia paid on average $1,507 in recruitment charges; their counterparts in Qatar paid $1,156 (https://bit.ly/3zzxLxh). To some, recruitment charges might appear like a justified service fee, but the tens of thousands of rupees that workers pay far exceed the real cost of recruitment. When low wage migrants pick up the tab it makes them vulnerable to indebtedness and exploitation. Worker-paid recruitment fees eat into their savings, force them to take high-interest loans, live on shoe-string budgets, and in the worst cases of abuse, leave workers in situations of debt bondage — a form of forced labour. But perhaps the Bill’s most glaring inclusion is that it permits government authorities to punish workers by cancelling or suspending their passports and imposing fines up to Rs. 50,000 for violating any of the Bill’s provisions. When enforced, it can be used as a tool to crackdown on workers who migrate through unregistered brokers or via irregular arrangements such as on tourist visas. Criminalising the choices migrant workers make either because they are unaware of the law, under the influence of their recruiters, or simply desperate to find a decent job is deplorable, runs contradictory to the purpose of protecting migrants and their families, and violates international human rights standards. Recruiters and public officials could misuse the law to instil fear among workers and report or threaten to report them. Migrants in an irregular situation who fear that they could be fined or have their passports revoked, are also less likely to make complaints or pursue remedies for abuses faced. Scant gender dimensions This Bill does not also adequately reflect the gender dimensions of labour migration where women have limited agency in recruitment compared to their counterparts and are more likely to be employed in marginalised and informal sectors and/or isolated occupations in which labour, physical, psychological, and sexual abuse are common. The Bill also provides limited space for worker representation or civil society engagement in the policy and welfare bodies that it sets up. To ensure that labour recruitment works for the tens of thousands of Indian women and men who migrate outside our borders each year, the Ministry of External Affairs must start at the top, and draft a clearer purpose which explicitly recognises the contributions of Indian workers, the unique challenges they face, and uphold the dignity and human rights of migrants and their families. Then it must address the specific provisions that diverge from this purpose.

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Diriliş: Ertuğrul is more than just a Turkish delight||As Turkey’s geopolitical and regional ambitions grow, its soft power influence through its most popular television export, Diriliş: Ertuğrul (Resurrection: Ertuğrul), does not seem to wane. Recently, its first publicly-owned floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage and regasification vessel — also named Ertuğrul Gazi — was inaugurated. Present at this event, which would enable the country to cover much of its energy needs, was President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Returning to its Islamic roots and re-establishing the Ottoman glory have been a top priority for Mr. Erdoğan and his AK Party. Hence, last September, while commemorating the 739th death anniversary of Ertuğrul Ghazi, he reiterated the “goal of preserving Anatolia as a homeland”. Ertuğrul reflects that ambition for prestige and national assertion. Produced by Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), the national broadcaster, this historical extravaganza, set in the 13th century, has been inspired by the life of Ertuğrul Ghazi, whose son, Sultan Osman, became the first Caliph of the Ottoman Empire. His heroic acts managed to capture the hearts of billions of viewers across 72 countries and became popularly known as the Muslim Game of Thrones . Mr. Erdoğan, a great proponent of this show, has been playing an active leadership role in the Islamic world — whether it is in Afghanistan, supporting Bangladesh with regard to the Rohingya issue, aiding Azerbaijan against Armenia or extending its presence in North Africa. For someone who has been modelling himself as an Ottoman sultan, a drama series like Ertuğrul is an effective communication vehicle. In 2019, Turkey, Pakistan and Malaysia had proposed setting up a television channel to promote Muslim heroes and counter Islamophobia. While that did not take off, the following Ramzan, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan recommended the show to his youth. Soon, a quarter of the global audience were Pakistanis and by July 2021, Pakistan Television Corporation’s (PTV) YouTube channel gained 14.9 million subscribers. Extending beyond its political leadership, the Turkey-Pakistan ‘brotherhood’ is witnessed across shops and hotels in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, where the two flags fly together. Recently, Bangladeshis turned fans after some Bengali-dubbed episodes became available. The Turkish Ambassador there, Mustafa Osman Turan, after visiting Deepto, the popular private TV channel, said such shows would help bring two fraternal countries together. Meanwhile, Deepto has planned to purchase the series. Incidentally, Bangladesh has become the fourth-largest arms buyer from Turkey, reportedly receiving weapons worth about $60 million in the first quarter of 2021. The historical conquests of the hero have also resonated with Kashmiris in India. In May 2020, a TRT official tweeted that more Indians searched for these videos on YouTube than for Shah Rukh Khan. Many parents in Kashmir have even chosen to name their newborns Ertugrul, and a restaurant in downtown Srinagar is themed around it. In August 2020, Azerbaijan became a major gas supplier in Turkey. A month later, the latter supported the former after intense fighting broke out between Azerbaijan and Armenia. During this time, it was also announced that Ertuğrul would be dubbed in the Azeri language and aired on its state television channel, AZ TV. However, not the entire Muslim world has taken to it. In a bid to curb Turkey’s soft power influence, some religious organisations in Egypt and Saudi Arabia called for a ban. Saudi Arabia, which holds a grudge against the Ottomans, launched a big budget production titled Mamalik el-Nar (Kingdoms of Fire) that has not caused any ripple. The popularity of Ertuğrul is in a way reflective of Turkey’s growing influence around the world, including Venezuela where Mr. Erdoğan shares a warm relationship with President Nicolas Maduro. Mr. Maduro not only endorsed the series but also visited the sets during his trip to Turkey in 2018. For now, it seems that wherever Mr. Erdoğan goes, Ertuğrul  follows. With the christening of an LNG vessel, it wouldn’t be wrong to assume that Ertuğrul , which has become a symbol of Turkish power, has expanded beyond being a historical hero to other critical sectors of its society and economy. At the inauguration, Mr. Erdoğan said his government was “determined to ensure a more prosperous life” for each one of its 84 million citizens.

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Yet another colonial legacy||A recent event in Kerala, though far from the industrial centres of India, may hold a clue to understanding the malaise crippling the nation’s industry. This event took the form of one of the State’s major employers making a much publicised investment outside Kerala. What is unusual about this is that the company had earlier announced that it would make an even larger investment within the State itself. The negative publicity given to its departure by the company was considered unnecessary by the State government and experts have pointed out that the original promise of investing this larger amount in the State is incredible, as its volume is several times the firm’s market capitalisation. The investor, however, announced that he had been hounded out by the regulatory authorities. Independently, journalists have confirmed that the company’s premises had been subjected to 11 inspections in one month by the concerned government departments, and its CEO had stated on public television that he had been charged with over 70 compliance failures following these. In a swift move, Kerala’s Minister for Industries appeared on public television, where he opened himself to questioning. He stated categorically that the inspections had been in response to alleged violation of human rights and labour laws by the company, and that they had not been ordered by the Industries Ministry of the State. We have no reason to disbelieve him, but are left wondering about the legitimacy of a regulatory arrangement under which the elected government of the day has no say on inspections, even if some of them are related to court rulings. The picture of an ungoverned bureaucracy that emerges from this incident is breathtaking in its implication for the kind of democracy that we are living in. But it is not difficult to see where this originates from. It was the governance model during colonial rule in India. In an insightful commentary on his compatriots of the East India Company, the economist Adam Smith had observed that their only concern was to build a fortune by any means and to get out of the country as fast as possible, no matter what the consequences for its inhabitants. However, even this understanding of the rationale of colonialism is not enough to appreciate its debilitating consequences for India. To hold India, the British invented an intermediary class standing between themselves and the natives. For the latter, there was no redress against the depredations of this class, whose excesses the colonial regime tolerated as a small price for retaining their colony. Crippling effect The colonial administrative apparatus has been retained intact in Independent India. Of course, this was not inevitable. The toxic measures that enslaved Indians could have been removed forthwith, but for reasons that are not difficult to comprehend, India’s political class kept them. Now, it has the Supreme Court asking why stick with a sedition law that had been used to immobilise Indians. While many understand the absurdity of the sedition law today, and the more aware among them can see how it kills our democracy, the crippling effect of colonial practices that govern economic activity have gone unscrutinised. Random inspection of a company’s premises by State functionaries sits at their pinnacle, preventing India’s industry from achieving its potential. On the 30th anniversary of the economic reforms, a puzzle that needs resolution is that while they have been focused on the manufacturing sector, the manufacturing sector has not expanded relative to the economy. Its share has remained quite the same. We may just have received a clue from Kerala to comprehend this outcome. While the elegantly crafted trade and industry reforms have addressed the policy regime, they have not addressed the conditions under which production takes place in this country. This may have held back investment, standing in the way of the expansion of the manufacturing sector as intended. India’s regulatory regime needs a radical overhaul.

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Change at the helm||By unseating B.S. Yediyurappa from the Chief Minister’s chair in Karnataka, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set in motion a new strategy for its consolidation in the State. Considering that this change of guard has been in the making for a while, the party must have accounted for the ramifications. The BJP had to change its Chief Minister in Uttarakhand twice within a span of four months recently, pointing to the pitfalls in effecting changes even when they are premeditated. Mr. Yediyurappa is no pushover and remains agile and active even at the age of 78. He has already said he would remain active in politics. At least for now, he has no intention of crossing swords with the central leadership of the party, which gave him the marching orders. But the Lingayat community that he belongs to has left no opportunity to express its displeasure. Community leaders and seers have come out openly in support of the displaced Chief Minister. Lingayats form the axis of the BJP’s social base in Karnataka. Mr. Yediyurappa has been the mastermind of the party’s rise in Karnataka and became the party’s first Chief Minister in a southern State, in 2008. In 2018, the BJP did not win a majority, but a year later, he undermined the Congress-Janata Dal(S) coalition government by engineering defections. Two years later, he is handing over the baton, leaving the fate of the defectors in the hands of his successor. The BJP high command has been wary of strong regional leaders, and Mr. Yediyurappa has given it no reason to relax. His cunning has been a double-edged sword for the party. On the one hand it helped the party’s rise, but on the other he used it to consolidate his own personal power. He parted ways with the party once and even went to jail on corruption charges. He has been brazen in promoting a son, B.Y. Vijayendra, in the BJP, and as the inheritor of the Lingayat mantle. The BJP’s game plan appears to be to hold the community within its tent, but loosen its grip over power, mimicking its approach to the Patels in Gujarat who had turned the party into a vehicle of their domination until Narendra Modi arrived on the scene. It took a while before the Patels reconciled to their changed status in the BJP. The high-command party that the BJP has become may like to promote a Lingayat leader, though not necessarily as the new Chief Minister, who will be more compliant to its wishes than Mr. Yediyurappa. A lot will also depend on Mr. Yediyurappa’s plans and his command over the Lingayats, once out of power. But the BJP’s new strategy should not involve communal polarisation and its new Chief Minister must refrain from playing competitive Hindutva with other Chief Ministers of the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/change-at-the-helm/article35551503.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Wounded mountains||The tragic death of nine tourists in a landslip in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh is another pointer to the fragility of the ecology of the Himalayan States. Extraordinarily heavy rain pummelled the State recently, leaving the hill slopes unstable and causing floods in built-up areas including Dharamshala. The descending boulders from destabilised terrain, which crushed a bridge like a matchstick, are a source of worry even for cautious local residents, and for unwary visitors, such as the tourists travelling in a van, they can turn into sudden disaster. Himachal is famed for its scenic vistas and welcoming summer climate, and drew a few hundred thousand tourists in June this year as States began relaxing the controls for COVID-19. There was justified alarm at the prospect of a fresh surge in infections, prompting Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur to appeal for COVID-appropriate behaviour. Unfortunately, there was not enough vigil against travel to risky areas, in the wake of a disastrous year for tourism, resulting in the mishap in Kinnaur’s Basteri area. What should worry Himachal, and neighbouring Uttarakhand, is that the States may be entering a phase of irreversible decline because of losses to their ecology; frequent landslides may become inevitable. Bootstrapping an incompatible model of development in the hills, represented by big hydroelectric projects and large-scale construction activity involving destruction of forests and damming of rivers, is an invitation to harm. Mega hydropower, which Himachal Pradesh is working to tap as a significant source of “green” power that substitutes energy from fossil fuels, could alter several aspects of ecology, rendering it vulnerable to the effects of extreme events such as cloudbursts, flash floods, landslides and earthquakes. The parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy during 2018-19 noted that the State could more than double its existing harnessed hydropower potential of 10,547 MW. Kinnaur is a focus point for such development, centred around the potential of the glacially-fed Sutlej valley, but one scientific estimate warns that avaricious tapping of the river through all planned projects would impound nearly a quarter of its waters in dams, and divert a staggering 72% through tunnels. Other researchers, studying the 2015 Nepal earthquake, point to high seismicity causing fatal landslides and severe damage to hydropower structures in the Himalayas; the cost of power produced was underestimated, while the potential was overestimated. Evidently, it is impossible to assign a real value to the costs to people and communities, together with the loss of pristine forests that weak afforestation programmes cannot replace. As catastrophic weather events inflict frequent, heavy losses, Himachal Pradesh and other Himalayan States can only watch their ecological base erode. Changing course may yet preserve a lot of their natural riches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/wounded-mountains/article35551504.ece

The Judges, Mr. William Booth, talked to U.N. committees inquiring into South Africa’s racial separation practices. He said he saw the new and expectant graves in a cemetery for blacks in the Dimbaza area. He also told of visiting a prison for blacks, which the authorities called one of the best, where he found “35 to 40 inmates crowded into a 30’ by 30’ cell, where they are expected to live for 10 to 15 years.” He said in Dimbaza, described as a settlement for 7,000 blacks in the southern part of the republic, 50 per cent of all children born there die of malnutrition before they are one year of age. Parents decorate their sorry little graves with milk bottles, rattles and toys so they will be happy in death as they were unhappy in life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/graves-for-blacks-not-yet-dead/article35551514.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Commodity prices boosting exports’ value: Moody’s arm||High commodity prices have boosted the value of India’s exports, which have hit a record $95 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and outbound trade is likely to lead the country towards a recovery after the pandemic’s ‘one-two punch’ hit the economy, Moody’s Analytics said in a report on Monday. Stating that India is struggling to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination, the firm reckoned that ‘herd resilience’ — when 65% of the population is fully immunised — is now expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. Only Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand are expected to reach those levels of vaccination later, among India’s peers in the region. In an economic outlook report on the Asia Pacific Region titled ‘The Delta Roadblock’, the financial intelligence firm said the delta variant of COVID-19 is among the key factors adversely affecting economies. ‘Exports, a lifeline’ It termed exports a lifeline for the region which are now well above pre-pandemic levels and continued to rise in the April-June quarter. “Even in India and Indonesia, where exports make up relatively small shares of the economy, high commodity prices have boosted the value of exports. This is one factor that helped reinvigorate India after its first devastating wave of COVID-19,” the firm said in its report.   “[India has] suffered lengthy economic shutdowns, accompanied by only modest fiscal support provided to SMEs and low-income households, that could lead to very deep and lasting scarring as they struggle to reopen businesses, pay back loans, or find employment as the economy finally recovers,” it concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/commodity-prices-boosting-exports-value-moodys-arm/article35551486.ece

A year earlier, “net profit after tax from continuing operations & discontinued operations” was at Rs. 543.93 crore, L&T said in a filing. Total income in the April-June quarter of FY22 rose to Rs. 29,982.70 crore from Rs. 22,037.37 crore. The engineering and construction conglomerate’s expenses were at Rs. 27,708.08 crore as against Rs. 21,367.63 crore earlier. Project progress was impacted with regional lockdowns, shortage of industrial oxygen and supply chain disruptions. International revenues at Rs. 11,186 crore constituted 38% of total revenue. The company bagged orders worth Rs. 26,557 crore at the group level during the quarter, a growth of 13%. Orders were received in various segments across metros, rural water supply, minerals and metals, residential, power transmission and distribution, power and hydrocarbon offshore sectors. International orders comprised 34% of order inflow. With expectation of a repeat normal monsoon, the agriculture sector is likely to remain buoyant, it said, adding the economy is expected to gain lost ground, aided by the fiscal stimulus packages announced, adoption of new COVID compatible occupational models by businesses and vaccination efforts gathering momentum.

The Reserve Bank-led monetary policy panel (MPC) is scheduled to announce the third monetary policy review on August 6, amid the continuing spike in retail inflation that has breached the 6% upper-tolerance level for the past two consecutive months. “We expect the MPC to stick with a dovish pause in the August 6 policy, overlooking the ‘transitory hump’ in inflation,” Bank of America Securities (BofA) India house economists said. “Thereafter, the normalisation path will depend on the evolution of growth, inflation and the pandemic.

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Sharath surmounts Apolonia’s challenge||A. Sharath Kamal, the flag-bearer of Indian table tennis, entered the round of 32 in men’s singles while the country’s campaign in women’s singles ended on Monday in Tokyo. Sharath overcame a stiff resistance from Portugal’s Tiago Apolonia to make it to the third round. While 10th seed Sofia Polcanova of Austria proved too hot to handle for Manika Batra in the women’s third round, Sutirtha Mukherjee failed to put up any resistance against 32nd seed Fu Yu of Portugal. Sharath, seeded 20th, used his power-packed backhand winners to precision while overpowering his Chennai teammate in the Ultimate Table Tennis league in six games. Sharath won 2-11, 11-8, 11-5, 9-11, 11-6, 11-9. Sharath will next face defending Olympic and World champion Ma Long of China. Later as Manika — a day after surprising 20th seed Margaryta Pesotska of Ukraine — took to the table, Sharath may have been in a bit of dilemma. After all, it was a clash between his partners for India and UTT franchise. Forehand targeted The left-handed Polcanova gave an exhibition of how to negate the advantage that Manika derives from her long-pimpled rubber that she prefers to use on the backhand. For a majority of the first three games, Polcanova targeted Manika’s forehand and the European was far too superior and quick in the rally. Despite getting her act together in the fourth set, Manika couldn’t snatch a set from her fancied opponent to go down 11-8, 11-2, 11-5, 11-7 in 27 minutes. In the women’s second round, Sutirtha lost 11-3, 11-3, 11-5, 11-5 to the 42-year-old veteran of Chinese origin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sharath-surmounts-apolonias-challenge/article35551752.ece
27 July 2021||Tokyo,||Titmus wins duel in the pool against American great Ledecky||Australia’s Ariarne Titmus won a thrilling 400m freestyle duel with American great Katie Ledecky in the Olympic pool on Monday as Caeleb Dressel launched his bid for a seven-gold spree in style. The Tokyo Aquatics Centre also witnessed another dominant 100m breaststroke swim by world-record holder Adam Peaty, who defended his title to give Britain its first gold medal of the Games. Absorbing encounter Ledecky came to Japan on the back of four gold medals and a silver at Rio in 2016, but Titmus has been snapping at her heels, ousting her as World champion in 2019 and topping the timesheets this season. Titmus inched clear over the final 50m to touch in 3min 56.69sec after an absorbing encounter. Only world record-holder Ledecky has ever gone quicker. The United States team spearheaded by Dressel stormed to the men’s 4x100m relay gold medal in the third-quickest time ever. Zach Apple brought them home after Dressel led off, with sizzling legs from Blake Pieroni and Bowen Becker ensuring they touched in 3:08.97s, ahead of Italy and Australia. It could be the start of a seven-title spree for Dressel, 24, whose 13 world titles have prompted inevitable comparisons with Michael Phelps — winner of eight golds in 2008 and 23 in total. The unstoppable Peaty extended his dominance of the 100m breaststroke event, powering to the line in 57.37s ahead of Dutchman Arno Kamminga while Canada’s Maggie MacNeil dethroned Sarah Sjostrom to win the women’s 100m butterfly. Britain's Tom Daley paid tribute to his late father after he and Matty Lee edged hot favourites China to the gold in synchronised 10m platform diving. Finally, a gold! Daley, 27, who revealed that he might have missed the Games after knee surgery, wiped away tears on the podium as he finally added gold to the bronzes he won at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Games. The Britons held their nerve on the last dive to win the final with 471.81 points, with the Chinese Chen Aisen and Cao Yuan second on 470.58 and Russians Aleksandr Bondar and Viktor Minibaev a distant third. Daley’s thoughts turned to his father, Rob who died of cancer in 2011, aged 40.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/titmus-wins-duel-in-the-pool-against-american-great-ledecky/article35551850.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I am mentally strong and I’ll remain that way’||Hours after she ended her second Olympic journey by becoming the first Indian female paddler to win two singles rounds in Olympics, Manika Batra opened up about the last fortnight that has kept her in the headlines, not just for her exploits on the table. How have the last eight days been? Overall, it went really well, but not today. If you compare my stint in first Olympics (in 2016), I am — not satisfied, but — really happy with my performance over here. My aim is 2024, so I have to train harder once I return. I am really happy with the way I played against the higher-ranked Ukrainian (Margaryta Pesotska, 20th seed and World No. 32) in the second round. What went wrong in mixed doubles? They (Lin Yu Jun and Cheng I Ching) are a real strong opponent. They are World No. 1, were seeded third over here but they are really strong. The boy (Lin) was just way too fast and had a strong ball. He was attacking relentless. We did try and put up our best (but, it wasn’t enough). Against Sofia Polcanova today (Monday), you never looked to be in the game… Yes, I think my game and my mind weren’t on the same page. I was a bit nervous and perhaps expected too much from myself. Of course, you have to aim higher but I think I tried way too hard. I think I was desperate to win rather than enjoying the game. I will blame myself on that. I should have enjoyed myself and taken it point by point. The Team Leader of the table tennis contingent (M.P. Singh) has said that you refused to let national coach Soumyadeep Roy sit for your matches. Your response? I think sometimes it’s portrayed wrongly. Roy da is Sutirtha’s (Sutirtha Mukherjee) personal coach and Sanmay (Paranjape, Manika’s personal coach) was in the gallery. Sanmay knows my game and I would prefer that Sanmay would advise me (in singles). Once that didn’t happen, I thought I would play alone since Sanmay and I were devising strategies ahead of every match and he was also telling me from the gallery. So was there an ego issue between you and Roy? He sat for our mixed doubles match. Later, he asked me and I told him I would play alone. He was fine with it. He didn’t say anything. I don’t know if anyone said anything in the media but it’s okay. I am mentally strong and I’ll remain that way only.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-am-mentally-strong-and-ill-remain-that-way/article35551852.ece

The 26-year-old Ramkumar was pleased with his fighting performance as he had won his first four rounds in three sets each. It included a victory over second seed and compatriot Prajnesh Gunneswaran. “It was a long week for me, but a good one here in North Carolina. I could sustain a good game thanks to the grace of God. Also, I was in touch with coach T. Chandrasekaran sir before every match, and he guided me well. I am grateful to him,” said Ramkumar. Incidentally, it was Krueger who had beaten Ramkumar in the second qualifying round of the Newport ATP event last week. After the heart-breaking 9-11 loss in the fifth set of the final qualifying round in Wimbledon, the 227th ranked Ramkumar has stepped up his performance with increased confidence. Taste of Grand Slam He did get the taste of playing in his first Grand Slam as he got into the mixed doubles draw with Ankita Raina, and ended up playing Rohan Bopanna and Sania Mirza in the first round. “It was a wonderful feeling, playing first time in Wimbledon. It was an extremely tight last round of qualifying event, but I will take the positives and keep working hard,” said Ramkumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ramkumar-happy-despite-losing-in-the-final/article35551500.ece

Her campaign, however, came to an end as she lost to fourth-seeded Manon Brunet of France 15-7 in the women’s sabre second round on Monday. It was always going to be difficult for Bhavani against the Frenchwoman, ranked third in the world. In fact, the 27-year-old Indian had lost all four previous encounters to Brunet. However, Bhavani wasn't overawed by the opponent and took the battle to Brunet with some wonderful riposte and attack. But, the Frenchwoman, who had finished fourth in the 2016 Rio Olympics, seemed to have all the answers. At the turn, the score read 8-2, summing up the difference between the two. Though Bhavani showed her skill and won a few points, it wasn't enough. Earlier, Bhavani had put it across Tunisia’s Nadia Ben Azizi 15-3 in the first round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhavani-fails-to-make-it-past-second-round/article35551756.ece

If Suryakumar’s second T20I half-century — an attractive 50 off 34 balls with five fours and two sixes — ensured a decent total of 164 for five, Yuzvendra Chahal (4-0-19-1) was niggardly. Deepak Chahar (two for 24 in three overs) and Bhuvneshwar (four for 22 in 3.3 overs) struck when it mattered most, bowling the hosts out for 126 in 18.3 overs. From 111 for four in the 16th over, Sri Lanka lost its last six wickets for 15 runs. Debutant Charith Asalanka (44, 26b, 3x4, 3x6) played his heart out for Sri Lanka. But once he was dismissed by Chahar, caught in the deep going for another maximum, the hosts fell apart.

27 July 2021||Colombo,||Eyes on Samson as India aims to wrap it up||India will want Sanju Samson to translate his phenomenal talent into consistent performances when it tries to wrap up the T20 International series against Sri Lanka by winning the second match here on Tuesday. Having won the opening encounter, India is unlikely to change the winning combination unless the team management decides to rest Prithvi Shaw and Suryakumar Yadav, who are getting ready to link up with the red-ball team in the United Kingdom. However, it is expected that both will play on Tuesday and be rested for the last game once India has sealed the series. In case there is an alternative plan, Devdutt Padikkal and Ruturaj Gaikwad may get a look-in. Minor worry The other minor worry for the team would be Hardik Pandya’s batting form. His bowling has been steady, but is nowhere near what he used to be as a skiddy pacer before his back surgery. The Indian bowlers put up a fantastic show in the first game and Yuzvendra Chahal would like to do an encore with Varun Chakravarthy. For Sri Lanka, the T20 series is a tougher test than the ODIs. Charith Asalanka did try to put pressure on India in the first match, but the inexperience of Dasun Shanaka’s team during crucial phases was exposed. The silver lining will be Wanindu Hasaranga’s leg-breaks which have been causing a few issues for the Indians.  The teams (from):   India: Shikhar Dhawan (Capt.), Prithvi Shaw, Devdutt Padikkal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Suryakumar Yadav, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Nitish Rana, Ishan Kishan (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Yuzvendra Chahal, Rahul Chahar, K. Gowtham, Krunal Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Bhuvneshwar Kumar (Vice-Capt.), Deepak Chahar, Navdeep Saini and Chetan Sakariya.

27 July 2021||Chennai,||Bafna takes Tiruppur past the finish line||Maan K. Bafna is a smooth-stroking southpaw with timing and placement. Importantly, he can carry the team past the finish line under the pressures of a chase. Bafna’s skilful 51-ball unbeaten 72 was the decisive innings as iDream Tiruppur Tamizhans chased down Nellai Royal Kings’ 148 with three wickets and a delivery remaining in the Shriram Capital TNPL game at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Monday. Mounting tension Under mounting tension — the side needed 51 in the last five overs with six wickets in hand — Bafna kept piercing the gaps. Bafna, with loads of time, contemptuously swept paceman Sharun Kumar to the fence. And he reached a quality 50 (off 39 balls), swinging Sharun for the maximum. Slinger Athisayaraj Davidson erred in length in the 18th over and Bafna struck him over square-leg for a six and then squeezed the seamer to the square fence. Earlier, T. Ajith Kumar, a lively seamer with a high-arm action, stuck early — he got Tushar Raheja with a lovely delivery that left the left-hander for ’keeper Indrajith to snaffle a fine catch — and Tiruppur was under stress. S. Siddharth (42 off 28), stroking with power and striking left-arm spinners for huge on-side sixes, kept Tiruppur on course. Bafna had the final say. For Nellai, the young and talented Arjun Murthy batted with freshness and freedom for a delightful cameo (35 off 16 balls) dotted with gems on both sides. On view was timing, footwork and balance. For Tiruppur, It was nice to see Aswin Crist — he has come back from a career threatening back injury — generating pace and hitting the right areas on the surface. After Nellai was inserted, opener L. Suryaprakash (43 off 40 balls) stroking crisply down the ground and B. Indrajith (26 off 10), fleet-footed and connecting well, lifted Nellai. Both fell to Rajkumar, taken in the deep. Tidy left-arm spinner Mohan Prasath impressed with his control. In the end, it was the Tiruppur side that was celebrating after a few jitters in the final over.  The scores:   Nellai Royal Kings 148 in 19.5 overs (L. Suryaprakash 43, Pradosh Ranjan Paul 20, B. Indrajith 26, Arjun Murthy 35, Aswin Crist two for 31, R. Rajkumar three for 42, M. Mohammed three for 23) lost to iDream Tiruppur Tamizhans 149 for seven in 19.5 overs (S. Siddharth 42, Maan K. Bafna 72 n.o., T. Ajith Kumar two for 37, Sanjay Yadav two for 29, B. Aparajith three for nine).   Points: Tiruppur 2; Nellai 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bafna-takes-tiruppur-past-the-finish-line/article35551843.ece
27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mirabai accorded a grand reception||Olympic silver medallist Mirabai Chanu returned from Tokyo, to a rousing welcome amidst tight security, at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here on Monday. Quite thoughtfully Mirabai retained her face shield and mask, when she was escorted by security personnel and other officers. “It is a fruit of five years of hard work. I learnt a lot from the Rio failure. Winning an Olympic medal was my dream. I was confident that I would do my best and return with a medal this time. I am very happy,” said Mirabai. Top support Even as Mirabai thanked the Prime Minister, the Sports Ministry, especially the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) for the best support when required, coach Vijay Sharma put things in perspective. “After the first lockdown, it was thanks to TOPS’ sanction of Rs. 60 lakh that we could train in the US. The reward for that training came in the Asian Championship. Later, before the Olympics we got the clearance and US visa in time to train tension-free when TOPS sanctioned Rs. 75 lakh. That played a huge role in this Olympic medal. If TOPS had not supported this well, the result may not have been that great,” said Vijay. Both Mirabai and the coach said that it could have been a far better fight for the gold against the Chinese, but for the 49kg lifter facing a ‘biological situation’, a day prior to the competition. “I was tense. I thought that it would have been better if it had not happened at this time. Then, I told myself that it keeps happening. So, better to forget about it, and focus on my competition,” Mirabai said about dealing with her menstrual cycle.

Showing vast signs of improvement from its opening 5-1 loss to The Netherlands, Sjoerd Marijne’s side played a high-intensity game for most part. The Indians began well, but were soon left to chase the ball as Germany settled in and dominated possession. India goalkeeper Savita Punia was kept on her toes from the word go but could do nothing to stop Nike Lorenz’s accurate shot off a penalty corner. The 12th-minute goal gave Germany the early advantage and saw the side seize control of the game. The German defence shut out any attack attempted by the Indians. Germany won a penalty stroke early in the second quarter when Gurjit Kaur’s tackle on Cecile Pieper saw the referee point to the spot, but the Indians referred the decision and had it reversed. India had a golden chance to equalise in the third quarter but squandered it. Rani Rampal’s strike off a penalty corner struck Lisa Altenburg on the thigh on the goal-line. Even though it hit Alternburg above the knee, the Indians opted for a referral and won a penalty stroke. Gurjit Kaur stepped up to take it but was denied by a stunning save from Julia Sonntag. The missed chance would come back to torment India as Anne Schroder scored in the 35th minute with a ferocious strike. Vandana impresses Vandana was one of the better players on the Indian side and made repeated forays into the circle. She forced a fine save from Sonntag late in the third quarter. The Germans, with a 2-0 lead, were more than content to hold on to possession and control proceedings. The Indians are winless after two outings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-put-up-a-better-show-but-lose-to-germany-this-time/article35551748.ece
27 July 2021||Colombo,||Chahal determined to secure T20 World Cup spot||Intense competition among a rich pool of players is driving leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal to perform “at every given opportunity” and firmly cement his place in the India squad ahead of the T20 World Cup. With a good haul of wickets in the ongoing limited-overs series against Sri Lanka, Chahal wriggled out of the rough patch that had confronted him during the truncated 2021 IPL. After contributing in India’s win over Sri Lanka in the first T20I here, he acknowledged that one must perform to be in the side. “It’s definitely (a healthy competition). If you have a pool of around 30 players, you definitely have the quality. All the spinners are doing well. As a spinner, you know that there are at least two guys who are ready, who have performed here and in the IPL. “All I can do is think for myself and perform at every given opportunity. If you perform, you get to play, and if you don’t, then you are out. “So, whenever I have the ball in my hand, I focus on getting the job done,” Chahal said. Watching video clips of him bowling at his prime and speaking to men who matter, about the line he should pursue, to regain his mastery over the craft, helped him. Work in lockdown Chahal, who returned figures of 1/19, spoke about the work he did in the lockdown. “When I was not playing, I worked hard with my bowling coach on where to bowl. (I looked at) why I was not able to perform in a couple of matches. So, I worked on these even during the lockdown,” he said. “I bowled with a single wicket (to aim at). I practised with my friends as to where should I bowl. This type of bowling is my strength always; so, I backed myself before I came to this tour,” elaborated Chahal, who has picked up 63 wickets from 49 T20Is.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chahal-keen-to-secure-t20-wc-spot/article35551974.ece
27 July 2021||Tokyo,||A rare gold for Russian men||Nikita Nagornyy led the Russian team to the coveted men’s artistic gymnastics gold at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday to add to its world title. The Russians turned the turned the tables on Japan, which had pipped it to the title in Rio 2016. China had to settle for bronze. Nagornyy joined Artur Dalaloyan, David Belyavskiy and Denis Abliazin. The Russians last won the men’s team title in 1996. And they swelled with pride on top of the podium as Tchaikovsky’s concerto No. 1 filtered out through the sound system at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre. The Russian composer was called up to play the role of super sub as Russia’s national anthem cannot be used because the country is under a doping suspension and their athletes are competing under a neutral banner. The outcome of the first gold on offer at the gymnastics competition was in the balance until the final tumble on the floor. China was within less than a point of the Rio silver medallist going into the sixth rotation, with Japan set for third. But a brilliant last throw of the dice on the horizontal bars from Tokyo teenager Daiki Hashimoto, earning a high 15.100 points, propelled the Games’ hosts back into at least second. Nagornyy chalked up his feet and hands and took to the floor to try to get the Russian Olympic Committee team over the line. And the world all-around champion pulled it off superbly, his score of 14.666 securing the ROC a memorable win.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-rare-gold-for-russian-men/article35551848.ece
27 July 2021||Tokyo,||I’ve made my mark at the Olympics, says gymnastics judge Deepak Kabra||Deepak Kabra is living his dream at the Tokyo Olympics, but lack of flights to the Japanese capital due to the COVID-19 pandemic nearly robbed him of the chance of becoming the first Indian gymnastics official at the Games. At 33, he is the second-youngest judge here and is officiating in the men’s gymnastics events. A category-two judge, he arrived here just in time for the Games. “Four of the flights I had booked got cancelled and all the other judges had come here four days before me. I’d say it was special to just be able to reach in time and judge my event. I am quite relieved after judging one event. I’ve made my mark at the Olympics!,” said Kabra. A former gymnast, Kabra decided to pursue a career as a technical judge at 21. Late start “I started gymnastics very late. Simone Biles began gymnastics at the age of six and people say she was late – others normally start at four. I began when I was 12! My fundamentals were not great and I knew I wouldn’t go far as a gymnast. So I decided to pursue a role as a judge at 21. Kabra began his international career at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and has officiated in 20 global events including the Youth Olympics, World Championships and the Asian Games. “A gymnast’s total score is based on the level of difficulty they attempt and its execution. The difficulty level is based on the move performed by the gymnast and execution is how they perform it. Strike a balance “You need to balance both to achieve the highest final score and get a better ranking.” Having worked in legal portfolio management and corporate finance at Reliance Industries for eight years, he made the full-time switch to sports to join Reliance Foundation Youth Sports. He now aims to upskill himself to a category-1 judge. “No judge from India has ever done that. Only the top 25 judges in the world are given category-1 certification. That’s where I want to be.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ive-made-my-mark-at-the-olympics-says-gymnastics-judge-deepak-kabra/article35551846.ece

27 July 2021||TOKYO,||Indian shooters draw a blank in skeet||India drew a blank in shooting for the third consecutive day as Angad Vir Singh Bajwa and Mairaj Ahmed Khan failed to advance from the men’s individual skeet qualification round at the Asaka Shooting range on Monday. Angad finished 18th and Mairaj 25th. The former, making his Olympic debut, had been in raging form on Sunday when he shot 24, 25 and 24 to total 73. With only the top six qualifying for the final, Angad, who holds the world record of 60/60 in a final (Asian shot gun championship, Kuwait City, 2018), had to come out all guns blazing to remain in contention. However, he shot 23 and 24 in the last two rounds to slip down the ladder and ended his campaign with a score of 120. Mairaj, who managed only a 22 in his third round and was on the back foot coming into the second day, registered 23s in both rounds to finish 25th out of 30 shooters. France’s Eric Delaunay topped the qualification standings with a new qualifying Olympic record of 130. However, it was skeet legend Vincent Hancock who ruled the final. He clinched his third Olympic gold with a new Games record of 59, while Denmark’s Jesper Hansen, who won the 2013 skeet World championship, bagged silver. Kuwait’s Abdullah Alrashidi, who had bagged the bronze at the 2016 Rio Games as an Independent Olympic athlete, finished third again. He represented his nation this time and was not wearing an Arsenal jersey and causing a social media flutter as he did in Rio.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-shooters-draw-a-blank-in-skeet/article35551758.ece

The Russian World No. 2 did not even need his A-game as he cruised past the 160th-ranked Nagal.

The 27-year-old said she couldn't have possibly done anything better in the second round against France’s Manon Brunet, ranked third in the world. “I am very happy. Olympics has been a dream for me. I realised that it was true a few minutes before my first match [against Nadia Ben Azizi of Tunisia],” she said. Ranked 42nd in the world, Bhavani said she was nervous before the start of the opening contest as she hadn’t participated in any event after the 2021 World Cup in Budapest in March. “The way I fought in the first round showed that I was well prepared for the Games,” she said. About the bout against Brunet, Bhavani revealed that the Frenchwoman was too quick in the first half and admitted that she couldn’t understand her opponent’s strategy. She felt that she had a plan and put up a better fight.  “I did my best,” she said, adding that she had defeated Brunet in a training camp in France a few weeks before the Olympics. Bhavani will return to Liverno, Italy, before taking a flight back to Chennai, her hometown. “I want to rest my mind and body, and get ready for future competitions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-did-my-best-says-bhavani-devi/article35551774.ece

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Madhu and Kaitabha||When Lord Narayana asked Brahma to create the world, Brahma became very proud of himself. To teach him a lesson, the Lord made two asuras — Madhu and Kaitabha — emerge from His ears, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. The two asuras stole the Vedas from Brahma. Without the Vedas, Brahma could not create. The two asuras had inadvertently uttered a beejakshara in the Durga mantra, and so Durga said they could ask for a boon. They requested that they should die only if they wanted to. Durga granted them their wish. Because of Durga’s boon, it became difficult to destroy them. Lord Narayana fought them for a thousand years, but the fight was inconclusive. Lord Narayana complimented them and said they fought well, and He could give them a boon. But they were so arrogant that they told the Lord that they were powerful enough to grant Him boons! So, the Lord said He wanted them both to die. They had not anticipated this. So, they said that if the Lord’s promise to give them a boon was still on, then they would like to make use of it. The Lord assured them that His offer was still very much there. They then said they wanted to be killed by Him, but this killing had to take place only in a place where there was no water. The world had not taken shape fully, because Brahma had not commenced his job of creation. The world was covered fully with water. So, the asuras had assumed that killing them where there was no water would be impossible. The Lord took the huge form of Hayagriva, placed the two asuras on His thigh, and slapped them hard, crushing them in one blow. His hands became coated with the fat from their bodies. The Lord rubbed this off on the earth. The earth came to be known as Medini, because ‘medas’ in Sanskrit means fat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/madhu-and-kaitabha/article35551712.ece

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A walk to remember||When Srishti Bakshi trained for her arduous walk from Kanyakumari (Tamil Nadu) to Srinagar (Kashmir) she knew about the physical challenges it would entail. “But I did not anticipate how difficult it would be as an emotional journey,” says Srishti. Every day she met women from different parts of the country and they broke down as they spoke, narrating tales of abuse and violence inflicted upon them. “And I had to be collected in my response,” she adds. The 230-day walk, spanning 3,800 kilometres, was Shristi’s way of creating awareness of violence — acid attacks, dowry, rapes, assaults... — on women, and finding a possible solution. The walk and compelling interactions, are now part of a 90-minute-long documentary, titled WOMB - Women Of My Billion . “It captures the authentic voice of the Indian woman; what she feels, how she has tackled violence, how she has emerged victorious or even succumbed to it. All her different interactions with the world of violence is what the documentary puts out there,” says Sristhi. The documentary was showcased at the New York Indian Film Festival last month, followed by the London Indian Film Festival and its sister festivals in Birmingham and Manchester. Next month, it will be screened at the opening night of the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IIFM) in Australia. The film is directed by Ajitesh Sharma (who also had the challenging task of condensing 1,000 hours of footage into 90 minutes), produced by Apoorva Bakshi, Emmy-winning producer for Delhi Crime, and Juliet Blake also known for The Hundred Foot Journey.  A marketing professional with stints across India and Hong Kong, Srishti has always been vocal about women’s rights. Every time she read an article about attacks on women, it would anger her enough to post about it on social media.“It was like a coping mechanism,” says Srishti over a call from Edinburgh, United Kingdom, where she now lives. But it was when Srishti read about the Highway 91 rape case in India that she was really shaken and decided to do something about it. She spoke to friends and acquaintances and realised that it is a me-centric society. “Unless it happens to my family or within my society, we don’t wake up and think about the whole race,” says Srishti, who is also the founder of Cross Bow Miles, an organisation that empowers women.  The journey  “I prepared for the walk for a year,” says Srishti recalling her physically strenuous routine at the gym, where she dived into muscle training and was lifting 100 kilograms. There were days when the training got so intense that she fell ill, but that did not deter her goal. “I was laser-focussed on the walk. This did not even compare to the logistical nightmares. I engaged dad (a retired Lieutenant General from the Indian Army) as Operations Head of the movement. He charted out the route, and together we wrote to over 100 officials, including District Collectors, women development boards, IAS and IFS officers. Srishti walked 30 to 40 kilometres every day and realised that one can do only 20% of planning on paper, the remaining 80% happens on ground. She organised workshops, which were attended by 200-300 people every day, including men and women. People walked with her on a part of the stretch in their villages, towns or districts. “When we were crossing Madhya Pradesh, in Deval, I heard a 13-year-old girl had recently been gangraped and burnt alive. I visited the house where it happened. I felt demotivated and my team was sad,” she says. At that point, she started questioning herself and wondered why she was doing this; what will it change? The next day, she was joined by the ASHA and Anganwadi workers. One of the women looked like she had been beaten black and blue. It was a case of domestic violence. The woman walked in silence. At the end of that day’s walk, she turned to Srishti and narrated what had happened to her. Srishti asked her to join them at the workshop. The woman replied, “Just by looking at you doing what you are doing, I feel energised. I will push back and put a stop to what is happening with me.” This incident, Srishti says, made her stop second guessing herself. “I came across horrific stories but also stories of courage. These made me continue my journey,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-walk-to-remember/article35552170.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Life in motion||When riding public transport, you are, at once, both in motion and sitting completely still. It is in this dual state that Aditi Saigal (better known by her stage name DOT) immerses herself in music, coming up with new song ideas. In 2017, DOT took the indie music world by surprise with raw recordings of herself, singing ditties on the piano. And now, the 22-year-old is back with her first EP, Khamotion . Comprising songs such as ‘Taxi Fare’, ‘This Train’, and ‘Sultry Town (Ship’s Got No Sail)’, the album is dedicated to the concept of motion; the idea came to her on the daily commute to her college campus in Bangor, Wales, U.K. It is a contemplation on being forced to stay still and wanting to keep moving. Their release now, after a year in standstill, is appropriate. “I first wrote these songs as a final year project at Bangor University in 2019, and I thought why not polish them,” she says, on a call from Wales.  Khamotion sees DOT enter into what she calls her “new sound”: jazzy, occasionally vintage, and added layers of brass — from clarinets and woodwinds to trumpets and saxophones. DOT wants to retain her organic songwriting approach even while producing polished songs. “I hate going to the studio with a click track already in mind. I like to slow down, speed up, without keeping time with clicks. To me, that is what jazz is,” she says. And that is how it was recorded, with the piano and the drums playing together, in adjacent rooms with the door left slightly ajar. The album culminates in ‘Rush’, a series of grooves put together from all the other songs. It is an attempt to break free of the verse-chorus-bridge structures of pop. Yet, songs like ‘Taxi Fare’ are still reminiscent of the ‘Everybody Dances to Techno’ days. The latter was DOT’s breakout song as an 18-year-old, who was then just recording songs on her piano and putting them up on YouTube. As the daughter of musician Amit Saigal, founder of Rock Street Journal , DOT was no stranger to the music world, but after ‘Techno’, fame came knocking overnight. DOT moved to Bangor to study Music and Creative Writing, and then took up a job as a teaching assistant for special needs students. Her stay in Wales, and its proximity to concerts and open mics in Manchester and Liverpool, also allowed her to collaborate with musicians. “But the main thing I have picked up here is a longing to go back home and continue making music,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/life-in-motion/article35552169.ece
27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Irresponsibly yours||This city is full of irresponsible people. It makes me furious. Look at that stupid couple having a party, without even inviting me? Yesterday, I entered the lift and everyone inside rushed out. How do they expect us to spread cheer if people are taking social distancing to this degree? Of course, I had not worn my mask (it was a one-minute lift ride, after all — what can spread in one minute?). And then again, when was the last time they saw someone’s dazzling smile? (Lipstick shade Scandalous Ruby, in case you’re interested.) I mean, what’s the point of sending forwards that say ‘Keep Calm and Smile’ if no one can see that smile, and they are doing the opposite of keeping calm by stampeding over each other to avoid me and my Scandalous smile? I was the first to get my vaccine shot when they started it for senior citizens. Of course, you know I don’t appear remotely senior. I had to just flash my Aadhaar card, and can go back to being late-30s now. I made my husband’s driver (who is a senior citizen — I am honest that way) stand in the queue for three hours for my slot. The embarrassment! I saw a neighbour and before she opened her mouth, I pushed an old woman along, pretending I was there only to help my senior citizen aunt. My ‘aunt’ turned around and smacked my hand. My mean neighbour is now sending me ads for retirement homes and yoga for ageing bones. I shared my picture across social media. I put a flag emoji on the arm on which I got my vaccine. I have co-morbidities, I explained, even though I am in my late 30s. I had to make up some of the lesser co-morbidities to not appear both old and sick. Look at people thronging markets, to buy essential goods. When I threw a Covid party, I made sure everyone arrived at 10-minute intervals. No one ever saw crowds entering or leaving my house — I was super responsible like that. The building security said someone complained about the noise, and I said I was only watching TV. I am slightly deaf, I explained — it is one of my co-morbidities. They even tried to stop my maids from coming in. The maids are at risk from travelling, they said. Am I to now clean my own house? After the party that I (never) threw? I am throwing crying fits at the thought. Is that how you people want to spread cheer? Whenever someone sends me a link to donate for the Covid-unemployed, I tell them I am tirelessly supporting the economy. I spend days online-shopping for designer clothes, but where to wear them? Really! I even started a donation drive for myself and my co-morbidities. I am breaking my back being responsible, I said. No one has donated a single paisa . Irresponsible people.

27 July 2021||July 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Grit & flavour||For 24 years, Mohamed Yousuf Khan punctuated French classes with chocolate cake and lemon tea. From a little kitchen at Chennai’s Alliance Française, blanketed in the scent of vanilla, he whipped together light, fluffy cakes the old fashioned way: with butter, flour and muscle power. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, and business abruptly stalled, he found himself at home for the first time in decades, with nothing to do. Then, the taciturn baker, who had exchanged nothing more than nods with many students over two decades, suddenly found — to his surprise — that he was a local legend. His number circulated on Whatsapp, and the orders began again. This time, he is baking from home in Royapettah. “My cooking was never really commercial, as there were a small group of regulars: students, as well as the actors who came to Alliance for rehearsals,” he says, adding with a chuckle that most of them were fuelled by his signature lemon tea. “That used to be my biggest selling point. People are still messaging me to order it.” When he began to run the canteen, Yousuf says he taught himself to cook. “It was all survival instincts. I was working with McRennett, and I took a gamble to run my own show. To sustain business, I kept learning new recipes from everywhere.” His menu is short but includes his greatest cafe hits: dark chocolate cake, quiches with buttery pastry bases and spicy chicken cutlets. He also makes family style servings of creamy butter chicken, pepper mutton and an old school Chennai style biryani, if you want something more substantial. “Everything is made by me, from scratch, with no short cuts,” says Yousuf, adding that he focusses on quality ingredients and precise techniques to maximise flavour. Business is unpredictable, so he is quick to adapt. “Suddenly someone will share my number on Facebook or a Whatsapp group, and I will get a rush of orders,” he says. “Then, some weeks are quiet. But that’s OK. I was 21 when I joined Alliance, and now I am 45. The students treated me like family, and it is nice to be able to still cook for them.” Message Yousuf on 9840082252 to order    Mutton curry is an unexpected addition to the parasailing, rappelling, camping and scuba-diving offerings of Adventure Zone. Unexpected, but very welcome. The sprawling property and campsite, popular for corporate training programmes and city getaways, recently started offering a comforting, typically Bengali Sunday lunch. In a refreshing no frill format, instead of expending energy on a gush of Instagram reels and influencers, this Sunday popup is expanding slowly, the old-fashioned way. For the past four weeks, they have been cooking first for friends, then as word spread, for friends of friends, slowly expanding their reach. Major SR Roy, who runs Adventure Zone, says he chose to launch Ranna Mashi’s to showcase the skills of his talented Bengali cook. “He used to run a fast food restaurant in Kolkata, serving kati rolls, chops, chicken curry and that typical Bengali biryani,” says Major Roy, adding that they source ingredients, from the mustard oil to the spices, from Kolkata to ensure an authenticity of flavour. “Adventure Zone has always had a kitchen, with cosmopolitan food,” says Major Roy, adding, “We curate it from an activity point of view, keeping it light since people are outdoors rappelling, diving, canoeing etc.” Once COVID-19 struck, the venue fell silent. “Over night we went from catering to 650 visitors to absolutely 0,” says Major Roy. As restrictions ease, though locals are beginning to trickle back in, he decided it was time to find ways to get busy again. “I have a kitchen. I have the infrastructure. And very good Bengali food,” he says. The menu is succinct and simple, with big, homely flavours, tasting like lunch from an aunt’s house. There is fish, usually a river fish like Catla , and chicken or mutton curry. The typically Bengali vegetarian accompaniments include crisp slivers of fried potatoes, ridge gourd in a rich poppy seed gravy and yellow dal. Orders close on Friday evening, giving the kitchen time to get organised. For now, they do just one meal a week. “Many of our customers now order our Sunday lunch every week,” chuckles Major Roy. “Then, they can just close down their home kitchens and relax.” Whatsapp Major Roy on 9444384606 to order||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/grit-flavour/article35552172.ece
27 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. BJP MLA claims ‘hundreds died due to oxygen scarcity’||Days after the Central government claimed that nobody died due to lack of oxygen in the second wave of COVID-19, a BJP MLA in Uttar Pradesh has claimed that “hundreds of people died in agony due to lack of oxygen.” Shyam Prakash, BJP MLA from reserved seat Gopamau in Hardoi, made the statement in a comment on a Facebook post by a local journalist on Sunday. The scribe had posted the paper cutting of his newspaper’s coverage of the Centre’s claim that nobody died of oxygen scarcity and countered it with assertions made by the BJP’s own MLAs during the peak of the crisis. Many BJP MLAs had written letters outlining the crisis in their constituencies. Commenting on journalist Anand Mishra’s post, which he had captioned as “the world not does write the stories of the mute,” Mr. Prakash said, “You have spoken the truth. I agree with you.” He went on to state that hundreds of people died due to lack of oxygen. “Nobody can see the pain of MLA Rajkumar Agrwal and lakhs of other families,” he said, referring to his colleague from Sandila whose son died of COVID-19 in April. Mr. Agrwal had then alleged negligence on behalf of the hospital administration and even tried to get an FIR lodged. ‘Spoke about country’ On Monday, Mr. Prakash clarified his comments and blamed the media for making a mountain out of a molehill. “Where in my comment have I written that deaths only took place in U.P. and only during the second wave? I spoke of the entire country, and that is the truth,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-bjp-mla-claims-hundreds-died-due-to-oxygen-scarcity/article35551934.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Police move HC over fine for ‘farcical’ probe into riots case||Delhi Police has approached the High Court challenging a recent order passed by a local court that imposed a cost of Rs. 25,000 on it for “miserably” failing in its investigation into a case of a man who received gunshot injuries in his left eye during the north-east Delhi riots last year. The court had censured Delhi Police for resisting registration of FIR based on the complaint of the victim, Mohammad Nasir, a resident of North Ghonda in Delhi. It had further called the police investigation “callous and farcical”. The court had directed the DCP (North-East) to deposit the amount with the Delhi Legal Services Authority. It also said the amount should be recovered from the Station House Officer of Bhajanpura police station and his supervising officers, “who have miserably failed in their statutory duties in this case after holding a due inquiry in this regard”.  In its petition challenging the July 13 order, Delhi Police said the court “imposed cost to be deposited by the office of DCP, North-East, without giving any opportunity to the DCP to make his submissions, which is against the principle of natural justice”. Delhi Police also said the imposition of such cost would “seriously affect” not only the career of the government officials involved but also would “certainly cause serious dent” to the reputation of the officers. Remarks against probe “The court has made very serious remarks against the investigation even prior to the commencement of the trial, which is contrary to the basic law that no finding should be given in the midst of trial,” the plea stated. The local court had concluded, “I have also applied my mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and also perused the case diaries, which reveal a very shocking state-of-affairs”. The court had also queried how the police were unable to trace any eyewitness despite the MLC of Mr. Nasir clearly showing his address.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-move-hc-over-fine-for-farcical-probe-into-riots-case/article35551939.ece
27 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Schools reopen in Odisha||Schools across Odisha reopened on Monday after months of closure due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. With COVID-19 situation gradually improving in the State, the Odisha government had announced the resumption of Classes X and XII. According to Satyabrata Sahu, School and Mass Education Secretary, school education had been impacted due to the pandemic in two back to back academic sessions. Moreover, the online classes were not effective, as only 40% students could be reached through the mode. The situation had deteriorated in interior pockets, especially the tribal dominated districts, where access to Internet connectivity and ability to purchase smartphones remained a nagging issue. COVID precautions Both private and government high school managements have been asked to open the institutions by following COVID-19 precautions. However, students are required to take the consent of their parents prior to attending physical classes. The decision to open schools evoked an encouraging response. On the first day, more than 50% of attendance was noticed in most schools. The school timing has been scheduled from 10 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. to enable students have their lunch at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/schools-reopen-in-odisha/article35551931.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Plea seeks separate public toilets for transgenders||The Delhi High Court on Monday issued notice to the government on a petition seeking direction to contruct public toilets for the transgenders or third gender claiming they are prone to sexual assault and harassment” when using male toilets. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh sought responses of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Delhi government and all municipal corporations in the Capital on the petition. The petition filed by Jasmine Kaur Chhabra, a final-year law student, said it was not fundamentally or morally correct to ask anyone of a specific gender to use a public toilet which is made for any other gender. The plea said the Supreme Court in its 2014 judgment ‘National State Legal Authority vs. Union of India’ recognised third gender which consists of transgenders. “The Centre and State governments should take proper measures to provide medical care to transgenders in hospitals and also provide them with separate public toilets and other facilities,” the top court had said. Facing harassment It said the third gender faces trauma, agony and harassment when they utilise washrooms built for male or female. This is a serious and concerning issue which the people of transgender community face in their daily life. “When the third gender uses the washrooms made for male and female, then their right to privacy is violated,” it added. “Mysore, Bhopal and Ludhiana have already started taking action in such matters and have built separate public washrooms for them and that the Capital of India, Delhi is still seen nowhere taking such an initiative,” the petition said. It also said that the Central government have released funds for the concerned issue but still there are no separate toilets are made for the transgender or third gender community in Delhi. The HC has posted the petition for further hearing on September 13.

27 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||3 held for sending bogus police notices to Net users||Three members of a gang were arrested for allegedly sending fake police notices to Internet users asking them to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000 for watching pornographic content, which was an illegal activity, the police said on Monday.  Arrested from T.N. Three accused, Gabrial James, Ram Kumar Selvam and B. Dhinushanth, were all arrested from Tamil Nadu by a team of Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell where they operated on the behest of their mastermind, B. Chanderkant, who is based out of Cambodia, South-East Asia and accused Dhinushanth’s brother, the police said. A probe was initiated after a few people reported on social media about a purported police notice issued to them alleging they were watching pornography which is a banned activity, hence all the files in their computer were blocked. They were also asked to pay Rs. 3,000 as fine, the police said. The victims also added that they were only doing routine searches on their web browser and had not searched for any pornographic content. DCP (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy said: “Action was initiated suo moto after registration of an FIR on the basis of social media inputs. The technical analysis of bogus pop-up notices showed that they were being routed through foreign locations. However, the money trail led to multiple accounts operating from Tamil Nadu. Accordingly, a team was despatched to Tamil Nadu. Since, the fraudster’s used bogus addresses for opening accounts, the team camped in the region for over a week and travelled over 2,000 km between Chennai, Trichi, Coimbatore, Udhagamandalam, and several other places to finally apprehend three men, including the local mastermind, B. Dhinushanth.” When Dhinushanth was questioned, he told the police that the technical part of the entire operation which included hosting of bogus police notice and its targeted display to Internet users, was being handled by his brother, B. Chanderkant, who operated from Veal Pon, near capital city Phnom Penh of Cambodia, the officer said. “In the investigation so far, more than 20 bank accounts were found to be used to route the defrauded money. Cheating of more than Rs. 30 lakh has been accounted for through identified UPI IDs and QR codes used in the bogus notices over a period from February to June this year. Dhinushanth disclosed that the cheated money was being moved out from the banking system through cryptocurrencies by Chanderkant,” he said.

27 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||Residents against religious structures in park||Many residents of South City Part-II, including academics, artists and social activists, are up in arms against unauthorised religious structures inside a park near the township, opposing it as an attempt to grab the land. The residents have also made complaints to the police, the municipal corporation and also tweeted the complaint tagging the office of the Deputy Commissioner, but there has been no response so far. Social activist Sunita Sharma, a resident of Block C, said the religious structures that had come up in the senior citizens’ park at the entrance to Block A of the South City-II was a ploy to “grab land” in the guise of religion. She said there was a need to nip it in the bud or it may lead to several problems. “Soon hawkers and vendors would start selling their stuff close to this shrine. People may come from any part of the city to offer prayers at these shrines and could be a security threat.” She said that she and many other residents have vigorously taken up the matter with the residents welfare association, but there has been no response so far. Former DU Professor Shamsul Islam, a resident of Block A, said he and his wife had been contributing Rs. 1,000 per month for the maintenance of the park for the senior citizens, but he was shocked to find that suddenly two religious structures had come up overnight. He said that it was the modus operandi to grab the land which is worth crores. “I wrote to the RWA, the Police Commissioner, the MCG and also tweeted seeking intervention of the Deputy Commissioner, but there is no reply. It is illegal to carry out such construction in the public land,” said Mr. Islam. Repeated calls and messages to RWA president Niraj Yadav on the matter went unanswered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/residents-against-religious-structures-in-park/article35551944.ece
27 July 2021||New Delhi,||Tobacco use sees dip in Bollywood films: study||Tobacco-free Films and TV Rules (2012) has reduced tobacco depictions in Bollywood films, as per a new study released by HRIDAY, a Delhi-based NGO, which studied tobacco incidents in top-grossing Bollywood films between 2006 and 2017. “The number of tobacco incidents per film was increasing by about 10% per year [incidence rate ratio of 1.1 per year] before the rules took effect in October 2012. However, post-implementation of the rules, the number of tobacco incidents per film began to decline significantly by about 30% per year,” said Gaurang P. Nazar, one of the authors of the study. Moderate compliance The study will be published in Tobacco Control journal on Tuesday. “After 2012, there was moderate compliance with the rules that required a static warning on the screen every time tobacco use was displayed, audio-visual disclaimers and use of anti-tobacco health spots before and at intermission of films with tobacco. Although the level of brand placement was low, some films continued to display tobacco brands even after the rules went into effect,” Dr. Nazar said. Monika Arora, who is also an author, said that it has come down in youth-rated movies too. “We observed that the percentage of films depicting tobacco incidents in youth-rated [U and U/A rated] films was 76% in 2012. However, since the enforcement of the rules in 2012, this percentage has been reducing [35% in 2017]. This also indicates that rules have been effective in restricting, but not eliminating, the depiction of tobacco imagery in films,” Ms. Arora said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tobacco-use-sees-dip-in-bollywood-films-study/article35551945.ece

It has enabled the people of Puri to collect quality drinking water directly from the tap. Henceforth, people need not have to store or filter drinking water,” Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said while inaugurating the ‘Drink from Tap project’. “The inauguration of ‘Drink from Tap’ project marks a new chapter.

Justice Rekha Palli questioned the Centre’s counsel over the reason behind the request to furnish information in such a manner. “What secret is going to be in interpretation of a statute? I’m not considering suspension but interim arrangement,” the High Court remarked. Secret document Centre’s standing counsel Anil Soni replied that the information to be shared was in a secret document. The High Court will hear the case again on July 29. The CHRI had moved the High Court challenging a June 7 order passed by the Home Ministry, suspending its registration for 180 days. CHRI’s counsel had said that the suspension order is contrary to the framework of the scheme set out under the Act and even the suspension was passed without initiating any inquiry and is liable to be set aside. The NGO has said that the suspension order was “unreasonable, manifestly arbitrary, excessive and disproportionate, on the face of it being based on wholly incorrect facts and for violating basic principles of natural justice”. It said the suspension order has “completely paralysed” its functioning, “threatens the livelihood of its employees and casts a stigma on its reputation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-allows-centre-to-give-details-in-sealed-cover-over-chris-plea/article35551936.ece
