28 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Basavaraj Bommai will be new Karnataka CM||In a choice that underlined a keenness to protect the Lingayat vote base rather than indulge in risky experiments, the BJP on Tuesday chose 61-year-old Basavaraj Bommai as the next Chief Minister of Karnataka. Significantly, Mr. Bommai, who joined the BJP only in 2008, is not from the RSS stable and was earlier associated with the JD(U). This makes him an exception among BJP Chief Ministers in the State. He is a moderate face, not known to take a hardline Hindutva stance, and an amenable man across party lines. Mr. Bommai met Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot late on Tuesday, and will be sworn in alone on Wednesday at 11 a.m. Though there had been intense and wild speculation on the possibility of the BJP throwing a “surprise” choice, the saffron party played it safe by going with Mr. Bommai, who does not disrupt the caste calculations, and, significantly, is seen as a man who is close to the Lingayat strongman and outgoing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. He also meets the long-pending demand for a man from north Karnataka to be at the helm of affairs in the State. The decision came just a day after 78-year-old Mr. Yediyurappa resigned with tears in his eyes, at an event organised to mark the second anniversary of his chief ministership — a bumpy ride marked by dissidence, allegations of corruption and nepotism. Mr. Bommai, in contrast, will be seen not only as young and educated, but also non-controversial. In a day of quick and dramatic developments, the BJP Legislature Party meeting was convened and Central observers dispatched from Delhi. At the late evening meeting, the name of Mr. Bommai was proposed by Mr. Yediyurappa and seconded by former Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol. The choice was later announced by central observer Dharmendra Pradhan at a crowded press conference. Speaking after staking claim, Mr. Bommai thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party, besides Mr. Yediyurappa whom he described as his mentor. “I have been chosen unanimously by the BJPLP. I will not fail the expectations of Mr. Modi, the party, Mr. Yediyurappa and will give a pro-people administration. I will take all measures to improve the health of the economy hit by the pandemic. I will serve the people with the blessings of the elders,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/basavaraj-bommai-will-be-the-new-karnataka-chief-minister/article35574488.ece

BJP members, led by Kiran Uppar and several others, gathered at the Kittur Chennamma Circle soon after the announcement was made and they celebrated their leader’s elevation to the Chief Minister’s post. Also in Unkal village, which is now part of Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation and with which Mr. Bommai’s family has a long association, people celebrated by bursting crackers and distributing sweets. In Shiggaon, Mr. Bommai’s home constituency, his followers came out in large numbers and burst crackers at traffic junctions and distributed sweets. Similar celebrations were held in Haveri, where he served as district in-charge Minister ever since the BJP government under outgoing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa came into existence in the State. Meanwhile, a giant “Elakki Haara” (a garland of cardamom), for which Haveri is famous, was sent on Tuesday night to Bengaluru for the swearing-in ceremony. Artist Usmansab Patavegar and his family have made the huge garland using five kilograms of cardamom. The garland was prepared and sent to Bengaluru within hours of the announcement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/celebrations-break-out-in-hubballi-shiggaon/article35574549.ece

Ms. Chanu said, “It is because of your prayers, unwavering support and wishes that I bagged the Olympics silver medal. I am so excited that I cannot speak.” She said she was taken aback when Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren called her soon after she won the medal. She said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi also rang me up to express his happiness for bringing the laurel.” Chief Minister N.

He gave her the appointment letter and later escorted her to her new office in Imphal. Earlier, Ms. Chanu’s parents were joined by thousands of people, including fans and well wishers, at Imphal international airport to welcome her with garlands and hugs. Though they were all wearing masks, social distancing was not observed.

All we could do was to give Rs. 5 daily. With this pittance she used to go from our home at Nongpok Kakching to the Khuman Lampak. As bus service was unreliable she used to hitch a ride in trucks transporting sand, stones, etc.” Ms Chanu said, “In the Rio 2016 Olympics I could not win any medal. But this did not dishearten me. Instead it firmed me up, and as a result I underwent vigorous training for five years.” She said that she would prepare for the next Olympic games. Ms. Anita, her coach said, “One day Mirabai came to the sports complex saying that she would like to become an athlete.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Jabs for children as early as August’||Vaccination of children against COVID-19 may start as early as August, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya told a meeting of the BJP parliamentary party on Tuesday. India was on its way to becoming the largest producer of vaccines as his Ministry would expedite more licences to Indian companies, he said. He also spoke about the government’s efforts to fight COVID-19 and ramp up vaccination. The Minister’s statements are in line with what the government told the Delhi High Court in early July — that vaccines for adolescents between the ages of 12-18 would be available soon, and that a policy to regulate the vaccination programme would be spelt out soon. Giving more details about this, Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, said at a press conference that both Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s DNA vaccines for the 12-18 age group were being looked into. “Final trial results are awaited and after due scrutiny, the vaccines will be made available for children. We hope to make the vaccine available in the near future,” he added. A senior Health Ministry official said while the Pfizer- BioNTech mRNA vaccine had been tested and approved in the European Union for use in those aged 12-15, India was looking at an indigenous vaccine. “The exact timeline for this vaccine’s procurement and the quantity available is still not certain, so details can be given out only after the fineprint has been decided upon,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccination-of-children-as-early-as-august-mandaviya/article35574490.ece
28 July 2021||MANGALURU,||Three more months for bulk generators to build on-site waste processing plants||The Mangaluru City Corporation on Tuesday decided to give three more months time to establishments generating solid waste and apartments with more than 30 households to construct on-site composting units and process waste at source. Despite notices being issued to all bulk solid waste generators, including hotels, hospitals, lodges, wedding halls, catering units, apartments, to get such units constructed as per the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, the directions have not been fully complied with, noted a follow-up meeting of the corporation here on Tuesday. In case bulk solid waste generators fail to comply with the guidelines and do not construct on-site waste processing units, double the amount of fine will be imposed on them every day starting on November 1 during the waste collection drive, the corporation said. The meeting chaired by corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar shed light on the investigation taking place over the public interest writ petition regarding the city’s municipal solid waste in the High Court of Karnataka. The meeting also discussed the progress made in the implementation of the Solid Waste Regulations which is to be examined by the government. The attendees were informed about the time-frame within which the Waste Management directives have to be implemented. When representatives of establishments and residents associations present at the meeting expressed their dissatisfaction over inadequate/inconsistent garbage collection, the Commissioner handled the matter on a priority basis and directed the contractors to collect garbage consistently every day. Considering the severity of the waste disposal system, all stakeholders were given a strict three-month time period to begin wet waste processing in their buildings along with the instructions to construct an on-site waste treatment composting unit by October 31. Directions were passed on the lines of building composting units adopting the technology to process wet waste developed by companies approved by the National Green Tribunal. The stakeholders were told that to keep the public informed, the names of these establishments will be published on the Mangaluru City Corporation website.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/three-more-months-for-bulk-generators-to-build-on-site-waste-processing-plants/article35574904.ece
28 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Oppn. walks out over ‘failed’ COVID policy||Members of the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) walked out of the Assembly on Tuesday accusing the government of inflicting an economically crippling and inherently flawed COVID-19 lockdown regime on the State. They also attempted to put the government in the dock for “undercounting” COVID-19 deaths. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the Information Kerala Mission (IKM) had put the death count at 23,486 (since January 2020). However, the Chief Minister's Office had fixed it at 16,170. It had not accounted for 7,316 fatalities, he said. The Opposition flayed the government for failing to transfer cash directly to the people. Such a move would revive the economy by prompting increased spending. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s Rs. 20,000-crore stimulus package was a farce. It had no budgetary backing. The State had neither protected lives nor preserved livelihood. In contrast, neighbouring Tamil Nadu had successfully reined in the pandemic, allowed the economy to open up and transferred Rs. 4,000 to ration cardholders. Abject failure: IUML Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader P.K. Kunhalikutty sought leave of the House to discuss the government’s abject failure in reining in the disease and reviving the economy. He said the government had struck a casual attitude to the people's sufferings. However, it had mitigated crowding at liquor outlets to some measure by extending timings and allowing legal alcohol on weekdays. It should do the same for the ailing non-essential retail and service sectors. Mr. Satheesan said the government had relegated COVID-19 management to bureaucrats. They existed in privileged isolation, far removed from the commoners’ woes. The officialdom could not relate to the pandemic-induced daily deprivation faced by the masses. They framed rules with no thought for the human condition, he said. State's economy The State's economy was in a downward spiral. Non-Resident Indians’ remittances had dwindled to a trickle. People were on the verge of suicide. The lockdown regime had failed to contain the disease, he said. Mr. Satheesan demanded a pandemic relief commission to look into sector-wise losses sustained by the economy. Vaccine shortage Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the UDF's opposition to COVID-19 had no scientific basis. An estimated 50% of the State's population were yet to contract the virus and, hence, vulnerable to the infection. Vaccine shortage plagued the State's universal inoculation programme.  Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal reeled off the State's various pandemic impelled social welfare schemes, including distribution of pension and food kits, to counter the UDF's allegations. Speaker M.B. Rajesh deemed Mr. Vijayan's reply satisfactory and denied the UDF's notice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/oppn-walks-out-over-failed-covid-policy/article35574781.ece
28 July 2021||Kochi,||HC cancels KTU offline exams||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday ordered the cancellation of the offline examinations for first and third semester BTech courses being conducted by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU). Justice Amit Rawal passed the verdict on a writ petition filed by some students challenging the conduct of physical examinations for the first and third semesters. They contended that the offline exams being conducted from July 7 for the first and third semesters were in violation of the University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations. According to them, the UGC had ordered that only final year semester examinations need be conducted offline and others be conducted online only. Exams postponed Meanwhile, the university postponed all examinations scheduled for Wednesday. The move comes against the backdrop of the cancellation of the first and third semesters’ engineering examinations that were held recently by the Kerala High Court. Remaining exams The university was scheduled to hold the examinations of the first and second semesters (2015 scheme) and third semester (regular) on Wednesday. No announcement has been made regarding the remaining examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-cancels-ktu-offline-exams/article35574785.ece
28 July 2021||Bengaluru,||State sees significant dip in active cases||With a steady decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the State, active cases too have plummeted significantly, going below the 25,000 mark in the last four days. As of Tuesday, the number of active cases was 22,487 with Bengaluru Urban contributing 35.7% (8,047) of this caseload. The drastic fall in active cases, for the first time in about four months, indicated a robust recovery rate of 97.9% in the State. The State has been consistently reporting around 2,000 new cases and around 3,000 recoveries since July 10. The last time active cases hovered around the 25,000 mark was on March 30 (25,541) when the second wave had begun. From 2,62,162 active cases on April 25, the number of active cases crossed 4 lakh and touched 4,05,068 on May 1 registering over a three-fold rise than the highest active cases (1,20,270) reported in October 2020, during the first outbreak. In mid-May, the State’s active caseload peaked and exploded, touching 6,05,494. However, cases started falling after that and had reduced by nearly half by May 31. By June 30, active cases plummeted to 76,505 and further dipped by half by July 15. Although Karnataka overtook Maharashtra during May-June, the situation eased significantly in the first week of July and the State’s position on the national COVID-19 graph improved from first to third. Currently, it is fourth after Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Experts said although the dip in active cases is an encouraging sign it is important that the State sustains the same momentum. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said most of the patients testing positive for COVID now have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and hence are recovering quickly bringing down the number of active cases. “Some of the new cases are breakthrough infections (post-vaccination) and in those who had already been exposed to the virus. Hence, the disease is not severe in such patients facilitating early recovery. With lung involvement rare in such patients, most of them do not even require hospitalisation,” said Dr. Manjunath. V. Ravi, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said it is encouraging to see a significant fall in active cases. “However, we have to ensure that the cases do not rise again. It is essential to maintain COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and avoid super-spreader events. While emphasis should be on vaccination, the State should continue the same pace of testing,” he said. Meanwhile, the State on Tuesday reported 1,501 new cases. Of these, 354 cases are from Bengaluru Urban. With 32 deaths, the toll rose to 36,437. This is apart from 23 deaths of patients due to non-COVID-19 reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-witnesses-a-significant-dip-in-active-cases/article35574520.ece

28 July 2021||MALAPPURAM,||Passion for online learning at time of COVID||Mohammed Khubaib K.K., a student at Madin Academy here, continues to inspire his friends through best utilisation of the lockdown period for studies. Khubaib has secured 650-odd certificates from universities and institutions across the world for short-term programmes during the second phase of the lockdown. A first-year BCom student, Khubaib never misses any short-term online programme connected to his subject. He has got the certificates offered by the University of California, Harvard University, United Nations University, Google, and Microsoft in his lockdown folder. About 200 of the certificates were offered by Microsoft alone. “I have been focusing on the subject I am following. That’s why I chose short-term online programmes in areas such as digital marketing, accounting, economics, management, language studies and designing,” said Khubaib, who is preparing for the CMA foundation course. Motivational speech Khubaib began attending different online programmes in April when COVID-19 was about to start its second wave. What triggered him to search the Internet and opt for the online programmes, most of them offered free, was a motivational speech made by Madin Academy chairman Sayed Ibrahim Khaleel Bukhari in recent months. “Ustad (Mr. Bukhari) exhorted us to make the best out of the time we are confined at home. He also told us several stories about the importance of acquiring knowledge and the significance of knowledge in Islam,” said Khubaib. He said the Madin Academy encouraged him to take up any programme of his choice. Mr. Bukhari too was happy about Khubaib’s achievement. “What makes me happy is the achievement he made at a time when social media was being widely misused by the people, including students,” said Mr. Bukhari. Khubaib turned 22 a few days ago. He has given a short rest to his online studies as he is preparing for the CMA foundation examinations to be held in a few days. He has an aspiration for the Civil Services too. “I am preparing at a basic level for the Civil Services,” said Khubaib, adding that the lockdown had opened up innumerable opportunities even when denying many facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/passion-for-online-learning-at-time-of-covid/article35574779.ece
28 July 2021||Bengaluru,||After nearly three years, hoardings to make a comeback in city||Advertisement hoardings are likely to make a comeback in the city, which was bereft of them for nearly three years. The Urban Development Department (UDD) has issued a notification on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Advertisement Rules, 2019 allowing advertisement hoardings under sections of the BBMP Act, 2020. According to the notification issued on Tuesday, a copy of which is with The Hindu , the State government feels that that the earlier BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Byelaws, 2018, was not adequate to regulate the outdoor advertisements. Confirming the development, UDD’s Additional Chief Secretary Rakesh Singh told The Hindu that the decision was taken as the civic body was losing out on a lot of revenue with hoardings not being allowed in the city. Several rounds of deliberations had been held with stakeholders before arriving at the decision to allow the hoardings, he said. He added that the High Court of Karnataka had, on several occasions, come down heavily on the “erratic hoardings and materials used”. “The new rules have specified the protocol to be followed for permission, regulating the size of hoardings and materials used, which was missing in the earlier rules. With this, we will be able to ensure that the city’s aesthetics are not affected, apart from garnering revenue out of it,” he said. It was in August 2018 that the BBMP Council had passed a resolution banning all forms of advertisement hoardings for one year. This, however, was only after the High Court of Karnataka took the civic body to task over the mushrooming of illegal advertisement hoardings across the city. Nearly a year later, the UDD published the draft BBMP Advertisement Rules, 2019 in an attempt to bring back hoardings. The civic body, once again, passed a resolution opposing the draft rules. Meanwhile, the court is still hearing a PIL petition on advertisement hoardings and has time and again directed the BBMP to clear the huge skeletal structures of hoardings that still dot the cityscape. RTI activist Saidutta, who has filed the PIL in the high court, has alleged that “advertisement mafia and corrupt civic officials” were responsible for the development. “It is also unfortunate that the BJP, which had in its election manifesto stated that it was against hoardings, is responsible for its coming back,” he said, adding that he would challenge this legally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/after-nearly-three-years-hoardings-to-make-a-comeback-in-city/article35574517.ece

Mr. Sarma’s comments came a day after six Assamese people — five police personnel and a civilian — were killed and over 50 injured in the border clashes. He also said Assam will move the Supreme Court seeking protection of the Innerline Forest Reserve from destruction and encroachment and deploy three commando battalions in Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts bordering Mizoram to strengthen security. Assam has declared a three-day State mourning following the incident. ‘Centre’s responsibility’ “It is the responsibility of the Centre to define the boundary and we will abide by it... if tomorrow the Parliament enacts a law by which our land can be given to another State, we will do so but till then we will protect our constitutional boundary,” Mr. Sarma told a press conference. He also visited the Silchar Medical College and Hospital and met police personnel injured in the attack. “We hope that the Mizos regret that they have fired at fellow countrymen but we are leaving it to their wisdom and conscience. This is a dispute between two States and not a fight between countries. But the video evidence that we have of the Mizo forces celebrating after attacking our people has saddened and hurt us,” he said. The Chief Minister said that satellite images have shown that roads are being constructed and forests cleared for jhum cultivation (shifting cultivation) which cannot be allowed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sarma-talks-tough-on-border-row/article35574491.ece

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,||HC: disregard political interference while preventing illegal mining’||The Madras High Court on Tuesday hoped that the Industries Secretary and his team would disregard political interferences in their attempt to protect the natural resources and ensure that mining of valuable minerals in the State takes place strictly in accordance with the terms of the licences. The court also insisted on limiting the mining operations to demarcated areas. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations while passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate C. Prabhu. The court had, in the last hearing of the case, called for a report from the Industries Secretary on the steps taken by the government to prevent illegal mining of minerals in the State. Accordingly, a status report was filed before the court listing out the steps taken so far. After perusing the report, the first Division Bench remarked: “There appear to be widespread violation of the licence terms and rampant illegal quarrying which need to be addressed urgently. However, it is possible that serious steps are being taken in right earnest by the State.” After directing the Industries Secretary to file a further report, the Bench adjourned the case by three weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-disregard-political-interference-while-preventing-illegal-mining/article35575009.ece

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,||T.N. looking at reopening schools for senior classes||Tamil Nadu Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi on Tuesday said his department was examining the possibility of reopening schools for students of Classes IX to XII. The development comes against the backdrop of the declining number of daily COVID-19 cases in the State. “Some States have reopened schools for Class XII students alone, and they have said it is not compulsory for students to come to school. The attendance has been low in such States, and parents are hesitant to send their children to school, citing the possibility of a third wave . We will observe how schools are reopened in other States and discuss the issue with the Chief Minister after which a decision could be taken,” he said. Schools in Tamil Nadu have remained shut for a majority of the classes since March 2020. For Classes IX to XII, they reopened briefly after January this year, but were shut in April during the second wave of the pandemic. Over 1.35 lakh students have migrated from private schools to government and government-aided schools this year, largely due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Besides, another 68,500-odd students moved from aided schools to government institutions. In the wake of this development, Mr. Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said the School Education Department was considering how the authorities could equip schools better to handle the increase in strength. “District-level education officials have been asked to ascertain the needs of schools, and we are looking into the possibility of increasing teacher strength as well,” he added. Speaking at the Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School at Mogappair after inaugurating a campus greening initiative, the Minister encouraged organisations to come forward and join hands with the School Education Department in working with government schools across the State. “On this school’s campus, over 1,000 saplings were planted last year as part of a CSR initiative, and this is now a green campus. There are a lot of areas where organisations could work with government schools, and we want more companies to come forward,” he added. For Classes IX to XII, they reopened briefly after January this year, but were shut in April during the second wave of the pandemic. Over 1.35 lakh students have migrated from private schools to government and government-aided schools this year, largely due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Besides, another 68,500-odd students moved from aided schools to government institutions.

I hope the injured recover soon. HM has failed the country yet again by sowing hatred and distrust into the lives of people. India is now reaping its dreadful consequences,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Opposition unrelenting in Parliament||Both Houses of Parliament saw multiple adjournments on Tuesday, the Lok Sabha as many as 10, before being adjourned for the day as the Opposition continued with its protests against the government on the Pegasus issue and the three controversial farm laws. The Rajya Sabha, like the Lok Sabha on Monday, managed to pass the Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021 with a voice vote amid sloganeering and protests by the Opposition. The Lok Sabha cleared the Factoring Regulation Bill, 2020 and the National Institutes of food Technology and Management Bill, 2021 in a similar manner on Monday. Rajya Sabha chairperson M. Venkaiah Naidu, amid disruptions during Zero Hour, said he would not be forced “like this” through “undemocratic method” to give in to Opposition demands. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla told Opposition members who kept up protests in the House through all its 10 adjournments, that MPs should not be “competing to raise slogans” and that they should raise issues pertaining to people. While members of the Congress, CPI, CPI(M) and the Trinamool Congress were protesting over the snooping row, the Shiromani Akali Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party, and the Samajwadi Party raised slogans against the three farm laws. Despite assurances by Mr. Birla and subsequent Chairs Bhratruhari Mahtab and Rajendra Agarwal that members would be given ample opportunities to raise issues, the protests continued. Long after the Lok Sabha had adjourned for the day, two Congress MPs from Punjab, Ravneet Bittu and Gurjeet Singh Aujla, continued to protest in the House for the scrapping of farm laws. “They were persuaded to leave a little before 9 p.m.,” a Lok Sabha official said.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||15 crore vaccine doses expected in Aug.: Paul||The Union government expects to have 15 crore vaccine doses available for administration in August, V.K. Paul, Chairman of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC), said on Tuesday. “We have a visibility of about 15 crore doses,” Dr. Paul said at a press briefing. “We produce and we inject. A part of what we produce goes into testing and the batches are released in a certain way.” About 25% of the population has received at least one dose and 7% is fully inoculated. Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had said last week that 2.5 crore doses of Covaxin would be available in July and 3.5 crore in August. The earlier estimates were that at least six crore doses of Covaxin would be available from July. India’s target was to administer 51 crore doses by July. So far, 44 crore doses have been administered. Based on the supply, it is improbable that the target will be reached in the next four days. The government has said it plans to inoculate all adults — about 94.4 crore persons — by the year-end. For that, nearly one crore doses have to be administered a day, while India has generally averaged about 0.5 crore for most of this month. Of the vaccines administered so far, Covaxin comprises about 15%. Bharat Biotech said in May that it took four months for a batch of Covaxin to be manufactured and readied for supply. Thus, production of batches of Covaxin that were initiated during March this year would be ready for supply only in June, the company had said in a statement. At that point, about 2-2.5 crore doses of Covaxin had reportedly been supplied. That implies that only the batches produced in April would be ready for supply by July. At Tuesday’s briefing, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, Lav Agarwal said participants who had participated in the clinical trials for Covaxin would get certificates only if they had not been administered a placebo and the trial was unblinded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/15-crore-vaccine-doses-expected-in-aug-paul/article35574433.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||N. Ram, Sashi Kumar move SC||Senior journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar have moved the Supreme Court seeking an independent probe headed by a former or sitting judge of the court into the alleged mass surveillance of over 142 potential “targets”, including journalists, lawyers, Ministers, Opposition politicians, constitutional functionaries and civil society activists, using military-grade Israeli spyware Pegasus. The petition said, “Such mass surveillance using a military-grade spyware abridges several fundamental rights and appears to represent an attempt to infiltrate, attack and destabilise independent institutions that act as critical pillars of our democratic set-up”. It sought a full disclosure from the government on whether it had authorised snooping which, it said, seemed to be an attempt to muzzle free speech and to chill dissent. The government had still not given a straight answer to whether the illegal hack was done with its blessings, it noted. “Respondents [Ministries of Home, Information Technology and Communications] have not categorically ruled out obtaining Pegasus licences to conduct surveillance in their response, and have taken no steps to ensure a credible and independent investigation into these extremely serious allegations,” it highlighted. ‘Civilians targeted’ The spying had caused serious dents on the rights to free speech and privacy. It had no legal basis. In fact, the legal regime for surveillance under Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act had been completely bypassed. Civilians had become targets, it stated. “Surveillance/interception is justified only in cases of public emergency or in the interests of public safety, and the existence of such conditions must be inferred reasonably and cannot be determined solely on the assessment of the government… The hack/interception/decryption occasioned by the Pegasus spyware constitutes a criminal offence,” it pointed out. The software, manufactured by Israeli cyberarms firm NSO Group Technologies Limited, is “extremely advanced and capable of infecting a mobile phone/device without any interaction with the owner”. “It can conduct extremely intrusive surveillance, including tracking and recording calls, reading text and WhatsApp messages, collecting passwords, reading emails, accessing photos and videos, activating camera and microphone and enabling them to record events,” the petition noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/n-ram-sashi-kumar-move-sc/article35574419.ece
28 July 2021||New Delhi,||BJP MPs walk out of Standing Committee on IT||BJP members on Tuesday staged a walkout from the meeting of the Standing Committee on Information and Technology, headed by senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, claiming that the rules did not permit committee meetings to be held while Parliament was in session. The committee was also set to discuss the Pegasus case on Wednesday. Hours before the BJP MPs walked out of the meeting, Union Environment and Labour Minister Bhupender Yadav had called for an “informal” meeting of the BJP members of the IT Parliamentary Panel. Awkwardly, the invitation for the meeting also went to CPI(M) MP P.R. Natarajan. “Around 1 p.m., I got a call from Mr. Yadav’s office saying that the Minister wants to meet. I was surprised, since I had not sought any appointment with him,” Mr. Natarajan told The Hindu . At 2 p.m., Mr. Natarajan went to Mr. Yadav’s room in Parliament. “He asked me if I was a member of the IT committee? I said yes. Then he asked me which party I was from. When I told him I was from the CPI(M), he apologised and said it was a meeting only for the BJP members,” Mr. Natarajan said. At 4 p.m., the Standing Committee of IT met on the agenda: “To hear the views of the individuals/stakeholders/organisations in connection with the examination of the subject ‘Review of functioning of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)’ relating to Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in context of the draft ‘Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill, 2021’.” Right at the outset, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, according to multiple sources, said committee meetings can’t be held during the Parliament session. It was then pointed out to him that five other committee meetings were held on Tuesday. He then said the agenda was not notified in time. He, along with five other BJP MPs, walked out of the meeting. Later, speaking to CNN IBN, Mr. Dubey said, “We didn’t get the agenda. And when Parliament is in session, our work is to run the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. To hold a meeting at such a time is not appropriate. The Chairman is arbitrarily running his own writ.” Mr. Natarajan said it was only after the BJP MPs’ walkout that he realised that the meeting called by Mr. Yadav was to organise the protest. “This clearly shows that BJP high command decides how a member should behave in a standing committee that is a non-partisan platform,” Mr. Natarajan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-mps-walk-out-of-standing-committee-on-it/article35574440.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Settle OBC quota issue in medical seats soon: PM||In a significant development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed that the issue of reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the all-India quota in medical seats in State government-run medical colleges be resolved “on top priority” and out of court by the Ministries involved. This was conveyed to Ministers for Education and Health Dharmendra Pradhan and Mansukh Mandaviya and secretaries of their Ministries as well as senior officers of the Ministries of Law and Social Justice at a meeting presided over by Mr. Modi on Monday evening. “Under current conditions, 15% of undergraduate and 50% of postgraduate seats in State government medical colleges are earmarked as all-India quota. For admission, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have reservation in this quota but there is no reservation for OBCs. Prime Minister Modi wants that this long-standing demand by OBC students be resolved soon, even as several cases are pending before different courts across the country for many years now,” said a government official privy to the meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Modi also directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to implement reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in medical education. He asked the Ministry to review the status of implementation of EWS quotas in various institutions of medical education. DMK petition The meeting and the urgency with regard to resolving the OBC quota issue comes even as the Centre told the Madras High Court on Monday that the matter will be resolved in a week’s time. The court was hearing a contempt of court petition moved by the DMK, in which it pointed out that there was a delay in carrying out the court’s earlier order that the quota be implemented in the academic year 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/settle-obc-quota-issue-in-medical-seats-soon-pm/article35574422.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC mulls PM CARES Fund for orphans||Over 75,000 children have been orphaned, abandoned or have lost a parent during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of them may become victims of human trafficking rackets or descend into crime, a report in the Supreme Court said on Tuesday. Orphans are of particular concern to the Supreme Court. An affidavit filed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on July 26 showed that 6,855 children had been orphaned between April 1, 2020 and July 23, 2021. The Commission pointed out that each of these children had their own individual social backgrounds. The solution to help them rise again should be “individualised”. A one-size-fits-all scheme for all children may not work. The Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose orally asked the Union government whether the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) could be extended to children orphaned during the COVID-19 months and not just those whose parent or guardian died due to the virus. The scheme originally proposed to fund the educational requirements, in the form of uniforms, textbooks, etc. The scheme would also offer financial help to children for their higher education. A corpus of Rs. 10 lakh would be set aside for each child. The child would get the corpus amount in lump sum on reaching the age of 23. West Bengal’s figure The Supreme Court also questioned West Bengal’s claim that only 27 children had become orphans during the COVID-19 months. The court even threatened to order a separate probe into the figure. It directed the District Magistrates to collect information on children who had been orphaned during the pandemic. The Bench was hearing a suo motu case dealing with children impacted by the pandemic. The court’s amicus curiae , advocate Gaurav Agrawal, in his submissions on Tuesday said intervention and response by authorities to the problems of these children should be “more focussed”. “There is no reason why we should not be able to reach out and ensure that their education is not disrupted, and that their guardians have minimum amount to look after them,” Mr. Agrawal submitted. Justice Rao shared the experience he had in his native State. “I was talking to the district judicial officers about these children. They said they keep getting frantic calls from the children asking them to be taken back to observation homes, saying they have not eaten anything at home for days… These children should not be left in a position where they have to fend for themselves,” Justice Rao said. The NCPCR data also showed that 68,218 children lost one of their parents during the pandemic months till July 23 this year. Another 247 children were abandoned across the country. The court hearing highlighted the aspect of children studying in private schools and orphaned during COVID-19. “Quite a few of them are studying in private schools… The State governments may work out a mechanism for continuing the education of orphaned children in the existing schools. The number of orphans going to private schools should be ascertained and arrangement must be worked out for each child,” Mr. Agrawal suggested. Besides, eligible children who have either not enrolled or dropped out of schools should be enrolled in schools. Secondly, authorities should reach out to the guardians of these orphans and gauge whether they really can afford to have these children and if they require financial help.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘21.5 mn lost jobs in tourism sector owing to the pandemic’||With the tourism industry among the hardest hit due to the pandemic, it is estimated that about 21.5 million people working in the sector lost their jobs during the nine-month period from April 2020-December 2020, as per the data shared by the government on Tuesday. In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Tourism Minister G. Kishan Reddy said a significant number of jobs were lost in the tourism sector once the lockdown was implemented. “About 14.5 million jobs during Q1, 5.2 million during Q2 and 1.8 million jobs during Q3 were expected to have been lost as compared to an estimated 34.8 million jobs in the pre-pandemic period of 2019-20 [direct jobs],” he said. Mr. Reddy said this was one of the key findings of the study done by the National Council of Applied Economic Research for the Ministry of Tourism to assess the extent of losses to the sector. As per the report, due to overall economic slowdown during 2020-21, tourism economy or tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) saw a fall of 42.8% in April-June 2020, 15.5% in July-September 2020 and a fall of 1.1% in October-December 2020. “Due to significant drop in tourist arrivals and hence tourism expenditure, during the pandemic, it is estimated that TDGVA plummeted by as much as 93.3% in Q1 of 2020-21 over its level in the same quarter of the previous year,” the Minister stated, adding that it picked up slightly to post a decline of 79.5% and 64.3% in the second quarter and the third quarter respectively. However, Mr. Reddy added that the Ministry did not maintain data on revenue generated from tourism. Replying to another query, the Minister said no formal study had been instituted by the Ministry to assess whether the movement of people from all States increased at tourist places, which might raise fears of an increase in COVID-19 positive cases after the second wave. Further, Mr. Reddy said that as per the Bureau of Immigration, the number of foreign tourist arrivals in India stood at 10.93 million in 2019, declining to 2.74 million in 2020 and about 0.42 million till June 2021. According to the data compiled by the Ministry of Tourism, domestic tourist visits during the calendar year 2019 stood at 2,321.98 million while those in 2020 stood at 610.21 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/215-mn-lost-jobs-in-tourism-sector-owing-to-the-pandemic/article35574945.ece
28 July 2021||New Delhi,||Centre to meet top State officials||The Centre has called a meeting of the Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police of Assam and Mizoram on Wednesday in the wake of the violence along their shared border, where five Assam Police personnel were killed, officials said. Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla will chair the meeting to discuss the sudden escalation of violence along the Assam-Mizoram border.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD,||Dholavira in Gujarat on UNESCO World Heritage list||The Harappan city of Dholavira, in present-day Gujarat, was on Tuesday named the 40th Indian site on UNESCO’s World Heritage list. UNESCO’s announcement came just days after another site, Ramappa Temple in Telangana, was admitted to the list on Sunday. “The ancient city of Dholavira is one of the most remarkable and well-preserved urban settlements in South Asia dating from the 3rd to mid-2nd millennium BCE (Before Common Era). Discovered in 1968, the site is set apart by its unique characteristics, such as its water management system, multi-layered defensive mechanisms, extensive use of stone in construction and special burial structures,” UNESCO said. A range of artefacts of copper, shell, stone, jewellery, terracotta and ivory had been found at the site. “The two newly inscribed World Heritage Sites offer great insight into the knowledge and ways of life of earlier societies, customs, and communities,” UNESCO said. Located in the Kutch district, Dholavira is the larger of the two most remarkable excavations of the Indus Valley Civilisation dating back to about 4,500 years ago. The site had been on UNESCO’s tentative list since 2014 and India had submitted its dossier in January 2020, a Culture Ministry statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a series of tweets that he was delighted by the development. “Dholavira was an important urban centre and is one of our most important linkages with our past. It is a must visit, especially for those interested in history, culture and archaeology. I first visited Dholavira during my student days and was mesmerised by the place,” Mr. Modi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dholavira-in-gujarat-on-unesco-world-heritage-list/article35574401.ece
28 July 2021||New Delhi,||Seven parties seek Kovind’s intervention||Seven Opposition parties have written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his intervention to direct the government to debate the farmers’ issues and Pegasus row in the ongoing monsoon session. “We Members of Parliament of various political parties are writing to you to seek an appointment to apprise you of two disturbing developments including the complete stonewalling of demands of the peasantry to repeal the three agricultural laws as well as use of Israeli spyware Pegasus to tape telephones of politicians, journalists and activists,” said the letter, signed by Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Badal, NCP’s Supriya Sule, BSP’s Ritesh Pandey and Danish Ali, CPI(M)’s P.R. Natrajan, CPI’s M. Selvaraj, erstwhile BJP ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party leader Hanuman Beniwal and National Conference’s Hasnain Masoodi. None of the major Opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress or the DMK signed the letter. “You would appreciate that a human tragedy is unfolding on the borders of Delhi with more than 550 farmers already having lost their lives during the course of the ongoing ‘Kisan Andolan’ [farmers’ agitation]. The livelihoods of millions more are at stake due to the three agricultural laws which have been made with the express purpose of handing over the agriculture sector to corporations,” the letter to the President said. The letter also flags the Pegasus spyware cyber attack. The use of Pegasus software “to tape telephone numbers of politicians as well as journalists and activists besides known detractors of the NDA government has sent shockwaves amongst civil society,” it said. “Despite these revelations, the Union government is refusing to disclose why it had used this software against its own citizens,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/seven-parties-seek-kovinds-intervention/article35574424.ece
28 July 2021||CHENNAI,||Railway personnel told not to use private email for official work||The Ministry of Railways has directed officials across its network to use @gov.in or @nic.in domain email services only for all formal communications. The instructions follow an alert issued by a Central law enforcement agency to the Chairman, Railway Board, which specifically prohibited the use of private email services such as Gmail and Yahoo for official communications. In an advisory sent out to the General Managers of all Zonal Railways, heads of production units and other Railway establishments, the Railway Board said the initiative was part of measures taken by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to secure government websites, “considering the increased threat perception in the cyber space”. Insisting on the use of government domain email identities and reiterating an earlier order, which also emphasised the use of @gov.in/@nic.in services for uninterrupted services and security reasons, the advisory added that to secure web portals and prevent any sniffing attacks, the websites, both Internet and intranet and other sub-domains of respective Railway units, should obtain secure socket layer (SSL) certification at the earliest. Private entities It was noticed that websites of a number of field units were designed, developed and hosted through private entities that did not conform to the Guidelines for Indian Government Websites (GIGW) Version 2.0, 2019. Many such websites were not hosted on .gov.in or .nic.in domain, it added. Urging the authorities concerned to ensure that any website developed and/or owned by any of the field units should conform to GIGW Version 2.0 standards and use only .gov.in or .nic.in domains allotted exclusively and restricted to government websites, the Railway Board underlined the need for strict compliance to the alert. The GIGW Version 2.0 was developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in 2019 and adopted by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension, as an ‘Integral part of Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure’. Railway officials were also directed to initiate urgent steps to ensure that the information available on all Railway websites was “current” and “fully updated”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railway-officials-told-not-to-use-private-email-for-official-work/article35574428.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Media network wants Blinken to flag threats to press freedom||A global network of editors, media executives and leading journalists, the International Press Institute (IPI), on Tuesday called on United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to raise the issue of press freedom with Indian leaders during bilateral meetings. The IPI wrote to Mr. Blinken, who is visiting India this week, to bring to his notice “the stifling press freedom environment in which independent media is operating in India, amidst threats and legal harassment by the government at the Centre and in the States ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party”. The IPI letter noted that 18 attacks on journalists, eight arrests and 20 cases of “legal harassment” of journalists had been recorded by the IPI so far this year. “The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has displayed complete intolerance to criticism and resorted to legal harassment to punish those journalists and media organisations who are critical of its policies and speak truth to power… The recent revelations that some 40 journalists were targeted with the Pegasus spyware shows the extent to which the government has gone to invade the professional and private lives of journalists in order to stifle press freedom and human rights in the country,” the letter stated. Dainik Bhaskarraids The IPI also highlighted the raids by the Income Tax Department on the offices ofDainik Bhaskar. “The newspaper has extensively covered the impact of the health crisis and published photos of dead bodies floating in the river, which offended the government. We, therefore, urge you to raise the issue of press freedom during your bilateral meetings with Indian leaders,” the letter, which was signed by IPI executive director Barbara Trionfi, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/media-network-wants-blinken-to-flag-threats-to-press-freedom/article35574417.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||No landless farmers in new database||The Centre’s new National Farmers Database will only include land-owning farmers for now as it will be linked to digitised land records, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. A data policy was being prepared specifically for the agriculture sector in collaboration with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), he said. This exclusion of landless and tenant farmers becomes significant in light of the fact that, when asked whether the database would be used to select beneficiaries of government schemes, Mr. Tomar said, “Government can make use of the database for targeted service delivery with higher efficiency and in a focussed and time bound manner.” Mr. Tomar was responding to questions from the Telugu Desam Party’s Jayadev Galla, raising concerns about data protection and farmer inclusion in the Centre’s new Agristack initiative to create a digital ecosystem for agriculture. The database would be linked to the digital land record management system and would thus only include farmers who were legal owners of agricultural land. “In future, the possibility of including others may be considered in consultation with State governments and other stakeholders,” Mr. Tomar said, in response to a query about the large number of landless farmers in the country. Asked about the involvement of private companies and the kind of data that was being shared with them, Mr. Tomar claimed that “no private sector companies are involved as far as building of the Agristack is concerned”. However, the first step for the initiative was a “federated farmers’ database that would serve as the core of the Agristack.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-landless-farmers-in-new-database/article35574405.ece
28 July 2021||Srinagar,||Kashmir has turned a new leaf, says President||President Ram Nath Kovind, who is on a four-day tour of Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday said Kashmir had turned a new leaf. He stressed that democracy had the capacity to reconcile all differences and bring out the best of the citizens’ potential. “Kashmir is happily realising this vision,” he noted. “As Kashmir has turned a new leaf, exciting new possibilities are opening up. The whole of India is watching you with admiration and pride. Kashmiri youth are scaling new heights in a variety of sectors, from civil service exams to sports and entrepreneurial ventures,” he stated. Mr. Kovind was addressing the 19th Annual Convocation of the University of Kashmir in Srinagar amid tight security. Appeal to youth He called upon the younger generation of Kashmir to learn from J&K’s rich legacy. “Kashmir has always been a beacon of hope for the rest of India. Violence, which was never part of ‘Kashmiriyat’, became the daily reality. It is alien to Kashmiri culture and an aberration, a temporary one like a virus that attacks the body and needs to be purged,” he observed. J&K was witnessing a new beginning and making efforts to regain its lost glory, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kashmir-has-turned-a-new-leaf-says-president/article35574407.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Notice to Centre, Delhi on vaccine for homeless||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Union and the Delhi governments to inform what steps had been taken to vaccinate the homeless. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud refused to take an “elitist view” to “restrain beggars, vagabonds and the homeless” from begging at traffic junctions, markets and public places.  The court said several socio-economic problems drove people into begging. Their poverty could not be wished away by passing an order to remove them from the streets. It, however, took a serious note of a petition by Kush Kalra, represented by advocate Mohit Paul, that the government should take measures to ensure that the homeless were vaccinated. The court termed this a “human problem”. ‘Ensure medical facilities’ It recorded in its order, “We are issuing notice to Union of India and Delhi government at this stage, since the immediate issue is of vaccinating the homeless in Delhi and to ensure medical facilities. We expect a response from the Union of India and GNCTD [The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi] on what steps are being taken to deal with this human problem.” Mr. Kalra submitted that the homeless, in case they were ill, had no place to quarantine themselves. Many were not aware of social distancing protocols. If affected by COVID-19, they were a danger to themselves and to others. Most of them did not have access to proper medical care or treatment. The government had to address the needs of this segment of society immediately in anticipation of a third COVID-19 wave. The court has sought the assistance of Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta in the case. The Bench posted the case after two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-notice-to-centre-delhi-on-vaccine-for-homeless/article35574438.ece

Working presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny and Pawan Goel accompanied Mr. Sidhu to their first meeting with the Chief Minister since taking over the reins. The letter said after deliberations and consultations with party workers, there are five priority areas on which the government must act upon immediately from amongst the 18-point agenda. Key demands The key demands include punishing the main culprits behind the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and the police firing incidents at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan and the arrest of the big fish behind drug trafficking as mentioned in the Special Task Force report. The letter also says: “Our government must fulfil your 2017 election promise by cancelling faulty power purchase agreements.” On the “three black farm laws”, the Congress leaders demanded that the Punjab government must reject them completely. The Chief Minister said all the key issues of concern raised by the party leadership were already in advanced stages of resolution by his government, which had been working on them in close coordination with the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/act-immediately-on-five-priority-areas-sidhu-tells-cm-amarinder/article35574627.ece
28 July 2021||Patna,||Bihar seeks details of wards of bureaucrats studying in govt. schools||The Bihar government has sought details of children of bureaucrats studying in government schools in all the 38 districts of the State. The move follows an interim order issued by the Patna High Court on July 13, asking the Bihar government to furnish details of the wards of IAS, IPS and Class-1 and II officers in the State services studying in government schools. The court directive came on a writ petition filed by guest schoolteachers whose services were terminated. The Additional Chief Secretary of the State Education Department, Sanjay Kumar, said in view of the court order, he had written to all District Magistrates (DMs), Superintendents of Police (SPs) and district education officers to collect the details. Review meeting The State Chief Secretary will hold a review meeting through videoconference with all the DMs and SPs on August 4, he said. The court is scheduled to hear the case on August 16. Earlier, while responding to a counter-affidavit filed by the Chief Secretary in the case, Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay of the Patna High Court had observed: “The Chief Secretary has made tall claims and highlighted the steps taken for improvement in the quality of education but those policies and schemes are only glorifying the records where these policy documents are maintained to understand the qualitative change and improvement. The court is of the considered view that improvement in the system can be gauged by the faith of people towards the system.” “Let the Chief Secretary convene a videoconference of DMs of all the districts of the State to solicit the information from them as to how many wards of the IAS and IPS and Class-I and II officers in the State services are undergoing studies in the government-run elementary and other schools. The CS shall file an affidavit, furnishing details of wards of the elite class studying in government-run schools, as it will instil confidence in society,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-seeks-details-of-wards-of-bureaucrats-studying-in-govt-schools/article35574628.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Centre will help to mediate border rows’||The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, had been requested to grant further extension of time up to January 9, 2022, to frame the rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the Union Home Ministry told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. In a question on another topic from Haji Fazlur Rehman (BSP), the Ministry said there were disputes arising out of demarcation of boundaries and claims and counter-claims over territories between Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram. “Occasional protests and incidents of violence are reported from some of the disputed border areas...the approach of the Central government has consistently been that inter-State disputes can be resolved only with the cooperation of the State governments concerned and that the Central government acts only as a facilitator for amicable settlement of the dispute in the spirit of mutual understanding,” said the written reply. The CAA was notified on December 12, 2019 and came into force on January 10, 2020, the Ministry replied to a question from Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi on what steps were being taken to frame the CAA rules. The passage of the CAA, apart from the issue of National Register of Citizens, had triggered widespread public protests for several weeks in the country. Several Opposition parties opposed the Act. The law aims to grant citizenship to undocumented migrants belonging to six non-Muslim communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-will-help-to-mediate-border-rows/article35574395.ece

Bommai) also served in the same post, just as JD(S) father-son duo of H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy. The decision on the next Chief Minister came just a day after 78-year-old Mr. Yediyurappa resigned with tears in his eyes, at an event organised to mark the second anniversary of his tenure — a bumpy ride marked by dissidence, allegations of corruption and nepotism. Mr. Bommai, in contrast, will be seen not only as young and educated, but also non-controversial. In a day of dramatic developments, the BJP Legislature Party (BJPLP) meeting was convened and central observers dispatched from Delhi. At the late evening meeting, the name of Mr. Bommai was proposed by Mr. Yediyurappa and seconded by former Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol. The choice was announced by central observer Dharmendra Pradhan. Speaking after staking his claim, Mr. Bommai thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party, besides Mr. Yediyruappa whom he described as his mentor. “I have been chosen unanimously by the BJPLP.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Assam, Mizoram can approach SC, Centre’||The long-standing border dispute between Assam and Mizoram can be resolved either by the Supreme Court or the Centre, legal experts said on Tuesday. One of the experts called the brewing border dispute “a failure of the Constitutional machinery”. While senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi and Assam's standing counsel Debojit Borkakati said the Centre should intervene and take steps for a peaceful settlement, another senior lawyer Dushyant Dave was of the view that both the States should be put under President’s Rule. Mr. Dave said there was a failure of the Constitutional machinery in both the States and the violent incident was the ugliest manifestation of the insurrection between the States since Independence. He said these north-eastern States had conducted themselves poorly and the incident justified sacking both the governments and keeping the States under the President's Rule through Governor. ‘Litigation takes time’ Mr. Dwivedi, a Constitutional law expert, said the two States could avail themselves of two options; one was to approach the Central government and ask it to resolve the problem in an appropriately agreed manner through a legislation. “They can also move the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution, but litigation takes time. Meanwhile, the Centre can form a high-level committee, sit down with the States, and sort out the issue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-mizoram-can-approach-sc-centre/article35574399.ece

He had said that while vaccination of children will be a milestone, children mostly have mild infections and some even are asymptomatic. “They, however, can be carriers of the infection, which is dangerous for the medically compromised section of society. Currently, while Zydus has already done the trials, Covaxin trials should be over by August or September, and by that time, we should get an approval and roll out the vaccine for children,’’ he noted. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration previously gave Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine emergency use authorisation for children. This vaccine requires two injections given 21 days apart. The European medicines’ watchdog has also approved the use of Moderna’s vaccine for children aged 12 to 17. ‘Very helpful’ Suresh Kumar Panuganti, consultant peadiatric critical care, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, said prevention is better than cure and various diseases could be prevented in children by using vaccines. Dr. (Maj.) Manish Mannan, HoD, Peadiatrics and Neonatology, Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon, pointed out that vaccines have a great role in preventing the severity of illness, comorbidity and mortality. “Vaccination would be very helpful for the safety of the children and is very necessary. As announced, first the vaccination will be given to 12-18 year old kids and then it will followed with other age group of kids depending upon the effectiveness, adverse effects and reaction, if any. In this pandemic, if vaccination is available, one should surely get it,’’ he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccination-of-children-as-early-as-august-govt/article35574403.ece
28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Assam CM Sarma talks tough on border row||He also visited the Silchar Medical College and Hospital and met police personnel injured in the attack. Assam, he said, will behave responsibly under all circumstances, and even under provocation, will not fire back at civilians. “We hope that the Mizos regret that they have fired at fellow countrymen but we are leaving it to their wisdom and conscience. This is a dispute between two states and not a fight between countries. But the video evidence that we have of the Mizo forces celebrating after attacking our people has saddened and hurt us,” he said. The Chief Minister said that satellite images have shown that roads are being constructed and forests cleared for jhum cultivation (shifting cultivation) which cannot be allowed. “We will move the Supreme Court to ensure that the forests are protected,” he said.  “The dispute is not regarding land but encroachment of reserved forests is the issue. We have no settlements in the forest areas and, if Mizoram can give evidence, we will immediately carry out eviction,” he said. The Chief Minister asserted that not an inch of Assam's land could be encroached by the neighbouring State. “People have sacrificed their lives but boundary has been protected which we will continue to do at any cost,” he asserted. Mr. Sarma said after he took office in May, he had spoken to Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga and suggested that both the States should maintain status quo . The Mizoram CM had agreed but insisted that Chief Secretary-level talks should continue, he said.  The Assam Chief Minister said in the last few months several attempts were made to encroach Assam’s land in Hailakandi, Karimganj and Cachar districts in five sectors and the police foiled each attempt. “On July 25, Cachar DFO gave a report that a road was being constructed inside the Inner Line Forest, and when our deputy commissioner, IGP and DIG rushed to the spot, the next day they found that not only a road but a police post had also been set up in the forest,” he said. The Kolasib Superintendent of Police was asked to remove the post, and while talks were going on to find a peaceful solution, Mr. Sarma alleged, “Mizoram police along with civilians began pelting stones, opened fire and later started firing from LMGs from top of a hill which continued for 30 to 35 minutes.” He said as the firing was on he spoke to Mr. Zoramthanga six times, asking him to control the situation “but he just said that he was sorry”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-cm-sarma-talks-tough-on-border-row/article35574406.ece

Buoyed by her victory, especially in the face of a resurgent BJP, her meetings with the Opposition parties are being seen as a definitive sign that the TMC wants to play a larger role in national politics. “Opposition unity will automatically happen,” Ms. Banerjee said. Asked if she will lead such a consortium of Opposition parties, she said, “India will lead and we shall follow.” The Lok Sabha elections are still some time away, she said but the preparations have to begin right away. On Pegasus, she urged the BJP government to call for an all-party meeting to clear the air on its role in the whole issue. “The Prime Minister should call for an all-party meeting and consult us. There should be a Supreme Court monitored probe.” On meeting Mr. Modi, she said it was a courtesy call and that she was following the Constitutional protocol. “I had asked for an appointment with the PM to seek his blessings after winning the Bengal Assembly polls for the third time.” During the brief meeting, she said she has urged the Prime Minister to ensure more doses of COVID-19 vaccine for Bengal. “I am not against giving vaccines to other States, but considering the population of Bengal we need more doses,” she said. She will meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday. Ms. Banerjee said she will meet Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav in the next few days. The only significant omission in the list of Opposition leaders is NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar. “I will speak to him and maybe we will meet once the COVID situation settles,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-terms-modi-meeting-a-courtesy-call/article35574413.ece

Kishan Reddy said a significant number of jobs were lost in the tourism sector once the lockdown was implemented. “About 14.5 million jobs during Q1, 5.2 million during Q2 and 1.8 million jobs during Q3 were expected to have been lost as compared to an estimated 34.8 million jobs in the pre-pandemic period of 2019-20 [direct jobs],” he said. Mr. Reddy said this was one of the key findings of the study done by the National Council of Applied Economic Research for the Ministry of Tourism to assess the extent of losses to the sector. As per the report, due to overall economic slowdown during 2020-21, tourism economy or tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) saw a fall of 42.8% in April-June 2020, 15.5% in July-September 2020 and a fall of 1.1% in October-December 2020. “Due to significant drop in tourist arrivals and hence tourism expenditure, during the pandemic, it is estimated that TDGVA plummeted by as much as 93.3% in Q1 of 2020-21 over its level in the same quarter of the previous year,” the Minister stated, adding that it picked up slightly to post a decline of 79.5% and 64.3% in the second quarter and the third quarter respectively. However, Mr. Reddy added that the Ministry did not maintain data on revenue generated from tourism. Replying to another query, the Minister said no formal study had been instituted by the Ministry to assess whether the movement of people from all States increased at tourist places, which might raise fears of an increase in COVID-19 positive cases after the second wave. Further, Mr. Reddy said that as per the Bureau of Immigration, the number of foreign tourist arrivals in India stood at 10.93 million in 2019, declining to 2.74 million in 2020 and about 0.42 million till June 2021. According to the data compiled by the Ministry of Tourism, domestic tourist visits during the calendar year 2019 stood at 2,321.98 million while those in 2020 stood at 610.21 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/215-million-jobs-lost-in-tourism-sector-centre/article35574482.ece

A Mizoram Minister, the local MLA and the village council chief alleged that the CRPF were unable to prevent “Assam policemen and civilians” from entering and overruning security forces’ camps inside Mizoram near Veringte on Monday. Mizoram Minister Lalruatkima alleged the CRPF did not restrain police personnel and civilians from Assam from intruding into Mizoram territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crpf-faces-flak-over-border-clash/article35574396.ece

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V.

28 July 2021||New Delhi,||Rakesh Asthana appointed Delhi Police Commissioner||Days before his superannuation, Gujarat cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana was on Tuesday appointed Delhi Police Commissioner. Mr. Asthana, a 1984-batch IPS officer, was to retire on July 31. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs order, Mr. Asthana, who was serving as Director General, Border Security Force, will join as the Delhi Police Commissioner with immediate effect. On July 1, Balaji Srivastava, a 1988-batch IPS officer, was given the additional charge of Commissioner of Delhi Police. While clearing Mr. Asthana’s appointment as CP, Delhi, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the inter-cadre deputation from Gujarat to AGMUT cadre. The ACC also extended Mr. Asthana’s service initially for a period of one year beyond the date of his superannuation or until further order, whichever is earlier. This is one of the very few instances when an IPS officer outside of the AGMUT cadre has been appointed as the Delhi Police chief. Mr. Asthana had earlier served as the Special Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation. He was the Narcotics Control Bureau chief when actor Rhea Chakraborty was arrested in a drugs case in Mumbai. During his stint in the CBI in 2018, Mr. Ashtana was engaged in an unsavoury spat with the then CBI Director Alok Verma. Both the officers were removed from the central probe agency and Mr. Asthana was subsequently cleared of the charges.

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Protecting waterbodies is duty of the State govt.: NGT||It is the duty of the State government to ensure that regular maintenance works are carried out in rivers, and that their flow is not obstructed by any natural cause, the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal said. The State is also expected to keep the Adyar river in conformity with the standard provided for river water, so that aquatic life can have sufficient oxygen, the Bench said. If there is any laxity on the part of regulators in carrying out such activities, it will adversely affect the environment, especially the riverine environment ecology and aquatic life, including flora and fauna, the Bench said. The Bench made these observations in a case related to the illegal discharge of sewage into Adyar river at Saidapet. It came down heavily on the Public Works Department and other government departments for not filing a report on the status of the river, as mandated by it. The Bench also noted that a joint committee formed by it had not submitted its report. “The fact that in spite of being given a year, the report has not been submitted, shows the lethargic attitude on the part of the regulators as well as the government departments in carrying out the directions of this tribunal and protecting the environment,” the Bench said. The departments sought some more time to file their reports. While giving them time to submit the reports, the Bench said, “If they do not submit the report, then they will have to face consequences for non-compliance with the directions, as contemplated under sections 25 and 28 of the National Green Tribunal, 2010. If the report is not filed by the committee members, then they are directed to appear before this tribunal through video conference on the next hearing date to show cause as to why action should not be taken against them for non-compliance with the direction.” The tribunal directed the joint committee to further ascertain the current status of the river based on a recent media report and submit its findings. All departments have been directed to file their reports before August 25.  The fact that in spite of being given a year, the report has not been submitted, shows the lethargic attitude on the part of the regulators Southern Bench, National Green Tribunal||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protecting-waterbodies-is-the-duty-of-state-govt-says-ngt/article35574599.ece
28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen want more bus services between hamlets||For decades, fishing communities have been struggling without sufficient buses between their hamlets in Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and the city. Though the government has introduced a new bus route, 109T, connecting 100 fishing hamlets between Tiruvottiyur and Kovalam, fishermen want more direct buses connecting villages in all the three districts. “Fishermen from Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chennai visit Kasimedu for work. There are people coming from Semmencherry and Ennore. They have to come early in the morning. But since they do not have sufficient bus services, some sleep on the boats. Many rely on autorickshaws, who fleece them,” said Nanjil P. Ravi, spokesperson, Akhila India Meenavargal Sangam. The demand of fishermen for more bus services over the years have not yielded results. “Our relatives are spread across hamlets in three districts. When the bus terminus was functioning from Flower Bazaar, fishermen could easily change buses to reach their destinations. But after it was shifted to Koyambedu, it became difficult,” he added. K. Bharati, president, South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association, said many women fish vendors visit Kasimedu very early in the morning. “Due to lack of bus services, they arrive at the docks the previous day, and stay the night. More buses will help them travel easily. It would be helpful if the MTC allows us to carry fish till 5 a.m. so that there is no disturbance to other passengers during peak hours,” he said. Mr. Ravi said more than two decades ago, the government had rolled out a bus service connecting Tiruvottiyur and Kovalam. “But it was stopped in a month as the road was bad, and the drivers were finding it difficult,” he said. Now, with the introduction of the 109T bus route, fishermen are hopeful of getting buses connecting the three districts. “Fishermen from Kovalam used to shell out thousands of rupees to travel by cab to fishing hamlets around Royapuram. They also used to come to Kasimedu by hiring vehicles. Now, they are relieved as they spend Rs. 48 per person on the newly introduced 109T bus route,” explained P.R. Mahendran, a fisherman from N.T.O. Kuppam. According to an MTC official, the new route was started on July 4, based on a request by the Akhila India Meenavargal Sangam. A total of four buses are operated between Tiruvottiyur and Kovalam. On average more than 1,500 passengers travel on this route on a daily basis. The 109T bus service starts from Tiruvottiyur, and makes over 35 stops, including Royapuram, Beach Station, Kamarajar Salai, Sathya Studio, Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Neelankarai and Muttukadu, before reaching Kovalam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-want-more-bus-services-between-hamlets/article35574577.ece
28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 cases in city drop to levels seen before the two waves||The number of COVID-19 cases reported in the city has dropped below the level that was witnessed during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The city reported 111 cases on Sunday, which was the lowest since May 1, 2020, when the cases began to steadily rise during the first wave that reached its peak by the end of June last year. The previous lowest since the first wave was 119 cases reported on February 20 this year, before the onset of the second wave. On average, the city has been reporting around 130 cases a day in the past week, which was lower than the average cases reported in any one-week period since May 2020. The decline in the number of cases following the peak of the second wave was noticeably sharper compared to the overall Tamil Nadu numbers, which are yet to drop. The State has been reporting more than 1,700 cases a day, which is comparable to the numbers reported during mid-November last year, when the first wave of the pandemic was on a gradual and prolonged decline. The State’s number of cases came down to the lowest of around 450 cases a day in February this year. It can be noticed that even during this lowest phase in the State before the second wave, the city was accounting for roughly one in four cases. However, the city now accounts for less than one-tenth of the cases reported daily in the State. ‘No stone unturned’ Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said although the cases had considerably come down, they were leaving no stone unturned in the measures being taken to avoid another surge. “Every Tuesday and Friday, all health professionals, experts and senior officials, including myself, meet to discuss every case that was reported to ensure that the source of contraction was identified and contained. We do not want any cases for which the source of infection cannot be traced,” he said. Focus on vaccination With more than 25,000 tests performed a day, he highlighted that the city has not lowered its testing despite the decline in cases. “In markets, malls and other such vulnerable places, we regularly collect samples on a rotational basis to identify any spread at the earliest,” he said. Mr. Bedi also highlighted the focus being given to vaccination, with more drives being organised in malls, markets and other places to quickly inoculate as many people as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-cases-in-city-drop-to-levels-seen-before-the-two-waves/article35574590.ece
28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘DMK govt. will fulfil poll promise of reserving 75% jobs for Tamils’||The DMK government will stick to its poll promise of reserving 75% jobs in the private sector for Tamils, according to Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu. In an interview, he shared his thoughts on the investment climate, plans for the future and more. Edited excerpts:  Tamil Nadu ranks 14th in the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) ranking. Does this have an impact on investor sentiment? What steps are you taking to improve the State’s ranking? These rankings don’t always depict the ground reality of the investment climate in the State. Even at the global and national levels, concerns have been raised around the conceptualisation, methodology and evaluation process of the EoDB ranking. Tamil Nadu does well in many rankings, like the Export Preparedness Index and the Innovation Index, which complement EoDB. The EoDB ranking methodology needs a holistic relook. The Chief Minister recently launched 100-plus services on the single window portal. This will help us better our rankings. The true indicator of EoDB is the investments attracted. In three months, our government has signed MoUs entailing investments worth Rs. 17,141 crore. But big names like Tesla are missing in the new investments… We have signed MoUs with globally renowned firms like CapitaLand (Singapore), ZF (Germany), Hyoseong (Korea), Araymond (France), AxleTech (USA) and Cryolor (France). We are confident of getting many mega projects. Is the State in talks with Tesla? Tesla is talking about entering India, and has flagged the issue of high import duty. Whenever the firm evinces interest in foraying into India, the Tamil Nadu government will make its pitch. When Kitex Garments exited Kerala, there was buzz that it would come to Tamil Nadu. But it eventually went to Telangana. Why? The day Kitex announced its withdrawal from Kerala, Industries Secretary N. Muruganandam and I offered it the best incentives we could put forward. Our doors are not closed. Kitex has got other plans, and we are open to its investments. Talks are on at various levels. The DMK’s poll manifesto promised 75% quota in jobs for Tamils in the private sector. Is it feasible? A similar move by Haryana drew a negative reaction from the IT/ITES sector... Yes, it is possible. Tamil Nadu has skilled and semi-skilled labourers. Name the category, and we have the talent pool. We are concentrating on it, and we will make it possible by way of industrialisation. That is why when we talk about investments, we are also talking about employment opportunities. The availability of human resources in Tamil Nadu and Haryana is totally different and not comparable. Industries prefer Tamil Nadu because of skilled labour. It is only logical to hire locals. Tamils are ruling the IT/ITES industry across India as well as the [San Francisco] Bay Area. We will give priority to locals, and we will stand by it. The former AIADMK regime banked on the Global Investors’ Meet to woo investors. What are your plans to attract investments? There isn’t a standard playbook for attracting investments. We are focusing on three things — industrial infrastructure, enabling ecosystem and proactive investment promotion. Under industrial infrastructure, Sipcot will create a land bank of 15 new industrial parks and upgrade the existing parks on an outlay of Rs. 15,000 crore [in the next five years]. Secondly, digitisation of G2B services, reduction of compliance burden, investor-focused policies for sunrise sectors and financial assistance for large industries [will be implemented]. Thirdly, [there will be] targeted investment promotion to attract value-add investments in focus sectors. The government has set a target of the State becoming a $1 trillion economy by 2030 and attracting Rs. 23 lakh crore worth of investments with the potential to create jobs for 46 lakh people. A year ago, the State Industrial Policy spoke of incentivising firms looking to shift base from China to India. Do you have any plan to attract them now? The Union government has set up a panel for screening investments from China. More than 100 proposals involving FDI from China are pending. Prospective investments in Tamil Nadu from China that are in the pipeline are worth at least Rs. 10,000 crore. We are working towards getting these cleared. Under the GST regime, States have to design their own incentives for industries. With the State’s financial position under stress, will it be feasible? Some feel the State should not provide incentives to industry, and should use the funds for welfare measures instead... The subsidies provided to large industries constitute less than 1% of the State’s Budget, and it is neither a matter of contention nor of competition when it comes to welfare. True welfare can be ensured through the creation of meaningful and gainful employment, which is fully aligned with the mandate for industrial development. In that sense, any dissonance between the expenditure towards industries and welfare is purely suppositious. What is the status of the Aerospace Park at Sriperumbudur? The project is spread over 250 acres. So far, 14 plots have been allocated to aerospace industries. Two firms have commenced production. Two more have completed construction, and will start production in two months. The Rs. 250 crore Aero Hub (advance computing design centre) is under construction, and will be completed by July 2022. Many Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have been lying vacant for several years. How do you intend to fill these spaces? After the sunset period, industries are less keen on setting up shop in SEZs. Some of them are being denotified as Domestic Tariff Areas, and the land is used for new industries setting up shop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govt-will-fulfil-poll-promise-of-reserving-75-jobs-for-tamils/article35574562.ece

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Division Bench stays single judge’s order against Vijay||A Division Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday stayed the operation of a highly critical order passed by a single judge recently while dismissing a 2012 writ petition preferred by actor C. Joseph Vijay, seeking entry tax exemption for his Rolls Royce Ghost, imported from England. Justices M. Duraiswamy and R. Hemalatha granted the interim stay after senior counsel Vijay Narayan, representing the actor, said the latter was willing to pay the tax in full, but wanted the “uncharitable” remarks, made not only against him but also the “actors’ community at large,” expunged. The senior counsel also wanted the Division Bench to set aside the imposition of the costs of Rs. 1 lakh on the actor. After hearing him, the Bench directed the Commercial Tax Department to raise a challan, demanding the payment of 80% of the tax, since 20% had already been paid in 2012. Such demand must be raised in a week and honoured in a week thereafter, the Bench said. It decided to hear his appeal next on August 31 to consider the plea for expunging the remarks and setting aside the costs. Mr. Narayan brought it to the notice of the Bench that the Kerala High Court had, in 2000, ruled that the State government was not empowered to levy entry tax on imported cars. A Division Bench of the Madras High Court, too, took a similar view. So Mr. Vijay had filed the writ petition in 2012. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that State governments were entitled to levy entry tax. Subsequently, the High Court began dismissing writ petitions pending before it. All those cases were rejected with a simple dismissal order, he said. But the single judge took exception to the writ petition filed by the actor, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/single-judges-order-against-vijay-stayed/article35574569.ece

Steps were being taken through Indian missions in the respective countries. Following credible information on illegal export of stolen antiquities from the city, the officers of the special wing conducted a search at Selva Exports in Aravamudhan Garden, Kilpauk, on Monday. They seized two stone idols, a metal idol and a painting of Lord Krishna from inside wooden articles on the first floor of the premises. The police registered a first information report and arrested B. Subramaniam, 58. Mr. Singh told presspersons that since last year, the special wing had booked 17 cases and arrested 18 persons, besides seizing 40 stolen idols across the State and 74 idols from Jean Paul Rajarathinam in Puducherry. Three idols of Sri Rama, Lakshmana and Sita, which originally belonged to Rajagopalaswami temple, Anandamangalam, were recovered from a museum in London and they were restored to the temple. Steps have been taken to bring back an idol of Hanuman traced to Singapore, he said. Explaining the progress in a few cases, the ADGP said a case was registered at the Kadayam police station in connection with theft of five idols from Sri Narasimmanathar temple, Alwarkurichi, in 1985. Two of those idols, namely Adhikara Nandhi and Kangala Nathar, were recovered through the Antiquities Trafficking Unit, New York. Soon, they would be brought back to the State. Similarly, six idols, which went missing from Sri Vishwanathar temple, Vikrapandiam, Thiruthuraipoondi taluk, and another six idols, which went missing from Veera Cholapuram temple, Kallakurichi district, were traced in the U.S. and efforts were on to bring them back.

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister opens city’s first batch of CNG pumps||Chief minister M.K. Stalin on Tuesday inaugurated 25 compressed natural gas (CNG) pumps, owned by Torrent Gas, in the city and Tiruvallur. He opened the facilities, the first such in the State capital, via video conferencing in the presence of Minister of Industries Thangam Thennarasu and officials. He also opened their city gate station, from where gas would be supplied via pipelines to homes, industries and other commercial customers. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Stalin said, “Access to CNG, a cheaper and cleaner alternative to petrol and diesel, has been a felt need of the people of Tamil Nadu. Widespread availability of CNG and the significant savings it will bring will encourage consumers to adopt it, thereby having a positive impact on the environment. The domestic, commercial and industrial use of natural gas will spur further industrial development in the State.” Though Indian Oil Corporation’s liquid natural gas terminal was inaugurated at Ennore in March 2019 and is in use by industrial customers in Manali, providers have been opening CNG outlets in a phased manner. The company has tied up with State-run oil marketing companies for space in their fuel outlets, where separate tanks have been created for CNG pumps. Nagapattinam and Ramanathapuram already have CNG outlets. The outlets were getting gas supply from the Indian Oil Corporation. Addressing reporters at an online press conference, Jinal Mehta, director, Torrent Gas, said CNG would be sold in the city at Rs. 51.35 per kg. This is the second lowest price in the country. A few days ago, Mr. Stalin inaugurated the Atlantic Gulf and Pacific (AG&P) Pratham’s CNG outlet at Meenambakkam, under the Kancheepuram geographic area.

The order has modified the roster system prescribed for the appointment of people in public services. The revised quota scheme is a sequel to the previous AIADMK regime framing the Special Reservation Act for Vanniyars, which came into effect on February 26, the day on which the Election Commission of India announced its schedule for the Assembly poll in Tamil Nadu and four other States. Here is an explainer on the issue: What is the Special Reservation Act? The law has envisaged the distribution of the 20% quota for MBCs and DNCs by assigning 10.5% to Vanniyars, 7% for as many as 25 MBCs and 68 DNCs, and 2.5% for the remaining 22 MBCs. There are seven sub-castes — Vanniyar, Vanniya, Vannia Gounder, Gounder or Kander, Padayachi, Palli and Agnikula Kshatriya — under the broad classification of Vanniyars. The rationale behind the law is to provide MBCs and DNCs better access to various benefits and promote their equitable development. What prompted the previous AIADMK government to adopt the law? There were both political and policy factors that contributed to the enactment of the law. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an ally of the AIADMK since 2019, has been a long-standing proponent of the idea. In December 2020, it launched an agitation in support of its demand, forcing the then government to announce the formation of a one-member commission of inquiry to collect quantifiable data on castes, communities and tribes of the State in six months. Between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s, two backward classes commissions — one headed by A.N. Sattanathan and another by J.A. Ambasankar, both former civil servants — pointed out that several communities among those in the list of BCs had not received their due share in educational and employment opportunities, while a small number of communities in the list of BCs benefited to a relatively larger extent. It had been the case of Vanniyar leaders that their community was among those left behind in the scheme of reservation. The law was framed after the State government consulted the chairman of the State Backward Classes Commission, M. Thanikachalam, on the possibility of providing internal reservation among MBCs and DNCs within 20%, to the Vanniyars. The chairman, in his response, had referred to the recommendation of his predecessor, M.S. Janarthanam, to the government in 2012, for providing 10.5% quota to Vanniyars within the 20%. How did the scheme of exclusive reservation for MBCs come into being? Even though the first official list of MBCs was prepared by the Congress government in January 1957 for giving more concessions to candidates of the sub-category, it was left to the DMK government, in March 1989, that provided 20% quota exclusively to MBCs and DNCs. This was taken out of the quota of BCs, who had 50% reservation till then. This was done to address the grievance of Vanniyars and other communities. What has contributed to the implementation of the 2021 Special Reservation Act? There was an element of uncertainty over the law getting enforced, which was essentially due to the circumstances under which the legislation was adopted by the Assembly this February. During the campaign for the Assembly election, critics of the Act said this would adversely affect the prospects of MBCs and DNCs other than Vanniyars. The AIADMK’s coordinator and former Deputy Chief Minister, O. Panneerselvam, termed the law provisional, because it was only after the completion of work by the one-man commission, compiling data on the State’s castes, that a final picture would emerge on the quantum of reservation for various communities. In June end, the Supreme Court refused to stay the operation of the law. Earlier, on June 23, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin assured the Assembly that a “good decision will definitely” be taken after consulting officials of the departments concerned. Recently, it was reported that the government had chosen not to extend the life of the panel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-low-down-on-the-105-quota-for-vanniyars/article35574564.ece

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin rolled out free bus services for women, transpersons and the differently abled in 7,300 ordinary fare buses across the State. This includes 1,700 buses in the city. The service has been welcomed and from July 12 till date, more than 3.5 crore women, 20,000 transpersons and over 2 lakh differently abled persons have utilised it. M. Sekhar, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Share Vehicles General Trade Union, said the scheme was a good one. “Due to COVID-19, many people are working from home, there are no colleges or schools either. So our business has taken a hit already. Many share autorickshaw drivers have also lost customers due to the free bus scheme. The government can help us by providing permission to have a pre-paid system for share autorickshaws outside railway stations, bus termini and Metro stations,” he said. Autorickshaw drivers also complain that they have lost business. “We are facing losses due to app based taxis and Metro Rail. Now, the free bus service has aggravated our losses. The government should roll out some scheme for us too to help us tide over financial losses,” said M. Prabhu, an autorickshaw driver.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/autorickshaw-drivers-lose-business/article35574574.ece
28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘90 of 596 SC students awarded National Overseas Scholarships in 2020-21’||Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Virendra Kumar has said that 90 out of 596 Scheduled Caste (SC) students studying in universities abroad, who applied for the National Overseas Scholarships, were awarded the assistance in 2020-21. In response to Villupuram MP D. Ravikumar’s question about the number of students awarded the National Overseas Scholarship in the last five years and the total annual strength of applications, he said, “108, 178, 97, 97 and 90 students respectively were awarded the scholarship for 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 respectively. And only 14, 6, 5, 8 and 8 disabled students were awarded the scholarships during the same period.” The Minister revealed that 535 (2016-17), 487 (2017-18), 379 (2018-19), 461 (2019-20) and 596 (2020-21) students had applied for the scholarships. Mr. Ravikumar said that while allocation of funds is already low at Rs. 20 crore for the scheme, the budget is not being fully spent. “In 2017-18 and 2018-19, only Rs. 3.13 crore and Rs. 5.97 crore has been spent. The DMK and Congress should come forward to oppose the Modi government that is preventing the Scheduled Caste students from receiving education,” the VCK leader said. The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry implements two National Overseas Scholarship Schemes — a financial assistance scheme for select students from Scheduled Caste, denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, landless agricultural labourers and traditional artisan categories for pursuing Masters and PhD-level courses abroad and the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities implements a similar scheme for students with disabilities for pursuing Masters and Ph.D courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/90-of-596-sc-students-awarded-national-overseas-scholarships-in-2020-21/article35574969.ece

The water agency is finalising the tender process to procure 50 sewage disposal lorries to cater to the merged areas lacking underground drain coverage. At present, Metrowater allows private operators to decant sewage collected from merged areas in sewage pumping stations for a nominal charge. Before the pandemic, nearly 1,000 loads were decanted in these facilities daily. This is also part of the efforts to reduce pollution in the city waterways. The water agency has proposed to get the tankers and outsource operations and maintenance for seven years. The contractors will collect sewage in the added areas, and decant them in treatment plants at Sholinganallur, Perungudi, Nesapakkam and Kodungaiyur. The project would be implemented in six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metrowater-plans-to-offer-sewage-collection-to-citys-added-areas/article35574579.ece

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Karnataka files response to T.N.’s plea against dam||The Karnataka government has recently conveyed its response to the Centre regarding the Tamil Nadu government’s request not to take up the Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project, according to Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. This was through Karnataka’s communication of July 20, he informed the Rajya Sabha on Monday, replying to an un-starred question of former Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss of the PMK. Answering queries of the former Union Minister on whether the Karnataka government had sought permission from the Centre on the project and whether Tamil Nadu had given its consent, the Union Minister replied that the screening committee of the Central Water Commission (CWC), in its meeting on October 24, 2018, accorded “in-principle” clearance to Karnataka for the preparation of a Detailed Project Report (DPR) by the project authority (government of Karnataka), subject to “certain conditions”. In January 2019, the Karnataka government submitted the DPR to the CWC, copies of which had been forwarded to the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) for obtaining consent of co-basin States. As for the position on the 1892 agreement between the Madras Presidency and the then princely State of Mysore (presently, States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka), the Minister quoted Clause III of the pact in which the Mysore government should furnish to Madras “full information” regarding the proposed work on new irrigation reservoir or any new anicut on any river listed in schedules A, B and C of the Annexure to the agreement, and obtain consent of the latter ahead of the commencement of the work. The Madras government “shall be bound not to refuse such consent except for the protection of prescriptive right, already acquired and actually existing,” the Minister’s reply quoted the relevant Clause as saying. To a query by Mr. Vaiko of the MDMK and M. Shanmugam of the DMK on efforts made by the Centre to get the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal implemented, the Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti told the House that the Centre constituted the CWMA and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) to give effect to the Tribunal’s decision, as modified by the Supreme Court in 2018.

28 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Response poor to polytechnic courses||Admission to polytechnic colleges has been largely abysmal this, year though a few Chennai colleges have fared relatively well. While colleges in small towns are struggling to fill sanctioned seats, some city-based colleges have managed to receive a lot of applications. A faculty member at a city polytechnic said it received 1,000 applications for 450 seats. Earlier, it used to get over 1,500 applications. Although job opportunities are excellent, several issues have influenced the students’ preferences, teachers say. The most recent factor is the COVID-19 pandemic. With the School Education Department declaring all students as having passed class 10, 11 and 12, many aspire to a degree programme. To attract students government polytechnic colleges announced that no fee would be collected for the first year. Though this year the Higher Education Department decided that the criteria for admission would be class 9 marks, not many students have opted, said a faculty member.  “The All India Council for Technical Education’s academic calendar has given a deadline of October to commence classes for polytechnic and engineering students. Peer influence and the delay in admission process has adversely impacted polytechnic admissions,” the faculty member said. S. Shanmugasundaram, general manager at a private firm in Tiruppur, said that trained polytechnic students were hard to come by now. “In 2006-07, we used to recruit from various colleges and there was no dearth of trained candidates. A beginner’s salary is Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,000 and within three years the candidate can expect to do well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/response-poor-to-polytechnic-courses/article35574722.ece

28 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Association condemns G.O. issued for Vanniyar quota||The Society for the Rights of Backward Communities (SFRBC) on Tuesday condemned the State government for issuing the government order (G.O.) for implementation of an Act that provides 10.5% special reservation for the Vanniyars in education and employment. V. Rathna Sabapathy, coordinator of SFRBC, told mediapersons here that the representatives of other communities will soon announce “non-violent” steps across the State to attract the attention of the government on this issue. He alleged that the State government had “neglected” the demands of 252 backward communities through the special reservation for Most Backward Classes (Vanniakula Kshatriya) within the MBC quota, which he claimed would adversely impact the opportunities in education and employment for the youths from other communities. He also alleged that both the DMK and the AIADMK governments had introduced legislations only in favour of one community in the past and did not bring any legislation for other backward communities. The members of SFRBC and other allied organisations could not meet Chief Minister M.K. Stalin despite multiple representations to discuss this issue, Mr. Sabapathy claimed. On Monday evening, the DMK government issued the G.O for the 10.5% special reservation for the Vanniyars in education and employment with retrospective effect from February 26. As per the Act passed by the AIADMK government in February, the ‘Most Backward Classes (Vanniakula Kshatriya)’, the ‘Most Backward Classes’ and ‘Denotified Communities and the Most Backward Classes’ will have 10.5%, 7% and 2.5% respectively within the 20% reservation provided for these communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/association-condemns-go-issued-for-vanniyar-quota/article35574608.ece
28 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||TNSTC operates 775 buses in Coimbatore district||Nearly three weeks after the operation of buses were allowed in Coimbatore district as part of the COVID-19 lockdown relaxations, the Coimbatore Division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) operates 775 buses out of its total fleet of 1,012 buses in the district. Officials said on Tuesday that the 775 buses comprise 466 town buses and 309 mofussil buses. On July 5, the TNSTC Coimbatore Division operated 535 town and mofussil buses following the lockdown relaxations and added 240 more buses in these three weeks. However, despite the apparent increase in the number of buses, the TNSTC officials said the patronage has only increased marginally for the town and mofussil buses. Regarding the government’s scheme of free travel for women in ordinary town buses, the number of women availing the scheme in Coimbatore Corporation limits remain at around 1.1 lakh to 1.4 lakh a day despite the increase in number of ordinary town buses from 260 to 300 buses. Out of the 466 town buses that are currently being operated, 166 are deluxe ‘red’ buses that do not come under this scheme, officials said. Following the recent controversy involving a Coimbatore-Tiruppur TNSTC mofussil bus conductor allegedly using his saliva to issue tickets, all conductors have been instructed to ensure hygienic practices inside the buses, the TNSTC officials added. Officials from the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) said that around 50 buses were being operated from Coimbatore to various locations across the State and the air-conditioned buses were not being operated.

28 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘State needs separate export policy’||Tamil Nadu should come out with a separate export policy, said A. Sakthivel, chairman of Apparel Export Promotion Council and Federation of Indian Export Organisations. In a memorandum to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, he said that with Rs. 2.10 lakh crore worth exports, Tamil Nadu accounted for 10 % of total exports from India in 2019-2020. In a move to give an impetus to exports, the State should form an Export Promotion Board and have a separate export policy. Synthetic fibre garments Currently, Indian garment exports are mostly limited to cotton fibre-based products. This fulfils the need of overseas buyers for three months only. To acquire business throughout the year, the textile units in the State should maximise production of synthetic fibre garments/apparels. Considering the potential in this sector, the State should have an exclusive park to develop synthetic fabrics and garments. MMF segment and technical textiles are included among the 10 key sectors in the Production Linked Incentive Scheme announced by the Union government. The units coming up in the park can leverage on the benefits from the scheme too. The Government of India has announced a scheme of Mega Investment Textiles Parks (MITRA) and Tamil Nadu can set up parks for synthetic garments, garment accessories and textile machinery under the scheme. The two sea ports in Tamil Nadu one should be upgraded to accommodate mother vessels, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-needs-separate-export-policy/article35574604.ece
28 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Revenue Dept., HACA to check for violations in clearing of private land||The Revenue Department and the the Hill Area Conservation Authority (HACA) are closely checking for violations in clearing of 18 acres of private land near Anaikatti at 24 Veerapandi in the district.  Sources said Revenue Department officials inspected the private land close to Kandivazhi tribal settlement after the issue came to the attention of the District Collector, who is also the chairman of HACA, recently. Based on the Collector’s instructions, the Forest Department inspected the place some days ago and submitted a report that raised concerns about the flow of a stream that originates from the forest and passes through the land. The Department also pointed out that the passage of a small stream that flows to the main stream was obstructed after the land was cleared using excavators, the sources added. The Revenue Department officials, including Coimbatore north tahsildar, visited the place after residents of the tribal settlement lodged a complaint with the District Collector last week. The residents had complained that the owners of the land had encroached upon their land and blocked their way to the forest. A senior Revenue Department official said that the complaints of the residents were being checked. N. Veeran from the settlement said the land owners had now left a very narrow path for the tribal residents to access the forest. Wild animals, mainly elephants, use the wild stream and any obstruction to it would lead to animals coming to villages in search of water. He also alleged that the Revenue officials did not hear their grievances during the visit. The land is registered in the name of my mother, wife and a relative and was bought several years ago, said S. Surendran. “Bushes were cleared from the land for agricultural purpose. The tribal settlement’s land was not encroached upon and in fact we have given them path through our land to access the forest,” he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revenue-dept-haca-to-check-for-violations-in-clearing-of-private-land/article35574610.ece

28 July 2021||DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||‘2.12 crore people vaccinated in State’||Over 2.12 crore people have been vaccinated in the State so far and more people will be vaccinated soon, Minister for Health and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian said at Hogenakkal on Tuesday. Even as the second wave was coming to an end, there were concerns about the third wave that could not be dismissed. The new variants were posing a serious threat and, therefore, it was important for the public to get vaccinated. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had called for speeding up vaccination of the eligible population, Mr. Subramaniam said. As on date, 2,12,20,229 people had been vaccinated in the State. According to the Minister, the Union government had allocated 2,01,66,610 doses of vaccines to Tamil Nadu. Using these, 1,97,98,121 vaccinations were carried out by the government through its hospitals and camps. A total of 14,22,108 vaccinations were carried out by private hospitals. Speaking at Hogenakkal while overseeing a vaccination camp for coracle operators, Mr. Subramanian said Hogenakkal had managed to duck an infection for long till one case was reported from Manalmedu. Immunity came second, but vaccination was the key to protect oneself from infection or its severity. Earlier, Mr. Subramanian trekked a few kilometres through the unmotorable hill villages between Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri near Bettamugilalam and interacted with the people to know of their needs in health care.  New health scheme  The Minister told the media later in Dharmapuri that the Chief Minister would launch Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam, a scheme to provide health care at the doorstep, in the first week of August either in Dharmapuri or Krishnagiri. He said in Krishnagiri on Monday that the scheme would cover over one crore people across the State, screening them for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Over 20 lakh people in the State had diabetes and hypertension. The new scheme would also cover those undergoing dialysis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/212-crore-people-vaccinated-in-state/article35574720.ece

Abdul Gani Textile Market (Gani market) here on Tuesday. There are 370 permanent shops that function every day while 730 weekly shops function from Monday night to Tuesday night on the premises and on the roads. Due to COVID-19 second wave, the weekly shops are allowed to function only during day time till 9 p.m. All the shops that remain closed for two months due to lockdown are functioning from Monday to Saturday from July 5.

28 July 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine tokens based on electoral rolls reduce waiting time||The new system of issuing tokens based on the electoral rolls has reduced the waiting time of persons from over 12 hours to less than two hours at the vaccination centres here on Tuesday. With the number of COVID-19 cases increasing in May and June and the awareness level among people to vaccinate raising, people used to wait for over 12 hours during night time to receive tokens in the morning at the centres. Also, limited availability of vaccine doses resulted in huge crowds waiting for long hours outside the centres and returning without receiving the tokens. Since elderly persons and the general public faced hardship in waiting in queue, the district administration decided to issue tokens based on the electoral rolls in the Assembly constituencies. Based on the vaccine allotment to 181 centres in the district, tokens ranging from 50 to 200 were issued to people in each centre on Monday. On Tuesday, people with tokens reached the centre at 8 a.m. and the vaccination began at 10 a.m. In the Corporation limits, tokens were distributed booth wise in the Erode (East) and Erode (West) Assembly constituencies. Camps were held at 20 locations in the city limits covering 40 wards. A total of 9,050 persons were vaccinated. Officials said the camps would continue on Wednesday also.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-tokens-based-on-electoral-rolls-reduce-waiting-time/article35574709.ece

28 July 2021||Hyderabad,TAMIL NADU||Telangana challenges NoC to builder||After Ramappa temple secured the Unesco World Heritage Site tag, there is growing chorus for making a case for Hyderabad with the Qutb Shahi era Golconda Fort, Qutb Shahi tombs and Charminar besides a host of other sites. The sites in Hyderabad were nominated much earlier in 2010 while the Ramappa nomination was made in 2014. Trying to keep Golconda and Qutb Shahi tombs in the reckoning, the Telangana government is securing its flanks for a watertight case. The government is challenging the decision of the National Monuments Authority (NMA) to grant no-objection certificate (NoC) to a builder for constructing villas between the Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs complex. The State government is citing the NMA rule that automated approvals cannot be given near the site that are on Unesco tentative list. In a counter-affidavit, which The Hindu could access, the State invoked various sections in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (2010) challenging the issue of NoC to the builder. Interestingly, the NMA had at its May 6, 2021, meeting decided to reconsider the NoC citing: “After perusal of the application, as the monuments is likely to be world heritage site and complete data not provided, it was decided that Authority will visit the proposed site of construction with local officials of Archaeological Survey of India and Competent Authority, Telangana.” The inspection was never carried out. A month later, the NMA went back on its decision and issued the NoC with sharp words for Telangana to reveal the minutes of the 307th meeting: “The chairman has taken exception that Competent Authority, Telangana, chose to ignore the recommendation of NMA. As so recommended the competent authority may abide by the provisions of the Section 20D (4) and 20D (5) of the AMASR Act, 1958 and issue the necessary permission to the applicant without further delay.” The NMA invoked the NoC issued by the Archaeological Survey of India in 2008 for its decision in April 2019. But in 2010, the Golconda Fort and Qutb Shahi tombs were placed on tentative list of World Heritage Site putting them in the race for Unesco tag. The NMA has a caveat about automated approval of NoC when a site is on Unesco tentative list. During the examination of Ramappa temple by World Heritage Committee, the key opposition to its inclusion was based on the boundary of the site. Norway, which agreed for the inclusion wanted the boundaries of the site to be expanded in a major way to include the irrigation and other artefacts from Kakatiya era.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/telangana-challenges-noc-to-builder/article35574448.ece
28 July 2021||KARAIKAL,TAMIL NADU||Case made for airport in Karaikal under UDAN scheme||Apparent stalemate in the status of the proposed private greenfield airport in Karaikal town has prompted the travelling public in the port town to demand the facility under the UDAN scheme of the Central government. The Puducherry government had, during 2019, appointed Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL) to participae in the Karaikal Airport Development Project. Touted as India's first fully funded airport with private capital, work on the proposed greenfield project was earlier initited by Karaikal Airport Private Limited, a subsidiary of Super Airport Infrastructure Private Limited. The greenfield project was originally expected to be completed in June 2018 by the private promoter. The planned 1,800m runway was reduced to 1,250m due to problems in land acquisition. The private promoter, according to representatives of trade and industry in Karaikal, did not get the required support from the Puducherry government. The CIAL was later roped in and entrusted with the task of undertaking a feasibility survey of the airport development site and submit a report. According to official sources, there has been no further progress. The Karaikal Chamber of Commerce has been persistently urging the Puducherry government to build a greenfield airport in the region. “The trade and industry sectors expect the new regime to walk the extra mile to ensure air connectivity for Karaikal,” president of Karaikal Chamber of Commerce, Muthaiah said. The Super Airport Infrastructure India Pvt Ltd (SAIIPL), the promoter, had already obtained all necessary clearances from regulatory agencies including permission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation and no-objection certificate from the Puducherry government. A pre-feasibility study conducted by SAIIPL identified potential for air links to Chennai and Bengaluru in the form of devotees who visit shrines in and around Karaikal in large numbers all through the year. The places of worship include Saneeswarar temple at Tirunallaru, Nagore Dargah and the Basilica of Velankanni. “The new government must evince interest in the revival of the project in right earnest. Ideally, the Puducherry government must facilitate the private promoter to complete the project. Else, the government must prevail upon the Centre to start an airport under the UDAN regional connectivity scheme,” said V.R. Dhanaseelane, president of Karaikal District Citizens Welfare Association. The Karaikal Port project proposed in 2007 has taken shape, while the airport project proposed a year earlier is still in limbo, he added Earlier this year, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had proposed about 392 routes under UDAN 4.1 bidding process under the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/case-made-for-airport-in-karaikal-under-udan-scheme/article35574673.ece
28 July 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Seven arrested for house burglaries||The Sivaganga district police have arrested seven persons who had indulged in house break-in crimes in Karaikudi on July 10. Following complaints, police had formed special teams. A building contractor Senthil Kumar, who had locked his home on NGO Colony third street and went to Chennai on July 10, complained that Rs. 5 lakh cash and five sovereigns of gold jewels were missing from his home. Similarly, two others, including Renuka, a teacher from Kamban Nagar, NGO Colony, had complained about missing of 60 sovereigns of gold jewels. As the CCTV camera footage showed a car, when the police felt it was a breakthrough, the registration number of the vehicle was found fake. As the police interrogations were on, Thiruvannamalai police alerted the Sivaganga police team. Two days ago, six persons identified as Muthukumar (23), Petchumuthu (22), Yekalaivan (28), Indra Karthik (27) and Ramesh of Srivaikundam in Thoothukudi district, their accomplice Ramajayam of Kalasapakkam in Thiruvannamalai district were arrested. It is said that the gang had reportedly indulged in a wordy altercation with some forest officials in the district after they were told to vacate the falls where they were bathing. They were in an inebriated mood. When Thiruvannamalai police secured and interrogated them, the accused had confessed to have committed crimes in Karaikudi, Sivaganga district recently. With the money, they had spent lavishly on liquor and other illegal acts. They handed over the accused to the team from Sivaganga district. Based on the confession, the Karaikudi police also arrested Subramanian of Sandaipettai in Thirumayam. It is said that the suspect had given information about locked homes following which the gang from Thoothukudi district had laid their hands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/seven-arrested-for-house-burglaries/article35574685.ece
28 July 2021||Kochi,TAMIL NADU||Won’t interfere with Lakshadweep order: HC||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday declined to interfere with the Lakshadweep Health Director’s order constituting a four-member committee for recommending special evacuation of patients to Kochi or Agati or Kavaratti from other peripheral islands through air ambulance. The Bench, led by Chief Justice S. Manikumar, disposed of a writ petition filed by P.M. Mohammed Saliah from Amini challenging the order, after recording the submission of counsel for the Health Director that in case of dire emergency, the competent authority could order evacuation of patients in half an hour without waiting for the committee’s recommendation. Case-to-case basis The petitioner pointed out that the committee would make a recommendation on a case-to-case basis after evaluation of all relevant documents uploaded online by the medical officer in charge of the respective islands along with a specialist at the Indira Gandhi Hospital, Karavatti. The order had put the petitioner andother inhabitants in great hardship since it would delay the processing of evacuation requests, endangering the life of the patient. Earlier, patients in critical condition used to be airlifted as soon as the medical officer of the respective islands made a request to the Director, Health Services functioning in Kavaratti. When the petition was taken up for hearing, S. Manu, counsel for the Health Director, submitted that as per the protocol for evacuation, an evacuation request from the island concerned was forwarded as text message to the nodal officer, special sortie evacuation, who in turn would forward the same to the Director of the Health Services, medical superintendent and the specialist doctors concerned at the Indira Gandhi Hospital, Kavaratti who are members of the evacuation committee.  The necessary documents were sent via WhatsApp or e-mail by the doctor concerned. The whole exercise might take half an hour at the maximum. In case of dire emergency or failure of the network in the island concerned, the competent authority could order evacuation via text message without waiting for the committee’s recommendations. The evacuation of less emergency cases, which were to be done on the same day, however, could be delayed till the cut-off time for the respective islands. The Health Service Department would ensure that there would be no delay in evacuation due to the functioning of the committee, he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wont-interfere-with-lakshadweep-order-hc/article35574441.ece
28 July 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||TDB to seek consensus on priests issue||The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) plans to hold consultations with stakeholders to evolve a consensus on the contentious issue of reservation of the Sabarimala temple priesthood for Malayala Brahmins.  While a section of the non-Brahmin priests have moved the Kerala High Court seeking to quash the notification inviting applications only from the Malayala Brahmin priests, a few others have approached the board seeking to continue the practice. “As the demand for continuing the practice and modifying it has come up, the board will discuss the issue. Changes in temple practices can be introduced only after holding discussions with all the stakeholders concerned. The board is yet to decide on whom to be invited for discussion and when to hold it,” said N. Vasu, president of the TDB, on Tuesday. Regarding the ongoing litigation before the High Court, Mr. Vasu said the board would seek to maintain the status quo regarding the priesthood. However, the board was bound to implement the court decisions, he said. The court is likely to consider the case on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the board rejected the applications of six non-Brahmin priests who had applied for the posts of Melsanthis in Sabarimala and Malikappuram as they failed to meet the caste criterion. “My application was rejected as I did not belong to the Malayala Brahmin caste. Earlier as well, my application was rejected on the same ground, though I am amply qualified to be appointed as the Melsanthi,” said C. V. Vishnunarayanan, one of the priests who had moved the High Court. The Akhila Kerala Thantri Mandalam, a collective of Brahmin chief priests, suggested continuing the temple practice regarding priesthood. Priests from other Hindu castes have been serving in Bhadrakali temples at Vellayini, Mulankadakam and Kodungalloor. It is also the case with the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, Thiruvananthapuram. Centuries-old temple practices cannot be changed in one stroke, said Mandalam general secretary S. Radhakrishnan Potti. Consultations Any change in temple practices shall be introduced only after consultations with stakeholders, including the representatives of priests, vedic experts, judges, Devaswom boards, and the Hindu community organisations, he said.

A senior official from the revenue wing of the Corporation said that the auction was stopped a few minutes after the commencement of the process in MADITSSIA hall. According to a Government Order, categories which are leased to private people should go through the auction process once in every three years.

The participants indicated interest in only 47 out of the 63 categories. A total of 163 people had shown interest to participate in the auction process for the 47 categories. The official said that the auction process was postponed as there was a report from the police that the auction would cause a probable law and order problem. ‘A problem emerged during the auction process that was conducted by the Corporation three years back. So, it was decided to postpone this year’s auction process,” said the official. The auction process has to be postponed to a particular date after consulting the police.

28 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Corporation pulled up for putting up shops on playground||Taking a serious view of the fact that temporary shops had been put up on a playground that belonged to a school in Thoothukudi, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that this was a ridiculous move by the Thoothukudi district administration. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi wondered how the playground could be used to put up the temporary shops and observed that time and again the court had deprecated such a practice. The court was hearing a petition filed by the Anna Perunthu Nilaya Vattara Viyabarigal Nala Sangam of Thoothukudi. The members of the sangam were the vendors who were carrying out business in the old bus stand. Since development works were going on at the old bus stand as part of Smart City project, the vendors were moved to an open ground which belonged to a school. They complained that they could not make ends meet and were unhappy with the temporary arrangement. Under these circumstances, the Thoothukudi Corporation had demanded rent from them, they said. They sought a direction to restrain the Corporation from demanding rent as they were put up in a temporary place. The court directed the Thoothukudi Corporation to look into the plea of the vendors and take necessary action. The court said the Corporation could grant concessions to the vendors and disposed of the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-pulled-up-for-putting-up-shops-on-playground/article35574900.ece
28 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco must take steps for a turnaround, says HC||Taking cognisance of a report released by the Ministry of Power that showed Tamilnadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) was ranked 39 among 41 power companies or boards that were rated, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that this was a wake-up call to the Corporation. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that unless some effective steps were taken to achieve a financial turnaround, reduce the power purchase cost and bring down the dependency on government subsidy, it was only going to move from bad to worse.

It entered into a lease agreement with (Tangedco) for establishing an electrical substation.

Since the lines would cut across the company property, deviation of the line was sought. The petitioner company was asked to pay the defrayment cost for deviation in approved line otherwise the lines would be laid as per the approved route. The petitioner company filed the petition challenging this communication. The court said the matter involved an area of expertise and it was completely ill-equipped to deal with the same. The court directed the petitioner to make a representation to the Ministry concerned and find a solution to the issue.

28 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||TTDC eyes more drive-in dining facilities||With the hospitality industry struggling to revive its fortunes in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) is planning a makeover to woo back customers. Following the launch of a drive-in restaurant and open air theatre at its property in Madurai in October last, the TTDC is looking at a similar facility on its Island Grounds premises in Chennai. “It [Island Grounds] already has a restaurant called ‘Drive-in’ but it lacks facilities that go with it. The pandemic, lockdowns and anxiety among people have rendered it almost dysfunctional now. We will be upgrading it to a state-of-the-art facility,” TTDC Managing Director Sandeep Nanduri told The Hindu . “Modifications under the new [COVID-appropriate] norms will be undertaken in a phased manner,” he said. This includes upgrading the rooms and putting rigid cleaning, disinfection and infection prevention policies in place. Out of its 53 properties in Tamil Nadu, 10 are categorised ‘premier’ given their advantage of prime location and large open spaces, where outdoor dining will now be prioritised. The business in the initial five months was good in Madurai after the launch of the drive-in, but subsequently lost momentum in the aftermath of the second wave of COVID-19. “We have now drawn up a master plan to refurbish it further,” Mr. Nanduri said. Currently, the place is crying for patronage even though the outdoor six-acre space has been used creatively with the installation of a large screen where sports and music programmes, awards and reality shows are beamed. Besides, slots are earmarked for vehicles to park so that guests can enjoy food sitting in the safety and comfort of their car as special steel trays customised with hooks fit into the inside of car doors in the evenings. Those wanting to enjoy the evening under the open sky have the option of taking a table in the well-lit ground. The tables are distanced appropriately and a new open air kitchen gives the guest a view of what is cooking. Earlier, 15 to 20 cars lined up daily but now the footfall has declined to two-three families during weekends, said M. Guneshwaran, the hotel’s senior manager. On week nights, the place awaits its customers. Mr. Nanduri said plans are afoot to further beautify the space with landscaping, introducing children’s play area and constructing a stage for events besides an additional open kitchen to make the menu more expansive. “We are adapting to the times and the changes will continue as a work-in-progress. Once it is fully complete, up to 50 cars will be able to park easily,” said Mr.Guneshwaran. “We want people to take a break from the arduous indoor life and spend safe evening hours in a place free from congestion and embraced in green,” he added.

Right to raise issue The Opposition was well within their rights to raise the snooping issue in the Parliament. The Prime Minister was not bothered about the disruption in the Parliament. The onus is now on the government to order a JPC probe and ensure smooth functioning of both the houses, Mr. Narayanasamy added. “Snooping is against democratic principles and by doing so the rights of the people have been infringed.

28 July 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers disappointed over dropping of channel work||Work on the Rs. 41.08 crore Ramanadhi – Jambunadhi elevated channel, which was started on August 8, 2020 with the objective of completing it by August 2022, has been abandoned after just 1% of the work inside the forest was completed. This shocking information has been obtained by farmer T. Mariappan of Vaithilingapuram near Aavudaiyaanoor under Right to Information Act. Consequently, farmers of 11 village panchayats in this region have decided to boycott the upcoming local body polls. The Jambunadhi feeds 4,050 acres of land in 11 village panchayats including Kalloorani, Sivanaadaanoor, Thippanampatti, Ariyappapuram, Aavudaiyaanoor, Peththanaadarpatti, Poolaankulam, Venkataampatti, South Madaththur, Keezha Kadayam and Theerthaarappapuram through 21 ponds. Moreover, the river water, on getting stored in these ponds during the rainy season, improves groundwater table in more than 100 villages. Unfortunately, the Jambunadhi does not get water like Ramanadhi throughout the year as the latter is blessed with water flow during southwest and northeast monsoons. So, the then Chief Minister K. Kamaraj planned to take the Ramanadhi Dam’s surplus water through an elevated channel to the Jambunadhi to nourish the 4,050 acres of land. After he stepped down from the Chief Minister’s post, nothing happened to execute this project. After being in cold storage for several decades, the project got revived by the previous AIADMK regime towards the fag end of its tenure. As per the plan, the channel would be dug for 3,215 metres and the elevated channel would be constructed for about 700 metres with 2.30 metre-width and at 1.20 metre height at a total estimated cost of Rs. 41.08 crore. Even as the work was started inside the reserve forest area, the Deputy Director of Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve’s Ambasamudram Division stopped the work, saying that the work could be continued only after getting due permission from the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Chennai. Consequently, the work that was stopped on October 31, 2020 was not resumed. “This is very much disappointing and frustrating… After the project conceived by a great leader was shelved for several decades, it was revived very recently. But, it has been aborted following communication gap between two government departments,” says Mr. Mariappan, who submitted the questions under RTI and received reply from the Assistant Engineer, Tirunelveli Special Division Scheme. Sources in the KMTR’s Ambasamudram Division said the contractor identified for this project used explosives to blast the rocks while digging the channel instead of using earth-movers and the work was stopped. The officials concerned were instructed to get permission from the appropriate authorities of Department of Forest. “The application for resuming this work is pending with Forest Department since February 23, 2021,” the sources said. Mr. Mariappan said only 1% of the work, which was 50 year-old demand, had been completed and there was no sign of resuming the work to complete it before the deadline of August 2022. “No land has been acquired and no land owner has received any compensation. But, the government says that the work would be completed by August 2022. The officials believe that the farmers could be pacified with some reply. But this will not be the case this time. If a positive step is not taken, the farmers of this region will boycott the upcoming civic poll,” warned Mr. Mariappan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-upset-over-dropping-of-channel-work/article35574899.ece

In a memorandum submitted to the district administration, the CPI committee pointed out that kuruvai cultivation had been taken up in a considerable extent of ayacuts irrigated by the canal and vaikkal in Thanjavur district. Non-release of water from the lake into the two irrigation channels despite the water level in the lake reaching its full capacity had caused concern among Budalur taluk farmers, who took up kuruvai cultivation in the area inspired by the kuruvai package and release of water for irrigation from Mettur on the scheduled date of June 12, the party said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-release-water-from-vazhavanthankottai-lake/article35574670.ece

28 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation plans to establish amusement park||Tiruchi Corporation has plans to establish an amusement park in the city. Although the city has added more than 100 parks, most of them are small in size and mainly cater to morning and evening walkers and children. Moreover, it is alleged that most of the children's parks remain closed due to absence of a standard mechanism to carry out repairs and maintenance. Several residents hang out on pavements of the Cauvery bridge between Mela Chinthamani and Mambazhasalai to catch up with their friends and families in the evening. ‘Summer beach’ A few years ago, Tiruchi Corporation opened temporary hangouts called ‘summer beach’ on the dry river bed of the Cauvery during the non-Mettur season between March and May. It was an instant hit among the people of the city, who visited the place in droves in the evening. But the civic body dropped the idea after a few years, apparently due to safety issues. However, the massive support did highlight the need for establishing a solid infrastructure to fulfil the need of entertainment seekers. Taking into account various aspects, the Corporation has mooted the idea of establishing an amusement park in the city. “Consultations are on to formulate a plan to establish an amusement park. The idea is to create all types of infrastructure for entertainment seekers under one roof,” a senior official of the Corporation told The Hindu . He said that a number of infrastructure projects were on the pipeline including an integrated bus stand at Panchapur on the outskirts of the city. Setting up an amusement park was among the projects. The idea was to create infrastructure such as batting cages, go-karts, bumper boats, roller coasters and water slides. The official said the process of identifying land for the amusement park was on. Once it was finalised, the Corporation would take steps to engage a consultant to prepare a detailed project report. The Corporation had toyed with the idea of establishing amusement/theme park in the city some years ago but the project failed to take off.

28 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Neglect of public fountains draws residents’ ire||Neglect of illuminated public fountains, which were established with much fanfare in the city as part of the beautification drive, has drawn ire from the residents. Since Tiruchi, situated on the banks of the Cauvery River, is blessed with good water sources, the Tiruchi City Corporation decided to erect many illuminated fountains, as in Bengaluru and Mysuru, in the city when N. Ravichandran was the Commissioner. A New Delhi-based consultant was roped in to study the infrastructure for preparing suitable design and model for the beautification drive. It identified 16 locations, mostly traffic roundabouts and inter junctions in the city, to erect colorful illuminated water fountains. In the first phase, the civic body installed fountains at Central Bus Stand, Williams Road traffic signal, Bharathidasan Road roundabout, Thiruvanaikoil Checkpost and Chathiram Bus Stand. They were erected one after another within a span of about a year in 2018-19. The civic body spent about Rs. 1.47 crore using funds sanctioned under the Smart City Mission. In addition, it planned to erect 10 more water fountains at various roundabout and traffic signals. The fountains, which were operated in the evenings, added beauty to the city. But, residents now complain that except one or two, the fountains have been hardly put to use. With the fountains remainingd unused for month, the pipes with numerous holes to circulate and re-circulate water with the sets of sequences have become rusty, they say. “The purpose of erection of fountains is defeated. They should be put to proper use immediately,” said N. Jamaludeen of Thennur, a civic activist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/neglect-of-public-fountains-draws-residents-ire-in-tiruchi-city/article35574656.ece
28 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||CPI(M) cadre demand removal of ‘untouchability wall’ in Tiruchi||A section of cadre of the Communist Party of India-Marxist staged a novel agitation by placing an empty coffin in front of the Tiruchi Corporation Office at Mela Kalkandarkottai on Tuesday urging seeking demolition of an alleged “untouchability wall” constructed at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar where several members of Scheduled Caste community reside. The demonstrators also opposed the creation of a cemetery very close to the residential area in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar that comes under ward 30. The party claimed that a nearly nine feet high wall to a length of around 150 metres was constructed by an individual behind Rajiv Gandhi Nagar to sell vacant fertile lands converted into several plots. “The ‘untouchability wall’ had been constructed by blocking five streets in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar and two streets in Indira Nagar. This had blocked public passage leading to a one-way route for the residents to enter and exit causing hardship to them,” said N. Karthikeyan, secretary of CPI-M Ponmalai unit which organised the agitation. The demonstrators placed an empty coffin and garlanded it besides paying floral tributes before burying it. Mr. Karthikeyan said public passage should be allowed at least for two streets in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar instead of blocking the five streets. A petition was submitted to the district administration recently in support of these demands. Since there was no action, the stir was organised, he said. When contacted the District Collector S. Sivarasu toldThe Hinduthat he had asked the Corporation Commissioner to do a spot verification and submit a report on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-untouchability-wall-in-tiruchi/article35574600.ece

28 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||SIPCOT starts activities in Industrial Park||The Small Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd (SIPCOT ) has started work on construction of roads and providing other amenities at its industrial park in Manapparai. To begin with, a thrust is likely to be accorded for food processing industries in the industrial park on an overall expanse of 1,077 acres. Sixty-five food processing industries involved in the making of biscuits, export-quality rice, ghee, drumstick products, and onion processing have applied to the SIPCOT for establishing their manufacturing units in the specially-earmarked 275-acre portion in the park. Since manufacturing activities in fabrication units have slowed down, early facilitation for establishment of food processing industries will give a fillip to local economy, N. Kanagasabapathy, Chairman of Tiruchi Trade Centre said. Out of 436.05 hectares, the plot area constitute 328.59 hectares. The rest of the land area is to be utilised for construction of roads and storm water drainage; common amenities like power, water storage fire services and administrative office; commercial activities; green belt outside plot area and along roadside, and solid waste development. The industrial park will encompass all general engineering units such as fabrication, machining, forging and castings; auto components; packaging units; and paper conversion units as well apart from the food industries. The small industries sector has much to look for in the industrial park as 20% of the plot area will be provided for the small and medium units, in consonance with the MSME policy 2021. The policy envisages attracting new investments worth Rs. 2 lakh crores by 2025 and creating additional employment opportunities for 20 lakh people. New MSMEs and start-ups will be exempted from approvals for establishment and operation for a period of three years based on self-certification, as per the policy. The government has acknowledged that MSMEs face pressure and constraints in sustaining competitiveness in a globalised world against the backdrop of greater competition, rapid technological advances,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sipcot-starts-activities-at-industrial-park/article35574662.ece

28 July 2021||TIRUPATTUR,TAMIL NADU||All out efforts to vaccinate residents in Jawadhu Hills||Village Health Nurses (VHN) T. Chennammal and C. Janaki and their young colleague A. Sasi Rekha were never far away from their home, Jawadhu Hills. They travel together to the two local Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) in the hillock where they have been working for a decade. They check pregnant women in their thatched houses; administer polio drops to the children in the hamlets and screen elders for their age-related illnesses. They are household names in the hills. Their routine has hardly changed, even during the pandemic. From Monday, they have been visiting houses in these remote villages by foot with a common purpose of vaccinating all residents aged 18 years and above against COVID-19. On an average, 200 residents in these tribal hamlets are being vaccinated every day for the first time. “We belong to the same tribal (Mayalali) community of residents in the hillock. It bonds us. It also makes them (residents) trust us," says 52-year-old T. Chennammal, the oldest among the three VHNs in the hills. Nurse Chennammal belongs to Nellivasal Nadu, one of the 32 villages in the hills that comes under Tirupattur district, around 30 km from the hillock. Her colleagues — Janaki and Sasi Rekha — are not far away from her village as they reside in the neighbouring Pudhur Nadu and Kombai villages. Along with a health team led by two doctors, R. Ramesh and V. Venketaraman, the nurses walk miles on the rugged terrain, as vehicles find it difficult to negotiate narrow bends and uneven pathways in the villages on the hillock. They administer vaccines for plantation workers, traders, village elders and farmers in the hillock covering at least two villages every day. Of the total population of 32,000 residents, district health officials said that around 15,000 residents are eligible for vaccination. "By the end of this month, we will vaccinate around 2,000 residents in at least nine villages in the hillock. We will cover more hamlets in the coming weeks," says T.R. Senthil, Deputy Director (Health), Tirupattur. It was on last Saturday at the joint meeting organised by the Tirupattur district administration with health officials that sub collector P. Alarmelmangai gave detailed guidelines to intensify the vaccination drive on the Jawadhu Hills to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Subsequently, separate health teams were formed to create awareness on the drive among the tribal communities. The district administration also roped 54 ASHA workers, who have been working in these villages, for the vaccination drive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-out-efforts-to-vaccinate-residents-in-jawadhu-hills/article35575022.ece
28 July 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Artworks of Villupuram artisans to find place on global market platforms||From terracotta toys and figurines in Koliyanur to woodwork and home decor in Mugaiyur, the artistic riches of rural artisans in Villupuram district will soon be showcased on global market platforms, including Amazon and Flipkart. The district administration is in the process of identifying an exclusive brand name to sell the products from Villupuram under a single umbrella. The move is aimed at enhancing visibility of these unique local products and taking them to a global audience. Collector D. Mohan said, “several blocks in the district have a rich culture of handicrafts, made by rural artisans, that are hugely popular. But they have been struggling to get their products to the marketplace. The products will be brought under one brand name while ensuring a fair price for every artisan.” The products range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 5,000. The Koliyanur block alone has over 40 families engaged in making terracotta products. The families will be brought under a single federation and the Department of Rural Development will help them with storage space and raw materials. Koliyanur will be an example for all other blocks with unique products. The administration has started cataloguing the products with descriptions, rates, geographical location, and details of the artisans. The initiative will help artisans get at least 30% higher price for their products, he said. “The products have been photographed and a coffee-table book with product details is being readied. It will be distributed to Ministers and dignitaries visiting the district,” Mr. Mohan said. The Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women has already tied up with Amazon. The product catalogue will be uploaded on the platform. The initiative will support the rural economy, said an official of the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA). The administration is exploring the possibility of a tie-up with Flipkart and the Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) to support the rural artisans and turn the district into an export hub. “DEF will help the artisans with the basics of marketing, providing local businesses an opportunity to leverage global market places.” “A common myth is that Villupuram district remains most backward. This should change and the initiative will accelerate growth under a separate brand name,” Mr. Mohan added.  The administration has started cataloguing the products. The initiative will help artisans get at least 30% higher price for their products||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/artworks-of-villupuram-artisans-to-find-place-on-global-market-platforms/article35574595.ece
28 July 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Special toilets for physically challenged in Virudhunagar||R. Mareeswari (40) had a joyful childhood like any other children of her age. But, fate played a cruel role and both her legs got crippled from hip after she was infected with polio at the age of three years. Since, then she had been crawling on the ground, floor and road. The district administration had helped her with a three-wheeled cycle for easier commuting. But, for long time, she had to be on all her fours even while going out into the wild for relieving herself near her residential area in Palavanatham. Her father’s attempt to construct a toilet for the house, some 10 years back too was of not much help to her. “I had to use my hands even inside the small toilet,” she said. However, realising the plight of people like Mareeswari, Virudhunagar Collector J. Meghanath Reddy has come up with a model individual toilet that suits their special requirements. District Rural Development Agency has set up a spacious toilet with western commode, ramp with railings and health faucet that would give big relief for Mareeswari. Since, the Rs. 12,000 subsidy given under Government scheme will not be sufficient to provide additional facilities for the differently abled, the DRDA approached corporate offices. “We have set up the first toilet, as part of Collector’s innovative programme, at a cost of Rs. 40,000 with corporate social responsibility funds,” said Project Director (DRDA), P. Thilagavathi. The Collector got a list of five differently abled women, who had difficulties in walking with both their legs crippled. “We have selected the most deserving for the pilot project of 25 toilets,” she said. While the normal toilets constructed under Government scheme is only four by three feet, the model toilet has come up on 2 metres by 2 metres. It is more spacious as the idea is allow the differently abled persons to move into the toilet on their three-wheeled cycle/wheel chair and turn it without much difficulty. The administration has provided ramp. Besides providing a disabled-friendly western commode, railings have been set up for them to easily get down from the cycle/wheel-chair. A health faucet too has been provided to help them overcome the difficulties in using mugs. The Collector said that five such toilets are under construction. Expressing happiness over the new toilet that is clean and dry toilet, Ms. Mareeswari said that that if the height of the commode was brought down a little, it will help her to climb over it easier. “The officials have sought my feedback and promised to set it right,” she said. Ms. Thilagavathi said that the officials have been instructed to make further fine-tuning of the facility to best suit the needs of the differently abled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/special-toilets-for-physically-challenged-in-virudhunagar/article35574696.ece

Over 1.35 lakh students have migrated from private schools to government and government-aided schools this year, largely due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Besides, another 68,500-odd students moved from aided schools to government institutions. In the wake of this development, Mr. Poyyamozhi said the School Education Department was considering how the authorities could equip schools better to handle the increase in strength. “District-level education officials have been asked to ascertain the needs of schools, and we are looking at the possibility of increasing teacher strength too,” he said. Speaking at the Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School at Mogappair after inaugurating a campus greening initiative, the Minister encouraged organisations to come forward and join hands with the Department in working with government schools. “There are a lot of areas where organisations can work with government schools, and we want more companies to come forward,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-looking-at-reopening-schools-for-senior-classes/article35574679.ece

28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bommai’s selection shows BSY still holds sway||The choice and the optics of the selection process of the new Chief Minister of Karnataka, Basavaraj Bommai, has only shown the continued relevance of B.S. Yediyurappa and the Veerashaiva-Lingayat vote bank he commands for the Bharatiya Janata Party. Some have even expressed fear that he might end up as the “shadow Chief Minister” because of this. Besides, the three Deputy Chief Ministers are also likely to be key confidantes of Mr. Yediyurappa, making his stamp on the new government more emphatic. Mr. Bommai has been identified as a key confidante of Mr. Yediyurappa from his first day in the saffron party. Though he did not quit the party and join the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) in 2012, he returned to the side of Mr. Yediyurappa once the veteran leader rejoined the party in 2014 and was known as his “man Friday” in the Cabinet that the veteran leader led till Monday. The mobilisation of Lingayat support for Mr. Yediyurappa over the past one week forced the hand of the party high command to choose a Lingayat leader to replace him and placate him, party sources said. “The party could not risk antagonising the support of the Lingayat community and afford to be seen ill-treating its tall leader, as the community’s support is key to the BJP’s prospects in the State. The party had to placate Mr. Yediyurappa, and from among his confidantes the party chose a candidate with the most administrative experience,” a senior party leader said. The BJP sees Mr. Yediyurappa as being relevant in the 2023 Assembly and 2024 parliamentary polls, sources added. The dissidents may have been successful in forcing Mr. Yediyurappa to quit as Chief Minister, but it seems they have not been able to make him “irrelevant”. Deference to BSY Through the process of selection, central observers and party leaders displayed complete deference to Mr. Yediyurappa. The party leaders briefed him of the choice on Tuesday evening, minutes after which Mr. Bommai dashed to his house and sought his blessings. An emotional Mr. Bommai even touched the feet of Mr. Yediyurappa. Central observers and BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel acknowledged Mr. Yediyurappa’s contributions to the party, with the latter asserting, “Yediyurappa is a tall leader of the party. He will continue to guide both the party and the government.” Mr. Yediyurappa, rejecting reports of retirement or a gubernatorial post, has maintained that he would continue to be active in politics and work for the party. Mr. Bommai said about Mr. Yediyurappa, “He is my political guru. I am blessed that he proposed my name. He will continue to guide us.” Mr. Yediyurappa was seen beaming through the process of selection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bommais-selection-shows-bsy-still-holds-sway/article35574543.ece
28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No decline in city’s crime in second year of pandemic||Contrary to expectations that the pandemic and frequent lockdowns that forced people to stay at homes may have reduced crimes, drug-related offences, various forms of thefts, and vehicle lifting topped the city’s crime list in the first half of this year till July 21. Statistics from the city crime record bureau show that apart from cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act – the highest number of cases so far – as many as 2,098 vehicle theft cases were reported in and around the city, but the police managed to detect only 346 cases. This is because the stolen vehicles are taken out of the city within an hour and sold to people after tampering the chassis numbers. The accused also dismantle old vehicles and sell them to junkyards, making it is difficult to track stolen vehicles, the police said. Similarly, as many as 777 housebreaks were reported, while the police managed to detect (solve) only 251. As many as 1,146 cases of cheating were reported, of which only 372 were solved. Crimes against women While handling crime against women, the city police has not been up to the mark. Of 304 cases of sexual harassment, the police detected 189 cases. However, out of 59 rape cases registered this year, the police cracked 53 cases. A total of 207 cases of assault on women and dowry harassment and domestic violence cases were reported, of which 178 cases were solved. As many as 185 POCSO cases were also reported till July. While recovery and detection rates reflect the efficiency of the police and their performances are rated accordingly, many police officials opined that their main focus has shifted to enforcing COVID-19 related guidelinessince last year. Admitting that law and order and crime detections has taken a backseat, a senior police officer attributed this to change in priority during the lockdown period. “The presence of police in the form of patrolling and basic policing with local criminal intelligence systems are best to contain crime and maintain law and order. Due to many factors, in the last few months, this has been affected and we are reviving the system,” another police officer added. High detection rates The police seem to have fared well in handling other cases. According to the statistics, 82 murders were reported in seven months, of which the police detected 80 of them. Again, out of 22 dacoity cases, 21 were solved, while out of 87 chain-snatching cases reported, the police cracked 64 cases. There were 2,481 cases registered under NDPS, of which the police detected 1,893. In a recent crime review meeting, city Police Commissioner Kamal Pant directed the Hoysala patrolling police to step up vigil and directed the jurisdictional police officers not to use patrolling vehicles for other purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-decline-in-citys-crime-in-second-year-of-pandemic/article35574529.ece
28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Can Yediyurappa’s exit help the Congress, despite choice of Bommai as new CM?||The unceremonious exit of B.S. Yediyurappa from the Chief Minister’s post has come as an opportunity for the Congress, with the party dubbing the turn of events an “insult’ to the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community. The politically powerful community had moved away from the Congress towards BJP, and the Congress is making a determined bid to woo it back ahead of the 2023 Assembly elections. Some of the State’s Congress leaders, who had been attacking Mr. Yediyurappa as “corrupt” and slamming the BJP government for its mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, have now started attacking the BJP high command for constantly “troubling the veteran leader” and forcing him to shed tears while announcing his resignation. The party has demanded that he reveal who caused him to break down so publicly. Even though his successor — Basavaraj Bommai — is another Lingayat leader, the Congress believes that “insult” meted out to Mr. Yediyurappa will not be forgotten too soon. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chief D.K. Shivakumar and senior party leaders Shamanur Shivashankarappa and M.B. Patil, both Lingayat leaders, have pointed out that Mr. Yediyurappa was sidelined and ignored by the BJP’s central leaders from day one. Mr. Shivashankarappa, who heads the influential All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, and Mr. Patil have openly said Mr. Yediyurappa’s removal from the post of Chief Minister would not go down well with the community. Mr. Shivakumar has demanded an explanation from the saffron party’s national leaders as to why the Chief Minister was asked to quit on the government’s second anniversary and when the State was still grappling with multiple crises such as floods and the pandemic. BSY’s vote bank The caste factor plays a significant role in Karnataka politics, and Congress leaders believe Mr. Yediyurappa, a charismatic mass leader, has a personal vote bank of 7% to 8% across the State. They think the voters who identify with the former Chief Minister could help the Congress to regain its hold in North Karnataka. In the 2018 Assembly elections, the BJP won 104 seats though it secured 1.79% fewer votes than the Congress (38.14%), which secured 80 seats. Various sub-sects of the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community have sway over nearly 100 constituencies. The Congress fielded 47 candidates from the community, but and only 16 won in 2018 as opposed to the BJP’s 35 MLAs. Traditionally, the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community had backed the Congress, which also enjoys the support of the minorities, Dalits, and OBCs. Since the reorganisation of the State in 1956, four Congress Chief Ministers belonged to the community, with the last one being Veerendra Patil, whose ouster by Rajiv Gandhi alienated the community to some extent. P.S. Jayaramu, retired professor of political science, Bangalore University, said the Congress can regain its hold over the Lingayat community only by ending groupism and factionalism in the party. Instead of projecting the party’s next Chief Minister candidate, both Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar should work together and focus on issue-based politics, he said. Muzaffar Assadi, professor of political science, University of Mysuru, said anti-incumbency, negative vote, and alleged corruption, particularly during the handling of COVID-19, could work in favour of the Congress in the coming elections. The immediate test for the BJP’s new Chief Minister and the Congress would be winning the bypolls to Hanagal and Sidhangi Assembly constituencies, which would be held in the next few months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/can-yediyurappas-exit-help-the-congress-despite-choice-of-bommai-as-new-cm/article35574550.ece
28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Access control charges at KSR railway station from Aug. 1||Get ready to pay for pick up and drop at the Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna (KSR) railway station from next month. The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd.

And for two-wheelers, Rs. 15 will be charged for every subsequent five minutes. Divisional Railway Manager Ashok Kumar Verma said that access control is being implemented to streamline traffic flow, make the station more pedestrian friendly, and reduce congestion. Aneesh Hegde, chief PRO of SWR, said: “The KSR railway station is maintained by IRSDC, and SWR looks after operations of the trains. These access control charges, similar to what is charged at the airport, were introduced in 2019. After the outbreak of pandemic, it was temporarily stopped as the railways suspended train services across the country and stations had low seen reduced footfall. The charges are being re-introduced after a gap of almost one-and-a-half years. It will help managing traffic at the entry point.

The court also made it clear that the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) should not continue the work till the committee, empowered to grant No Objection Certificate for construction in aerodrome area, considers a fresh the application of the BMRCL to carry out works on the elevated metro lane after the government adopts appropriate mitigation A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the order while disposing of a PIL petition filed Ajoy Kumar Patil, a city-based advocate. The work on the metro project on the western periphery of the aerodrome was stayed by the High Court in September 2020 after the petitioner alleged that the elevated structures come under restricted zone affecting flight operations. Later, an Obstacle Limitation Surfaces survey conducted by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in April revealed that the proposed metro rail will be an obstacle to the approach funnel of the runway of the aerodrome. The DGCA, appraised of the obstacles, suggested to the State government to either reduce the height of the obstacles surfaces within the permissible limit as per Ministry of Civil Aviation (Height Restriction for Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations) Rules, 2015, or to adopt mitigation measures as suggested/recommended by the AAI by reducing the length of the runway. The DGCA, in its letter dated May 20, 2021, had also told the State government to intimate it if the latter wanted the obstacles to be considered as per the provisions of the Aircraft (Demolition of obstructions caused by buildings and trees, etc) Rules, 1994. Following the DGCA’s communication, the State government had decided to adopt the mitigation suggested by the AAI to reduce the length of the runway by issuing direction to the director of the GFTS while claiming that it wants both infrastructure projects and general aviation activities at the flying school to ‘co-exist’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/adopt-measures-to-ensure-metro-lane-does-not-affect-aerodrome/article35574531.ece

Yediyurappa is learnt to have had a relaxed time with his family members after returning from Raj Bhavan. He went out for dinner with about 25 family members, where he spoke very little of politics or what went into his decision, according to Aruna Devi, one of his three daughters. The 78-year-old leader’s decision had surprised most of his family members and close associates because of its suddenness, she said. However, she added that he later spent a relaxed next day hosting dignitaries who came to meet him. “He told us that he was happy with the decision he took. In between, he was also speaking to national leaders who called him,” she said. Sources also said that many in the family enquired with him about the political career of his youngest son B.Y. Vijayendra, who is also BJP State vice-president and was believed to be gunning for a suitable post. The BJP leader is learnt to have not shown interest in speaking about politics with them. Ms. Aruna Devi, who is the women’s wing president of All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, also categorically spiked rumours of a family rift between the two brothers over their political future. “The family stands united and there is no difference of opinion.

28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Without a head, can SIT continue probe, asks HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday said it would examine the legality of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), in the absence of a head, continuing to probe cases registered in connection with the CD scandal involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. Additional Commissioner of Police Soumendu Mukherjee (Bengaluru-West), who was appointed as head of the SIT, has been on leave since May 1. Under the circumstances, the court said it was necessary to examine whether a probe in his absence had sanctity in law. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda passed the order while hearing PIL petitions on the CD scandal and petitions filed by the victim. The Bench directed both the State government and the SIT to respond to the query on whether the SIT could continue the investigation. The SIT was set up on March 11. The court was earlier informed that Mr. Mukherjee has been on medical leave since May 1. Not completed As the SIT made it clear to the court that its investigation in connection with the FIR, registered based on the victim’s complaint, was yet to be completed, the Bench directed it not to file the final report in the jurisdictional court without prior permission of the HC. Also, the Bench said it would consider the issue of legality of constitution of the SIT to probe the scandal, based on contentions raised by the petitioners and the victim that the SIT was set up on Mr. Jarkiholi’s request and that the Home Minister had no power to instruct the Commissioner of Police to set up an SIT. Senior advocate C.V. Nagesh, appearing for Mr. Jarkiholi, pointed out that Mr. Jarkiholi had submitted a petition to the Home Minister on March 10 to conduct an inquiry as “false” allegations were made against him. None of the FIRs, registered based on either the complaint filed by the victim or by the former Minister, existed when the SIT was constituted. When senior advocate Indira Jaisingh, representing the victim, pointed out that a news report was published on the Internet edition of an English daily stating ‘SIT finds no evidence to prosecute Ramesh Jarkiholi’, the Bench directed her to submit details of the report. Further hearing was adjourned till August 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/without-a-head-can-sit-continue-probe-asks-karnataka-high-court/article35574538.ece

28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lingayats partly placated by choice of Bommai||Though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is under the scanner for replacing its ageing Lingayat strongman B.S. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister, the elevation of Basavaraj Bommai, who was Home Minister in the outgoing Cabinet, to the post is seen as a move to placate the Lingayat voter base, which is the saffron party’s strength in North Karnataka. Mr. Bommai belongs to the powerful Sadar subsect among Lingayats and could keep the Lingayat vote base intact. H.M. Renuka Prasanna, secretary of All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, welcomed the BJP’s decision. “Though the community is still hurt with the resignation of Mr. Yediyurappa, it is expected to accept Mr. Bommai as a consensus candidate. This is an appropriate and good selection,” he said. Mr. Bommai is expected to gain acceptance because the community, in the second half of the 1980s, had seen his father, the late S.R. Bommai, lose the post of Chief Minister in an unceremonious way when his government was dismissed. The S.R. Bommai case, in which the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the late leader, is cited as an important case study in Centre-State relations. Also, in Lingayat vote bankpolitics, the Sadar sect plays a crucial role in winning seats for the BJP in central Karnataka and a part of the Bombay Karnataka region. Of the 41 Lingayat-Veerashaiva legislators in the BJP, 10 belong to the subsect. Sirigere Mutt, one of the most powerful Lingayat mutts in Karnataka, belongs to the Sadar subsect. The mutt is seen as being very active in mobilising support for a political cause, and a number of small mutts that have local influence follow the subtle political messages conveyed by Sirigere Mutt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lingayats-partly-placated-by-choice-of-bommai/article35574547.ece
28 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Plaints pour in against school managements||Like the previous academic year, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) has been flooded with complaints from parents about school managements blocking online classes of those who have not paid fees for the current year. The commission received complaints against 20 managements over the past two weeks. One of the parents said: “The school management has said that we should pay one quarter of the fees at the beginning of the academic year, and only then our child will be allowed to attend online classes. We want schools to allow us to pay monthly fees as our income has reduced during the second lockdown.” Fr. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of the commission, said they had directed officials of the Department of Public Instruction to attend to all the cases and submit a report to the commission. “After the intervention of the commission, department officials held talks with the managements and assured us that schools have agreed to unblock online classes,” he said. The Karnataka State Legal Services Authority too received request from a parentseeking legal aid. However, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said it was difficult for schools to sustain online classes if parents do not pay fees. “If parents are unable to pay, we will direct them to the nearest government school,” he said. The Department of Public Instruction has not announced any decision pertaining to the school fees that needs to be paid this academic year. V. Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said as the case pertaining to fees was in court, they were waiting for its orders. “We have proposed that a retired High Court judge could head a committee and recommend how we could charge fees this year,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plaints-pour-in-against-school-managements/article35574533.ece

28 July 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Alternative one-way routes suggested||The Hassan district administration has issued an order suggesting alternative one-way routes for people commuting between Bengaluru and Mangaluru by light motor vehicles, as the Shiradi Ghat stretch of NH 75 has been closed for vehicles. A portion of the NH75 had caved in during the rains, forcing the administration to stop vehicles. The DC in the order issued on Monday, suggested three alternative routes for cars, jeeps, tempos, minivans, two-wheelers, ambulances and ordinary buses. Those travelling to Mangaluru from Bengaluru should take a deviation at Anemahal to reach their destination via Kesaganahalli – Kyanahalli and Heggade. Those travelling to Bengaluru from Mangaluru can take Maranahalli – Kyamanahalli – Harle Kudige – Anemahal route. The people travelling towards Bengaluru have one more option: Dodda Thappale – Kumbaradi – Harle Kudige – Anemahal. The administration has restricted the speed limit at 30 kmph along these one-way routes. The DC directed the SP to depute police staff at points where travellers have to take deviations. The officers of National Highways have been directed to put up signboards for the convenience of the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/alternative-one-way-routes-suggested/article35574938.ece

28 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Court permits Vinay Kulkarni to visit Dharwad||The former Minister and Congress leader Vinay Kulkarni, who is behind bars in connection with the murder of zilla panchayat member Yogeeshgouda Goudar, visited Dharwad after almost nine months on Tuesday to complete a legal formality. The former Minister, whose bail plea has been rejected, came to Dharwad on Tuesday to sign a General Power of Attorney (GPA) in favour of his wife Shivaleela Kulkarni authorising her to make property transactions on his behalf. Vinay Kulkarni’s counsel had approached court seeking permission to visit Dharwad to complete the formalities pertaining to the GPA before the Sub Registrar and it was granted by the court. Giving permission for the visit, the court had directed the police that none of his supporters should be allowed to meet him during his visit to Dharwad. Accordingly, the police brought him under tight security to the Mini Vidhana Soudha in Dharwad where the office of the Sub Registrar is located. However, several of Vinay Kulkarni’s followers and Congress leaders gathered near the Mini Vidhana Soudha. But the police ensured that none met him during his visit. Vinay Kulkarni is lodged in Hindalga Jail in Belagavi and it was at 11 a.m. that he was brought from Hindalga Jail to the Sub Registrar’s office. Then, Vinay Kulkarni submitted the GPA in favour of his wife Shivaleela Kulkarni authorising her to look after his farm and dairy. Vinay Kulkarni’s wife, along with his children Vaishali and Hemant, were waiting anxiously at the office and they turned emotional on seeing him. Although Vinay Kulkarni’s younger brother Vijay Kulkarni, who also has been grilled several times by the CBI, tried to meet him, he was not allowed by the police. The police action made some of his supporters furious. They tried to argue with the police. But after Deputy Commissioner of Police Ramrajan strictly told them that they have to abide by court order, they retreated. Vinay Kulkarni subsequently visited the branch of Bank of India near the Old SP Circle where he opened a joint account with his wife to deal with financial transactions of his dairy. There, again, scores of his supporters turned up to see him raising slogans in his favour, which made Vinay Kulkarni emotional. He responded by waving at them. He was later taken back to Hindalga Jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/court-permits-vinay-kulkarni-to-visit-dharwad/article35574737.ece

Addressing a gathering at the Press Day celebrations jointly organised by the Jidga Math and the Karnataka Union Of Working Journalists on the math premises in Jidga, Aland taluk, on Tuesday, chief of Jidga Math Murugharajendra Swamy said that he has already mobilised 1,000 devotees who can sponsor at least one child’s education. “When I visited Siddaganga Math a couple of years ago, I found that the math was offering free education and accommodation to over 1,000 poor students. I also found that many poor students from Kalaburagi and surrounding areas were studying there. They had to leave their native place and parents for that faraway place for the purpose of studies. It was then that the idea of opening residential schools for poor children from Kalaburagi region came up. I have already mobilised 1,000 devotees who could sponsor at least one child’s education. The process, which was disrupted by COVID-19, will take off soon,” he said. Taking note of the hard work and the sacrifices that the frontline warriors made in the fight against COVID-19, the seer said that a programme for felicitating all the frontline warriors in Kalaburagi district will be organised at his Kotnoor Math in Kalaburagi.

28 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||It may take 25 days to restore Donigal stretch temporarily||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) expects to temporarily restore the landslip-affected stretch of National Highway 75 near Donigal in Sakleshpur taluk of Hassan district in the next 25 days. Heavy landslip affected the embankment of the highway to a considerable extent in the early hours of July 22 forcing the authorities concerned to suspend vehicular movement through the stretch. The crucial link between the coastal region and other parts of the State has thus become unavailable for movement affecting routine life as well as trade and commerce. Attributing very heavy rain received in the region at that particular time as the reason for the landslip, NHAI’s Hassan project implementation unit director Col. A.K. Janbaz said that preliminary works securing the embankment from further slips have already started. The authority requires a maximum of 25 days to restore the stretch to facilitate movement of heavy vehicles, Col. Janbaz told The Hindu . However, this also depends on the quantum of rain in the coming days, he added. The landslip-affected stretch forms part of NHAI’s four-lane project on National Highway 75 between Hassan and Maranahalli in Hassan district. With the contractor for the project, Isolux Corson India Engineering and Construction Pvt. Ltd., being insolvent, NHAI entrusted the project to sub contractor Rajkamal Builders Pvt. Ltd. to continue the work. The 45-km four-lane project is being executed under engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode at an estimated cost of Rs. 537.92 crore. Stating that non-availability of captive stone quarry had hindered the progress of work, Col. Janbaz said that the entire four-lane work is likely to be completed by the end of 2023, as against the initial deadline of March 2022. Light vehicles Meanwhile, Hassan Deputy Commissioner R. Girish on Monday passed an order allowing light vehicles, up to passenger buses, to operate on National Highway 75; but using alternative village roads. The vehicles may take the Anemahal-Kyanahalli-Kesaganahalli-Heggadde route or Maranahalli/Doddatappale-Kyamanahalli-Harle Koodige-Anemahal stretch, he said. The NHAI too is allowing light vehicles to pass through the affected stretch at Donigal during the day time, Col. Janbaz added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/temporary-restoration-of-nh-75-may-take-25-days/article35574540.ece

When there are instances of child marriage, Dr. Rajendra said, the anganwadi workers concerned should be alerted and action should be taken to visit the people involved. Parents should be made aware of the harm of child marriage. He said that awareness programmes on child marriage prevention should be held during the meeting of women self-help groups and other forums in villages.

28 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Build 25 vermicompost units each, GPs told||The Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat has decided to facilitate construction of at least 25 vermicompost units for every gram panchayat in the district to encourage farmers to take up the activity on a large scale. This will be done through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme when the zilla panchayat launches the Raita Bandhu movement on August 15 [till October 15], said ZP CEO Kumara on Monday. Speaking at the Raita Bandhu Abhiyan video conference meeting at the ZP here, Mr. Kumara said that it is necessary to encourage farmers to move towards vermicomposting because of its multiple benefits. While vermicompost encourages organic farming, the cost of production too gets reduced with this method compared to the use of chemical fertilizers, he said. The CEO asked panchayats to undertake a wide campaign to reach out to farmers with the initiative and also inform them of the ill-effects of using chemical fertilizers. He told them to arrange necessary training for farmers through qualified personnel, while asking officials concerned to document the construction of vermicompost units and the success stories. Deputy Director of Horticulture H.R. Nayak said that an action plan has already been prepared for the vermicompost units and if this is approved, estimates will be prepared. Joint Director of Agriculture Seetha and others were present. Nutrition gardens Chairing another meeting on Nutrition (Kitchen) Gardens, Mr. Kumara said that a Nutrition Garden movement to raise them on the premises of schools, colleges, hostels and hospitals will soon be launched. While leafy vegetables and other vegetables may be grown on campus of educational institutions, hospitals may raise medicinal gardens, he said and directed the Education Department to make a list of all such institutions in the district. Besides vegetables, saplings of native fruits, including mango, sapota, lemon, papaya and amla, may be raised on the premises of educational institutions, he said. Mr. Kumara noted that works on 50 school buildings, 60 anganwads, 11 hostels and seven backward classes hostels will be taken up during the current financial year. Deputy Director of Social Welfare S.B. Yogesh and Deputy Director of Women and Child Development Papa Bhovi and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/build-25-vermicompost-units-each-gps-told/article35574915.ece

28 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC expedites search for vending zones across Mysuru||Amid a sustained crackdown by the traffic police on roadside vendors for impeding free pedestrian movement, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has expedited its search for suitable areas for vending zones in the city. Ever since two pedestrians were injured grievously in a serial mishap on New Sayyaji Rao Road on July 15 after they were forced to walk on the road due to encroachment of footpaths, the police have been carrying out a special drive in all the five traffic police station limits of the city by booking cases against roadside vendors for encroachment of footpaths. Already, the MCC has identified seven vending zones in different parts of the city in a recent exercise and is awaiting the government’s approval for the Detailed Project Report (DPR) it has sent. “We are yet to begin the development of these vending zones. But it will not be enough. We are in the process of identifying more such vending zones”, said Shashi Kumar, Additional Commissioner of MCC, who has been entrusted with the task of overseeing street vending activities. The proposed vending zones include Ballal Circle, Vijaynagar High Tension Line Road, in front of St Joseph’s Hospital in Bannimantap ,and near P and T quarters in N.R. Mohalla. Out of the seven proposed vending zones, the traffic police have refused to provide a No Objection Cerificate (NOC) to one that falls in the limits of MCC’s Zone 5, forcing the authorities to look for an alternative site and send another proposal. The civic body recently held a meeting where the Assistant Commissioners and Development Officers of all the MCC zones in the city have been directed to identify suitable areas for establishing vending zones that conform to the guidelines, he said. The vending zones chosen should not only be free from traffic, but should also not receive any objections from the people residing in the neighbourhood. “Work is under way to identify more such vending zones in the city,” Mr. Kumar added. Meanwhile, Bhaskar Srinivas Raje Urs, president, Karnataka Street Vendors’ Federation, said the Karnataka Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood, Regulation of Street Vending and Licensing) Scheme 2020 permits street vendors to earn their livelihood without hindering free movement of traffic or pedestrians. In Mysuru, the MCC has already issued QR code-based identity cards and vending certificates to 1,580 street vendors. Several authorised vendors too have been booked in the drive by the traffic police, he lamented. However, the traffic police officials said they have booked street vendors for encroaching on footpaths and hindering free movement of pedestrians under the provisions of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-expedites-search-for-vending-zones-across-mysuru/article35574934.ece
28 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||How many street vendors are there in Mysuru?||Though the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is yet to launch a fresh survey of street vendors in the city, the number of applications received for the Prime Minister Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi), a special micro-credit facility for street vendors launched by the Centre last year, crossed 20,000 in Mysuru. MCC Additional Commissioner Shashi Kumar told The Hindu that over 20,000 applications from the city had been received for the scheme, which seeks to provide collateral-free working capital loans upto Rs. 10,000. However, the total number of street vendors in MCC limits with an identity card and a vending certificate is no more than 1,856 at present. “We will be starting a fresh survey of street vendors in the city soon,” he said. The 1,856 identity cards were given to vendors in Mysuru about three years ago. The response to the MCC exercise in 2018 to identify street vendors in the city and issue them identity cards and vending certificates, was very poor, said Bhaskar Srinivas Raje Urs president, Karnataka Street Vendors’ Federation. Lockdown effect? Their numbers were much more three years ago. But, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown had substantially increased the number of vendors in Mysuru with a large number of private school teachers, factory workers and even autorickshaw drivers turning street vendors, said Mr. Urs. It may be mentioned here that the number of people taking to vending a variety of food items on the streets went up sharply during the lockdown. “Though many had dropped out lately, a few are continuing,” he said, while claiming that that the total applications for the PM SVANidhi scheme from Mysuru had crossed 22,500. He claimed that 8,500 of the applicants had been sanctioned the loan too. Similarly, Mr. Urs claimed that about 12,000 persons from Mysuru had received the COVID-19 aid of Rs. 2,000 given by the State government to street vendors. Applications for PM SVANidhi should be accompanied by not only copies of the applicant’s Aadhaar card, photo, ration card and voters’ identity card, but also a Letter of Recommendation (LoR) issued by the MCC, he said. Previous surveys With regard to previous surveys, Mr Urs said a total of 1,200 vendors were identified during an exercise confined to food street vendors during 2010. When another survey was conducted in 2011 to cover all vendors, a total of 4,800 were identified. Meanwhile, the proposed new survey of street vendors in Mysuru is expected to be carried out by the Town Vending Committee of MCC comprising not only the Commissioner, but also health and police official, besides representatives from the vendors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/how-many-street-vendors-are-there-in-mysuru/article35574937.ece

The stakeholders claim that the revival, when compared to the last wave, appears to be quicker and one of the key reasons attributed to this is vaccination.  “It took nearly 25 days for the palace to register 1,000 visitors last year. This year, on the third day of reopening, over 1,000 tourists visited the palace. The footfalls are around 3,000-3,500 on weekdays and about 5,000 on weekends. Last Sunday, the palace attracted 5,500 visitors,” said Mysuru Palace Board Deputy Director T.S. Subramanya. The situation, post-lockdown, appears to be better when compared to the scenario after the lockdown was eased last year. The tourism sector will revive further if the same situation continues, the stakeholders feel. At the zoo Another tourist destination that is equally popular in Mysuru has also been registering a rise in footfalls. The Mysuru zoo has been attracting around 2,000-plus visitors on weekdays and about 3,500-plus visitors on weekends. Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni said footfalls are on the rise but there is still a long way to go to register the kind of footfall that existed during pre-COVID-19 days. Despite this, the footfalls post-lockdown are better this time. COVID-19 protocol “Visitors are fully aware of the situation and have been following the guidelines at the zoo. Vaccination and sharp drop in cases are the factors for the rise in footfalls,” he felt.  It took nearly 25 days for the palace to register 1,000 visitors last year. This year, on the third day of reopening, over 1,000 visited the palace. T.S.

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Hoardings to make a comeback||Confirming the development, UDD’s Additional Chief Secretary Rakesh Singh told The Hindu that the decision was taken as the civic body was losing out on a lot of revenue with hoardings not being allowed in the city. Several rounds of deliberations had been held with stakeholders before arriving at the decision to allow the hoardings, he said. He added that the High Court of Karnataka had, on several occasions, come down heavily on the “erratic hoardings and materials used”. “The new rules have specified the protocol to be followed for permission, regulating the size of hoardings and materials used, which was missing in the earlier rules. With this, we will be able to ensure that the city’s aesthetics are not affected, apart from garnering revenue out of it,” he said. It was in August 2018 that the BBMP Council passed a resolution banning all forms of advertisement hoardings for one year. This, however, was only after the High Court of Karnataka took the civic body to task over the mushrooming of illegal advertisement hoardings across the city. Nearly a year later, the UDD published the draft BBMP Advertisement Rules, 2019 in an attempt to bring back hoardings. The civic body, once again, passed a resolution opposing the draft rules. Meanwhile, the court is still hearing a PIL petition on advertisement hoardings and has time and again directed the BBMP to clear the huge skeletal structures of hoardings that still dot the cityscape. RTI activist Saidutta, who has filed the PIL in the high court, has alleged that “advertisement mafia and corrupt civic officials” were responsible for the development. “It is also unfortunate that the BJP, which had in its election manifesto stated that it was against hoardings, is responsible for its coming back,” he said, adding that he would challenge this legally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hoardings-to-make-a-comeback/article35574536.ece

Alexander here recently decided to hasten various processes related to the implementation of the Punargeham project of the Fisheries Department in the district. The previous Left Democratic Front government launched Punargeham to provide housing for all fisher families residing in areas vulnerable to sea erosion and tidal wave attack in nine coastal districts of the State. The project aims at rehabilitating fisher families living within 50 m of the coastline. Officials said the land acquisition, rehabilitation, and other processes would be expedited. Authorities have identified 4,660 families in the district for inclusion in the scheme. Of these, 928 families have informed their willingness to shift from the coastline. “The district-level management committee has given its nod for buying land for 474 beneficiaries. Of these, land registration for 407 families has been completed,” said an official. Rs. 10 lakh each The Fisheries Department is providing each beneficiary Rs. 10 lakh, including Rs. 6 lakh for buying land and Rs. 4 lakh for constructing house. The amount is disbursed in instalments. As many as 383 families in the district have received the first instalment. A total 214 of these beneficiaries have received both the instalments, and 131 families got the third instalment too. “Our aim is to provide housing for all families included on the list. The process of identifying land to rehabilitate the rest of the beneficiaries will be speeded up. Apart from the beneficiaries already identified, we are in the process of finding more fisher families for inclusion in the scheme,” the official added. As part of the project, the government is planning to rehabilitate 20,000 families across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/land-acquisition-for-punargeham-project-to-be-expedited/article35574882.ece

Theatres in Telangana have been permitted 100% audiences, while Andhra Pradesh will allow 50%. Mahesh Koneru, who produced the legal thriller Thimmarusu , said the team waited for theatres to reopen and did not consider a digital release.  Ishq was originally scheduled to release on April 23. Another film, Narasimhapuram, was also expected to be released on July 30. Ceiling rates The State government issued a notification directing theatre managements to adhere to the maximum ceiling rates, as laid down by the government. Film exhibitors had been pointing out that in rural areas, ticket prices were unrealistically low, between Rs. 10 and Rs. 50. Exhibitors argued that they would not be able to meet recurring maintenance and sanitation costs with such low ticket prices. Film industry representatives were hopeful that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would allow ticket pricing that would also benefit theatres,” N.V. Prasad, a film producer said. Film industry insiders said more than 20 Telugu films had completed censor certification formalities and were awaiting release in late August and September.

The work on 10 of the 109 houses has been completed in the first phase of the rehabilitation project at Vellappan Kanady, a vested forest area nearly 18 km from nearest town of Meppady in the district. As many as 109 families were given record of rights for one acre of land each on vested forest land under the rehabilitation project nearly two years ago. Thirty-seven members of 10 landless tribal families have been living here in makeshift huts erected on the allotted land. With the completion of the rehabilitation project, all the families would be provided houses in a time-bound manner, K.C. Cheriyan, Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) officer, Wayanad, told The Hindu . Most of the families in the settlement, belonging to the Paniya, Adiya, and Kattunayakkan tribes, were from Thirunelly and Noolpuzha grama panchayats, said Mr. Cheriyan. The project was executed by the Tribal Resettlement and Development Mission (TRDM), and each house was constructed at a cost of Rs. 6 lakh, he added. Each 480-sq.-ft house, constructed by the District Nirmithi Kendra, consists of two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen, a work area and a toilet. Directions had been given to departments concerned to expedite measures to provide infrastructure facilities such as road, electrification, and drinking water to the residents under the project on a war footing, he said. Phase two “It is expected that the houses can be handed over to the owners in a month,” he said.

The project is proposed to be implemented with funds from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), said a communication from the Public Relations Department. Residential areas in Chalakkadavu, one of the most vulnerable places in Chellanam panchayat, were flooded during high tide on Tuesday. Residents of the area had protested against ‘official inaction’ on Monday morning by temporarily blocking traffic on the Fort Chellanam-Cherthala road even as the district administration said works worth Rs. 3.22 crore had been completed to erect structures like geotextile tubes to prevent sea intrusion. Jinson Veluthamannungal, a resident, said that there was no change in the volatile situation in the panchayat as it faced heavy rain and rough sea. The communication from the district administration said geotextile bags had been erected for 100 metres each in Kannamali and Chalakkadavu and for 70 metres in Malakhappadi. These are some of the most vulnerable areas in Chellanam panchayat. Works worth Rs. 1.75 crore had been carried out for erecting geotextile bags along Bazaar, Companippadi, Cheriyakadavu, Vachakkal, Kandakkadavu, Reethalayam, Deepti Anganwadi and Puthenthode segments. However, Chellanam Janakiya Vedhi’s V.T. Sebastian alleged that lives and property of people still remained under threat from high waves and flooding. He alleged that the district authorities were not actually looking into problems of people but only announcing projects that did not see proper implementation. The district administration said that geotextile bags worth Rs. 30 lakh had been handed over to Chellanam panchayat for carrying out coastal protection works, and the District Collector had ordered the Irrigation Department to submit a report on the works carried out in the panchayat. The department carried out works worth Rs. 25 lakh to desilt stormwater drainage systems like the Vijayam Canal and Uppathkkad in Chellanam following cyclonic storm Tauktae. Similar works worth Rs. 35 lakh had been carried out on Vypeen Island. Works worth Rs. 8 crore for geotextile tube erection have begun in Vachakkal, Cheriyakadavu and Companippadi, while breakwaters have been built off the Edvanakkad coast in Vypeen.

The district health wing has suggested an increase in the working hours based on the inference that overcrowding could have occurred owing to time restrictions applicable to such facilities. An increase in working hours may reduce crowd. Physical distancing and use of masks have to be ensured in public places to check the pandemic spread, with the help of the police and other enforcement agencies, according to an analysis of the COVID-19 situation in the district by the Health Department. The health authorities had analysed community mobility reports prepared by Google to study movement trends across different categories of places that include groceries, super markets, and transit stations. N.K. Kuttappan, District Medical Officer, said that a concerted effort was required to check overcrowding in public places. It is being done by enforcement agencies, he said. The Health Department has suggested stepping up testing in local bodies figuring in the ‘D’ category (TPR above 15%), while sentinel testing should be increased in areas in the ‘A’ category (TPR below 5%). The district administration has decided to deploy mobile teams in local bodies with high TPR while focussing on persons likely to have increased social contacts. The District Surveillance Unit has stated that the strategy of ‘test-isolate-treat’ and vaccination should go hand-in-hand to avoid increase in positive cases. There will be an increase in post-COVID outpatient numbers in the coming four to eight weeks. “Respiratory infections associated with the disease may flare up, especially in this rainy season. The district has a robust system for post-COVID patient services,” said Dr. Kuttappan. The analysis showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in the community. Other communicable diseases were also co-existing in society. So, utmost care should be given to patients so as to not miss out on other infections, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/districts-mobility-data-points-to-overcrowding-in-public-places/article35574824.ece
28 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fields form 19% of SilverLine land||Paddy fields comprise nearly 19% of the 1,343 hectares required for Kerala's SilverLine project connecting Kasaragod and Thiruvanthapuram. “Out of the total land requirement of 1,343 hectares for the project, the paddy field land use is 253.45 hectares, which is only 18.9% [of the total requirement],” according to the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the implementing agency Kerala Rail Development Corporation (K-Rail). The data on the paddy fields required for the 529.45-km semi-high-speed rail SilverLine have been mentioned in Chapter 20 of the DPR titled ‘Sustainable Transport System and Green Initiatives’ submitted before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Green project The bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member K. Satyagopal had asked the K-Rail to submit the documents showing the feasibility study and environment management plan to supplement the 'green project' claim made by the agency. The court gave the directive in a petition that alleged that the project lacked environmental clearance. The DPR said that nearly 30 hectares of the 253.45 hectares of paddy land used will be redeveloped and reclaimed as paddy fields. An additional 10 hectares of fallow land will be converted as paddy field. The 15% of the net paddy field agricultural land will come down after the fallow land is converted into paddy field at the end of the project, it said.  The report said that K-Rail has started associating with the government's efforts to revive paddy farming. Special funds can be availed of to restore the damage caused to the paddy fields and make the fallow land fit for paddy cultivation, it said. The DPR said that no forestland has been used for the project by careful planning, though the proposed rail corridor covers almost the entire north to south of Kerala. It is a necessary evil and is unavoidable to cut or replant trees during any major construction such as railway projects. In this project, 10 trees will be planted for every tree getting axed, it said. The DPR stated that semi-high-speed rail infrastructure requirements such as curves and gradients have been optimised to reduce the land requirement. The land proposed to be used in this corridor is approximately between 2.06 ha/km and 2.44 ha/km, which is much less than the motorway, it claimed. Asked why only a part of the DPR was given to the tribunal, K-Rail authorities said that the court had asked to produce the relevant portions explaining the green concepts associated with the project. The rapid environment impact assessment report was also submitted before the court, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paddy-fields-form-19-of-land-for-silverline/article35574830.ece

A proposal mooted by the department for clearing obstructions and ensuring free flow of floodwaters through the canal has been submitted to the State authorities. Now, administrative sanction and funds for the project are awaited, said department officials. This was one canal that was left unattended during Operation Breakthrough, which was undertaken to free the city of flooding. Canal cleaning operations cannot be successful without clearing encroachments along its course. As many as 75 shops have come up on top of the canal, which need to be removed for the successful implementation of the project, said R. Baji Chandran, Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Department, who led the team of officials. The bed level of the canal was found raised up to 1.5 metres using concrete along the canal stretch between the KSRTC bus station and railway station. The elevated bed level, which prevented free flow of water through the canal, needs to be removed using excavators. The removal of the concrete floor shall be carried out by ensuring that the nearby structures are not damaged, he said. The construction of concrete retaining walls for the Mullassery canal has blocked a large number of small canals that used to drain into it. The block needs to be removed and canals reconnected again to ensure that floodwaters are carried away, Mr. Chandran explained. The removal of encroachments on the canal will be a significant step towards freeing the city of flooding. Once the funds are released, the restoration work could be completed within three weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mullassery-canal-restoration-awaits-administrative-clearance-funds/article35574816.ece

Sources said the inspection was part of routine checks on industrial units using groundwater but had to take No Objection Certificates (NOC) from the department. A report on the inspection is expected soon though sources pointed out that the Kitex unit had not approached the department for NOC. Sources said the inspection followed complaints raised at the District Development Committee (DDC) a fortnight ago. P.T. Thomas, MLA, had said at the DDC meeting that Kitex Garments was drawing a substantial quantity of groundwater without official permission. Meanwhile, Kitex Group chairman Sabu M. Jacob said here that an inspection was held for the 12th time on the company premises in a short period of time. He had alleged that 11 inspections had been carried out at Kitex units during June. Monday’s inspection is against assurances given by the Industries Department that checks on industrial premises would be centralised, and that no surprise and serial inspections would be conducted. Mr. Jacob said officials of the Groundwater Department at Kakkanad had informed him that the inspection was held on the basis of a complaint raised by Mr. Thomas. He added that the Industries Minister had promised a fortnight ago that there would be centralised checks on industrial units, and that surprise checks would not be held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/checks-on-kitex-unit-part-of-routine-procedures-say-officials/article35574828.ece

Having registered a case of theft on July 22 on a petition by the university authorities, the police have decided to continue with their probe to piece together the events that led to the disappearance and then the re-emergence of the scripts. “Since they are pivotal to the higher studies of the students, we will hand the answer scripts over to the university authorities on the assurance that they will be produced before the court on demand,” said P.A. Davis, Sub Inspector, Kalady. Meanwhile, Sangamesan K.M., a senior faculty member of the department who was suspended earlier this month after being held responsible for the loss of answer scripts, has been reinstated by the Sanskrit university with immediate effect. He rejoined duty on Tuesday. “The Association of Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University Teachers will continue its protest demanding to unearth the conspiracy behind the whole incident and punish the guilty,” said Prof. Sangamesan who is also the president of the association. He had denied the accusation saying all along that the answer scripts and grade sheet were handed over to the head of the department on March 17.

28 July 2021||Kochi,KERALA||HC takes Kerala govt. to task||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday slammed the State government for not yet arresting the accused in a case relating to cutting and removal of valuable trees from reserved forest under the Meppadi forest range in Wayanad. The Bench comprising Chief Justice S.Manikumar and Justice Shaji P.Chali made the oral observation when a public interest litigation seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the alleged illegal cutting and removal of trees came up for hearing. When the petition came up for hearing, the Bench orally observed that the investigation in the case did not seem to be on the right track. The accused had not been arrested as yet. The court asked why the police were reluctant to arrest the accused despite registering 701 cases. The Advocate General submitted that one of the accused had obtained bail in the case. Besides, the police were not able to effect any arrest due to the pandemic situation. The court said the police could not delay arresting the other accused saying one of the accused was out on bail. It showed the lethargic attitude of the police and any delay in arresting the accused might lead to destruction of evidence. The court also directed the State government to file an affidavit in this regard. According to the petitioner, a section of revenue and forest officials and politicians of the ruling front conspired with the timber mafia for the illegal act. They even used the lockdown as an additional cover to cut and transport valuable trees from private land and forestland. The investigation by the police was only an eyewash. There would not be a fair investigation as government officials were also involved in the case. If the State agency continued with the investigation, there was every possibility of tampering with the evidence. Surendran’s reaction BJP State president K. Surendran said the High Court’s damning observations about the Revenue and Forest Department’s “dubious and facilitatory role” in the illegal felling of 100s of ancient rosewood trees in Wayanad was a slap in the face of the Pinarayi Vijayan government. The court had slammed the government for not arresting a single person in the case. The Forest Department had registered 701 cases and confiscated Rs. 14 crore worth of valuable timber. Mr. Surendran said CPI(M) and CPI politicians and former Revenue Minister and the Chief Minister’s Office had a role in the timber loot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-takes-govt-to-task-on-tree-felling-case/article35574811.ece

Anilkumar. The department had come up with a preliminary report on the 28 canals running through the city and the issues plaguing them. A team of experts had also listed the hazards, including dumping of waste and encroachments on canals, at a presentation held at the corporation council meeting on Monday. The team members had also reported that some canals had vanished from the city following illegal reclamation and encroachment, resulting in flooding. The closure of a few drains, which carried floodwaters from city roads to the main canals, also contributed to flooding. Bunk shops and other structures too had come up over the canals, the experts had pointed out. Mr. Anilkumar said surveillance mechanism would be strengthened to prevent dumping of waste in canals, and Kudumbashree would be given the task. The civic body will seek the help of the State government and courts for evicting encroachers. The support of various agencies will be required for effective implementation of the project, he informed the council. The expert team led by R. Baji Chandran, Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Department, was instrumental in implementing the Operation Breakthrough project in Kochi for mitigating urban flooding. A detailed project report for handling urban flooding will be prepared shortly after considering suggestions made by the corporation council. The department came forward to address flooding and management of drains on a request made to Minister Roshy Augustine and Additional Chief Secretary T.K. Jose. The department had earlier taken over the management of canals in Thiruvananthapuram, the Mayor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/surveillance-to-be-strengthened-to-prevent-dumping-of-waste-in-canals/article35574814.ece

Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan passed the interim order on Tuesday on a writ petition filed by Zainul Abid, president, Al Madrasathul Uloomiya, Minicoy, seeking to quash the notice. The petitioner pointed out that the madrasa was established in 1980 for imparting religious instructions to children of officials coming from the mainland or other islands and working in governmental and quasi-governmental institutions on Minicoy island, who were unfamiliar with Mahal, a language predominantly spoken on the island. ‘Abuse of power’ He said the hasty manner in which the administration was preparing to demolish the madrasa was an abuse of power. The land was allotted under 14(2) of the Laccadive, Minicoy & Amindivi Islands Land Revenue and Tenancy Regulations, 1965. Therefore, he could not be termed as a person occupying the land without lawful authority. Besides, the Deputy Collector had no authority to issue the notice. The court directed the administration to file a counter-affidavit within four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-stays-notice-for-demolition-of-madrasa-in-minicoy/article35574820.ece

They will also claim remuneration for every animal that is gunned down. Last year, 173 wild boars were thus killed in the State with the highest number being recorded in Kozhikode (70 animals), followed by Thiruvananthapuram. The killing of the crop-raiding boars will be carried out under the existing provisions of law. The State had earlier issued orders for killing the species, which posed threat to agriculture and human life, said Bennichan Thomas, chief wildlife warden (CWW), Kerala. The State government had earlier delegated the powers of the CWW to divisional forest officers to order killing of the species. The officials were also asked to decide on complaints of crop-raiding boars within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint. While ordering the killing of wild boars that pose threat to human life and property, the department insists that such animals shall not be brought down by poisoning, electric shock or by deploying explosives. The CWW could also order its killing in identified areas where the animals cause widespread crop loss and other damage. The free availability of food waste and reduced number of its predators have been attributed as the important reasons for the increase in the population of the species. Rise in numbers However, barring the steep hike in its numbers in 2002, the number of wild boars seemed to have remained more or less constant in the State, according to a data published on the website of the department. The government order permits killing of only those wild boars which enter the farmlands. They cannot be chased and hunted down in forest areas. The carcass of the animals thus killed will have to be burned using kerosene for preventing the consumption of meat. The government has also specified that the responsibility of any loss to human life or destruction of property during the process of killing the wild boar shall solely be on the persons who are engaged in the process, according to government officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/licenced-gunners-to-look-for-crop-raiding-boars/article35574805.ece

But the municipality has denied any role in the incident. The Infopark police will question municipal workers in connection with the incident on the basis of the statements of three persons who were involved in the alleged killing of the dogs. The police have arrested and released on bail four persons in the case, and veterinary officials have sent samples for forensic tests to ascertain the cause of death after 25 dog carcasses were recovered from a municipal dumping yard early last week. Ranjini Haridas, trustee of Humanity for Animals, said, “We are only asking people to be compassionate towards animals,” while the people in power are unable to understand the laws governing the country. She participated in the protest in which the group members blindfolded themselves to represent what they described as indescribable cruelty to dogs. Meanwhile, the issue of dog deaths did not come up for discussion at an online meeting of the Thrikkakara Municipal Council, as the Opposition boycotted the meet demanding that an offline meeting be convened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/activists-stage-protest-against-killing-of-dogs/article35574817.ece

On the first day of the drive, most parts of the 13 km of the Kollam bypass cutting through 12 Corporation divisions were cleaned by the the Corporation health wing. The Corporation is implementing the project in connection with Subhiksha Keralam, an initiative launched by the government to make the State self-reliant in food production.

The Rs. 50-crore plant produces 63 tonnes of oxygen, 70 tonnes of nitrogen and 7 tonnes of liquefied oxygen every day. With this, the company has become self-reliant in oxygen production and so far, the KMML has supplied around 1,550 tonnes of oxygen for medical purpose. The company has now increased its production from 7 TPD to 9 TPD considering the high demand for oxygen due to COVID-19.

A three-member committee appointed by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) and led by V.C. Kabeer held interactions with party functionaries at different levels on Monday and Tuesday. While some leaders submitted written complaints against the District Congress Committee (DCC) and the State leadership, others expressed strong resentment against the way the leadership handled an important election. Official sources said majority of the party workers pointed to organisational lapses as the key reason behind the electoral debacle. The party had won just two seats in the district. “The United Democratic Front (UDF) could have won a majority of the seats in the district had the KPCC acted proactively after the setback in the local body elections. However, factionalism and interests of various groups prevented a revamp of the DCC, which in turn, failed miserably in coordinating the committees,” said a Congress leader. Exit of KC(M) Other allegations against the leadership included its inability to fill the vacuum created after the exit of Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)] from the UDF. The failure in obtaining the trust of the religious forums too was raised. The Jacobite faction of the Malankara Church distanced itself from the party, as was evident from the drop in the vote margin of former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in Puthuppally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-committee-meets-to-review-election-debacle/article35574888.ece

A circular issued by the Bishop of Pala Mar Joseph Kallarangatt on Tuesday asserted the need for launching an action plan as a relief measure to large families that are facing crises. “Families are experiencing severe financial crunch these days. The education of children, their health and employment have all become arduous tasks,” noted the circular, to be read out in parishes under the diocese on August 1. According to the bishop, parents should happily receive the children gifted by God and are duty bound to raise them responsibly. “By giving birth to each child, the parents are becoming part of God’s creation process,” he noted. Monthly assistance The circular further elaborates on the welfare scheme, which begins with a monthly financial assistance of Rs. 1,500 from August 2021 to the couples who are married after 2000 and have five or more children. It further accords preference to children from such families for employment in a hospital run by the diocese, while women who deliver of their fourth children onward are entitled for free delivery care from admission to discharge in a couple of hospitals run by the Church. Similarly, children who are born as the fourth or subsequently in a family will be offered free education at the nursing college under the diocese while such children obtaining admission in its engineering or hotel management colleges will be exempted from paying tuition fee. The scheme also seeks to give priority to these children, who are born between 2000 and 2021, in recruitment to educational institutions in accordance with the government norms. The scheme, proposed by the Family Apostolate of the Pala diocese the other day, had received a barrage of criticism in the social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pala-diocese-plans-more-sops-for-large-families/article35574843.ece

The extent of shortage was evident on Monday itself when District Collector N.

However, thousands of slots were available at private hospitals, where Rs. 780 is charged per jab. Some hospitals have been witnessing huge rush for the past few days as well. Fresh doses are expected only within the next two days. Meanwhile, Mr. Reddy directed all private hospitals to set up vaccination facilities. At a meeting of hospital representatives here on Tuesday, he said the test positivity rate (TPR) and the number of infected persons were going up in the district. This had led to strengthening of restrictions here, he added. Of the fresh cases reported on Tuesday, 2,354 were locally acquired infections, while the source of 34 others was not known. As many as 17,803 samples were tested, and TPR was 13.63%.

28 July 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Survey finds hurdles to women in communications industry||The findings of the first edition of the ‘I Lead’ survey, a collaborative study launched to capture the experiences and challenges of women to reach leadership positions in the field of communications, has shown that less than half (42%) of women believe that equal pay for equal work is not practised in the field of communications. The I Lead survey was conducted by Women’s Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Public Relations and Digital Marketing Council and the Indian Institute of Management - Kozhikode (IIMK) in early 2021 among 1,000-plus woman professionals. The survey was spread across genres of journalism, advertising, public relations, digital communications, content writing, corporate affairs, and corporate communications, a press release issued by the IIMK said on Tuesday. Mentoring programme Two-third (68%) of the respondents said that their organisations did not have a formal mentoring programme for aspiring woman leaders. More than half (53%) of the respondents said organisations did not have a clear career growth path for women joining post-maternity leave or taking critical care breaks. Nearly 79% of women said the organisations considered home investments as gaps during promotions or assignment of critical work. More than half (53%) of the respondents said their employers did not recruit and engage in formal succession planning to ensure gender diversity. The I Lead survey also captured the progress made by companies in recent years towards ensuring gender diversity, clearly indicating some big wins. Two-third of the respondents (68%) said male and female employees were evaluated on equal parameters. Also, 67% of participants accepted that their organisations valued and nurtured ambitious women. More than half (63%) of the respondents affirmed that women were provided with upskilling opportunities. Besides 7 in 10 (74%) women agreed that their organisations encouraged them to speak up against workplace discrimination / harassment, clearly indicating a commitment to building a safe and inclusive culture. Kavita Lakhani, director (operations), Weber Shandwick, and national president, WICCI Public Relations and Digital Marketing Council, said, “While 66% of respondents agreed to the existence of gender diversity at workplaces, 61% said equal number of men and women was not in leadership roles.” Inclusion policies Prof. Deepa Sethi, Chairperson, PGP-LSM, IIMK, and project coordinator, said, “It is high time women were treated equally. Diversity and inclusion policies need to be implemented in true essence. Women are not asking for special treatment. Nonetheless, they do deserve equal treatment in every aspect of work, including their climbing the ladder to leadership roles.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/survey-finds-hurdles-to-women-in-communications-industry/article35574800.ece
28 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||LDF plagued by controversies of junior coalition partners||Less than 100 days in office, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government appears to be plagued by controversies of its junior coalition partners. At least two of its minor constituents, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National League (INL), which have secured a berth in Pinarayi Vijayan’s Cabinet 2.0, are not just regional parties, but have their Central leadership at the helm. The allegation that NCP’s A.K. Saseendran, who is the Forest Minister, intervened to settle a molestation case and the factional war in the INL have cast a blot on the Left-led alliance. Though his party is solidly backing Mr. Saseendran, the CPI(M) leadership is unhappy with the turn of events.  NCP leadership Now, senior leader P.C. Chacko, who quit the Congress on the eve of the Assembly elections and joined the NCP, has emerged as a troubleshooter to staunchly support Mr. Saseedran. His good rapport with the NCP’s Central leaders is perhaps saving the day for Mr. Saseendran. Nevertheless, the NCP claims that the voice clip between the father of the victim in the molestation case and Mr. Saseendran revealed that the controversy was actually blown out of proportion and could not be swept under the carpet. That the victim is a BJP worker and the father an NCP activist made the case mystifyingly intricate for the police. CM’s support The Chief Minister had also supported his Cabinet colleague in the Assembly. Incidentally, during the previous LDF government, Mr. Saseendran had to resign as Transport Minister in March 2017 in the sensational honey-trap case. Vertical split The case of the INL is more complex than imagined in the ongoing saga of problems in the party. Its State committee meeting held in Kochi on Sunday not only witnessed another episode of factional feud but culminated in the vertical split of the State unit. Now, the warring sections, led by State general secretary Kasim Irikkur and Minister Ahammad Devarkovil on one side and the other led by its State president A.P. Abdul Wahab, are trying to outsmart the other to get more number of leaders and cadres to their camps. Status quo Meanwhile, INL national president Mohammed Suleman is backing the Kasim-Ahammad faction by endorsing the decision to remove the State president and expel seven other leaders for creating a volatile situation in Kochi. That has lent the option for the Chief Minister to preserve the status quo of his Cabinet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-plagued-by-controversies-of-junior-coalition-partners/article35574794.ece
28 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Traders seek overhaul of COVID management system in State||A section of traders have now decided to follow what they called “a path of consensus, not confrontation” to persuade the government to open shops on all days of the week. They have sought an overhaul of the COVID-19 management system and constitution of an expert panel to deal with the current crisis. This was decided by the functionaries of the Malabar Development Council, the Wayanad Chamber of Commerce, and other organisations at a meeting at Kalpetta in Wayanad district on Tuesday. C.E. Chakkunni, functionary of the forum, said that the current management of the pandemic was faulty. The government should speed up vaccination and complete it as early as possible, he added. E.P. Mohandas, secretary, Wayanad Chamber of Commerce, said the government should allow traders to open shops on more days and for more hours in line with the pandemic protocol to reduce the rush of people. Offices and banks should also increase their working hours. The concept of weekend lockdowns should be done away with, he added. The participants at the meeting said they were apprehensive if the government might strengthen the restrictions to contain the pandemic in the coming days. Traders and merchants would not be able to survive for long. It was evident from the reports of suicides of owners of bakery and stationery shops, bus operators, and a man renting out equipment such as mikes for public events. They pointed out that thefts were being reported from closed shops. They are now planning to meet the Chief Minister with a list of suggestions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-seek-overhaul-of-covid-management-system-in-state/article35574786.ece
28 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||State witnessing a demographic transition||Calls for protecting and promoting the rights of elderly persons have been growing with their numbers touching nearly 20% of the population in the State. In fact, Kerala is ageing faster than the rest of the country with regard to demographic transition. The proportion of senior citizens (60 years and above) is expected to increase from 13% (2011 Census) to 23% by 2036. Almost every fifth individual in the State is expected to be a senior citizen by then, S. Irudaya Rajan, Chairman, International Institute of Migration and Development, Kerala, told The Hindu . Declining fertility and increasing longevity have been contributing to the demographic shifts in the State. “Thus the issues surrounding the ageing population require long-term planning,” Dr. Rajan said. Experts believe that government agencies and civil society need to prepare for the welfare measures of the geriatric population. “A holistic combination of health-care and socio-economic protection should be envisaged to deal with the ageing population in the future. The mindset of society should change with focus on quality of livelihood,” he said. He said that the share of the aged was likely to reach 28.2% and 34.3% in 2041 and 2051 respectively. “People should realise that Kerala has an ageing population and old age is second childhood,” said Dr. Rajan, who has done extensive studies on ageing and co-authored a book Senior Citizens of India: Emerging Challenges and Concerns with Udaya S. Mishra, Professor, Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. 3.69 cr. by 2036 Studies showed that the population of the State is expected to increase from 3.34 crore to 3.69 crore during 2011-2036. Also, the life expectancy of men will increase from 72.19 in 2011-15 to 74.49 in 2031-35 and that of women from 78.15 to 80.15. The lowest Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in the country is expected to be in the State at 9 in 2031-35 and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is expected to decline from 1.82 during 2011-2015 to 1.8 during 2031-35. The sex ratio (females per 1,000 males) is expected to show a marginal decrease from 1,084 in 2011 to 1,079 in 2036. Decadal growth rate Incidentally, the percentage decadal growth rate of State’s population during 2001-2011 was 4.9%, the lowest among Indian States. Among districts, Malappuram has the highest growth rate (13.4%), and Pathanamthitta has the lowest growth rate (-3%). Idukki also has seen a decline in population with a negative growth rate (-1.8%). Also, the growth rate of population was lower in the southern districts of Idukki, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Thiruvananthapuram than other districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-witnessing-a-demographic-transition/article35574839.ece
28 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Junior residents not to join duty at MCH||Non-academic junior residents (NAJR) at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kozhikode, have decided not to abide by the Health Department’s decision to extend their tenure for another three months, claiming that it will affect their prospects for higher studies. This is likely to affect the functioning of the hospital, including treatment of COVID-19 patients. As many as 219 students, belonging to the 2015 MBBS batch, had completed their five-and-a-half-year course, including the one-year Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship, in April this year. The government decided to extend it for another three months in view of the pandemic situation. The 2016 batch of house surgeons had not yet assumed charge, as their exams were not over too. However, when the Kerala House Surgeons Association protested against the extension of their tenure, they were categorised as NAJR with a monthly stipend. The government had said in the order that they would be asked to serve either for three months or till the new batch takes over, whichever was earlier. With the extended tenure ending on July 24 now, the department has again prolonged it for another three months. The junior residents say that the exams for the 2016 batch will take at least one more month to conclude. A junior resident told The Hindu on Tuesday that the latest Government Order was applicable only to government medical colleges. “The entrance test for postgraduate courses is expected to be held in April 2022. If we work for another three months here, we will get only five months for preparations,” he said. MCH sources said the sudden departure of postgraduate medical students and medical interns would hit patients hard. The Health Department is yet to hold talks with their representatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/junior-residents-not-to-join-duty-at-mch/article35574795.ece

Titled ‘Out of Syllabus’, the initiative was conceived after teachers realised that completion of the syllabus in the mother tongue like a ritual could hardly help teachers and learners use language effectively and effortlessly, said a release. Before the pandemic struck, the English club of the school had arranged foreign guests to interact with the students. Now, the activities have switched to the online mode, prominent among them being ‘A while with the Guest!’. It provides children an opportunity to interact in English with experts from outside Kerala, the Middle East, the U.S., and the U.K., through a webinar or Google Meet. The teachers pointed out that a casual practice of news reading, poster making, recitation and the like evoke little interest in children in acquiring language skills for practical use. However, interaction with those who do not know Malayalam will help build confidence in them to engage in casual interaction and enhance their communicative competence. K.M. Sachin Dev, MLA, recently opened the activities for the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/out-of-syllabus-project-enters-third-year/article35574803.ece

28 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Snags hit Vidyashree scheme||The Vidyashree student laptop scheme has been hobbled by setbacks since its launch. The government had a couple of days ago decided that owing to delays in supply of laptops by the empanelled companies, besides non-availability of laptops for Rs. 15,000, the Kerala State Financial Enterprises microcredit scheme for Rs. 15,000 associated with Vidyashree will be reconfigured to Rs. 20,000. Now, complaints have arisen that the laptops delivered to students are faulty. The complaints have been raised against a company backed by the government. The company has so far delivered 2,150 laptops, against a purchase order of 4,845 as per the KSFE. A faulty hardware component led to complaints regarding one batch of laptops distributed by the company. Though the defective laptops were replaced they also developed problems. Following this, supply of laptops was stopped immediately. 20% have problems It is estimated some 20% of the laptops supplied have problems. All the faulty laptops will be replaced within three to four weeks, the company said. A mechanism for the replacement is yet to be worked out, Kudumbashree, in association with whom the project is being implemented, said. The government cites delay in supply of laptops for reconfiguring the microcredit scheme from Rs. 15,000 to be repaid in 30 months by paying Rs. 500 a month to Rs. 20,000. Vidyashree scheme beneficiaries now have the option of purchasing laptops or tablets from the market and presenting the invoice or bill to a KSFE branch and getting the cost or maximum of Rs. 20,000, whichever is less. This has to be repaid in 40 months at Rs. 500 a month. Those still interested in buying the laptops of the two companies that have delayed supplies the maximum will get these through the KSFE once these become available. The government has decided to take legal action against the two companies for delays and entrusted the same to the KSFE Managing Director. While one company has supplied 160 laptops against 34,365 purchase orders, the most orders placed, another is yet to supply even one against 19,063 orders, as per the KSFE. Distribution of all laptops received except 467 has been completed.

He stressed on the need to create a mindset that eschewed the dowry system. Emphasising the role of universities in this regard, he suggested collecting two affidavits from students against dowry—one at the time of admission and the other while receiving the degree. “Social evils begin in the mind; the defence against them should also begin in the minds. The mission of universities is to mould minds,” he said. Appreciating the government for its prompt action in posting Dowry Prohibition Officers in all districts and at the State level. He also lauded the decision to make employees to sign an undertaking or not accepting or demanding dowry in their personal lives. Social sanctions Mr. Khan said the need to propagate awareness to an extent that social sanctions were built against dowry. The fear of such a social stigma should deter people from demanding or giving dowry, he said. The Vice Chancellors who participated in the meeting offered a wide range of suggestions such as including the topic in the compulsory modules and mandatory non-credit and MOOC (massive open online courses) programmes, conducting awareness programmes in colleges, forming social justice forums, linking anti-dowry affidavit with the National Academic Depository, taking a pledge against dowry at the time of appointment of staff, and inscribing anti-dowry messages at key locations on campuses.

Sivankutty has said that the government will consider a review of the service and wage conditions of the staff in the pre-primary section of government schools who are being remunerated by Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs). He was responding to a calling attention motion moved by E. Chandrasekharan (Communist Party of India) in the Assembly on Tuesday. Mr. Chandrasekharan highlighted the plight of numerous teachers and ayahs of pre-primary classes started by the PTAs after December 7, 2012 at their own expense. While 2,115 pre-primary schools are directly run by the government in Kerala, no pre-primary classes launched by the PTAs of government schools were given approval since the date. Besides unreasonable remuneration and lack of proper service conditions, such employees have also been unable to avail themselves of training conducted by the General Education Department for pre-primary employees. The teachers have also not been receiving the handbook published by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT). The situation threatened to affect the quality of education imparted to pre-primary students, Mr. Chandrasekharan said. According to Mr. Sivankutty, the government had decided to allow pre-primary schools only after prior approval so as to check their proliferation and to prevent the deterioration of standards. Monthly honorarium Nevertheless, the government has been providing monthly honorariums of Rs. 12,500 for teachers with more than 10 years of service, Rs. 12,000 for those having lesser service, Rs. 7,500 for ayahs with over 10 years of service and Rs. 7,000 for others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pre-primary-staff-wages-to-be-reviewed/article35574798.ece

28 July 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Now, another Thrissur coop. bank in loan scam||After the loan scam at the Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank, another bank fraud has come to light in Thrissur district. The fraud has been reported at the Moospet Service Cooperative Bank controlled by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The irregularity has been found in an audit report of the Registrar of Cooperatives. It is reported that the bank has suffered a loss of Rs. 13.36 crore due to the fraud. It is reported that loans were sanctioned beyond the operating limit of the bank to board members and their relatives illegally. High loan amounts were sanctioned by exaggerating the value of the collateral. Though the Registrar’s report was submitted a few months back, no action has been taken against the bank authorities. As news leaked, depositors gathered in front of the bank on Tuesday for getting back their money. A long queue was seen in front of the bank. The bank has started distributing tokens to depositors for withdrawing money. Karuvannur scam probe Meanwhile, the Crime Branch, the Cooperation Department and the high-level committee appointed by the government have started an inquiry to find out the financial sources, deposits and business deals of the accused in the Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank loan scam. It is important to trace their financial sources as the Cooperation Department is planning to attach the properties of the accused for distributing the money of the depositors. The team is inquiring about the properties of the relatives and friends of the accused. Four private institutions registered at Irinjalakuda and a medical equipment business in Ernakulam, where the accused allegedly have shares, are under the scanner.  The department has started revenue recovery procedures against the accused in the case. Locker unearthed A Crime Branch team unearthed a secret locker used by the accused to store the documents of illegal deals at the Karuvannur bank. Gold coins and 29 documents were found from the locker. According to official information, the loss to the bank due to the scam is Rs. 104.1 crore. But it is reported that the actual loss may be much more than that. The irregularities in the bank's functioning from 2014 to 2020 have come to light now. But there were allegations against the bank from 2003 itself. The department is planning a more detailed investigation. In addition to the loan scam, the audit done at the bank had found irregularities in the functioning of supermarkets at Mapranam, Karuvannur and Moorkkanad and in the conduct of chit funds. The committee appointed by the government had been asked to submit a report in 10 days. It is also checking whether the accused have any foreign deposits. There is a move to take a loan from Kerala Bank to pay back the depositors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-another-thrissur-coop-bank-in-loan-scam/article35574845.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy government has taken it upon itself to complete all houses. We will hold house-warming ceremonies by August next year,” the Minister added.

28 July 2021||Bengaluru/Hubballi,ANDHRA PRADESH||A man who treads middle path||Sixty-one-year-old Basavaraj Bommai, chosen by the BJP as the next Chief Minister of Karnataka, is known as a man who treads the middle path in a right-wing political outfit.  Parliamentary skills Known as a man who is not easily ruffled and has good parliamentary skills, he is known to be a troubleshooter for the BJP during the legislature stalemates as he also has cordial relationship across the political affiliations. Even during the turbulent times in the faction-ridden BJP, Mr. Bommai did not have many political detractors. Politics and administration are not new to him, as he is the son of Janata Parivar stalwart late S.R Bommai, who had served as Chief Minister of the State and also Union Minister. In fact, Mr. Basavaraj Bommai’s migration from a socialist party such as the Janata Dal (United) to the BJP in 2008 had raised many eyebrows, particularly in the wake of his father being a follower of Marxist M.N. Roy. But junior Bommai managed to assimilate into the BJP and also became its soft and progressive face. He earned the goodwill of the BJP high command for staying with it when his mentor and BJP veteran B.S. Yediyurappa left the party in 2012. But that did not spoil his relationship with Mr. Yediyurappa as he remained his trusted lieutenant when the veteran leader returned to the BJP fold and also went onto become its Chief Minister. Hailing from Hubballi, Mr. Basavaraj Bommai is one of the few prominent leaders from the region who have made it big in the State’s political landscape. Mr. Basavaraj Bommai served as political secretary to the then Chief Minister J.H. Patel in 1996-97. In 1997, he was elected to the Legislative Council for the first time from the Local Bodies Constituency (Dharwad, Haveri, and Gadag area) and then went on to retain it in 2003. He was elected as Deputy Opposition Leader of the Upper House from 2000 to 2004. He is representing Shiggaon constituency in Haveri district in the Assembly for the third time in a row after joining the BJP. An engineer by profession, he has vast administrative experience as he has held prominent portfolios such as Water Resources, Law, and Home and Parliamentary Affairs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-man-who-treads-middle-path/article35574444.ece

The police put up barricades on the main roads to prevent the entry of Mr. Veerraju into the town and personnel were deployed on the Jinnah Road and the municipal office area since Monday night. On Tuesday, BJP activists led by Mr. Veerraju staged a demonstration protesting the move to install a statue of Tipu Sultan. When the issue appeared to go out of control, police led by Deputy Superintendent of Police (Proddatur) Y. Prasada Rao took the protesters into custody to restore normalcy. ‘Unconstitutional move’ Local legislator Rachamallu Sivaprasad Reddy laid the foundation stone for the statue recently, to which the BJP raised an objection, dubbing it an ‘unconstitutional move’.

28 July 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Srisailam temple EO refutes BJP charges||Bhramarambha Mallikarjuna Swamy Devasthanam Executive Officer Karanam S. Rama Rao has refuted the allegations levelled by BJP State president Somu Veerraju on the Endowments Department and the officials managing the Srisailam temple affairs that only two persons belonging to Muslim community was conducting commercial activity in the temple complex area, saying the matter is in the Supreme Court. As per the Section 13 of the A.P. Endowments Act, only Hindus should be allowed to conduct all types of activity on temple premises, but two persons —Razak and Rafi—were having shop leases. When they were served notices to end the lease, they moved the Andhra Pradesh High Court which rejected their plea last year, the EO said. “Following the High Court order, we served notices on them and sought possession of the shops. But, they approached the Supreme Court. One hearing was held and it has been adjourned. So the Endowments Department is in no way compromising the rights of the Hindus and we are following the law in letter and spirit,” Mr. Rama Rao told The Hindu . Allegations that Muslims were removing the Siva Lingams from the Ganta Matham was also false, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/srisailam-temple-eo-refutes-bjp-charges/article35574955.ece

28 July 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Riparian row: ‘justice’ sought for drought-prone Prakasam||An all-party meeting convened by the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday adopted a resolution urging the Union Government to issue a gazette notification to include the Pula Subbaiah Veligonda project designed to draw Krishna water from the foreshore of the Srisailam reservoir as an ‘undisputed project’. “Chief Minister Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy should impress upon the Centre to issue a fresh notification in this regard as the project, taken up under ‘Jalayagnam’ by then Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy on a priority basis, was considered an ongoing project by the Bachawat Tribunal, which decided on the share of various riparian States,” CPI district secretary M.L. Narayana said while starting the discussion. The State government should note that the project had been envisaged to cater to the parched parts in Prakasam, Nellore and Kadapa districts, where people suffered due to high fluoride content in water, said TDP Ongole Lok Sabha unit secretary K. Srinivasa Rao. The district had been allotted assured water by the tribunal under the Nagarjuna Sagar Right Bank Canal (NRBC). However, uncertainty loomed large in the wake of new projects being taken up by the upper riparian States of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana, lamented All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee district convener Ch. Ranga Rao. Though the district, which was in the tail-end, was entitled up to 70 tmcft of Krishna water from the Nagarjunasagar project, the ryots had not realised fully their quota even in a year when the major reservoirs on the Krishna attained full capacity due to alleged over-utilisation of water by the upper riparian districts, alleged Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president Sripathi Prakasam. Farmers in the district coming under Addanki, Darsi and Ongole branch canals of NRBC had been missing cultivation of crops in an extent of up to two lakh acres in five decades as its formation by bringing together the most backward parts in Guntur, Nellore and Kurnool districts, complained CPI(ML) New Democracy district secretary Ch. Venkateswarlu. The future of the 72,000 acre ayacut coming under the Krishna western delta in the district had become a big question mark now allegedly due to projects designed to draw Krishna water even when the level at Srisailam was 800 feet, feared Congress farmers wing State vice-president V. Rajagopala Reddy. Poura Samajam president Narasimha Rao said ‘historic injustice’ had been meted out to the district at the time of bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh by leaving the most backward Prakasam district from the list of districts selected for provision of Bundelkhand-like special economic assistance by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/riparian-row-justice-sought-for-drought-prone-prakasam/article35574949.ece

Mr. Ambedkar said as the river was in spate, water was touching the power cables and some poles were in water. Collector Kartikeya Misra directed the APEPDCL officials to prepare plans for laying new lines by erecting towers through the forests. He asked the officials to send the proposals for laying new lines. “We are living in constant fear. Many poisonous snakes and insects and pythons are moving in the forests.

Though the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) also fielded 10 candidates, in the last minute they abstained from voting and walked out. On the other hand, the YSRCP candidates could garner 64 to 65 votes, each on an average. The polls for GVMC’s 98 wards were held in March and the YSRCP could secure 58 seats, and with the support of three independents, its tally now in the civic body stands at 61. While the TDP had won 31 seats, the Jana Sena Party and the BJP combine could win 4 and one each was won by the CPI and the CPI (M). The JSP-BJP combine and the CPI (M) boycotted the elections. Even while the election was in progress, TDP corporators and leaders staged a protest near the Gandhi Statue near GVMC office, alleging irregularities. Speaking after the thumping victory, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said that it was known fact that YSRCP corporators would win, as we have absolute majority. “We don’t understand on what ground TDP had fielded its candidates. From the voting pattern it was clear that there was some cross voting in favour of the YSRCP from the TDP bench,” he said. Senior YSRCP leader and former MP Ummareddy Venkateswarlu said that Standing Committee, which is headed by the Mayor as chairman, plays an important role in the functioning of the civic body and the GVMC would play a key role in the development of the city, once it becomes the Executive Capital.

That is why we are demanding that the date be extended till August 31, so that people can download it and study the document, before giving their suggestions and objections,” he said. Mr. Madhav also pointed out that the Master Plan was drafted without much of a field survey and checking the physical conditions. It appears like a greenfield master plan, where the existing contours, geographical features, buildings, roads and physical conditions in existence, have not been considered, he said. Pointing out a few discrepancies, Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju said that the existing road from Hanumanthawaka to beach via Visalakshminagar is around 20 metres. But in the master plan, it has been extended to 60 metres. Similarly, the existing Sampath Vinayaka Temple road is around 26 metres and in the master plan it has been shown as 45 metres. “If the existing roads are extended in such a manner, many residential and commercial complexes have to be fully or partially demolished, which is not practical. This clearly indicates that adequate field survey has not been done,” he said. Mr. Madhav pointed out that the roads in the new plan runs through layouts and even run parallel to the existing roads, which is not necessary. The MLC said out that there is no clarity in the zoning aspect and this is confusing the public. Apart from demanding an extension in the date, the BJP leaders also said that road width and designs needs a relook. “We also demand that the VMRDA should initiate a discussion with all the stakeholders and public and as well as come clear on how and to what extent the earlier Master Plan -2020 was implemented. We also demand that the VMRDA come clear on funding such an elaborate plan and how it intends to complete the project, when on one hand the State government does not have funds even to repair the potholes on the roads,” said Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju. He said that the draft plan does not give a clear picture on the compensation to be paid to those who might lose whole or part of the buildings or land. “Whether it is going to be land-to-land or cash payment against land, should be indicated. If it is land-to-land, then they should specify, where the land will be given,” said Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/extend-date-to-accept-suggestions-on-draft-plan-till-august-31-says-bjp/article35574984.ece

28 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Non-COVID services to resume at Gandhi from Aug. 3||Non-COVID services are set to resume at Gandhi Hospital from August 3. This holds significance as it is the only other State-run tertiary care health facility apart from Osmania General Hospital (OGH) where super speciality services are provided under one roof, free of charge. Orthopaedic (bones), nephrology (kidneys), gynaecology and obstetrics, paediatric (health issues of children), and several other specialist doctors provide services there. Before COVID-19 pandemic hit the State, around 1,800 to 2,000 in-patient beds used to be occupied per day at Gandhi Hospital, and 3,000 to 4,000 people used to consult doctors there on out-patient (OP) basis every day. The hospital was turned into an exclusive COVID treatment facility towards the end of March last year. With that, patients suffering from non-COVID medical complications had to opt for OGH for free super specialist services. Patients’ rush Gandhi Hospital was the only healthcare facility across the State where COVID patients were admitted until private hospitals were given the permission to attend coronavirus cases. Around 35,000 patients with mild, moderate and severe form of the infectious disease underwent treatment free of charge at the government hospital. A dedicated team of senior and junior doctors, nurses, para-medical staff, sanitation staff, and others provided COVID services. Junior doctors at the hospital staged protest in November demanding non-COVID services to be resumed since their exposure was limited and they were not getting trained in attending any other complication. Non-COVID services resumed in November third week.  When the COVID cases started to shoot up again during the deadly second wave, the tertiary care health facility was turned into a COVID-only treatment hospital around the third week of April. Nevertheless, finding a bed at the hospital was tough for several weeks. Patients used to wait in ambulances till their admission was cleared. “Around 15,000 critical COVID patients were admitted here during the second wave,” said T. Prabhakar Reddy, nodal officer at the hospital. Hospital superintendent M. Raja Rao said that all of the 1,890 beds were completely occupied during the peak of the second wave. When the coronavirus cases started declining, the number of patients with Mucormycosis saw a rise. Around 1,600 patients with Mucormycosis were admitted. Of them, over 1,100 were operated on. Now, with both COVID and Mucormycosis cases on the decline, the patient rush has come down. Around 380-400 COVID patients are at the hospital on any given day in the past one month. “We will start non-COVID services (OP, IP and emergency services) at Gandhi Hospital from August 3,” said Dr Raja Rao. The possibility of a third wave leading to surge in patient load, however, continues to play on the minds of healthcare workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/non-covid-services-to-resume-at-gandhi-from-aug-3/article35574752.ece
28 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Settle water row through talks: engineers’ body tells TS, AP||Telangana Retired Engineers’ Association (TREA) has suggested the two Telugu speaking States to work towards addressing the outstanding issues on river water sharing through dialogue till the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II (KWDT-II) award is finalised. “The conflict should be resolved with both the Chief Ministers or their representatives working out a mutually agreed framework till the matter is settled by the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal (KWDT-II) or by a new tribunal which the Telangana government has been pressing for. No opportunity should be given to the Centre to enforce the gazette from October 14,” the engineers’ body said in a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. If the matter is not settled with dialogue, the Telangana government should move the Supreme Court in time challenging the notification of July 15, president of the association G. Damodar Reddy, general secretary M. Shyam Prasad Reddy, advisors B. Anantha Ramuloo and P. Venkat Rama Rao suggested. Stating that sharing of Krishna water has long been a serious issue between Telangana and Andhra regions, they pointed out that the rationale behind formation of Telangana was to get its due share in proportion to catchment area, population, drought-prone area, cultivatable area, non-cultivatable area and others. Bachawat Tribunal (KWDT-I) had awarded en-block share of 811 tmc ft of assured water to erstwhile Andhra Pradesh – for Andhra and Telangana regions with Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar projects being the two joint storage facilities for Krishna water, the engineers’ body said. They submitted a copy of the letter to Special Chief Secretary (Irrigation) Rajat Kumar on Tuesday. Since the project-wise allocation of water and guidelines for management are not mentioned in KWDT-I and as KWDT-II is yet to give its award, sharing of Krishna river water among AP and Telangana is being carried out as per working arrangement on ad hoc ratio every year for the last seven years and needs to be revised, they observed. Further, they said that notifying the purview of Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards (KRMB and GRMB) as per Section 87 of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014, is not legally correct without the award of KWDT-II in place. They also pointed out that water is a State subject and as per the existing provisions of the Constitution, only dispute resolution on joint projects on interstate rivers falls within the purview of the Central government. “The gazette notification on the two river boards’ purview is nothing but taking over the entire water-based projects in the basin except minor irrigation of both the States. It is almost bringing water into the Central list or treating the States as Union territories,” the association observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/settle-water-row-through-talks-engineers-body-tells-ts-ap/article35574764.ece
28 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Working with RDIF to ramp up Sputnik supplies: Dr. Reddy’s||Drugmaker Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, which is the brand custodian of Russian vaccine Sputnik V in India, on Tuesday said it is working with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for ramping up the supplies. “We are also working with six contract manufacturing organisations in India for manufacturing readiness,” the company said in a statement forming part of its April-June quarter financial performance. During a virtual media interaction, CEO (API and Services) Deepak Sapra and CEO Branded Markets (India and EM) M.V.Ramana said vaccine supplies that slowed down in recent weeks amid an increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia were expected to improve in August. “Indications are that in August, we should start seeing better flow of the imported product,” Mr.Ramana said, adding COVID-19 cases in Russia were on the decline. Sputnik V made in India was likely to be available after September, he said. RDIF, which is marketing the vaccine developed by Gamaleya Research Institute globally, has partnered with Dr. Reddy’s to market and distribute the vaccine in India. Since the pilot launch in May by Dr. Reddy’s, over 2.5 lakh people have been vaccinated. The vaccine is available across 80 cities. Mr.Sapra said since Dr. Reddy’s holds the right to market the first 125 million people doses (250 million vaccine doses) in India the company would also be marketing Sputnik V to be produced by Serum Institute of India. On the single-shot Sputnik Light, which is the first dose component of Sputnik V, he said as per recommendation of an expert committee that advises the Drugs Controller General of India, the data from Phase-3 trials in Russia are going to be leveraged for seeking approval in India. Sputnik V trial for adolescents (12-18 years) is also underway in Russia. “We expect to build on the trial for doing something similar in India,” he said, adding the trial in Russia is likely to be completed by October. Digital Health foray Mr.Ramana said Dr. Reddy’s, through a subsidiary, has made a foray into digital health. “Through our initiative called SVAAS we will provide a comprehensive but simplified healthcare solution to people in managing their healthcare needs,” he said. SVAAS will bring together doctors, laboratories and diagnostics, pharmacies and insurance on a single platform for patients and pilot projects have rolled out in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. A release said Dr. Reddy’s subsidiary SVAAS Wellness and ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company are collaborating for the pilot launch of a first-of-its-kind cashless outpatient offering in India.

28 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Praveen Kumar to join BSP||Eight days after R.S. Praveen Kumar resigned from Indian Police Service, the air is being cleared on his future course of action with sources close to him indicating that he is likely to join Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). While the former top cop did not confirm or deny such reports, it is reliably learnt that Central BSP leaders were going to announce his induction into their party in the first week of August. Going by his position as former IPS officer with an outstanding service for 26 years, the BSP leaders are said to be contemplating on giving him the top post in the State apparently that of party president. Those close to him said that Mr. Praveen Kumar opined that joining any other party would eventually translate to bargain for a position. “He was gravitating towards BSP because that was close to his ideology with Dalits and Bahujans playing key roles in party operations,” they said unwilling to be identified. When the former police officer announced his resignation, it was speculated that he could be the likely candidate of ruling TRS in ensuing Huzurabad by-election following resignation of Eatala Rajender for MLA post. Those reports got shattered within a couple of days with Mr. Praveen Kumar appealing to CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao to earmark money for Dalit children to pursue studies abroad instead of announcing Rs. 10 lakh to each Dalit family in the name of ‘Dalit empowerment’. So his joining hands with TRS was ruled out. Mr. Praveen Kumar categorically distanced from all other leading political parties in the State refuting reports that he was pledging support to any candidate in Huzurabad by-election. The idea of sailing with Congress or BJP was dropped since the two parties have completely different goals while his prime goal was empowering Dalits and Bahujans and seeing them achieve political power. At the same time, Mr. Praveen Kumar’s supporters said, he was interacting with like-minded persons from all walks of life and parties. Gathering support for the empowerment of Bahujans and chalking out a path to achieve the goal was his main activity now, they said. Meanwhile, some of his close associates announced that a public meeting would be convened on August 8 at NG college ground in Nalgonda marking his political entry. They are hoping to gather at least five lakh people for the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/praveen-kumar-to-join-bsp/article35574770.ece
28 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR doubles speed on key Godavari bridge||South Central Railway (SCR) doubled the maximum permissible speed on a key Godavari bridge located between Mancherial - Peddampet section to 100 kmph on Tuesday. This is also the first time that a ballasted deck bridge of over 1 km length has been permitted to operate at such high speed in the zone, informed General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Tuesday. The stretch between Mancherial-Peddampet, covering a distance of nine km, is located in the Golden Diagonal (Grand Trunk) route of Kazipet - Balharshah section, which is a gateway of the southern region particularly from the northern region of the country. Seven minor bridges are located within this critical stretch along with one important bridge of 1.2 km length across river Godavari. This section is surrounded by several coal, cement and thermal plants with separate line for their sidings/industries leading to heavy congestion of the section. A third line had been successfully completed in the year 2018. Since then, the maximum permissible speed in the block section between Mancherial-Peddampet was 80 kmph, while the maximum speed over the Godavari bridge has been 50 kmph. To improve speeds on this major bridge, the long weld rails along the bridge, providing ‘Switch Expansion Joint (SEJ)’ on the both sides of the bridge approaches was done along with strengthening the track formation by unloading of another 120 wagons of ballast and tamping among others, he explained. Safety and quality tests were done using the Track Recording Cars (TRC) and Oscillation Monitoring System (OMS) over the bridge to ensure no defects. During the same time, temporary speed restrictions along the third line between Manchiryal to Peddampet were also attended to and the speed has been increased to 100 kmph over this section.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-doubles-speed-on-key-godavari-bridge/article35574771.ece

The Satya Dev and Priyanka Jawalkar starrer is a remake of the 2019 Kannada film Birbal : “Our film was ready for release in May and we waited till the second wave of COVID-19 subsided and the situation was conducive for theatres to reopen,” says Koneru. If not for the intense second wave, summer would have witnessed star-studded releases, including the Chiranjeevi-starrer Acharya .  Ishq , originally scheduled to release on April 23, stars Teja Sajja and Priya Prakash Varrier and is directed by S.S. Raju. Another film titled Narasimhapuram is also expected to release on July 30. The Pawan Kalyan starrer Vakeel Saab directed by Sriram Venu was the last significant theatrical release before cinema halls downed their shutters as the second wave of COVID-19 intensified. Film industry insiders state that more than 20 Telugu films have completed censor certification formalities and are waiting to release in late August and September. S S Rajamouli’s ambitious RRR starring Ram Charan and NTR is expected to release on October 13. The Telugu film industry is hoping that the third wave of COVID-19 doesn’t play spoilsport to their business plans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cinema-halls-in-telangana-and-andhra-pradesh-to-reopen-on-july-30-with-telugu-films-thimmarusu-and-ishq/article35574758.ece

Speaking to The Hindu , Ambassador of Estonia to India Katrin Kivi, who met IT Minister K T Ramarao and IT Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan on Tuesday, said that both sides went over the MoU. “We have briefly gone through the areas which are mentioned in the MoU which was signed in October 2018, and it is time to renew it now. Both sides are happy to continue and have identified three, four concrete areas which interest is even bigger, for interaction and where cooperation is of mutual benefit,” Ambassador Kivi said. Terming Estonia as a champion in cyber security, Ambassador Kivi said that the Telangana government showed an interest in learning about the country’s e-voting technology which has allowed Estonians to vote online. “In Estonia people are able to vote online since 2004-2005. During the last election, over 40% of Estonians were voting online,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/estonia-urges-telangana-to-study-their-e-voting/article35574760.ece

Sharmila demanded the government to direct the estimated 54 lakh unemployed youth in the State towards jobs, in addition to immediately launching the unemployment allowance scheme that was first proposed at the 2018 TRS poll campaign. Citing figures, she said Telangana is at the peak with regard to unemployment in the country and observed that joblessness grew by four times in the past seven years under the ruling TRS government. Sitting in the day-long hunger strike, Nirudyogula Koraku Nirahara Deeksha, at Pullemla village of Chandur in the district, as part of her weekly hunger strikes on Tuesdays, she demanded the government for release of notifications for job vacancies and measures to provide up to three lakh jobs in the private sector. Ms. Sharmila, who garnered a wide response from voluntary organisations, unions and locals, recollected the role of youth, like the sacrifice of Srikantha Chary, in the separate Telangana movement. She also met the family of Srikantha, a local youth who reportedly ended his life over delay in job notifications. Meanwhile, as the deeksha was in progress, local Congress legislator Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy called up Ms. Sharmila and expressed solidarity with her movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/unemployment-grew-by-four-times-in-ts-sharmila/article35574991.ece

Eleven policemen, including one SHO, have been sent to police lines. Five of them have been booked for abetment to suicide and other sections of the IPC. Sources said Akshay, 22, and his mother had gone to a vaccination centre in Ranchad village of Binauli police station in Baghpat on Monday morning. There, he allegedly got involved in an argument with two policemen who were stationed to manage the crowd. Police sources said Akshay wanted his mother to jump the queue and when the policemen stopped him, he slapped one of the constables, leading to a brawl. Akshay’s family membersclaim that he pointed out mismanagement at the booth and it led to the fracas. Case registered After the incident, the police registered a case against Akshay for preventing an official from doing his duty and raided his residence and ransacked the premises.

On July 23, under the leadership of BSP Rajya Sabha member Satish Chandra Mishra, the party kicked off a fresh outreach programme among the Brahmins. The BSP’s campaign started from Ayodhya with Mr. Mishra offering prayers at the makeshift Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir and Hanumangarhi temple. ‘Faith in BSP’ Ms. Mayawati said the “enthusiastic participation” in the Brahmin Sammelan was proof that the community had faith in the BSP. Her opponents had “lost sleep” due to the success of the programmes and were using various tactics to “stop” them, she added.

28 July 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra floods: death toll rises to 209, eight still missing||At least 209 people have died in floods in Maharashtra and eight still remain missing, it has been confirmed. A total of 4,34,185 people from eight districts have been evacuated to safer places, as rescue operations continue. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who is on a tour of flood-affected Sangli and Kolhapur districts, directed authorities on Tuesday to make a list of unauthorised structures on riverbeds. “No permission can be granted to any structure on the riverbed at any cost,” he told officials at a meeting held after his visit. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Pawar said a committee would be set up under retired principal secretary Eknath Patil. “The committee will study and suggest measures to remove river silt deposits. This would clear the river path and ensure a smooth flow,” he said. Commenting on the closure of National Highway 4 (Pune-Bangalore) after the road went under water, affecting the supply of milk, fuel and vegetables, Mr. Pawar said floodwater had accumulated between Shiroli and Kini toll booth. “We will be studying the level of floodwater in 2005, 2019 and 2021. Based on that, discussions will be held with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on raising the height of roads,” he said. Meanwhile, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said building canals to divert water to Maharashtra’s drought-prone areas was the best option available. “The project was discussed with the World Bank for funding during our time and it had even given in-principle approval. I think this is the only option in the long term.” Diverting run-off water would not invite any objection even from Karnataka, Mr. Fadnavis said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-floods-death-toll-rises-to-209-eight-still-missing/article35574869.ece
28 July 2021||Mumbai,||Pawar urges leaders to avoid ‘calamity tourism’||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday urged leaders and dignitaries not involved in relief and rescue work to avoid ‘calamity tourism’ by visiting flood-hit villages, as it would disturb the administration and volunteers engaged in post-disaster relief work. “Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister and guardian minister should be on the ground. Because they take stock of the situation and direct the relief work. Opposition leaders too have visited and I am sure that they have extended support to authorities. But many people who are not involved in relief work travel for no reason. This disturbs district authority and hampers ongoing work,” Mr. Pawar said at a press conference. Mr. Pawar’s statement comes on a day when Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari travelled to flood-affected Konkan region, along with suspended Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Ashish Shelar. “Perhaps, his visit would result in more funds from the Centre. But it should stop now. I appeal to those not involved in relief and rescue work not to travel to flood-hit areas,” he said. When asked about the Governor being accompanied by Mr. Shelar and not any government representative, the NCP chief said that the Governor must have chosen someone whom he trusted. He recalled the incident from 1993 when Latur district’s Killari village was ravaged by earthquake. “When the then Prime Minister P.V. Narsimha Rao decided to visit the village, I asked him not to come for 10 days. I told him that his visit would distract the administration from relief work. He agreed and did not visit,” Mr. Pawar said. Earlier, Mr. Pawar announced that relief material would be sent to the flood-affected districts in Konkan and western Maharashtra from Rashtravadi Welfare Trust. “We are sending 16,000 kits of kitchen utensils and bedsheets,” said Mr. Pawar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pawar-urges-leaders-to-avoid-calamity-tourism/article35574871.ece

Justice A.S. Gadkari directed the police to file their affidavit by July 29 in response to a petition submitted by Mr. Kundra (45) challenging his arrest in the case. Mr. Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested on July 19 by the Mumbai Police’s Crime Branch in thecase filed in February. Post-arrest, he was sent to police custody by a city court. On Tuesday, a magistrate’s court sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.

28 July 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Power restored to 6.59 lakh affected consumers in Konkan, says Minister||Energy Minister Nitin Raut on Tuesday said that electricity had been restored to 6.59 lakh of the 9.59 lakh consumers affected by torrential rain and floods in Konkan region of Maharashtra. Talking to reporters in Mahad in Raigad district, Mr. Raut said that 474 of the 479 power stations in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Pen, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara, had taken a hit and 303 of them had become operational again. “Power has been restored in 1,460 of the 1,927 affected villages,” he said. The Minister said for the first time in the 45 years of his political career, he heard of such a disastrous cloud burst in Maharashtra destroying villages which were never on the landslide-prone list. “Mahad was under 25 feet water. From electric lines to transformers to towers, everything had collapsed into the Savitri river. Energy Department officials are working on a war footing. A lot of work still needs to be done and it will be completed soon,” Mr. Raut said. The priority was to restore power at hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, he said. “Of the 40 such affected hospitals, 21 have got electricity back.” Meanwhile, Governor B.S. Koshyari, who was on a visit to Mahad on Tuesday, said the State government along with the Centre would soon rehabilitate and compensate the survivors of the landslide. “Those who are gone, nothing can be done about them. What we need to do now is for the survivors,” Mr. Koshiyari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/power-restored-to-659-lakh-affected-consumers-in-konkan-says-minister/article35574867.ece

28 July 2021||Singapore,||China’s sea claims have no basis, says U.S.||Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday that Beijing’s expansive claims in the South China Sea have “no basis in international law”, taking aim at China’s growing assertiveness in the hotly contested waters. Mr. Austin’s broadside came at the start of his first trip to Southeast Asia as U.S. Defence Secretary, as he seeks to rally allies in the region as a bulwark to China. President Joe Biden’s administration wants to reset relations with Asian countries and build alliances to face Beijing, after the turbulence and unpredictability of the Donald Trump era. Speaking in Singapore, Mr. Austin criticised China’s actions in the disputed sea, where Beijing has overlapping territorial claims with several Southeast Asian states. “Beijing’s claim to the vast majority of the South China Sea has no basis in international law,” he said in a speech hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank. “That assertion treads on the sovereignty of the states in the region,” he said, adding that the U.S. would support countries in defending their rights. China claims almost all of the resource-rich sea, through which trillions of dollars in shipping trade passes annually, with competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing has been accused of deploying a range of military hardware, including anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles there, and ignored a 2016 international tribunal decision that declared its historical claim over most of the waters to be without basis. Rising tensions Tensions have escalated in recent months between Beijing and rival claimants. Manila was angered after hundreds of Chinese boats were spotted inside the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone, while Malaysia scrambled fighter jets to intercept Chinese military aircraft that appeared off its coast. Mr. Austin said on Tuesday the U.S. “will not flinch when our interests are threatened” — but he insisted Washington does “not seek confrontation” with China. “I am committed to pursuing a constructive, stable relationship with China, including stronger crisis communications with the People’s Liberation Army.” The U.S.-China relationship has deteriorated over a range of issues from cybersecurity and tech supremacy to human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Mr. Biden has largely kept the hawkish stance on China of Mr. Trump, describing the Asian power as the pre-eminent challenge to the United States, but has lowered the temperature and instead emphasised working with allies and working at home to compete better. After Singapore, Mr. Austin will visit Vietnam and the Philippines, and will seek to underline that the U.S. is a “stabilising force” in Southeast Asia, said a senior defence official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinas-sea-claims-have-no-basis-says-us/article35574276.ece
28 July 2021||Brussels,||NATO chief urges ‘negotiated settlement’ in Afghanistan||NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday reiterated calls for a “negotiated settlement” with the Taliban in Afghanistan, admitting that the country faced a “deeply challenging” security situation as foreign troops leave. “The security situation in Afghanistan remains deeply challenging, and requires a negotiated settlement. NATO will continue to support Afghanistan, including with funding; civilian presence; and out-of-country training,” Mr. Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter after speaking to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Since early May, violence has surged as the Taliban launched a sweeping assault just days after U.S.-led NATO forces began a withdrawal which is now almost complete. Most of NATO’s 10,000-strong force have already pulled out of the country after a decision by President Joe Biden to bring Washington’s troops home after two decades. UN warning The United Nations warned on Monday that Afghanistan could see the highest number of civilian deaths in more than a decade if the Taliban’s offensives across the country are not halted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nato-chief-urges-negotiated-settlement-in-afghanistan/article35574272.ece
28 July 2021||Jerusalem,||Israeli war crimes apparent in Gaza assault, says HRW||Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused the Israeli military of carrying out attacks that “apparently amount to war crimes” during the 11-day war in May against the Hamas militant group. The human rights organisation issued its conclusions after investigating three Israeli air strikes that it said killed 62 Palestinian civilians. It said “there were no evident military targets in the vicinity” of the attacks. The report also accused Palestinian militants of apparent war crimes by launching more than 4,000 unguided rockets and mortars at Israeli population centres. Such attacks, it said, violate “the prohibition against deliberate or indiscriminate attacks against civilians”. The report, however, focused on Israeli actions during the fighting, and the group said it would issue a separate report on the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in August. “Israeli forces carried out attacks in Gaza in May that devastated entire families without any apparent military target nearby,” said Gerry Simpson, associate crisis and conflict director at HRW. He said Israel’s “consistent unwillingness to seriously investigate alleged war crimes”, coupled with Palestinian rocket fire at Israeli civilian areas, underscored the importance of an ongoing investigation into both sides by the International Criminal Court. The HRW report looked into Israeli air strikes. The most serious, on May 16, involved a series of strikes on Al-Wahda Street, a central thoroughfare in downtown Gaza City. The strikes destroyed three apartment buildings and killed a total of 44 civilians, HRW said, including 18 children and 14 women. Twenty-two of the dead were members of a single family, the al-Kawlaks. In its investigation, HRW concluded that Israel had used U.S.-made GBU-31 precision-guided bombs, and that Israel had not warned any of the residents to evacuate the area ahead of time. It also found no evidence of military targets in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israeli-war-crimes-apparent-in-gaza-assault-says-hrw/article35574394.ece

Another 31 people were injured in the incident at the Chempark complex, three of them seriously, city authorities said in a statement. All those affected worked at the site. The cause of the huge blast, which was heard several kilometres away and sent a column of black smoke into the air, was not immediately clear. Germany’s NINA warning app sent an “extreme danger” alert to residents, telling them to stay home and shut doors and windows.

More than 4,54,000 shots were administered over the past week — just over 85% of the eligible adult population of more than 5.3 lakh people — after a recent flood of foreign donations. UNICEF’s Bhutan representative, Will Parks, hailed the vaccination drive as a “great success story for Bhutan”.  The tiny nation had quickly used up most of the 5.5 lakh AstraZeneca doses donated by India in late March and early April for first jabs, before New Delhi halted exports. Faced with a growing time gap between the first and second doses, Bhutan launched an appeal for donations. Five lakh Moderna doses donated by the U.S. via Covax and another 2.5 lakh AstraZeneca shots from Denmark arrived in mid-July. More than 1.5 lakh AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Sinopharm shots are also expected to arrive in the nation of 7.7 lakh people from Croatia, Bulgaria, China and other countries. The government has meanwhile bought 2 lakh Pfizer doses that are expected to be delivered later this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bhutan-vaccinates-most-of-population-after-donations/article35574267.ece

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s make room for the river||“There are no words in the German language for this devastation... it is a surreal, eerie situation,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said when she visited the regions in Germany hardest hit by the floods which occurred as a result of heavy rains between July 12 and 15. No escape for any country A month’s rain poured in just 24 hours in the worst-affected areas of Germany and Belgium. This caused multiple rivers to burst their banks and flood parts of the two countries as well as the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. It is believed that these areas of Europe have not witnessed such heavy rainfall for more than a century. The floods showed that climate change spares none. Even if a country has adequate resources and advanced infrastructure (physical as well as organisational), it can find no escape from extreme climatic events. Reports say the death toll in Germany and Belgium has crossed 214. Hundreds more are unaccounted for, and authorities are still struggling to restore normalcy. A shocked flood victim told a reporter that he thought such disasters happened only in Asia. Heavy rainfall within a short period of time resulted in overflowing rivers, canals, and other water bodies flooding many towns and cities. The scenes of roads being washed away, houses getting inundated, and stranded people being evacuated by helicopters, earth movers and lifeboats were no different from what is normally witnessed in India during such disasters. It bore uncanny resemblance to what Kerala experienced in August 2018. Not surprisingly, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reacted to the situation in Europe. He expressed condolences and asked the Indian community in Europe to stand in solidarity with the flood victims. He also recalled with gratitude the technical assistance extended by the Netherlands to the State following the 2018 floods and the visit of the Dutch King and Queen to Kerala in 2019 when they personally reviewed the joint efforts under way for long-term flood resilience. Superior organisation, better preparedness and an advanced flood management system helped the Netherlands, with its centuries of experience in dealing with floods, to avoid casualties. But many towns were submerged. Thousands of people had to be evacuated. Floodwaters breached a dike and entered the town of Meerssen. The Dutch military, however, managed to close the breach using hundreds of sandbags. Chancellor Merkel, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other leaders were quick to attribute the cause of the floods to climate change and call for urgent action to arrest global warming. Experts say the more CO2 the world emits into the atmosphere, the warmer will be the air temperature. Warmer air holds more moisture and results in excess rainfall, which leads to flooding. Additionally, increasing temperatures at the poles result in slower movement of storms in the mid-latitudes. As a result, storms linger longer at a specific place. The combination of a slow-moving storm and the presence of surplus moisture in the atmosphere results in intense rainfall in one location within a short period of time. In 2018, Kerala, for example, witnessed 414 mm of rain in just three days between August 15 and 17. Rainfall for the period of August 1 to 19, 2018, in Kerala was 164% more than normal. Several have asked: what did the Netherlands do right in dealing with the floods and what did the others do wrong? The advanced flood warning system of Germany (which includes a network of sensors to measure river water levels in real time) did forecast heavy rains and the possibility of floods. But local authorities were unable to respond rapidly enough and communicate the warnings to the wider population. The rain and floods happened so fast that there was no time to evacuate all residents to safety and fully deploy the formidable rescue and relief infrastructure that they possessed. There are already demands that such warnings must be communicated to the general public in simple language. Rather than forecast the millimetres of rain expected, conveying specific information regarding the extent of damage to property and life would likely encourage affected communities to remain alert and respond quickly. Lessons for India The floods in Europe call attention to the global need for countries to implement ecologically sensitive flood protection measures. The Dutch have gone beyond their conventional dependence on dikes, dams, walls and gates to protect themselves from floods. Their current disaster resilience mantra is to live with water, build with nature and make room for the river. They champion creating adequate space for rivers to overflow by protecting floodplains from human interference, deepening riverbeds and creating alternate channels for excess water. After two major floods in 1993 and 1995, the Dutch embarked on several projects to widen riverbanks and reshape the areas around rivers. The floods in Europe serve as a wake-up call to us in India to adopt pragmatic policies and practices that are nature friendly. We must recognise that we will have to learn to live with water in the long term. Flood-prone areas should be identified, and projects initiated on an urgent basis to create room for rivers. Low-risk areas such as playgrounds, maidans, or agricultural fields should be earmarked to store excess rainwater. Drains must be built for diverting water into these storage units. This will relieve the stress on the existing drainage infrastructure. The stored water can later be discharged back into the drainage channel once the high water subsides. The United Nations Development Programme-World Bank-European Union Post Disaster Needs Assessment report prepared for Kerala after the 2018 floods pointed out that the drainage capacity of the rivers and canals of the State must be increased by creating more room for the water to flow. It called for removing obstructions and encroachments from existing water channels, the proper maintenance of such channels and creating additional channels for water to flow. In the short term, strengthened disaster readiness, planning and preparation will help us deal with sudden, intense rain and consequent floods. Climate change and global warming will continue to cause extreme climatic events. Across the world, countries are being confronted with situations of either too little or too much water and droughts interspersed with floods. Rainfall has become unpredictable. While national and State disaster management authorities have grown in experience, competence and professionalism, there is need for a higher degree of coordination and preparation across all levels of government. Practice drills need to be conducted in flood-prone areas. We need to test the effectiveness of flood warnings. The warnings should be in local languages and in simple terms. Today, many are wondering how they can learn from the Dutch experience in preparing for floods and dealing with their aftermath. But the Dutch themselves are wisely not permitting themselves any complacence. Conscious of their vulnerability to water, they maintain a spirit of eternal vigilance to floods. Reflecting this approach, the Dutch Prime Minister has exhorted his countrymen to learn from the recent disaster and see what more can be done rather than stay satisfied that major damage and loss of lives was prevented.

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Needed, a more unified Asian voice for Afghanistan||As the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) end their presence in Afghanistan and set off a churn in the neighbourhood, Central Asia is emerging as a key player that the global Troika of the United States, Russia and China are turning to. Three meetings this month, of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) contact group on Afghanistan and SCO Defence Ministers in Tajikistan, and the Central and South Asia conference on regional connectivity in Uzbekistan, are turning the spotlight on the region’s role in dealing with the situation in Afghanistan, and how India could build on that. Factoring in the Taliban Put plainly, events of the past few years, and the decisions of the Troika have kept India out of a leading role in Afghanistan. Since 2019, the Troika has met with Pakistan (Troika plus) in order to discuss Afghanistan’s future, one in which the Taliban — with which New Delhi has had no ties — gains an important if not controlling role in Kabul. The same powers that invaded Afghanistan post 9/11, and declared the Taliban leadership as United Nations Security Council-designated terrorists, are now not only advocating talks with the Taliban, entreating their Pakistani hosts of the past two decades to help, but actively paving the way for the Taliban’s return to power. India’s efforts to build on trade with Afghanistan, shore up development projects and increase educational and training opportunities for Afghan youth have been appreciated, but these cannot grow bigger due to a number of factors. New Delhi’s original hesitation in opening talks with the Taliban, which even Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani had suggested, has cut India out of the current reconciliation process. The end of any formal dialogue between India and Pakistan since 2016 and trade since 2019, have resulted in Pakistan blocking India’s over-land access to Afghanistan. India’s alternative route through Chabahar, though operational, cannot be viable or cost-effective also long as U.S. sanctions on Iran are in place. India’s boycott of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017, and now tensions at the Line of Actual Control after the Chinese aggression in 2020, make another route to Afghanistan off-limits. Meanwhile, the U.S. has announced a new, surprise formation of a “Quad” on regional connectivity — U.S.-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan that does not include India, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting trial runs of truck convoys from Tashkent to Karachi and back. With so many doors slamming shut, the hope is that the Central Asian window, with the “Stans” (as the five Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are sometimes referred to) will open new possibilities, but here too, there are some caveats. Uzbekistan’s view To begin with, it is clear that Tashkent (Uzbekistan) sees the rise of the Taliban in a different light from New Delhi. After a whirlwind round of negotiations in his own region since coming to power in 2016, where he mended relations and ended border disputes with each of the other Central Asian States, and outreaches to the U.S. and China to shift the traditional tilt towards Moscow, Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has made purposeful moves on Afghanistan. In 2018, his government became one of the first countries to publicly invite a Taliban delegation from Doha, Qatar to visit, while at the same time he has promoted a number of ambitious trade and connectivity initiatives with the Ashraf Ghani government. A push for connectivity Speaking at the Central and South Asia conference in July, Mr. Mirziyoyev spelt out his plans for a modern version of the “the ancient northern trade route known as the Uttara Patha, connecting the Indo-Ganges Plain with the southern territories of the Eurasian continent through the historical cities of Takshila, Gandhara and Termez.” He spoke of the old Silk Routes that once bound Central and South Asia together, and called Afghanistan the key link in “practical connectivity” for them. Significantly, while he mentioned the salience of the Termez-Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar railroad, the Trans-Afghan railroad to connect to China’s BRI, and the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) via the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas as key elements of the “architecture of connectivity”, he did not mention the Chabahar route that India has espoused. The Uzbekistan-Pakistan memorandum of understanding on Transit Trade — or the Agreement between Uzbekistan and Pakistan on Transit Trade (AUPTT) — was also signed the same day, which would give Uzbekistan access to the Pakistani seaports of Gwadar and Karachi, rather than Iranian ports. Uzbekistan’s calculations, and by extension, those of its other Central Asian neighbours, are three-fold: the first is that prosperity for these land-locked countries can only flow from access through Afghanistan to the closest ocean, i.e. the Indian Ocean. Second, that all transit through Afghanistan depends on guarantees of safe passage from the Taliban, backed by the group’s mentors in Pakistan. Third, each of the “Stans” are now a part of China’s BRI, and tying their connectivity initiatives with Beijing’s will bring the double promise of investment and some modicum of control over Pakistan. Shared concerns Given the odds, New Delhi’s room for manoeuvre with these five countries on Afghanistan appears limited but not without hope. To begin with, India and the Central Asian States share common concerns about an Afghanistan overrun by the Taliban and under Pakistan’s thumb: the worries of battles at their borders, safe havens for jihadist terror groups inside Afghanistan and the spill-over of radicalism into their own countries. It is necessary for India to work with them, and other neighbours to shore up finances for the government in Kabul, particularly to ensure that the government structure does not collapse. It is only a matter of time before the COVID-19-weary international economies tire of funding Afghanistan, as the last donors conference in Geneva (November 2020) showed. As part of the SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), India must also step up its engagement with the Central Asian countries on fighting terror. While the Narendra Modi government has made it clear it will not send Indian boots to the ground in Afghanistan, it can support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) where it needs it most: in terms of air power. India’s previous gift of a few helicopters is far from adequate, given commitments made as Afghanistan’s first Strategic Partner 10 years ago, and there must be more that New Delhi can support, especially in conjunction with other countries that depend on Soviet-made arms, including helicopters and planes, weaponry, ammunition and spare parts. Dealing with Pakistan Finally, South Asia must learn from Central Asia’s recent example in knitting together this region more tightly, a task that can only be completed with better ties between India and Pakistan. New Delhi’s furtive discussions with the Taliban leadership in Doha make little sense unless a less tactical and more strategic engagement with Pakistan is also envisaged. Most importantly, countries of Central Asia and South Asia need to find a more unified voice, as they have in recent weeks. Afghanistan’s future will affect both regions much more than it will the distant global powers that currently dominate the debate. Travelling to Kazakhstan in 2015, Prime Minister Modi spoke of why the Silk Road that connected the two regions faded away. “The end of the Silk Road did not just come about from the rise of sea-based trade of the new European powers,” he said, “It also happened because Central Asia was no longer a bridge between regions, but the new fault line between great empires to the east, west and south.” Ensuring a similar rupture is not wrought in Afghanistan is essential, which today has the potential to become that bridge or the biggest boulder between Central and South Asia. suhasini.h@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/needed-a-more-unified-asian-voice-for-afghanistan/article35574256.ece
28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Weighing down the private unaided college teacher||The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every sector in the economy in India and across the globe as well. Relatively, the education sector has managed to maintain its revenue. Both schools and colleges have transitioned to the online education mode to serve their students. Under the pretext of providing online education, most private institutions have managed to collect fees in full. Survey and findings Though the revenue of private educational institutions has not taken a huge hit, the same cannot be said about the livelihoods of teachers in private unaided colleges. During the novel coronavirus pandemic, layoffs and pay cuts have forced several private-unaided college teachers to take up odd jobs to provide for their families. The example of an assistant professor in Tamil Nadu who suffered a pay cut in a private-unaided college following the pandemic and who died while climbing a palm tree — he had taken to cutting the leaves of palm trees to make a living — pushed us to survey private-unaided college teachers and to understand the impact of the pandemic on their working and living conditions. We surveyed 194 teachers working in private-unaided colleges that are affiliated with the University of Madras, Chennai. The survey was conducted between June 13 and June 26, 2021. The findings show that even before the pandemic, private-unaided college teachers received below-par salaries and many did not enjoy any social security benefits. Among 194 respondents, 137 fulfilled the University Grants Commission (UGC) qualifying criteria (has PhD or National Eligibility Test or State Eligibility Test) to be an assistant professor; 72% of these qualified teachers received less than Rs. 25,000 per month and 5.1% received less than Rs. 10,000 per month, while according to the Seventh Pay Commission entry-level consolidated monthly salary for an assistant professor is Rs. 76,809. In our survey, we found that only 38% and 42% had Employee State Insurance and paid leave, respectively. This deplorable condition of private-unaided college teachers can be attributed to the absence of any State regulation of private higher educational institutions, including on matters relating to the working conditions of teachers and other employees. Following neoliberal policies, the Indian state has withdrawn from providing higher education. This has resulted in the enormous growth of private higher educational institutions. According to the All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), 2020 report, at all India level, 65% of the total colleges are private unaided colleges. Tamil Nadu, which is one of the few States that privatised higher education in the early 1980s, has 77% private unaided colleges. This shows the dominance of profit-maximising private-unaided colleges in higher education. Online education as burden It is against this background that we must understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihood of private-unaided college teachers. Private-unaided college teachers have made every effort to provide service to students in the online mode. In our survey, 88% of the respondents noted one or more of the following as the reason(s) for the difficulty they faced in online teaching — lack of Internet, lack of room/space, and lack of quality equipment. Further, every respondent had to incur an expenditure to purchase Internet service. Of the 194 teachers surveyed, 132 had to incur an expenditure to purchase one or more of the following items: a phone, computer, headphones. And, 107 respondents reported experiencing high emotional distress during this period linked to online teaching work. All these show that these teachers had to physically, emotionally, and monetarily exert themselves to provide online education during this pandemic. Despite this valorising effort by private-unaided college teachers, they have not been rewarded by their management. Instead, they have been punished with severe pay cuts during the pandemic. The survey data revealed that through the first half of 2020-21, less than a third of teachers received the full salary they were entitled to. Sadly, 10% of our respondents did not receive any salary during April to June 2020. As colleges have transitioned to online mode, one can argue that the operational costs of these colleges must have declined drastically. Further, it is a well-known fact that private colleges have collected fees from students. Therefore, there is no justification for reducing the salary of teachers during this pandemic. Private-unaided colleges have used the pandemic as an excuse to rob teachers who have worked hard to teach under very difficult conditions, incurring considerable monetary expenses and experiencing much stress during this period. Making ends meet The arbitrary pay cuts have forced several of our respondents to work in additional jobs and/or borrow money from informal sources to survive. These jobs were mostly manual informal jobs such as construction work, farm labour, mechanic work, food delivery, etc. While the pandemic may have worsened the livelihood conditions of private-unaided college teachers, their working conditions were deplorable even in ‘normal’ times because of the complete absence of regulations by the State in this regard. The Government of Tamil Nadu should consider taking some immediate measures in this regard. Some of these are: pay complete arrears salary to private-unaided college teachers that have been siphoned off by the management; reinstate teachers laid off without any cause; reimburse the expenditure incurred by teachers for online teaching during the pandemic. In 2018, Kerala fixed Rs. 1,750 per day and Rs. 43,750 per month as a standard salary for lecturers with UGC qualification and Rs. 1,600 per day and Rs. 40,000 per month for lecturers without UGC qualification in unaided private colleges. The Tamil Nadu government may consider implementing something along these lines. Further, the Tamil Nadu Private Colleges (Regulation) Act 1976 needs to be reviewed and amended to equip monitoring agencies such as the Directorate of Collegiate Education and the Regional Joint Directorate of Collegiate Education to safeguard the welfare of teachers and non-teaching staff in unaided private colleges.

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Dalits’ fist of fury||Portraying a Dalit character as the protagonist is a significant development in Tamil cinema. Dalits are now shown as courageous men performing fantastic heroic deeds. In Kabali , the Dalit is the leader of Malaysian migrants. In Kaala , he is the good-hearted mafia don who challenges the authority of the ruling class in Mumbai. In Asuran , he is an angry man who uses violence to protect his family against feudal lords. In Karnan, he is a village rebel who kills a police inspector in a revengeful act of justice. These are violent stories about Dalits’ social struggles, aspirations and quest for justice. In these films, the Dalit characters emerge as the equal claimants of popular heroic virtues. A beautiful metaphor In Pa Ranjith’s Sarpatta Parambarai, the hero Kabilan (Arya) stands distinct from earlier Dalit protagonists. We see Kabilan first as a part of an audience at a boxing game. Then from an underdog boxer he overcomes social obstacles to become the ultimate champion of the game. The film thus escapes the typical social burden of the Dalit hero and shows Kabilan as a young sportsperson who plays the game with dedication and grit. Kabilan does not use violence for revenge. Instead, the competitive game of boxing emerges as a beautiful metaphor to represent social conflicts, clan pride and personal passions. Kabilan is not a revenge-hungry young man but a committed disciple of his clan’s boxing coach Rangan (Pasupathy) and enters the ring only to protect the dignity of his people. Though the violence in the boxing ring showcases raw masculinity, it is utilised only to suggest that even ghettoised people can enter into any game and emerge victorious. Kabilan’s punches demonstrate that human spirit and passion cannot be imprisoned by any class or community. The new Dalit hero as an aggressive man is different from the stereotypical representations of him as brutalised. However, these new films only change the social location of the conventional hero; they don’t radically alter the idea of the popular hero. The Dalit hero appears as an improvised version of the mainstream hero as he is also depicted as a tormented man. Though these characters often play under the shadows of Dalit symbols like B.R. Ambedkar’s photograph or Buddha’s statue, we are yet to see an authentic portrayal of a Dalit protagonist who can represent Ambedkarite cultural aesthetics and Dalits’ political vision on screen. The recent portrayals supplement the populist attributes of Tamil cinema and stand agnostic to Ambedkar’s political principles and social ethics. After the Russian revolution, while many western educated elites were influenced by Marxist political ideology and wanted to test socialist ideas in Indian conditions, Ambedkar showed only a passive appreciation towards it. He appreciated the socialist, transformative agenda to address class inequality; however, he disassociated himself from the advocates of revolutionary or anarchic violence against the state or the dominant elites. He understood that the Dalits were the most powerless among the Hindus and any violent challenge to the ruling classes would only invite further alienation, subjugation and brutal repression. More than imagining a violent conflict between the Dalits and upper caste Hindus, Ambedkar wanted to build a democratic dialogue to achieve a better conception of the modern state and civil society. His primary task was to bring an enlightened consciousness amongst the Dalits so that they can cherish their rights as citizens and claim various entitlements. Ambedkar’s greater goal was not to eliminate the social elites or defeat them in physical battles but to introduce the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity in society. The Dalit social and political assertion must be peaceful, ethical, and engaged with the principles of social justice. In the post-Ambedkar period, Kanshi Ram used constitutional and democratic apparatuses to mobilise the Dalit-Bahujan people for bringing about political change. However, such powerful figures and their movements are yet to find respectable presence on the silver screen. Instead, the recent Dalit protagonists we see are of macho males furiously fighting evil caste supremacy. Ambedkar’s political ideas stand distinct from the violent masculinity that has been idealised in Indian cinema’s action genre. The emerging Dalit’s heroic avatar too appears as a tacit mimicry of the masculine male fantasy that mainstream Tamil cinema has produced all these years. While there are Dalit characters in cinema now, most portrayals endorse the dominant cultural narrative that celebrates hedonistic aspirations, militant violence and male superiority. The emerging Dalit cinematic genre can do better if it also challenges the populist narrative structure and liberates cinema from its patriarchal gaze. Sarpatta Parambarai is not an ideal addition here but it is a promising move towards breaking the Dalit hero’s fantasy for violence and revenge. Harish S.

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Needed: an anti-trafficking law||Sita was 13 years old when she was trafficked. Her parents worked in a tea garden in Assam for meagre wages. She was trafficked to a placement agency in New Delhi, and bought for about Rs. 20,000 as a domestic worker by a couple. Sita was not paid a single rupee. Instead, she was re-trafficked, raped, and exploited by employers and traffickers. Sita’s father and I found the young girl trapped in a house in Delhi three years later. But she did not step out when we found her. She hid behind a wall, crying. “I cannot show my face to my father. I am impure now. I want to kill myself,” she said. This is the reality of thousands of women and children from the poorest sections of our society. No nation can call itself civilised if it tolerates the buying and selling of its daughters. Of what meaning is the wealth, power or progress of a nation if its children are traded as though in medieval slave trade, at a lower price than cattle? A comprehensive Bill Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) and various civil society groups have campaigned for decades for a strong law to end this menace of human trafficking. In 2017, Sita and thousands of survivors like her marched in the Bharat Yatra alongside students, governments, the judiciary, multifaith leaders, businesses and civil society to demand for such a law. We covered 12,000 km with over 1.2 million people on foot with the single demand that India must pass a comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation. The passionate chants of these brave hearts who survived trafficking still reverberate in my ears, “ Bikne ko taiyaar nahi hum, lutne ko taiyaar nahi hum (We are not ready to be sold, we are not ready to be stolen)”. The Government of India has proposed the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021. This Bill aims to tackle all aspects of trafficking including the social and economic causes of the crime, punishment to traffickers, and the protection and rehabilitation of survivors. This is achievable if the Bill has the necessary checks and balances against potential misuse of power by agencies, periodic reviews of the law, and adequate allocation of resources for effective implementation. The government must include these crucial provisions in the Bill and facilitate its smooth passage in the current session of Parliament. A problem worsened by COVID COVID-19 has further intensified the need for the law. Traffickers are taking advantage of prolonged school closures and loss of family livelihood. BBA with government agencies has rescued almost 9,000 children from trafficking since the first lockdown. In comparison, about half this number of children were rescued during the same time period of 14 months preceding the pandemic. The gravity of the situation cannot be undermined. We will not recover from the effects of the pandemic without the wherewithal to address its human impact, which comes with this law and its associated budgets. Human trafficking is a crime in itself, but it is also the propeller of several other crimes. It creates a parallel black economy which fuels child labour, child marriage, prostitution, bonded labour, forced beggary, drug-related crimes, corruption, terrorism and other illicit businesses. The architects of our Constitution established the severity of the crime of trafficking by making it the only offence punishable under the Constitution of India itself, besides untouchability. A strong anti-trafficking law is the moral and constitutional responsibility of our elected leaders, and a necessary step towards nation-building and economic progress. It is non-negotiable for the realisation of an India that our Constitution-makers envisioned, our freedom fighters struggled for, our soldiers die for, and our children deserve. India is stepping into its 75th year of Independence. There can be no greater gift to India than the freedom of our children. I call on Parliament to urgently pass a strong anti-trafficking law.

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Dangerous conflagration||Following a dangerous and avoidable escalation of an otherwise dormant border dispute, five policemen and a civilian from Assam were killed in the Mizo border town of Vairengte in clashes between police from the State and their counterparts in Mizoram, on Monday. The sequence of events, beginning October 2020, suggests that what began as skirmishes between residents close to the disputed border between Assam’s Cachar and Mizoram’s Kolasib districts has snowballed into a violent confrontation between police and residents. The events point to a failure of the constitutional machinery, empowered to de-escalate tensions at the border. The presence of central paramilitary forces should have helped maintain the peace, but it is curiously not the case. Besides, Assam and Mizoram are governed by the BJP and its ally, the Mizo National Front, respectively, and are part of North-East Democratic Alliance, of which the Assam Chief Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, is a founder-convenor. The political bonhomie should have allowed the respective Chief Ministers to tamp down border tensions and to return to the status quo through joint fact-finding teams, involving the administrative officials in maintaining the peace over the border issue. Instead, both Chief Ministers have been exchanging allegations on Twitter, seeking the intervention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and using videos to tell a story that suited their version of the events — a farcical means of communication. This also occurred just days after both Chief Ministers (along with others) met with Mr. Shah to discuss the resolution of inter-State border disputes. The unfortunate loss of lives has led to hardened stances, with Mr. Sarma announcing that Assam would deploy “4,000 commandos to guard its border”, even as Mizoram’s Chief Minister Zoramthanga has maintained that the casualties followed from the Assam police’s actions. Sectarian tribalism has been the bane of the North-eastern States, with underdevelopment acting as a catalyst in complicating knotty issues over land and other issues in the region. There is no sure-shot and quick solution possible to the border disputes between various States without a spirit of give and take and a civic engagement brokered by the Union government. But for that to happen, governments should, first, not condone violence of any kind and restrain partisans engaging in such activity in their respective States. A resort to one-upmanship will only prolong the disputes and harden stances. The Home Ministry must ensure that the Assam-Mizoram border situation is first subject to de-escalation and steps taken to return to the status quo that prevailed before the skirmishes began in October 2020 with the cooperation of the respective States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dangerous-conflagration/article35574250.ece
28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Crisis in Tunis||Tunisian President Kais Saied’s decision to sack the Prime Minister and suspend Parliament, amid widespread anti-government protests, has triggered the worst political crisis in the country since the Arab Spring protests. Among the countries affected by the Arab street protests, Tunisia was the only one that managed to successfully transition from dictatorship to parliamentary democracy. But the North African country’s elected rulers never managed to ease its economic woes, or offer stable governance. Tunisia has had nine governments since 2011, with its crisis-hit economy being battered further by the COVID-19 outbreak — last year, its GDP contracted by 8.8% in real terms. The trigger now is the government’s poor handling of the pandemic. The country of 11.8 million has recorded nearly 18,000 COVID-related deaths so far — one of the highest per capita death rates in the world. Only 7% of the population are fully vaccinated. Last week, the government’s move to speed up vaccination by opening it for all above 18 years ended in stampedes and violent incidents. Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi sacked the Health Minister, but public anger refused to subside. On July 25, Tunisia’s Republic Day, protests broke out and the offices of the ruling party, Ennahda, stormed. This allowed the President to sack the government. President Saied says he stepped in to “save the state”. But in a country where the wounds of decades-long dictatorship are yet to heal, his move to dissolve an elected government would raise concerns rather than comfort. Both the President and Parliament are popularly elected. Mr. Mechichi had the backing of Ennahda, the largest party in the suspended Parliament. President Saied, who is an independent, has had a testy relationship with Ennahda and the Prime Minister. While the Mechichi government has clearly failed in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, the President’s move to dissolve Parliament appears more a power grab than a genuine attempt to address the country’s problems. Ennahda and at least two other parties have accused Mr. Saied of orchestrating a coup. If they resort to protests, it would pitch the parties that control Parliament against the President, deepening political instability. The 2014 Constitution has called for a constitutional court to settle crises like these, but the court has not been formed yet. Under the Constitution, the President oversees only the military and foreign affairs, while the Prime Minister is in charge of the day-to-day affairs of governance. So to avoid a constitutional crisis, the President will have to appoint a Prime Minister, who should win the confidence of the Assembly of the People’s Representatives. Mr. Saied should act within his constitutional limits, recall Parliament and allow the formation of a legitimate government, which could take steps to address Tunisia’s economic and health-care woes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/crisis-in-tunis/article35574251.ece
28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Apollo-15 and Moon landing||The Apollo-15 Astronauts successfully fired their main spacecraft engine for one second in a special test to-night [Space Centre, Houston, July 27] clearing the way for a lunar landing attempt on Friday. There is a short circuit somewhere in the engine’s electrical system. If the engine had not fired, astronauts David Scott, James Irwin and Alfred Worden would have abandoned the landing goal and conducted an alternate lunar orbit scientific mission. Mission Commander David Scott sounded jubilant and relieved. Mission Control said the test proved that the trouble with the engine system was only something “which might be a little annoying.” Slightly more than half-an-hour before the firing, Apollo-15 passed the half-way point of its outward journey, when it was 209,354 km. from both earth and moon. Experts at Mission Control will need time to evaluate the engine burn. But Flight Director Glynn Lunney said earlier to-day that if the power plant fired as planned, the astronauts would press on with the landing. Astronauts Scott and Irwin are to land at the base of the Apennine mountains, the tallest on the moon, to search for clues to the birth of the solar system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/apollo-15-and-moon-landing/article35574260.ece
28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Panel raps govt. over MSMEs, urges larger economic package||A Parliamentary panel has pulled up the government for offering inadequate relief measures for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that were worst-affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It mooted fresh measures to help them stay afloat, including a doubling of the 90-day limit for banks to classify their loan dues as problematic. Offering loans and long-term measures — as the government had done over the past year — instead of improving the cash flow to generate demand as immediate relief, have put small enterprises in a grim situation, the panel said in its report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday. The second COVID-19 wave this year ‘even more vigorously ripped the economy, particularly the MSME sector’ just as it was recovering from the initial lockdowns of 2020, the panel said. “The Committee, therefore, recommends that the Government should immediately come out with a larger economic package aimed at bolstering demand, investment, exports and employment generation to help the economy, including MSMEs to recover from the pandemic fallout,” said the report of the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Industry. Chaired by TRS member of parliament K. Keshava Rao, the committee’s report sought a detailed study of the actual losses suffered by small enterprises since the onset of the pandemic, noting that no such intensive assessment had been done by the MSME Ministry. Arguing that most policies were formulated keeping medium and large enterprises in mind, the panel said the position should be ‘contrary’ with a focus on micro and small enterprises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/panel-raps-govt-over-msmes-urges-larger-economic-package/article35574241.ece

The arbitration ruling required one of DRL’s subsidiaries to pay $46.25 million (Rs. 340.1 crore) to Hatchtech Pty Limited. “As the company was carrying $20 million (Rs. 147.1 crore) as provision towards this litigation, an additional expense of $26.25 million (Rs. 193 crore)... was recognised during the three months ended June 30,” the company said. Shares of DRL tumbled 10.4% to close at Rs. 4,844.35 on the BSE after the company also said it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month asking for documents pertaining to certain CIS geographies over a complaint pertaining to alleged corrupt practices in Ukraine. A U.S. law firm is probing the matter at the instruction of a committee of DRL’s board.

28 July 2021||COIMBATORE,||Cotton prices rise, textile trade seeks zero duty||With cotton prices rising, the textile industry has sought removal of 10% import duty on the produce. Southern India Mills’ Association (SIMA) chairman Ashwin Chandran said in a press release that the increase of Rs. 3,800 a candy of cotton over the past 15 days by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and the 10% import duty on cotton were affecting the entire textile value chain. It had made textile exports ‘expensive’ in the global market, he said. Though the CCI offered three months’ lock-in for bulk purchase, textile mills could not benefit due to a liquidity crunch and uncertainty in cotton prices, he said. The import duty has encouraged price speculation, he claimed. For some varieties, prices of Indian cotton had exceeded the international price. Pradeep Kumar Agarwal, CMD, CCI, said international cotton prices and MCX prices had risen by Rs. 7,500 and Rs. 6,000 a candy, respectively, in the last one-and-a-half months. But, he pointed out, CCI had raised prices by Rs. 2,200 to Rs. 2,500 a candy for the same period, except for 1-2 varieties where it is higher. In the last one month, 40% of the cotton sold by CCI were purchased by textile mills directly.

Total income almost tripled to Rs. 3,170 crore. Passenger ticket revenue and ancillary revenue surged fourfold to Rs. 2,297 crore and Rs. 668 crore, respectively. Total expenses climbed 59.2% to Rs. 6,344 crore. “Fuel was a negative driver as, year-over-year, fuel price has doubled,” said CEO Ronojoy Dutta. “The second large factor was the severe impact that the COVID-19 second wave had on revenues in the quarter.” He highlighted the second wave impact by pointing out the dip in monthly revenue. The figures came to Rs. 1,540 crore in April, Rs. 670 crore in May and Rs. 960 crore in June.

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Gritty Dean springs a huge surprise||The form book took another beating as little-known Briton Tom Dean won the men’s 200m freestyle gold in Tokyo on Tuesday. The 21-year-old mechanical engineering student, who represented his country in the 200m individual medley at the 2019 World Championships in Gwangju, showed no sign of nerves as he rallied to win in 1:44.22s. Dean's teammate Duncan Scott and Lithuanian Danas Rapsys were the favourites for the race.  Dean, who had contracted the coronavirus twice last year, made his move in the final lap. Scott ensured a 1-2 for Britain with a late rally. This is the first time since London 1908 that Great Britain has won two medals in the same event. Scott, who took the silver in 1:44.26s, pushed Brazilian Fernando Scheffer (1:44.66s) to the third spot. Russian Evgeny Rylov, with a strong finish, claimed the men’s 100m backstroke title with a new European record of 51.98s. Rylov had won the silver at Rio 2016. The 24-year-old was placed second behind teammate Kliment Kolesnikov in the initial stages of the two-lapper before surging ahead. Kolesnikov made it a 1-2 for Russia, finishing in 52s flat. American Ryan Murphy was a distant third in 52.19s. Australia’s Kaylee McKeown, making her Olympic debut, powered to victory in the women’s 100m backstroke, clocking 57.47s, a new Games record. The 20-year-old, who finished fifth in Gwangju, was lying third before moving to the top. No flash in the pan McKeown proved that her world-record effort of 57.45s at the Australian trials was no flash in the pan. McKeown was expected to be given a tough fight by Canadian Kylie Masse and American Regan Smith. However, Masse took the silver in 57.72s and Smith the bronze at 58.05s. The United States grabbed the other gold of the day, as another Games debutant, the precocious Lydia Jacoby shocked South African Tatjana Schoenmaker, and defending champion and world record-holder Lilly King in the women’s 100m breaststroke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gritty-dean-springs-a-huge-surprise/article35574514.ece
28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Impressive Lovlina battles past Nadine||Two-time World Championships bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain produced an impressive performance to beat accomplished German boxer Nadine Apetz 3-2 in a keenly contested women’s 69kg pre-quarterfinal bout of the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday. After Mary Kom, Lovlina became the second Indian boxer to register a win in Tokyo. The 23-year-old, who received a first round bye, will meet third seed Nien-Chin Chen of Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals on Friday. Having done her homework well, Lovlina — who had secured her first Worlds bronze medal alongside Nadine in Delhi in 2018 — used her long reach to land punches against the strong German, who used her left jabs to good effect in the opening round. The Indian, however, took the first round with a split 3-2 verdict.  Anticipating that Nadine, also a double Worlds bronze medallist and a two-time European bronze medallist, would step up her attack, Lovlina preferred to stay safe and come up with a punch or two. The German fought well but could not execute her plans against the tactically superior Indian. Unable to catch up After claiming the first two rounds by identical 3-2 margins, Lovlina continued to throw punches from a distance even as Nadine tried in vain to catch up with her taller rival. Lovlina, who had lost to Nien-Chin in the 2018 World Championships semifinals, needs to win her last-eight bout against the former World champion in order to ensure an Olympic medal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/impressive-lovlina-battles-past-nadine/article35574467.ece
28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The Hundred: early days yet||Questions might be asked about the need for yet another format in cricket, its fourth, but The Hundred in England has been about Jemimah Rodrigues so far. With two quite incredible knocks, 92 from 43 balls and 60 from 41, she guided Northern Superchargers to victories. Clearly this is one Indian who loves the format. But the questions remain. Does lopping off 20 deliveries, giving bowlers 10 deliveries per stint (or five; there are no ‘overs’) and a 25-ball PowerPlay make The Hundred a) all that different b) easier to understand or c) more likely to bring in a new set of fans who can’t watch sport without music, colourful graphics and strategic timeouts? More importantly, will the new fans come in at the cost of the existing ones, thus merely retaining the numbers if not actually reducing them?  Wisden said when the idea was mooted that “The Hundred hung over the English game suspended only by the conviction of a suited few…” Feeling left behind The England and Wales Cricket Board which probably felt left behind by the IPL and Australia’s Big Bash League, appears keen to give the world its own home-grown franchise cricket. I can’t see a World Cup for The Hundred happening anytime soon; to be honest, there shouldn’t be one anyway. As at least one writer has pointed out, the complaint is not that it is unlike anything before, but that it is virtually indistinguishable from what we already have. The decimalisation of cricket (100 balls, change of ends after 10 balls, a bowler’s limit of a maximum of 20 balls) can be carried too far. Will the 22 yards be changed into 20 metres (21.87 yards), the 30-yard circle into 25 metres (27.34 yards) and so on pointlessly? Perhaps even a 10-member team rather than 11, to round things off. Somehow it is difficult to believe that what is keeping England’s youth from the game is the want of a decimal system. Artificial respiration Cricket-lovers in India have always found it hard to believe that the game needs artificial respiration. When the 40-over and then 60-over formats were introduced to bring the crowds back into the grounds in England, Indians didn’t see the need for such gimmicks here. When the first World Cup was held in 1975, India participated like a team under protest. This wasn’t the cricket they knew; in any case, crowds were not an issue in India which then had packed houses for Ranji and Duleep games. Likewise with T20. One cricket board official was quoted as saying, “We will never play Twenty20 cricket.” It was a sentiment reflected across the country then. What changed everything were the World Cup victories, the 50-over in 1983, and T20 in 2007, followed by the IPL. The Hundred is only a few games old, but gimmicks aside, doesn’t look different from its 120-ball cousin. Cricket has made the mistake before of changing its essential nature and then throwing huge amounts of money at the new product rather than strengthening what exists already. The message administrators thus send out is: No, we don’t believe in the game either.  The new audience — the reason underlying the change — is setting itself up for bewilderment at any other cricket match. After all that 10-or-5 balls stuff, they will then be exposed to the regular six-ball over and wonder where they (or the umpires) have gone wrong. Short-format cricket at least had the advantage, perhaps the decency even, of ensuring the game looked and felt the same. The Hundred may or may not work as a domestic tournament and if it does, England might be tempted to push for it to be accepted at the international level. It might be tactically more complex, especially for the fielding captain. And you can wear jeans in the Lord’s pavilion which must count as a major innovation. It is proving noteworthy in one area, however, and that’s in women’s cricket. Women aren’t paid the same amounts as the men, but they play their matches first followed by the men’s. Live television has already given someone like Jemimah Rodrigues a wider audience, and the teams the exposure they continue to need. Huge TV audience The opening match, between Oval Invincibles and Manchester Originals drew the largest television audience for women’s cricket in the UK. Many have compared Rodrigues’s debut innings with Brendon McCullum’s 158 that gave the IPL its stamp of acceptance. We should resist the temptation to over-interpret. Is this cricket’s future? Is this the best format for the Olympics or will some bright suit figure out that a 10-over tournament would be ideal? Thanks to the television deals with both BBC and Sky, is The Hundred too big to fail? Most importantly, will it be England cricket’s saviour or ruin? Right now there are more questions than answers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-hundred-early-days-yet/article35574504.ece
28 July 2021||Tokyo,||India gets its act together||Dragflicker Rupinder Pal Singh scored a brace as India cruised past Spain 3-0 for its second win in men’s hockey at the Tokyo Olympics here on Tuesday. Drubbed 7-1 by Australia in its last match, India produced a spirited performance against World No. 9 Spain and scored through Simranjeet Singh (14th minute) and Rupinder Pal Singh (15th and 51st). India, ranked fourth in the world, had earlier defeated New Zealand 3-2. Spain, on the other hand, is yet to register a win. The Indians will play reigning Olympic champion Argentina on Thursday. Spain steadily got into the groove and secured its first penalty corner in the 12th minute, but wasted the chance. In the 15th minute, the Spain defence was caught off-guard by Amit Rohidas’ pass and an unmarked Simranjeet just tapped the ball in. Rohidas was playing in his 100th match for India. The goal rejuvenated the Indians, as they secured three back-to-back penalty corners in the final minute of the first quarter. In the third set-piece, Harmanpreet’s flick found the body of a defender, resulting in a penalty stroke. Rupinder stepped up and made no mistake in doubling India’s lead. He was on target once again in the 51st minute, scoring off a penalty corner.  P.R. Sreejesh, who had a nightmarish outing against Australia, had a brilliant game, pulling off some fine saves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-gets-its-act-together/article35574471.ece
28 July 2021||BENGALURU,||Paartalu, Bengaluru FC appear to be on a collision course||Midfielder Erik Paartalu and Bengaluru FC appear to be on a collision course after the Australian stopped short of accusing his employer of denying him a chance to train, ahead of the AFC Cup playoff clash against Club Eagles FC on August 15 in Maldives. On Tuesday, Paartalu, a BFC midfield mainstay for the past four years and a contracted player until the end of the 2021-22 season, endorsed on Twitter a statement issued by Professional Footballers Australia — the body representing the interests of Australian football players — that called for his “reinstatement”.  “Erik remains a contracted player of Bengaluru FC. Disappointingly, the club is excluding him from training and ignoring his repeated requests for arrangements to be made for his return. “Accordingly, any suggestion that Erik has simply not reported for training, or that he is purposefully absent, is incorrect. The club has been reminded that it is Erik’s fundamental right as a professional footballer that he be given access to training,” the statement read. No comments BFC refused to comment on the issue. It is worth noting that the AFC Cup playoff was called off in May after reports had emerged of a breach of COVID-19 protocols by BFC squad members in Male. A photo in a Channel News Maldives report had shown Paartalu and two other BFC members outdoors. BFC owner Parth Jindal had apologised for the “inexcusable behavior of three of our foreign players/ staff while in Male” and had promised to take “strictest action” against the offenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/paartalu-bengaluru-fc-appear-to-be-on-a-collision-course/article35574506.ece

While the duo of Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Bhaker made it to the mixed 10m air pistol second qualification round, none of the three other teams got past the first hurdle. The teenage duo was in dazzling form in the first qualification round, topping the standings with a score of 582, studded with 26 inner 10s. Saurabh shot 98, 100 and 98, while Manu registered 97, 94 and 95. However, in the second qualification round, Saurabh shot 96 and 98 but Manu managed only 92 and 94. The two finished seventh with a score of 380 while China’s Ranxin Jiang and Wei Pang led the pack with 387. The Chinese beat the ROC team of Vitalina Batsarashkina and Artem Chernousov 16-14 in the final. The second Indian pair of Abhishek Verma and Yashaswini Deswal finished 17th in the first qualification round. India’s challenge in the mixed 10m air rifle ended tamely as both pairs were not even close to qualification. Elavenil Valarivan and Divyansh Singh Panwar totalled 625.6 to be placed 12th, while Deepak Kumar and Anjum Moudgil shot 623.6 to finish 18th.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/saurabh-manu-pair-loses-the-plot-after-a-bright-start/article35574473.ece

Long, the second seed here, is one of the greatest paddlers in the modern era, having won three consecutive World Championships and the singles gold in Rio 2016. Raising his level Even against a rusty Long, Sharath had to raise his level to be competitive. The Indian, choosing to play close to the table, managed just that, his top-spin returns from both flanks and flicks while returning the side-spin serves unsettling Long. After losing the first game, Sharath opened up an 8-4 lead. Long closed it down to 8-7, forcing India coach Soumyadeep Roy to call for a time-out. The next point witnessed the longest rally of the match, with Long levelling scores after a 12-shot exchange. However, Sharath produced three consecutive winners to make it 1-1. With either player unable to open up a sizeable gap in the third game, Sharath saved two game-points at 8-10 to take it into an extended tie-break. After Sharath came up with two successive backhand top-spins on his serve, at 12-11, Long took a time-out, broke Sharath’s rhythm and sealed the game. Though the next two games saw Long run away with it, the 39-year-old Sharath had every reason to be pleased with his performance.

28 July 2021||COLOMBO,||Krunal tests positive, second T20I postponed to Wednesday||The second T20 International between India and Sri Lanka on Tuesday was postponed by a day after Krunal Pandya tested positive for COVID-19. “The second T20I between Sri Lanka and India originally scheduled to be played on July 27 has been pushed forward by a day and will now take place on Wednesday, July 28,” said BCCI secretary Jay Shah in a media statement. “Following the Rapid Antigen Tests conducted ahead of the match on Tuesday morning, Krunal Pandya was found to be positive. The Medical Teams have identified eight members as close contacts,” the release added. The release also said the entire contingent underwent a RT-PCR test to ascertain any further outbreak in the squad. The match was to be played at the R. Premadasa Stadium here. Now there will be back-to-back matches on Wednesday and Thursday. India won the first T20I and it is quite baffling as to how Krunal, who has been a part of the strict bio-bubble for the past one month, contracted the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/krunal-tests-positive-second-t20i-postponed-to-wednesday/article35574509.ece
28 July 2021||London,||Noble gesture by Hamilton||Seven times Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton made a personal pledge of £20 million on Tuesday as he launched a new foundation, Mission 44, supporting under-represented young people in Great Britain. The money will support organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education through partnerships, collaborations, grant giving and advocacy, a statement said. The Mercedes driver’s brand partners and sponsors will also be contributing. Create real change “Mission 44 represents my commitment to create real change within this community,” said the Briton, who could celebrate a record-extending 100th career win at this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix. “In my early life, I experienced first-hand how coming from an under represented background can affect your future but, luckily for me, I was able to overcome those odds through opportunity and support. I want to ensure that other young people from similar backgrounds are able to do the same,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/noble-gesture-by-lewis-hamilton/article35574652.ece

Ferreira overcame a broken board in the first wave to outclass Kano Igarashi of Japan 15.14-6.60 in the men’s final. Moore defeated South African Bianca Buitendag 14.93-8.46 to take the gold in the women’s section. Good scores Igarashi, who had upset favourite K. Andino of the USA in the quarterfinals, struggled while Ferreira notched up good scores to take an early lead in the final. Owen Wright (Australia) overcame World No. 1 Gabriel Medina 11.97-11.77 to bag the bronze. Bianca Buitendag, who did well to beat seven-time World champion Stephaine Gilmore in the quarterfinals and prodigy Caroline Marks in the semifinals, finally met her match in Moore. The American established an early lead that Buitendag could not bridge.

28 July 2021||Chennai,||Dragons best Warriors by five wickets||Skipper C. Hari Nishaanth’s 38 (26b, 6x4) at the start and a late attack from R.S. Mokit Hariharan (41 n.o., 26b, 4x4, 1x6) helped Dindigul Dragons beat Ruby Trichy Warriors by five wickets in the TNPL at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium here on Tuesday. Strong start Chasing 146 for victory, opener Hari gave a strong start with some delightful off-side strokes. The left-hander started with a couple of boundaries through point off medium-pacer Sunil Sam before attacking left-arm spinners Rahil Shah and M. Mathivannan. Dragons were cruising at 66/0 after eight overs before openers S. Arun and Hari Nishaanth were dismissed in quick succession. Warriors managed to wrest the momentum back with some tight overs with no boundaries conceded for more than six overs. Mokit then broke the shackles as he took on Rahil in the latter’s final over hitting the Warrirors skipper for a six and four. With 32 needed off the last four overs, Mokit managed to find three boundaries off medium-pacer P. Saravana Kumar — two of them a bit lucky thanks to a misfield and an outside edge — which swung the game decisively towards Dragons. Earlier, asked to bat first, Warriors managed to meander to 145/5 thanks to Nidhish Rajgopal’s 45. On a pitch that had some assistance for the bowlers and against some skilful medium-pace bowling from L. Vignesh and R. Suthesh, the openers Sumant Jain and Amit Sathvik struggled to force the scoring in the PowerPlay with just 36 coming in that phase. Stringing a partnership Later, Nidhish and Mohammed Adnan Khan (26) strung together a 65-run partnership for the third wicket. The left-handed Nidhish started with a six off left-arm spinner M. Silambarsan before hitting Vivek Raj for a boundary and six to give some momentum to his side. However, once Adnan was dismissed off the first ball of the 16th over, the Warriors struggled to get the final flourish with just 38 coming off the last five overs. Gujrapneet was impressive, conceding just 11 in his last two overs and taking the wicket of Nidhish.  The scores:   Ruby Trichy Warriors 145/5 in 20 overs (Nidhish Rajagopal 45, Muhammed Adnan Khan 26, Gurjapneet Singh 2/24) lost to Dindigul Dragons 149/5 in 19.2 overs (R.S. Mokit Hariharan 41 n.o., C. Hari Nishaanth 38, M. Poiyamozhi 2/24, Rahil Shah 2/25).

28 July 2021||TOKYO,||Russian women end USA’s reign; Biles withdrawn||Russia’s women gymnastics team capitalised on the dramatic departure of Simone Biles from the USA team to win the team title on Tuesday. The US team withdrew Biles from the final after a disappointing opening vault and Russia went on to beat the champion from the last two Games and emulate the men’s team which had won 24 hours earlier. Competing under a neutral banner due to their country’s doping suspension, Russia was ending a sequence of domination by the US women in World and Olympic finals stretching back to 2011. USA Gymnastics said Biles was withdrawn because of an unspecified “medical issue” and would be assessed daily to determine whether she can continue in the Games.

28 July 2021||Bridgetown,||Aussie bowlers engineer ODI series win||Australia’s bowling attack dominated the West Indies batting line-up on way to a series-clinching six-wicket victory in the decisive final fixture of the three-match ODI series here on Monday. Opener Evin Lewis played a lone hand with an unbeaten 55 as the tourists bundled out the home side for 152 off 45.1 overs batting first with Mitchell Starc leading the rout with figures of three for 43. Fellow new-ball bowler Josh Hazlewood was at his most miserly in claiming two for 18 while the trio of spinners Adam Zampa, Ashton Agar and Ashton Turner combined for the other five wickets. Matthew Wade’s unbeaten 51 (52b, 2x6, 5x4) led Australia to the target with almost 20 overs to spare.   The scores: West Indies 152 in 45.1 overs (Evin Lewis 55 n.o.; Mitchell Starc 3/43) lost to Australia 153/4 in 30.3 overs (Alex Carey 35, Mitchell Marsh 29, Matthew Wade 51 n.o.).

28 July 2021||MUMBAI,||TTFI to consider action against Manika Batra||Annoyed by Manika Batra’s “outburst” against national coach Soumyadeep Roy, the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) secretary-general Arun Banerjee said that the Executive Committee will decide, during its next meeting, on whether to take action against Manika. “It is grossly unfair on her to go after the national coach. Yes, Sutirtha (Mukherjee) trains at his academy but Soumyadeep has been appointed national coach,” Banerjee told The Hindu from Tokyo on Wednesday. No personal coach On Tuesday, after exiting the women’s singles in round of 32, Manika, in an interview to The Hindu , had expressed disappointment over not being allowed her personal coach to be in her corner for singles matches. “Our national coach here (Soumyadeep Roy) is Sutirtha’s personal coach, so it helped her. I think if my personal coach could also sit for my matches, it would have helped a lot,” Manika had said. Banerjee, however, said Manika knew even before arriving in Tokyo that it was impossible for her coach Sanmay Paranjape to be in the arena for her matches. “Even before we left, she knew that her coach had ‘P’ category accreditation, which means he had access only for practice facilities,” Banerjee said. “I don’t understand the need to go after Soumyadeep. I will put forward the Team Leader’s (M.P. Singh) report to the Executive Committee and it will decide the future course of action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ttfi-to-decide-on-action-against-manika-batra/article35574515.ece
28 July 2021||TOKYO,||Period of ransom is over: NRAI president||National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president Raninder Singh said everything “humanly possible” was done to prepare the shooting team for the Tokyo Olympics, admitting that he has been perplexed by the performance of the shooters so far. Raninder said the “period of ransom is over” and he would take a closer look at the role of the coaches after the Games. About the alleged conflict between coach Jaspal Rana and Manu Bhaker, he said the two had worked together and achieved fabulous results in the last few years. No accreditation While many Indian coaches were sent to Tokyo, Jaspal was not given accreditation. Raninder conceded that Jaspal’s presence would have helped Manu in Tokyo. Despite efforts to resolve the discord, the situation was beyond repair, especially with Manu’s family expressing reservations. The NRAI president revealed that he had to bring in Ronak Pandit to guide Manu as he was good in both the 10m and 25m events.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/period-of-ransom-is-over-nrai-president/article35574464.ece

What broke the hearts of the Indians was the three-game upset of the top-seeded Indonesian pair of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamkuljo by the third-seeded Chinese Taipei duo of Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin. Since Satwik and Chirag had beaten Yang and Chi-lin, they must have been hoping that the Indonesians would win the last match. However, it was Yang and Chi-lin who posted a 21-18, 15-21, 21-17 victory over Gideon and Sukamuljo. The result left the pairs from Indonesia, Chinese Taipei and India tied with a 2-1 record.

With a combined ranking of 153 going into the Olympics, the Indian duo needed a miracle, and it duly fell short of the ranking cut-off for an event which saw a team with a combined ranking of 49 qualify in 16th place. World No. 1s Novak Djokovic and Ashleigh Barty will target gold in mixed doubles. Djokovic will partner Nina Stojanovic while Barty will pair up with John Peers. Osaka crashes out In singles, Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka’s dreams of a home Olympic gold were crushed by a 1-6, 4-6 loss to Marketa Vondrousova on Tuesday. “I definitely feel like there was a lot of pressure for this. I think it’s maybe because I haven’t played in the Olympics before and for the first year (it) was a bit much,” said Osaka. After looking assured in the first two rounds after her eight-week hiatus, Osaka made a dreadful start under the centre court roof at a rain-hit Ariake Tennis Park and never recovered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sania-nagal-duo-fails-to-make-draw/article35574475.ece

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Rama’s truthfulness||Rama’s sterling qualities drew the whole of Ayodhya to Him. His auspicious qualities attracted not only His subjects, but also Azhvars and Acharyas, said Akkarakkani Srinidhi, in a discourse. Nampillai, for instance, would quote extensively from the Ramayana while giving philosophical explanations. Nampillai’s discourses were well attended, while those of Naduvil Thiruveedhi Pillai Bhattar also known as Vagvijaya bhattar were not. This was not relished by Vagvijaya bhattar. One day Vagvijaya bhattar went to the king’s court to obtain the gifts the king gave to learned men. The king would usually ask a question and if satisfied with the answer, he would give the scholar a gift. He asked Vagvijaya bhattar the following question: “Rama Himself declared that He was a mortal. Yet He said Jatayu would attain moksha. How could a mortal grant moksha to anyone?” Vagvijaya bhattar did not know how to answer the question, for both the king’s observations were true. Rama had indeed said that He was a mortal, and He had also given moksha to Jatayu. So what was the answer? Vagvijaya bhattar turned to a disciple of Nampillai for help, and asked him how Nampillai would have answered the question. The sishya said, “Rama never once uttered an untruth. When such a person says something, the truthfulness of the person will ensure that whatever he says comes true. So Rama’s truthfulness would have been enough to give moksha to Jatayu.” Vagvijaya bhattar gave this reply to the king and he was honoured by the king with gifts. He took the gifts to Nampillai and said they rightfully belonged to him, for it was his disciple’s answer which had pleased the king. From that day onwards, Vagvijaya bhattar became an ardent devotee of Nampillai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/ramas-truthfulness/article35574427.ece

28 July 2021||July 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Munk, the reigning Alchemist||Wearing a black Acne Studios T-shirt, chef Rasmus Munk is at ease in one of the many conceptual dining rooms in the three-storey space that makes up the Alchemist. The Copenhagen-based restaurant is part dining, part sensory, part social commentary, and wholly unique. As restrictions ease and people make their way back to restaurants, tables here are booked for months ahead (reservations for August to October sold out within 10 minutes). Small wonder, since it’s added another feather to its two-star Michelin status. Alchemist was recently crowned number one on OAD’s (Opinionated About Dining, a relatively new restaurant ranking that uses votes from globe-trotting guests to rank the best eateries) list of top dining experiences in Europe. There’s a lot that sets it apart from other fine dining pilgrimages in the city. For one, it’s housed in the former set-building workshop of the Royal Danish Ballet. For another, each meal is made up of 50 impressions (their name for the courses). And finally there’s Munk’s propensity to make diners ponder social and political issues of the day, from child labour to global warming, over artfully crafted dishes. “In the last couple of years, chefs have had a big voice in our society. It’s important to use that well, to bring awareness to something that’s important to discuss,” he says, adding, “I think Alchemist is this trial, where we use food as a communication tool and talk about something that is important, besides just the ingredients.”  Pushing the comfort factor  This means projecting visuals on a planetarium-like dome of plastic bags floating among jellyfish. And experimenting with produce and methods that have not been used before — one of the innovations had him working with cows’ Achilles tendons and lambs’ lungs, which are usually discarded. There’s a course served inside the skull of a lamb, and one that demands guests to suck on a pair of silicone udders. Munk calls his food “holistic cuisine” — a Nordic manifest like the one popularised by the other Copenhagen legend, chef René Redzepi’s Noma, but “with layers on top of it”. “It takes elements from the science world, from theatre, from all other kinds of cultural institutions to create a multi-sensory dining experience.” He prides himself in creating “food for thought” and spaces that provide the perfect setting for it. For example, last year he created the Rainbow Room after he read an article that said that 80% of LGBTQI+ couples felt uncomfortable holding hands in public because of potential public disapproval. Dancers in LED outfits lead guests into the neon hall, and after the meal, the last impression is a dessert shaped like a seahorse, the gender-swapping fish.  The Danish Indophile  Munk, who at 30 is an India neophyte, still speaks of travelling to the country when he “was not that old, not in chef training too long”. While there, he remembers trying a pani puri. He later recreated it on his menu with a porcini mushroom dough filled with smoke and topped with oyster, kale and caviar. “When you bite into it, the smoke escapes as an aroma. The smoke is of different spices and thyme, so you have the texture of the pani puri , very crispy and delicate, and you have the aroma and the spices,” he explains. He was to visit India last summer, but the pandemic delayed his plans. “I’ve been studying a lot in Japan over the last few years. 2020 should have been the year I visited India and discovered it with a chef’s mind and eyes,” he says. It would have been interesting to see what four weeks in the country would have inspired him to create. Meanwhile, Munk shares that after not operating for more than a year and a half because of the coronavirus, he is excited for the future. “I think we have only scratched the surface of what holistic cuisine and this restaurant can be,” says the chef, who wants his guests to experience a shift in consciousness after dining at the Alchemist. And to do this, he promises to continue to “collaborate with different kinds of people — from theatre, movies, even psychologists and magicians”. A meal is approx Rs. 29,300 per person.

28 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Capital sees highest amount of rainfall in July since 2003||Heavy rain lashed the Capital on Tuesday causing waterlogging in several areas which further led to traffic snarls. Safdarjung, the official weather station of the Capital received 100 mm of rain in just three hours before 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday after which it received 1.8 mm of rain. Other weather stations like Palam received 68 mm before 8.30 a.m. and 59.4 during the day. With Tuesday’s rainfall, the Capital has recorded 381 mm rainfall so far this month which is the highest in July since 2003, according to figures shared by the MeT Department. It is also the heaviest spell of rain recorded in a day since 2013 when Delhi received 123.4 mm rainfall on July 21. The rain led to a fall in the maximum temperature which settled five degrees below normal at 29.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum settled at 25 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. Over 200 complaints The Public Works Department (PWD) was flooded with almost 200 waterlogging complaints. According to the department, over 11 complaints were received by the PWD control room every hour, totalling to as many as 188 complaints being received from across the city between 1.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. on Tuesday. A senior PWD official said Pul Prahladpur underpass was among the affected areas in addition to MB Road, Saket, Sher Shah Suri Marg and Bindapur DDA flats. Delhi Police Commissioner Balaji Srivastav directed the senior traffic police officers to ensure proper management after traffic congestion was witnessed neat Parliament. Traffic also had to be diverted after a road caved in at Rafi Marg. The Delhi police took to Twitter asking commuters to avoid certain routes. Mr. Srivastav through his official Twitter handle tweeted, “Daily heavy traffic jam enroute to Parliament near Rail Bhavan. Needs attention at senior levels of DTP @dtptraffic and proper traffic management.” Bus breakdown A senior traffic officer, however, cited the ongoing construction work and a breakdown of a DTC bus at Red Cross Road on Tuesday morning, as the reason for the traffic jam in the area. The officer said that a deep sewer work is being carried out at Red Cross Road. Half of the road is blocked and only the other half of the stretch is available for vehicular traffic. Delhi Metro trains did not stop at Saket metro station for a few hours as the area outside the metro station was flooded and passengers could not enter or exit the station conveniently. Mathura Road, Moti Bagh, Vikas Marg, Ring Road, Rohtak Road, Sangam Vihar and Kirari, were among other places to witness waterlogging. Traffic crawled at ITO, underneath Moti Bagh metro station, Dhaula Kuan underpass, near Pragati Maidan, Mathura Road, Vikas Marg, Ring Road near IP Flyover and Rohtak Road. To decongest the roundabout at Rail Bhawan, the traffic police said they had already diverted buses approaching the road but traffic could not be diverted completely because MPs also travel on the same road to reach Parliament Gate no. 2. The forecast for July 28 reads “generally cloudy sky with moderate rain/thundershowers”. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to settle between 28 and 25 degrees respectively. Monsoon arrived late in the Capital on July 16 missing its normal date of arrival on June 27 but has led to the wettest July with 14 rain days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/capital-sees-highest-amount-of-rainfall-in-july-since-2003/article35574640.ece

28 July 2021||New Delhi,||Khalid cannot claim parity with other accused in riot case, police tell court||Delhi Police on Tuesday informed a local court here that former JNU student Umar Khalid, arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots, cannot claim parity with other accused such as Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha, who were recently released on regular bail. Mr. Khalid was arrested on September 13, 2020 in north-east Delhi riots case being investigated by Special Cell where charges under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act had been invoked. In response to Mr. Khalid’s bail application, Delhi Police said that the Supreme Court while hearing the appeal filed by it against the judgments granting bail to Kalita, Narwal and Tanha, has clarified that these judgments “shall not be treated as a precedent and may not be relied upon by any of the parties in any of the proceedings”. “So, these judgments cannot be cited and relied upon by the applicant or accused [Mr. Khalid] in the instant case,” Delhi Police said. Hearing on August 7 Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat adjourned the hearing of bail application for August 7 on the request of his lawyer, who received the prosecution’s reply earlier during the morning. Delhi Police, in its reply, also said that the present case pertains to a “larger conspiracy”. “In total 21 accused have been arrested in the case till date, out of which chargesheet of 18 accused has been filed including the present applicant [Mr. Khalid],” the reply said. It said further investigation is on. “The application filed by the applicant has no merits as would be revealed and demonstrated before this court by reference to the chargesheet filed before this court... The prosecution would demonstrate the “prima facie” case against the applicant by reference to and relying upon the chargesheet filed before this court,” Delhi Police said. The HC while granting bail to Tanha, Narwal, and Kalita in the UAPA case, said the State blurred the line between the right to protest and terrorist activity in anxiety to suppress dissent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/khalid-cannot-claim-parity-with-other-accused-in-riots-case-police-tell-court/article35574635.ece
28 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘Hold 5 sittings in upcoming session’||The Delhi BJP Legislative Party on Tuesday met Speaker Ram Niwas Goyal and demanded that the Monsoon session, beginning on July 29, should have a minimum of five sittings instead of the scheduled two. This, the BJP argued, was required so that the MLAs could raise important issues of citizens. Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said BJP MLAs had given notices for discussions under Rule 55 on important issues. “Delhi is currently faced with a severe water crisis, the government schools are faced with a massive shortage of teachers, old-age pension is not being distributed for some strange reason, we are facing a breakdown situation in the public transport system,” Mr. Bidhuri said. “All these issues are very important and need urgent attention and we requested the Speaker to allow discussions on such issues. We feel that all this cannot be taken up and discussed in a two-day session and therefore requested the Speaker to at least have five sittings during the Monsoon session,” he also said. The other BJP MLAs and members of the legislative party present included Vijender Gupta, Mohan Singh Bisht, Om Prakash Sharma, Jitender Mahajan, Anil Bajpai, Ajay Mahavar and Abhay Verma. Mr. Bidhuri said they raised the issue of BJP MLAs not being given permission or their notices not being accepted for discussion on important issues. “It is strange that on whatever issue the BJP wants to take up discussions in the House, those notices get rejected. This Vidhan Sabha is a forum used by the ruling AAP to either condemn the Centre or the three civic bodies just to promote its selfish interests. I have also written a letter to the Speaker on these important matters,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hold-5-sittings-in-upcoming-session/article35574630.ece
