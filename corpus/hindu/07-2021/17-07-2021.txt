17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.P. can’t proceed with Kanwar Yatra amid pandemic, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday disagreed with the Uttar Pradesh government’s proposal to conduct a “symbolic” Kanwar Yatra amid the pandemic for “compelling religious reasons”, saying the fundamental rights of citizens across faiths and their right to life trumped religious sentiments. A Bench of Justices Rohinton F. Nariman and B.R. Gavai gave the State time till July 19 to rethink its proposal and file an affidavit. If it did not change its plans, Justice Nariman said, the court “will deliver whatever we have to deliver”. “We are of the prima facie view that this is a matter that concerns everyone of us as citizens of India and goes to the very heart of Article 21 [right to life], which has the pride of place in the Fundamental Rights Chapter of the Indian Constitution. Health of the citizenry of India and the right to life are paramount. All other sentiments, albeit religious, are subservient to this basic fundamental right,” Justice Nariman dictated in the order. The hearing began with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitting that the “State must not permit movement”. An affidavit was filed by the Centre “late” in the Supreme Court. After speed-reading the affidavit, Justice Nariman announced peremptorily, “State of Uttar Pradesh cannot go on with this, 100%”. The Bench refused to permit a “physical yatra”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uttar-pradesh-cannot-go-ahead-with-kanwar-yatra-says-sc/article35376158.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rising cases in Maharashtra, Kerala a cause of worry: PM||The increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Kerala and Maharashtra was a cause of grave worry, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday while interacting with the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala. He pointed out that in the past week, 80% cases as well as 84% COVID-19 deaths came from the States present in the meeting. He cautioned that similar trends were seen in January-February before the second wave. “The States where cases are rising, we have to take proactive measures to prevent the possibility of a third wave,’’ he said. Mr. Modi underlined experts’ view that if cases kept rising for a long time, chances of mutation of the coronavirus would also increase and dangers of new variants would also rise. “Therefore, we need to continue with the strategy of Test, Track, Treat and Teeka [vaccination] while putting special focus on micro-containment zones. The districts with large numbers should be focused on,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rising-cases-in-maharashtra-kerala-a-cause-of-worry-pm/article35376156.ece
17 July 2021||New Delhi,||Bail orders will be sent instantly to jail authorities: SC||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Friday said people given bail by courts, even by the Supreme Court, have to wait for days before prison authorities release them. “It is just too much,” he said. The Chief Justice, heading a Special Bench, voiced the Supreme Court’s exasperation at prison authorities who insist on receiving by hand the “authentic” hard copy of the bail order regardless of the fact that the personal liberty of people suffers. “In this age of information and communication technology, we are still looking at the skies for the pigeons to communicate the orders,” Chief Justice Ramana remarked orally. So, as a solution, the Chief Justice, flanked by Justices L. Nageswara Rao and A.S. Bopanna, announced in open court the rolling out of a new scheme called ‘FASTER’ or ‘Fast and Secure Transmission of Electronic Records’ by which the Supreme Court would instantly, directly, securely and electronically transmit bail and other orders to jail authorities, district courts and High Courts. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal appreciated the court’s initiative. Net connectivity When Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said orders anyway were uploaded on the court website, Justice Rao said “the idea behind the scheme is to transmit orders securely”. The Bench asked State governments to file their reports about the Internet connectivity in their jails to prevent technical glitches in future. The Secretary General of the Supreme Court was directed to submit a comprehensive report formulating the scheme within two weeks. The hearing was based on a suo motu case, ‘In Re: Delay in release of convicts after grant of bail’, registered on the initiative of Chief Justice Ramana to confront the problem which affects the liberty and dignity of prisoners. Recently, 13 prisoners in Agra Jail, who suffered imprisonment for up to two decades despite the Juvenile Justice Board declaring them ‘juveniles’ at the time of commission of their crimes, were granted bail by the Supreme Court on July 8, but were released by the prison authorities after a delay of four days. Again, Pinjra Tod activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha walked out of Tihar Jail nearly two days after the Delhi High Court granted them bail. The Supreme Court has made concerted moves in the recent months to de-congest prisons amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, a Bench led by Chief Justice Ramana had ordered the police to limit arrests during the pandemic to prevent over-crowding in jails and urged courts to not order detention in a mechanical manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bail-orders-will-be-sent-instantly-to-jail-authorities-sc/article35376654.ece

17 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC: jabs for children without clinical trials will be a disaster||The Delhi High Court on Friday said it would be a “disaster” if COVID-19 vaccines are administered without clinical trials to children, while asking the Centre to take steps to inoculate those below 18 years of age once the trials are over. “Let the trials be done. Otherwise, it would be a disaster if vaccines are administered without trials, that too, in case of children... Once trials are over, you quickly apply to children. The whole country is waiting,” a bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said. During the hearing, the Centre said clinical trials for the vaccines for children under 18 years of age are going on and are on the verge of completion. The Centre said children will be vaccinated when experts give permission. The High Court was hearing a petition filed on behalf of a minor which sought directions for the immediate vaccination of those in the 12-17 age group. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila which is developing DNA vaccines has concluded its clinical trial for those between the age group of 12 to 18 years and subject to statutory permission, the same may be available in the near future for children of that age group. The Centre said vaccination is the top most priority of the government and all efforts are being made to achieve an objective of 100% vaccination in the shortest time possible keeping the available resources in mind and availability of vaccine doses into consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-jabs-for-children-without-clinical-trials-will-be-a-disaster/article35376191.ece
17 July 2021||TASHKENT,||Over 10,000 jihadis crossed in from Pak.: Afghan President||Pakistan has not severed its relationship with terror groups, said Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani in a pointed charge at the neighbouring country as Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan sat a few feet away on stage at the Central and South Asia connectivity conference held here on Friday. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who also attended the conference, referred to the problems with transit trade in his speech alluding to Pakistan. He said economic development and prosperity go “hand in hand” with peace and security. In a hard-hitting speech, Mr. Ghani said more than 10,000 ‘jihadi’ fighters have entered Afghanistan in the last month, according to intelligence reports, while the Pakistan government had failed to convince the Taliban to participate “seriously” in the peace talks. “Contrary to repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his Generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force will use its power and influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organisations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of the assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and state,” Mr. Ghani said at the inaugural ceremony. Responding to the charges a few minutes later, Mr. Khan said he was “disappointed” by the allegation that Pakistan had a “negative role” in the conflict. “President Ghani, the country that is going to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan. Pakistan suffered 70,000 casualties in the last 15 years. The last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict,” Mr. Khan said, addressing the Afghan President directly. “I can assure you that no country has tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan. We have taken all action short of taking military action, and every effort to bring them to the dialogue table and have a peaceful settlement there, and to blame Pakistan for what is going on in Afghanistan is extremely unfair,” he added. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Khan spoke as another spat broke out between Kabul and Islamabad over allegations by Afghanistan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh that the Pakistan military had threatened missile launches against the Afghan Air Force if it targeted Taliban militia that has claimed border checkposts at Spin Boldak. In a statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry denied the claim. It said Pakistan acknowledged Afghanistan’s sovereignty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/10000-jihadis-have-crossed-in-from-pak/article35376162.ece
17 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Centre notifies jurisdiction of Krishna, Godavari river boards||The Central government took a major step towards facilitating an amicable settlement of the river water disputes between Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) and Telangana by issuing a gazette notification on Friday stipulating the jurisdictions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) as per the AP Reorganization Act of 2014. The notification will come into effect on October 14. It is expected to refrain A.P. and Telangana from taking actions that would further heighten the tension prevailing over the alleged unilateral drawal of water by Telangana from the Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala projects for power generation over the last few weeks in a manner that purportedly harmed the interests of farmers in A.P. The KRMB and GRMB are mandated to regulate the supply of water and power generated from the projects or components thereof having regard to the awards made by the Krishna and Godavari Water Disputes Tribunals, agreements entered into or arrangements made by the then existing State of A.P. with any other State or Union territory and any other agreements that may be made by the co-basin States. On and from the date of commencement of this notification, in respect of operational projects or from the date when a non-operational project becomes operational as the case may be, A.P. and Telangana have to completely hand over the jurisdiction of the projects on the Krishna and Godavari rivers and their components to the respective boards. CISF security for projects The two Telugu States have been directed to deposit within 60 days from the date of publication of this notification a one-time seed money of Rs. 200 crore each into the bank accounts of both KRMB and GRMB to enable them to discharge their functions effectively. The most important aspect of the notification is the authorisation of the Central Industrial Security Force to assist the boards in the day-to-day management of the specified projects and other works related to security assigned by the boards on such terms and conditions as laid down by the Central government. The notification brings 35 projects in the Krishna basin and 71 in the Godavari basin under the boards’ purview empowering them to operate the headworks of barrages, dams, reservoirs, regulating structures, canals, transmission lines and power houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-notifies-jurisdiction-of-krishna-godavari-river-management-boards/article35376141.ece

17 July 2021||Chennai/ Chandigarh,||Chandigarh bucks ‘excess deaths’ trend||Similar to the trend in Kerala, the total number of deaths registered by the Civil Registration System (CRS) in the Union Territory of Chandigarh in 2020 was lower than the average annual number of deaths in the pre-pandemic period. The total number of deaths registered between April 2020 and May 2021 — 22,149 was an estimated 1,781 to 4,705 deaths lower than averages registered in the pre-pandemic period (2015-2019 for the first estimate and 2018-19 for the higher one). Data on deaths registered monthwise from January 2015 to May 2021 in Chandigarh were sourced by The Hindu via an RTI. The lowered mortality held true for the city in 2021 till the second wave hit in the months of April and May, resulting in 2,002 and 2,114 deaths registered in the period. These numbers resulted in an estimated 1,023 excess deaths compared to the baseline mortality — average number of deaths for the two months in the years 2018 and 2019 and 1,310 excess deaths compared to the baseline mortality for the same months from 2015 to 2019. The COVID19 death toll recorded in the UT in these two months was 374, amounting to an undercount factor ranging from 2.7 to 3.5. If instead of averages, excess deaths were calculated by extrapolating the annual number of deaths through a linear growth model, the undercount factor was even less at 1.1. In sum, the officially registered COVID-19 deaths in the UT were not much lower than the “excess deaths” that we estimated using various methods. The pattern of deaths registered in Chandigarh was comparable to what was observed in Thiruvananthapuram municipal corporation as well. There too, there were fewer registered deaths in 2020, but numbers went up in 2021 after excess deaths were observed during the second wave. According to the Annual Report on Vital Statistics of India based on CRS 2019, the estimated deaths in Chandigarh were only 5,091 based on the death rate estimated by the Sample Registration System (SRS). But the CRS registered more than 20,000 deaths every year since 2017, a number that fell to 18,370 in 2020. The discrepancy between the estimated number of deaths and the actual registered numbers is due to the fact that many of those who die come to the city’s medical facilities for treatment of various illnesses and ailments from neighbouring areas. Dr V.K. Nagpal, Medical Superintendent at Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Chandigarh told The Hindu that there were fewer deaths during the first wave and especially during the lockdown months in comparison to the pre-COVID period. The reason, he said, was reduced vehicular traffic during the lockdowns that resulted in a drop in accident cases. “Hospitals in Chandigarh, especially Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) serve referral cases from neighbouring places including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu-Kashmir. So, when the referral and emergency, mainly road accident cases dropped then naturally the death numbers would also decline,” he said. Dr. Nagpal said as far as the estimates of SRS of the numbers of deaths is concerned it is based on the population of Chandigarh residents. “If the number of [registered] deaths is above the estimate it’s because the large number of people from outside Chandigarh visit the city hospitals for treatment and some of them die due to ailments, illnesses etc.,” he said. “The assumption surrounding the deaths as per Sample Registration System is correct as it is based on the population and residents of Chandigarh only and not the neighbouring areas,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chandigarh-bucks-excess-deaths-trend/article35376002.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre working on specifics to bring Moderna vaccine: Paul||The Central government “is working on specifics to bring in the Moderna vaccine”, V.K. Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog, said on Friday. At the Health Ministry press conference, he said people were still vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus, which was very much around. “We have to be alert. Our COVID case decline has slowed down and this is a warning sign,” he said. Dr. Paul said that the COVID-19 situation in most of the regions has turned from bad to worse. “Overall, the world is moving towards a third wave. World Health Organization’s warning about the third COVID wave is a red flag,” he said. Speaking about the vaccination process in the country, Dr. Paul said a target to administer 50 crore doses before July had been set and “we are on the path to achieving it”. Routine vaccinations Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has said that reports alleging that lakhs of Indian children may have missed their routine vaccinations due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased risk of future outbreaks and deaths, “are not based on facts and do not reflect the true picture”. “It is clarified that since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Ministry has been focused towards maintaining essential services, including immunisation under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP). The Ministry, along with all States and UTs and development partners, has worked towards mitigating negative impacts of COVID-19 and taking urgent actions to ensure that children receive life-saving vaccines,” said the Health Ministry in its release. It added that in order to mitigate negative impacts of COVID-19 on vaccination services, many other steps have also been taken. “A national guideline to safely continue immunisation services during the COVID-19 pandemic, including polio Supplementary Immunisation Activities (SIAs), has been developed. In order to identify reasons for missed vaccine doses, monitoring & supervision is being done by State and district task forces for prompt corrective action. Also, high-risk groups/areas (e.g. children who missed vaccination during COVID-19 outbreaks, districts with high vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), districts with low vaccine coverage, etc.) for risk mitigation have been identified,” noted the Ministry. The Ministry added that Intensified Mission Indradhanush identified 250 high-risk districts, where more than 9.5 lakh children and 2.24 lakh pregnant women were vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-working-on-specifics-to-bring-moderna-vaccine-paul/article35376013.ece
17 July 2021||New Delhi,||Bail orders will be sent instantly to prisons: SC||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Friday said people given bail by courts, even by the Supreme Court, have to wait for days before prison authorities release them. “It is just too much,” he said. The Chief Justice, heading a Special Bench, voiced the Supreme Court’s exasperation at prison authorities who insist on receiving by hand the “authentic” hard copy of the bail order regardless of the fact that the personal liberty of people suffers. “In this age of information and communication technology, we are still looking at the skies for the pigeons to communicate the orders,” Chief Justice Ramana remarked orally. So, as a solution, the Chief Justice, flanked by Justices L. Nageswara Rao and A.S. Bopanna, announced in open court the rolling out of a new scheme called ‘FASTER’ or ‘Fast and Secure Transmission of Electronic Records’ by which the Supreme Court would instantly, directly, securely and electronically transmit bail and other orders to jail authorities, district courts and High Courts. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal appreciated the court’s initiative. When Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said orders anyway were uploaded on the court website, Justice Rao said “the idea behind the scheme is to transmit orders securely”. Net connectivity The Bench asked State governments to file their reports about the Internet connectivity in their jails to prevent technical glitches in future. The Secretary General of the Supreme Court was directed to submit a comprehensive report formulating the scheme within two weeks. The hearing was based on a suo motu case, ‘In Re: Delay in release of convicts after grant of bail’, registered on the initiative of Chief Justice Ramana to confront the problem which affects the liberty and dignity of prisoners. Recently,13 prisoners in Agra Jail, who suffered imprisonment for up to two decades despite the Juvenile Justice Board declaring them ‘juveniles’ at the time of commission of their crimes, were granted bail by the Supreme Court on July 8, but were released by the prison authorities after a delay of four days. Again,Pinjra Tod activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwaland Jamia Millia Islamia studentAsif Iqbal Tanhawalked out of Tihar Jail nearly two days after the Delhi High Court granted them bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bail-orders-will-be-sent-instantly-to-prisons-sc/article35375987.ece
17 July 2021||Srinagar,||Two militants killed in Srinagar||Two local militants of The Resistance Front (TRF) were killed in a pre-dawn operation on Friday in Srinagar’s Alamdar Colony, taking the number of militants gunned down so far this year to 78. “Acting on specific information, a joint cordon and search operation was launched at Alamdar Colony, Danmar area, Srinagar. Terrorists were given opportunities to surrender, however, they fired indiscriminately. Two terrorists of self-claimed TRF of the Lashkar-e-Taiba were killed,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said. The police identified the slain militants as Irfan Ahmad Sofi and Bilal Ahmad Bhat, both residents of Natipora. “They were active since December, 2020,” the police said. The TRF recently shared on the social media that Irfan Ahmad Sofi and Bilal Ahmad Bhat had left it and joined the Islamic State-J&K. “The duo was behind the killing of the PSO of a Peoples Democratic Party leader in 2020, killing of two CRPF jawans in 2021. Besides, they killed an on-leave police official, constable Javid Ahmad, near his residence at Saidpora on June 22, 2021 and Inspector Parvez Ahmad at Nowgam. They were behind the killing of a civilian, Umer Nazir Bhat, at his shop in Habba Kadal,” the police said. The duo was “instrumental in motivating and recruiting the youth to join terror folds in Srinagar and its adjoining areas”. The police recovered incriminating materials, arms and ammunition, including one AK-47 rifle, one pistol and four grenades, from the encounter site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/two-militants-killed-in-srinagar/article35376005.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Over 86% of breakthrough infections caused by Delta’||A majority, over 86%, of the breakthrough infections after COVID-19 vaccination have been caused by the Delta variant, with hospitalisation of 9.8% of such cases and fatality observed in 0.4% of cases, according to the results of a nationwide study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on breakthrough COVID-19 infection. A breakthrough infection is a case of illness in which a vaccinated individual becomes sick from the same illness that the vaccine is meant to prevent. For the study, “Clinical characterisation and Genomic analysis of COVID-19 breakthrough infections during second wave in different States of India”, ICMR collected 677 clinical samples of individuals who have been partially or fully vaccinated but contracted the infection. The samples were collected from 17 States and Union Territories, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. The study found that a total of 482 cases (71%) were symptomatic with one or more symptoms, while 29% had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. “Fever (69%) was the most consistent presentation followed by bodyache, including headache and nausea (56%), cough (45%), sore throat (37%), loss of smell and taste (22%), diarrhoea (6%), breathlessness (6%) and 1% had ocular irritation and redness.” The southern, western, eastern and northwestern regions predominantly reported breakthrough infection mainly from Delta and then the Kappa variant. Alpha was predominant behind reinfection in the northern region, it stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-86-of-breakthrough-infections-caused-by-delta/article35376011.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||DRI unearths smuggling of luxury cars||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Friday arrested three persons, including the chief executive officer of a Gurugram-based dealership in the sale of used luxury cars, for their alleged role in the smuggling of high-end vehicles into India in the names of foreign diplomats. The accused have been identified as Liyakat Bachau Khan, Nipun Miglani and Suriya Arjunan. Six vehicles have been recovered so far. The agency suspects that the syndicate brought over 20 luxury vehicles into the country in the past five years using the same modus operandi , leading to duty evasion of over Rs. 25 crore. A DRI official confirmed that Mr. Miglani was the chief executive officer of Big Boys Toys. The racket was unearthed as part of an exercise codenamed “Operation Monte Carlo”, following a tip-off that a group had been smuggling high-end cars in the names of diplomats and diverting them to private persons, thereby evading Customs duty, said the agency in a statement. “Imports made by foreign diplomats and Missions in India are governed by the Foreign Privileged Persons (Regulation of Customs Privileges) Rules, 1957. Motor cars are classifiable under chapter heading 8703 having duty structure of BCD (Basic Customs Duty) — 125%, IGST (Integrated Goods & Services Tax) — 28% and 12.50% SWS (Social Welfare Surcharge). The net Customs duty on import of cars works out to 204%,” said the DRI. The agency found that a Dubai-based individual, who had earlier been probed for Customs offences, was the mastermind behind the racket.  The probe may lead to the identification of more accused persons in the coming days, the agency said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dri-unearths-smuggling-of-luxury-cars/article35376098.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ministry clears rules for vintage cars||For the first time ever, India is set to have rules for regulating the registration process for vintage cars. The Union Law Ministry has given its nod to an amendment to Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, which are expected to be notified by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways soon, according to a government official. Fifty years According to the rules, all two-wheelers and four-wheelers, which have not undergone any substantial overhaul, will be defined as Vintage Motor Vehicles 50 years after the date of first registration. Vehicles that already carry a registration number would be allowed to retain it. However, classics that are registered afresh, such as those that are imported into the country, would be assigned an identifier “VA” in the registration number. Vintage vehicles would neither be permitted on roads for regular purposes nor would they be used for commercial purposes. They would be allowed only during exhibitions. The fees for a new registration would be Rs. 20,000 and subsequent re-registration would cost Rs. 5,000. All such antique vehicles would be exempted from the provisions of High Security Registration Plate recently made mandatory by the government. The sale and purchase of such vehicles registered is permissible provided the buyer and seller inform respective State Transport Authorities, the rules said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ministry-clears-rules-for-vintage-cars/article35376016.ece

In Ahmedabad, the Prime Minister inaugurated a nature park, an aquatic gallery and robotic gallery at the Science City. The aquatic gallery, spread over 15,000 square meters, will be the largest aquarium in India housing 68 tanks showcasing 188 marine species, including penguins. A key attraction is a 28 metre long unique walkway tunnel. The project has been developed in collaboration with Marine Scape Eo-aquarium, New Zealand. The robotic gallery takes visitors through the history of robots, showcasing the pioneers of robotics technology. It will provide a platform for visitors to explore the ever-evolving field. At the entrance to the gallery is a huge replica of the Transformer robot. A unique attraction is the welcoming humanoid robot that communicates with visitors expressing emotions such as joy, surprise and excitement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modern-gandhinagar-station-opened/article35375981.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Don’t seek surrender of those on interim bail, SC tells States||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the States to not, for the time being, ask for the surrender of prisoners released on interim bail during the second wave of the pandemic to decongest prisons. “For the time being, they should not be asked to surrender until further orders,” a Special Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana ordered. The CJI Bench ordered the NALSA and the State governments to submit a detailed report on the criteria/norms considered by the respective High Powered Committees for releasing prisoners on interim bail. Copies of the report should be served to the Union government and amicus curiae, senior advocate Dushyant Dave. The court listed the case for hearing on Friday. In early May, the court turned a humanitarian eye to the over four lakh prison population trapped inside overcrowded jails even as a surging second wave led to huge loss of lives. Then, a Bench led by the CJI observed that “India has more than four lakh prison inmates. It is observed that some of the prisons in India are overburdened and are housing inmates beyond optimal capacity…. The requirement of decongestion is a matter concerning the health and right to life of both the prison inmates and the police personnel working”. ‘Limit arrests’ The court had even ordered the police to limit arrests during the pandemic to prevent overcrowding of jails and urged magistrates to not order detention in a mechanical manner in cases involving the punishment of less or up to seven years’ imprisonment. It had further ordered special committees or ‘High-Powered Committees’ constituted in most States and Union Territories to screen prisoners and release them on interim bail. The order had also taken into consideration those released on interim bail in the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. The court had ordered them to be freed “forthwith”. 90% of inmates released last year had returned to their prisons in February and March 2021. More importantly, the court had also taken into consideration the plight of prisoners too scared to return home, though eligible for release on interim bail or parole, owing to their social circumstances or simply because they were afraid they would get infected with COVID-19 while outside. In such cases, the court ordered proper medical facilities, immediate treatment and regular tests for both inmates and jail staff. It said maintenance of daily hygiene in prisons should be put at a premium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-seek-surrender-of-those-on-interim-bail-sc-tells-states/article35375985.ece
17 July 2021||New Delhi,||Actor Surekha Sikri, winner of three National Awards, passes away||A strong pillar of meaningful cinema, actor Surekha Sikri passed away on Friday. She was 76. A three-time National Award winner for best performance in a supporting role, Sikri will be remembered for her realistic performances in Tamas , Mammo and Badhai Ho.  In Govind Nihalani’s Partition saga Tamas (1988), she played Rajo, a Muslim woman who is worried about giving shelter to a Sikh couple for she doesn’t know what her fanatic son could do to them but eventually, she gets over her fear and stands up for them. It won her the first of the three National Awards. In Shyam Benegal’s Mammo (1994),  she played the empathetic yet pragmatic Fayyazi who has to deal with an inquisitive grandson and a dominating sister who has arrived unannounced from Pakistan. A product of composite culture, Sikri’s mother was a teacher in Aligarh Muslim University’s Abdullah Girls College and hence she spent her early days in a rich cultural atmosphere. It was in AMU that her love for theatre and Urdu bloomed. “Those were the days when Aligarh was one of the centres of the Progressive Writers’ Movement. Surekha ji performed extensively in plays staged in Abdullah College, and one of her co-actors used to be Naseeruddin Shah,” says F.S. Sheerani, coordinator, Cultural Education Centre, the hub of extra-curricular activity on the campus. “During that period, the National School Drama used to hold plays in Aligarh and in one such performance of Macbeth , Surekha- ji was cast. It is said her performance was noticed by none other than Ebraham Alkazi and she was advised to joined the National School of Drama,” adds Prof. Sheerani. Theatre star She excelled on stage and went on to win the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1989. “Along with Uttara Baokar, Surekha was the top draw in the Delhi theatre circuit in the 1980s. The audience used to come to watch their plays from neighbouring towns,” remembers veteran theatre critic Diwan Singh Bajeli. A new generation of audiences discovered Sikri’s talent through Balika Vadhu where she played Dadi Sa, a matriarch whose social outlook was formed by centuries of entrenched patriarchy. She again played a variant of her character in Badhai Ho (2018) that made her a darling among millennials. As the stern mother-in-law who is the first to accept the late pregnancy of her daughter-in-law, she exposed the hypocrisy that exists in society about sex and gender rights. A brain stroke limited her movement but not one to give up, Sikri was terrific in her last performance as an ailing, bed-ridden old woman in Zoya Akhtar’s segment of Netflix’s Ghost Stories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/actor-surekha-sikri-winner-of-three-national-awards-passes-away/article35375978.ece
17 July 2021||TASHKENT,||Pakistan likely to be most hit by Afghan conflict, says Imran||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said his country was likely to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan and hence had tried to bring the Taliban to negotiating table to avoid conflict. Mr. Khan was responding to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s opening remarks at the Central and South Asia connectivity conference in Tashkent and said he was “disappointed” by the allegation that Pakistan had a “negative role” in the conflict. “President Ghani, the country that is going to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan. Pakistan suffered 70,000 casualties in the last 15 years. The last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict,” Mr. Khan said. “I can assure you that no country has tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan. We have taken all action short of taking military action, and every effort to bring them to the dialogue table and have a peaceful settlement there, and to blame Pakistan for what is going on in Afghanistan is extremely unfair,” he added. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Khan spoke as another spat broke out between Kabul and Islamabad over allegations by Afghanistan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh that the Pakistan military had threatened missile launches against the Afghan Air Force if it targeted Taliban militia that has claimed border checkposts at Spin Boldak. In a statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry denied the claim. It said Pakistan acknowledged Afghanistan’s sovereignty. Mr. Khan said that apart from the violence in Afghanistan, “outstanding disputes” like Kashmir between regional players like India and Pakistan was the other big challenge to regional connectivity, and in comments to the media later even blamed the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) for creating hurdles to India-Pakistan dialogue, responding to a question from news agency ANI. In his speech at the plenary session, which was attended by the Foreign Ministers of Russia and China and senior officials from about 40 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., EU and Iran, Mr. Jaishankar didn’t refer directly to Pakistan or to China as he stressed the need for resilient supply chains in the post COVID-19 situation, as well as the problems of “one-way” trade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/10000-jihadis-have-crossed-in-from-pakistan/article35375992.ece
17 July 2021||GUWAHATI,||Manipur RTI activists in hiding seek support||Two Manipur Right to Information activists, in hiding for more than a year for seeking to know how the funds for a tribal council were spent, have sought the support of the people and the authorities before they are silenced by an extremist group. In an open letter on Friday, P. Johnson Samo and P.R. Amose said they had been on the run from the local leaders of the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (I-M) for seeking information on utilisation of public money allocated by the Centre to the Autonomous District Council in Senapati district since 2015. Fund misappropriation Mr. Samo is from Taphou Phyamai village and Mr. Amose from Khabung Khunou, both in Senapati district. Their RTI application followed allegations of misappropriation against the council’s chief executive officer (CEO) and four others. The duo said two NSCN (I-M) leaders of the region — K.V. Sounii and Puni Mao — issued “orders” asking them to withdraw their RTI applications or face stern action that “amounted to death threat.” Abducted and tortured Cadres of the NSCN (I-M) allegedly abducted and tortured another RTI activist, Kh. Enoch, and kept him in captivity until his family was forced to pay a hefty fine and agree not to use RTI. Another RTI activist, Dalounii, and 28 others from Senapati district’s Phuba village were also fined for similar “audacity,” the duo said. “The tremendous harassment and hardships faced by the RTI activists go beyond threats to their lives. The ways and means for earning their livelihoods have been choked too,” they said, adding that the NSCN (I-M) restricted and stopped contract works of people who have not toed their line. “We have appealed to some [Poumai and Mao Naga] civil society organisations and human rights organisations to help us but no one has come forward. We are suffering a lot from March 2020 to date. We may be killed but what about our future?” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/manipur-rti-activists-in-hiding-seek-support/article35376472.ece
17 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||Priyanka questions Modi’s praise of Yogi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praise for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s handling of the second wave of COVID-19 and his development model. Addressing journalists at the U.P. Congress headquarters after arriving in the State capital for a scheduled three-day visit, Ms. Vadra pointed out that on Thursday, the PM had handed out a “certificate” to Mr. Adityanath for his good handling of the second wave and for establishing “ vikasvad ” in the State. “I want to ask what kind of vikasvad is this that when the second wave of the corona [virus pandemic] was going on, you held the Panchayat polls. How many people got inflected with corona then and how many teachers died due to corona? But you still held the Panchayat polls,” Ms. Vadra said of Mr. Adityanath. She further said, “The government is itself trying to destroy the Constitution and attack democracy. And behind them is the hand of Modi- ji who comes here and praises them and congratulates them for the Panchayat polls when they actually spread violence during the polls and allowed lawlessness.” Ms. Vadra accused the administration and police in U.P. of kidnapping the candidates in these polls, and said that women candidates were assaulted and their clothes torn. “This type of lawlessness that the U.P. government is itself spreading is because it has totally failed. Their arrangements for the second wave of corona were poor,” Ms. Vadra said. After landing at Lucknow airport, Ms. Vadra garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the Hazraganj area of Lucknow, and was then scheduled to address media at the party office before conducting meetings. However, she sat on an apparently impromptu silent protest near the statue for two hours against the Yogi Adityanath government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-questions-modis-praise-of-uttar-pradesh-cm/article35375999.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers’ front issues ‘whip’ to MPs||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha has issued a “voters' whip” to all Opposition Members of Parliament, demanding that they raise the concerns of protesting farmers in the upcoming monsoon session. They should also prevent any other business from being transacted until the three contentious farm reform laws are repealed, said the SKM's “whip” which is being delivered via email before the session begins on Monday. “If you and your party defy this “voters’ whip”, the farmers of India will be compelled to oppose you on every public stage, just as we oppose the leaders, MLAs, MPs of the BJP and its allies,” warned the SKM. It said its “voters’ whip” overrides any other whip issued by political parties. It has demanded that MPs be present throughout the monsoon session and that they must not stage a “walkout” that enables the ruling party to push through its business unhindered. Even if suspended or removed, they should return to the floor of the House, it said. The SKM, a platform for farmers’ groups protesting the three laws, accused the non-BJP and non-NDA parties of failing to adequately respond to the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-front-issues-whip-to-mps/article35376000.ece
18 July 2021||CHENNAI,||Railways flags cybercrime targeting pensioners||In a new online fraud, cybercriminals have been targeting senior citizens by posing as pension-disbursing authorities calling to update Digital Life Certificate (Jeevan Praman Patr) online. The Ministry of Railways has alerted all public sector banks about the modus operandi of the fraudsters, who managed to access the pensioners’ service records. The issue was first flagged by the Cyber Crime Cell of the Lucknow Police, who issued an alert to all pensioners in Uttar Pradesh not to entertain any caller offering online update of Digital Life Certificate, which is a mandatory requirement for uninterrupted disbursement of pension. Personal details According to the police alert shared by the Railway Board, the fraudsters managed to access details like the pensioners’ date of appointment, date of retirement, pension pay order, Aadhar number, communication address, email ID, among others. “The fraudsters initiate a transfer and ask the pensioner to share the One Time Password [OTP] received on his/her mobile phone or email, saying that it was required to update the Digital Life Certificate. Once the OTP is shared, the funds get transferred to an unknown account,” said a senior railway official said. The Officer on Special Duty, Accounts, Railway Board, wrote to the chairmen and managing directors of all public sector banks, asking them to send out an alert message to all pensioners to be cautious of such fraudulent calls and stating that the pension-disbursing authorities would never make calls or seek OTP for online updation of Digital Life Certificates. The pensioners’ details of the Indian Railways is maintained by the Human Resource Management System, an online platform with adequate protective measures. The information is shared with banks, which are the pension disbursing authorities. Investigation was on to find out how the data leaked to the cybercriminals, the official said. “The Personnel Department of the Zonal Railways have also sent out alerts to pensioners asking them not to respond to any phone enquiries relating to Digital Life Certificates. We have also shared the national helpline number (155260) launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs to report cyber frauds for immediate action,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-flags-cybercrime-targeting-pensioners/article35376022.ece

He made these remarks while addressing the party’s social media workers in an interactive session on Zoom on Friday. “There are many people who are not scared, but are outside the Congress.

We want fearless people. This is our ideology. This is my basic message to you,” he said. News agency, PTI, quoted Mr. Gandhi as citing the example of Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia as “someone who got scared”. “He had to save his house and he got scared and he joined the RSS.” Mr. Gandhi’s comments are significant as several leaders have left the party.

The Bill that seeks to reserve one-third of all seats for women in the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in May 2008 by the UPA government and was referred to a standing committee. In 2010, it was passed in the House and transmitted finally to the Lok Sabha. The Bill lapsed with the 15th Lok Sabha. “It’s time we bring the Women’s Reservation Bill. The BJP, in its election manifestos of 2014 as well as 2019, had promised to bring in the Bill. So why have they not delivered so far,” TMC’s Parliamentary Party leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’ Brien said on Friday. The TMC, among other issues, would raise this in the monsoon session, he asserted. Mr. O’ Brien pointed out that 41% of the party’s members of the Lok Sabha and 36% in the Rajya Sabha were women.

The proposal follows the tabling of the Assam Cattle Protection Bill, which seeks to ban the transportation of cattle and sale of beef within 5 km of temples and other religious structures of non-beef consuming communities, as well as in areas of mixed populations. Presenting a Rs. 566.2-crore deficit Budget, Assam’s Finance Minister Ajanta Neog said the government has proposed a scheme to control the birth of scrub bulls up to 20% by procuring “high-genetic merit sex-sorted semen”. The plan is to increase the number of hybrid female caves born in cattle and buffalo farms for higher milk yield. The proposal for the current fiscal is to cover 50,000 cattle and buffaloes with 1.25 lakh doses of sex-sorted frozen semen sourced from genetically superior bulls. In the Budget, Rs. 100-crore has also been earmarked for the Indigenous Faith and Culture Department that would be set up with three directorates — Archaeology, Museum, and Historical and Antiquarian Studies — to be subsumed under it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-budget-seeks-to-control-cattle-population/article35376017.ece

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who also attended the conference, referred to problems with transit trade in his speech alluding to Pakistan. He said economic development and prosperity go “hand in hand” with peace and security. In a hard-hitting speech, Mr. Ghani said more than 10,000 ‘jihadi’ fighters have entered Afghanistan in the last month, according to intelligence reports, while the Pakistan government had failed to convince the Taliban to participate “seriously” in the peace talks. “Contrary to repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his Generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force will use its power and influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organizations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of the assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and State,” Mr. Ghani said at the inaugural ceremony of the conference, as he listed the challenges and threats to regional connectivity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/10000-pak-jihadis-have-entered-afghanistan/article35376748.ece

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in his message of condolence, expressed solidarity with the media and said his government is committed to upholding freedom of expression. “I am deeply saddened with the shocking reports that Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in Kandahar,” he said. Reuters has reported that Mr Siddiqui was in the main market of Spin Boldak when he was caught in crossfire. Tolo News has reported that a senior commander of the Afghan special forces Sediq Karzai too was killed in the same incident. Sources have informed that the mortal remains of Mr. Siddiqui was handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Indian Embassy in Kabul is coordinating with the Afghan authorities and ICRC to return them to his family. Speaking at a briefing on protection of civilians in armed conflicts, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who is currently in New York took up the issue and said, “India condemns the killing of Danish Siddiqui while he was on an assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan. I extend our sincerest condolences to his bereaved family.” Mr. Siddiqui was travelling in an armoured Humvee with Afghan soldiers and he had shared videos over the past few days that showed the vehicle came under attack on several occasions. Compassionate lens Mr. Siddiqui was known for his compassionate photographic coverage of current developments in South Asia. In recent years his photographs of the Rohingya refugees who were displaced by the Myanmar military from the Rakhine provice, drew global attention to the plight of the displaced community that is currently living in camps in Bangladesh. The photographs of the Rohinyga refugees was recognised with a Pulitzer Prize. Earlier this year, he used innovative methods like drone photography to capture the vast scale of the second wave of COVID-19 in India.

17 July 2021||New Delhi,||No word yet on role for Navjot Sidhu in Punjab||Former Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday met Congress president Sonia Gandhi at her residence, 10 Janpath, after the infighting in the State Congress intensified following reports that he will be made the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief. All India Congress Committee (AICC) in charge of Punjab Harish Rawat, who was part of the meeting along with former party chief Rahul Gandhi, told reporters that Ms. Gandhi was yet to take a call on the proposed changes to revamp the PCC. After the hour-long meeting, Mr. Sidhu avoided speaking to the media but Mr. Rawat did. “I had come here to submit my report on Punjab to the Congress chief and as soon as a decision is taken by the party president, I will come and share it with you,” he said. Asked if Mr. Sidhu would be made PCC chief, he queried, “Who says this?” On Thursday, however, Mr. Rawat, in response to the same question (whether Mr. Sidhu would be the new PCC chief), observed that “a formula was being worked around it”. “What one puts as breaking news, it is their own interpretation. I don’t interfere in their area. And secondly, until the Congress president has cleared it, I don’t know what is on her mind and her last decision,” he stated. The leadership is desperate to broker peace between Chief Minister Captain (Retd.) Amarinder Singh and Mr. Sidhu before the State goes to the polls early next year. The crisis in the State Congress is said to have escalated on Thursday after Mr. Rawat hinted that Mr. Sidhu could be elevated as the PCC chief, with two working presidents: one from a Hindu community and the other a Dalit. The suggestion, however, did not go do well with Captain Amarinder Singh’s camp. He is said to have reiterated his view that both the party and the government cannot be headed by Jat Sikhs (both him and Mr. Sidhu) and the party organisation should be headed by a Hindu leader. Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath, who met Ms. Gandhi on Thursday, is learnt to have batted for the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-word-yet-on-leadership-role-for-sidhu/article35375991.ece

The tragedy is said to have struck several villages between July 13 and 14 in the Deoraj region of West Champaran. “Eight people have died in three villages. Two of them died due to medical complications,” said District Magistrate Kundan Kumar. He said four people, including a woman, had been taken into custody. Local Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) leaders claimed that over 10 people had died. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Champaran range) Lallan Mohan Prasad said two people, Thug Shah and Suresh Shah, had been booked for illegal liquor trade. “The victims’ family members say they did not consume liquor. However, one of the two undergoing treatment has confessed he did,” Mr. Prasad told journalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/8-feared-dead-in-suspected-hooch-tragedy-in-bihar/article35376023.ece

Justice Rekha Palli said there should be justifiable reasons for the blacklisting, which should be communicated either to Mr. Rock or his wife Manisha Malik.

17 July 2021||New Delhi,||ED attaches assets worth Rs. 4.2 crore in graft probe||The Enforcement Directorate has provisionally attached assets worth Rs. 4.2 crore linked to former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and others in a money laundering case. The agency had earlier summoned him thrice for recording his statement, but he did not join the probe in person. The attached assets are held in the name of Mr. Deshmukh’s wife, Aarti Deshmukh, and the company Premier Port Links Private Limited. They include a residential flat in Mumbai’s Worli area, and 25 land parcels worth Rs. 2.67 crore on paper, located in Raigarh, Maharashtra. The ED probe is based on a FIR registered by the CBI against Mr. Deshmukh and others, following a directive from the Bombay High Court. It is alleged that they used improper means for collection of funds from various bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai “to achieve the target of Rs. 100 crore per month”. According to the ED, Mr. Deshmukh — while working as the Home Minister in the Maharashtra government — received illegal gratification of about Rs. 4.70 crore in cash from various orchestra bar owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-42-crore-in-graft-probe/article35375983.ece

17 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Unfair to expect States to cut fuel taxes, says Shashi Tharoor||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday said it is unfair to expect the State governments to cut Value Added Taxes on fuel, especially when the Centre is keeping most of the taxes by levying cess. Speaking to reporters at the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee headquarters, he said State Finance Minister Palanivel Thiagarajan had pointed out to him that the Centre had been levying cess on fuel and not sharing it with the States. “Cess is a very divisive idea as it is not divisible with States. When the Centre keeps 96% of it, then the onus is on itself to reduce the taxes and bring down the prices,” Mr. Tharoor said. He pointed out that since May 4, after the State elections, the fuel prices had been increased 40 times. The higher fuel prices were also leading to higher prices of vegetables, fruits, pulses and other essential household items, resulting in higher inflation. “This is not like ordinary inflation which happens in a healthy economy. The economy is under pressure and very little stimulus has been offered by the Modi government,” he added. Mr. Tharoor alleged that the current situation was due to the mismanagement of the economy by the Modi government. He also pointed out that import duty on some essential items like palm oil and pulses had gone up, and household items attracted higher GST rates. Mr. Tharoor urged the Centre to reduce taxes and cess on fuel significantly and also give a larger share to the State governments. He also called for rationalisation of GST rates. The MP also called on Chief Minister M.K. Stalin at the latter's camp office in Chennai. Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unfair-to-expect-states-to-cut-fuel-taxes-says-shashi-tharoor/article35376618.ece
17 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Aadi sale begins on a dull note||Like in 2020, the Aadi sale is expected to be a low-key affair this year too as many retailers say customers have cut down on their spending. A majority of retailers in the State, who usually offer discounts during Aadi (the fourth month in the Tamil calendar), have decided to refrain from announcing any sale. However, some outlets have decided to continue with the tradition of the special sale as they had been doing it for several years now. Those who have outlets in malls are not calling it Aadi sale but are trying to clear stocks by offering up to 70% discount. Retailers highlighted that like last year, sales during this Aadi would be down by 40%-60% depending on the COVID-19 situation. A high number of deaths during the second wave of the pandemic has created fear among consumers as well as retailers. “Most of my friends who run businesses have stayed away from Aadi sale this year. I have put up a sale because we have been doing it for over two decades and don’t want to break the tradition,” said a retailer on Ranganathan Street, T. Nagar, who has branches across Tamil Nadu. “When compared to Chennai, I see more people in Madurai and down south shopping this Aadi,” he said. It’s a tradition Rasi Silks has decided to continue with its tradition of Aadi discounts it this year too. “But the walk-ins are less when compared to pre-COVID levels,” Rasi Jairam, managing director of Rasi Silks, said. Mr. Jairam explained that the lockdown had an impact on the businesses of weavers and tailors, causing supply constraints. “As on date, we have decided not to have an Aadi sale this year to avoid overcrowding,” said P.A. Ravindran, general manager, The Chennai Silks. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, The Chennai Silks has made itself available on several e-commerce sites and intends to participate in discount sales online. Cautious approach Brands like Jeyachandran Textiles, who commence the sale in the first week of July, have decided to wait and watch. “We are yet to decide on Aadi sales this year. We will see what others are going to do and then take a call,” said Sundar J., managing director of Jeyachandran Textiles. Most retailers are lying low because of the fear of inviting the wrath of officials from the Corporation and the police. Officials have been constantly conducting surprise checks to ensure that there is no overcrowding. Despite the checks, on Friday evening, most big shops on Usman Road and adjoining streets had huge crowds, and social distancing norms were abandoned. The manager of one of the biggest stores said, “Yes, the government has said that we should allow only 50% customers. But how can we keep counting the number of people?” he asked. He said that everyone who walked in was being allowed inside as “we don’t want to lose customers”. Another retailer said it was impossible to keep a tab on the number of customers walking in and the State government had said 50% occupancy was permitted. “But they (the government) have not given any guidelines on how many people can be permitted into shops. Or what that 50% means,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aadi-sale-begins-on-a-dull-note/article35376627.ece
17 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Mask compliance still below 50% in city||A study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE) and the Greater Chennai Corporation has shown that while mask compliance has improved in the city, it was still below 50%. The study showed that the compliance in outdoor areas was 41% in slum areas and 47% in non-slum areas. Importantly, in indoor areas, the compliance was significantly poorer at just 24% in slum areas and 33% in non-slum areas. This study was round four of the periodic study being conducted by ICMR-NIE and GCC at different points since the outbreak of COVID-19. Rounds one, two and three were conducted in October 2020, December 2020, and March 2021 respectively. Round 4 was conducted from July 8 to 10. The compliance observed in the previous three rounds in outdoors was respectively 28%, 29% and 21% in slum areas and 36%, 35% and 21% in non-slum areas. Random selection As in the previous rounds, 64 streets, 32 each in slum and non-slum areas, were randomly selected for the study. At each survey point, 50 individuals were observed outdoors and another 20 individuals in indoor spaces like grocery shops, pharmacies, religious places or apparel stores. In total, 3,200 people were observed outdoors and 1,280 were observed indoors in slum and non-slum areas combined. According to the study, 38% of the people observed outdoors in slum areas and 25% observed in non-slum areas did not wear masks at all. The remaining 21% in slum areas and 28% in non-slum areas wore masks inappropriately, without covering their noses and mouths. Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, ICMR-NIE, said that while mask compliance had certainly seen a significant improvement from the 21% ahead of the second wave in March 2021, the compliance had to improve further. She said the poor compliance of just 24% in slum areas and 33% in non-slum areas in indoor spaces was a serious concern as the risk of COVID-19 transmission was far higher in these spaces. As a majority of the population was yet to get vaccinated, it was important to improve mask compliance, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mask-compliance-in-chennai-improves-but-still-below-50/article35376614.ece
17 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM reiterates State’s demands on COVID-19 vaccines, NEET||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday reiterated Tamil Nadu’s demands, urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to supply more doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the State, not to conduct the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and impose no GST on goods meant to tackle the pandemic. At a virtual meeting that Mr. Modi chaired to review the pandemic management in six States, Mr. Stalin said the DMK government had eliminated vaccine wastage, which stood at 6% earlier, and created a good deal of awareness of the importance of vaccination. As a result, the demand for vaccines was very high. “However, the allotment is lower than those for other States. I have already requested for a special allocation of one crore doses... I look forward to your support...” The Chief Minister said the Union government’s additional rice allocation to the priority cardholders had been extended to all rice cards, and this benefit should be extended to all eligible cardholders. In a COVID-19 relief initiative, the State had been distributing Rs. 4,000 in two instalments and a grocery kit to two crore families. Resources sought Mr. Stalin also sought zero GST on all goods needed to tackle the pandemic. “We are making preparations to manage a probable third wave. For that, I appeal to the Union government to allocate more resources to the State. Schools and colleges have already been closed. In the midst of the pandemic, conducting national-level tests like NEET may result in the disease spreading. Hence, I request the Prime Minister to reconsider the conduct of NEET.” He assured the Prime Minister that Tamil Nadu would take all steps to effectively handle the pandemic and stand firm with him to overcome the challenge. “Ours is the only major State where a new government faced the tough task of tackling the pandemic. My government met the challenge, reduced the number of deaths and contained the infection,” he said. He also thanked the Union government for increasing the allocation of oxygen and the antiviral drug Remdesivir to Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-reiterates-states-demands-on-covid-19-vaccines-neet/article35376246.ece

She was 40. Her father said she had complained of breathlessness and was taken to a hospital where she died after efforts to revive her failed. Pavithra wrote for readers of all ages. Her history-driven stories that came out as a column in The Hindu Young World under the head, Yester Tales, were compiled into a book. There were stories on the ancient trade route between Arabia and India and the atom bomb and Hiroshima. As translator, she served non-Tamil readers the beauty of Kalki Krishnamurthi’s Ponniyin Selvan and Sivakamiyin Sabadham . His descriptions of River Cauvery running during the ‘Aadi Perukku’ festival were beautifully translated by Pavithra, who also translated Amish Tripathi’sThe Shiva Trilogyand Jeffrey Archer’s A Twist in the Tale . Her friend and architect Thirupurasundari Sevvel said it was only recently were they firming up plans for the Madras Day celebrations, and Pavithra’s talk was scheduled for sometime in August. Historian V. Sriram said Pavithra was an immensely talented, multi-faceted person. At the same time, she was sensitive and of a quiet disposition. Miniature illustrations Her various skills were truly amazing and one of her legacies is the amazing miniature illustrations she had done of heritage buildings in Chennai. “Her Madras Miniatures adorn the walls of many homes in the city. She used to participate in the Madras Day celebrations and give talks that were appreciated by all,” he said. Besides being an author and illustrator (she has done illustrations for several books), Pavithra believed in organic farming and dabbled in it for some time.

17 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC reverses acquittal of man who sexually abused child||The Madras High Court has reversed the acquittal of a person who subjected a two-year-old girl child to aggravated sexual assault. It impressed upon the need for trial courts and the police to handle with sensitivity such cases involving a victim of tender age and parents who are rustic, illiterate and innocent. Justice P. Velmurugan set aside Tiruvarur mahila court's September 27, 2018, verdict acquitting S. Prakash from the case booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of 2012. Allowing an appeal preferred by the victim's mother, the judge convicted him and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The judge also directed the State government to pay Rs. 1 lakh in compensation to the victim child. He lamented that neither the police had done a meticulous investigation nor the trial court had dealt with the case appropriately. Nevertheless, he found that the materials available on record were sufficient to convict the accused. The appellant's counsel, Deepika Murali, pointed out that the accused, the victim’s neighbour, had volunteered to take care of the child when her mother was taking her along to a shop on September 17, 2017. After the woman returned, she found the child weeping and complaining of pain on her vagina. Though semen was found in the child’s inner garments, the victim's mother did not choose to lodge a complaint the same day since her husband was not in town. It was only the next day, when the child complained of pain again, that she was admitted to a hospital and the police was informed, leading to the registration of a case. Since the medical examination was conducted five days after the incident, nothing significant could be discovered. Therefore, the trial court chose to acquit the accused on several grounds including delay in lodging the complaint and lack of medical evidence to support the case of the prosecution, the counsel said. Flimsy defence Further, Justice Velmurugan found that the convict’s counsel had taken up a “flimsy defence” by using the word semen having been wrongly typed in Tamil as ‘semman’ (meaning red soil) while recording the evidence of the victim’s mother, to claim that no semen had actually been discovered. Stating that the case against the accused could have become much stronger if the police had taken some efforts to tighten it, the judge said the trial courts should also be proactive and order reinvestigation in such cases instead of giving the benefit of the doubt to the accused because of the flaws committed by the prosecution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-reverses-acquittal-of-person-who-sexually-abused-a-two-year-old/article35376616.ece

At least 2,000 families in 10 settlements along the Cooum and 5,000 settlements along the Adyar are expected to be evicted shortly. Officials will talk to residents who oppose resettlement in locations such as Aminjikarai. At least 10 of the 60 settlements along the Cooum have resisted resettlement in the past few years.

Families living in settlements such as Moovendar Nagar and R.K. Nagar in front of the D.G. Vaishnav College have also refused to move. Of the 14,257 families along the Cooum, 12,302 families have been resettled. Enumeration of residents along the Buckingham Canal will begin after resettlement of families along the Cooum. Eco-restoration of Buckingham Canal is expected to be taken up after the resettlement of families. Lake encroached At least 2,000 families have been identified as encroachers of 55 acres of Kolathur lake. The encroachments on the lake have been a major cause of flooding during the northeast monsoon. Officials will make a decision on resettlement of the families shortly.

17 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Contractors told to speed up shifting of overhead cables under the ground||The project to shift overhead power lines underground is being put on the fast track by Tangedco, according to officials. Launched in 2019 as part of safety measures, the project was delayed because of COVID-19 with workers leaving for their native places due to the lockdown and the Assembly election. A senior official of Tangedco said the project was proposed to be taken up in extended areas of the Greater Chennai Corporation and in a few suburban localities identified as having a large residential population. Covering 12 divisions in north and south regions of Tangedco, the project was proposed to be carried out at a cost of Rs. 2,567 crore. Unlike in other places, Tangedco went for horizontal directional drilling (HDD), a trench-less technology, to avoid damaging the road. The HDD technology involves minimum road cutting, the official said. Tangedco had initially issued work orders only for Perambur and Tambaram with the project nearing completion in Poompuhar Nagar, Rajaji Nagar, Kolathur, Villivakkam and Sembium in Perambur division. In Tambaram division, work had been stalled because of delay in getting permission for road cutting. The power utility has resumed the work in Pallikaranai, Medavakkam, Chromepet, Keelkattalai and Selaiyur with the Pallavaram and Pammal sections soon to be taken up. Work orders have been issued for executing the project in three divisions, namely Avadi, Adyar and the Information Technology (IT) corridor. In the three divisions, work was progressing slowly until last month because of the lockdown announced for first and second waves of COVID-19 and the Assembly election. Workers are back The senior Tangedco official said because of the lockdown, workers from north India had left for their native places and returned only last month. Also as the work involved shutting power supply, the project was further delayed. Work in all the three divisions had resumed and the contractors had been asked to speed up the implementation with minimum disruption in power supply, he added. In the Avadi division, Puzhal, Kathirvedu, Pudur, Kamaraj Nagar, New Military Road and parts of Red Hills are being covered along with the IT corridor of Karapakkam, Sholinganallur, Kandanchavadi, and ECR areas of Palavakkam and Neelankarai. Work is in progress in Velachery and Taramani too. Tangedco proposes to transfer overhead high tension and low tension cables for around 3,250 km to under the ground. Of this, cable network stretching to 1,600 km had been shifted underground using horizontal directional drilling, a trench-less technology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/contractors-told-to-speed-up-shifting-of-overhead-cables-under-the-ground/article35376636.ece

Speaking to reporters in Delhi after leading the delegation of representatives from parties in Tamil Nadu, Minister for Water Resources Duraimurugan elaborated on the meeting and said: “So the meeting was a success.” When the delegation asked the Union Minister about the reported approval given to Karnataka over the proposal, Mr. Sekhawat replied in the negative, Mr. Duraimurugan said. To a concern raised by the delegation over appointing a full-time chairman for the CWMA, the Union Minister said a suitable candidate was yet to be found. The meeting with the Union Minister at the Shram Shakti Bhawan in Delhi lasted about 45 minutes. The delegation from Tamil Nadu strongly urged the Centre not to grant permission to Karnataka’s proposal for the construction of a dam across the Cauvery river at Mekedatu, and handed over a copy of a resolution passed during a meeting last Monday against Karnataka’s proposal. Representatives in the delegation were: R.S. Bharathi (DMK); D. Jayakumar (AIADMK); A. Gopanna (Congress); G.K. Mani (PMK); Vaiko (MDMK); Thol. Thirumavalavan (VCK); R.C. Paul Kanagaraj (BJP); N.

They have been booked under Sections 294(b) (Uttering obscene words), 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) and 420 (Cheating) of IPC. The complainant Bhuvanesh Kumar is BJP Arni town president and a businessman. He alleged that Vijayaraman had introduced him to Narothaman, who claimed to be the PA of a Union Minister. ‘Rs. 1 crore demanded’ He and his father demanded Rs. 1 crore in cash for getting party ticket either for himself or his cousin. He gave Rs. 50 lakh cash as advance at a hotel in T. Nagar on March 12 before the BJP announced the list of its candidates. He was supposed to pay the rest of the amount after his candidature was announced. When his name was not on the list, Bhuvnesh Kumar contacted Narothaman who told him that he or his cousin could contest from Tiruvannamalai. But their names never appeared in the list officially released by the party. The accused failed to get the seat as promised and delayed returning the payment, the complainant alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-book-four-bjp-men-for-cheating-arni-unit-chief/article35376526.ece

Sarthak, an NGO working to empower persons with disabilities (PwDs) through various activities, has called for accurate national disability statistics to help identify the needs and the amount of institutional support required by PwDs. Most PwDs do not have access to quality healthcare, transport facilities, education, training and employment, the organisation has said. Accurate national disability statistics are important in ensuring the overall well-being of the disabled population and in monitoring trends in the prevalence of disabilities, the organisation's founder Jitender Aggarwal said. Sarthak has suggested to the Census Department to include all 21 disabilities as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016; a nationwide awareness campaign to stress the importance of identifying PwDs; social campaigns to de-stigmatise PwDs; use of digital mediums and technology to carry out the surveys and to collaborate with various stakeholders during the data collection process. “Accurate national disability statistics are essential for securing the rights of persons with disabilities,” said Mr. Aggarwal, founder, Sarthak Educational Trust.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accurate-national-disability-statistics-essential/article35376529.ece

17 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Lone male elephants involved in 63% of straying incidents, says Forest Dept. study||Lone male elephants constituted 63% of the total number of instances of elephants straying out of forests in Coimbatore Forest Division for crop-raiding between November 2020 and June 2021, according to a recent analysis by the Forest Department. Team prepares report A team of officials comprising Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle) I. Anwardeen, Coimbatore District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh and Assistant Conservators of Forests C. Dinesh Kumar and M. Senthil Kumar prepared the report along with biologists J. Peter and M. Naveen. The data on such incidents, collected on a daily basis by the Border Night Patrolling Team personnel who drove back the animals, was analysed to identify the reasons for their venturing out of the forests. In the eight-month period for which the data was analysed, female elephants that strayed out of the forests in herds constituted 16%, male elephants in herds were 14% and female elephants with its calves that strayed out were six per cent. Female elephants Out of the total straying incidents, lone female elephants constituted only one per cent. “As females are not known to move alone, it is assumed that these are sick animals left by a herd to fend for themselves,” the report noted. Out of the seven forest ranges in Coimbatore Forest Division, 28% of the total straying and crop-raiding incidents occurred within Periyanaickenpalayam forest range between November 2020 and June 2021. This was followed by Coimbatore forest range with 18% of the straying incidents, Sirumugai forest range with 17%, Mettupalayam with 14%, Boluvampatti with 11% and Karamadai with nine per cent. Madukkarai forest range saw the least number of straying incidents where only 3% of the total straying incidents were recorded in the given period. Peak According to the report, the number of lone male elephants straying out was at its peak in the first three months of the eight-month period – 131 tuskers in November 2020, 125 in December 2020 and 134 in January this year. There seemed to be a drop in the next three months, where only 88, 65 and 70 tuskers strayed out from forests in February, March and April respectively. In May and June, the numbers rose again as 108 and 111 lone male elephants strayed out for crop-raiding. Classification Crop-raiding by lone male elephants is generally classified into habitual (tusker meets most of its annual food requirement through this approach), opportunistic (raiding happens due to chance or inducement of food) and obligatory (sick elephants due to inability to forage by ranging long distance tend to stay near water bodies during the day and raid crops in the night), the report said. Obligatory crop-raiding is also observed in female elephants with calves, as the elephants prefer to spend minimum energy for food to subsist its calves through lactation, according to the report. Conflict monitoring Mr. Anwardeen said that this analysis was a part of an intensive elephant conflict monitoring system by the Forest Department to document and assess the behaviours of the elephants. “Whatever we understood, we decided to convey it to the stakeholders of the landscape,” he said, adding that long-term monitoring would be undertaken to develop appropriate mitigation strategies that were site-specific and season-specific.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lone-male-elephants-involved-in-63-of-straying-incidents-says-forest-dept-study/article35376268.ece
17 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to install 12 smart poles across the city||How about pushing a button on a smart pole in the city to draw the Coimbatore Corporation’s attention to report a grievance. Well, this is likely to be a reality in the immediate future as the Corporation is getting ready to roll out the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) project. Under the Central Government’s Smart Cities Mission, the civic body is implementing the project at Rs. 11.50 crore. Sources said the Corporation would soon install 12 such smart poles across the city. The poles would have smart cameras, rain gauge, wi-fi transmitters, public address system and a few more features. They would also have push buttons that the public could use to draw the civic body’s attention to grievances or problems. Personnel at the ICCC would pass the people’s grievances or problems to the field officials concerned and report to the senior officials the progress made in redressing those issues. The sources said the contractor executing the ICCC project had identified the 12 locations for erecting the smart poles – R.S. Puram, Gandhipuram, Ukkadam, a few lake fronts, Singanallur and a few other places – but they were subject to approval by the Commissioner. Besides providing a public interface platform, the ICCC was also working on integrating onto a digital platform the Corporation’s various activities– water supply, street light, grievance redress management, etc. At the touch of a button, the senior officials would be able to see the current condition or status of the civic body’s various services on a dashboard, the sources said and cited knowing about faulty streetlights on a real time basis or choked water supply lines or the location of its vehicles, etc. as the benefits. The ICCC by helping the officials take decision or respond quickly based on real time data would help the Corporation better deliver services. After the installation of 12 poles, the Corporation was likely to increase the number, as had happened in a few other cities, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-install-12-smart-poles-across-the-city/article35376642.ece

17 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Tea prices show signs of stabilisation||Tea prices are stabilising during the last two auction sessions and there are signs of demand picking up, said M. Balaji, Executive Director of Tea Board of India, south zonal office. The average tea price realised was Rs. 85 to Rs. 90 a kg at the auctions and these prices were better than the prices realised in 2019. Last year, the demand was good, both in international and domestic markets and hence the prices were higher, he said. Ramesh Bhojarajan, former president of the Nilgiris Bought Leaf Tea Manufacturers’ Association, said that in May tea was sold at the auctions at Rs. 110 to Rs. 120 a kg. The prices for lower grade tea had fallen to Rs. 80 to Rs. 85 a kg now. In June first week, the prices dropped by Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a kg. The drop was not so high now. Last year, supply from north India was low and south Indian tea had good demand. The prices went up to Rs. 170 a kg or more for tea in May last year. This year, the supply was good from north India and in the international market also. And, the demand for tea had not picked up in the domestic market as it did last year. However, in the recent days, there were signs of stabilisation of prices and movement had picked up for exports and domestic market at the current prices, he said. The Tea Board should take up promotional activities to increase consumption in the domestic market, Mr. Ramesh said. Mr. Balaji said several factors were impacting prices this year. Almost 50 % of south Indian tea went for exports every year. This year, international demand was down for the last three months for many reasons and hence, supply to the domestic market had increased. “Despite the factors that are impacting prices, there is no cause for alarm. But, we should watch the market and prices for some more days,” he said. Founder president of Nilgiris Nelikolu Micro and Small Tea Growers and Farmers Development Society Hubbathalai N. Sivan said the factories usually paid more than the minimum price. “The growers, especially the small growers, have been asking for Rs. 30 a kg of green leaves,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tea-prices-show-signs-of-stabilisation/article35376266.ece

17 July 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||More facilities at PHC sought||Communist Party of India (CPI) has urged the State government to install an X-ray machine and conduct post-mortems at the Government Upgraded Primary Health Centre at Talavadi. The party’s Talavadi West Union members met recently and discussed various issues related to the welfare of the people. The meeting was chaired by Chikalli Madhavasamy in which S. Mohan Kumar, State committee member, and functionaries took part. Various resolutions were passed in the meeting. A resolution said that in 2015, Sathyamangalam taluk was bifurcated and Talavadi taluk was formed. However, after six years, the hospital continues to be a primary health centre and was not upgraded as a taluk hospital. Access to the healthcare system continues to be a major concern for people in the hills who, in the absence of facilities, have to depend on hospitals at Chamrajanagar in Karnataka. “The X-ray machine at the centre was not functioning for many years and patients have to depend on the sole private hospital in the hills”, the resolution said. Another resolution said that a few years ago, post-mortems were conducted at the centre that was stopped for unknown reasons. If a person dies of animal attack or in an accident, the body had to be shifted to Sathyamangalam taluk hospital, located 60 km away. Also, passing through 27 hairpin bends on Dhimbam Ghat Road is always a tedious journey. Or else, post-mortem had to be conducted at Chamrajanagar, the resolution said. Hence, steps should be taken to conduct post-mortem at the centre and also upgrade it as a taluk hospital, the resolution added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-facilities-at-phc-sought/article35376287.ece

17 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TAMIL NADU||Centre notifies purview of Krishna, Godavari Boards||Seven years after their constitution under the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, the Centre has notified the purview of Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards (KRMB and GRMB) transferring the operation of all projects, including hydel generation, in the two river basins in AP and Telangana to the boards, effective from October 14. Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) issued the Gazette notification late on Thursday night bringing 35 projects and their components such as head works in the Krishna Basin and 71 in the Godavari Basin in the two Telugu States under the boards’ purview empowering them to supervise the operation of head works of barrages, dams, reservoirs, regulating structures, part of canal network, water transmission lines and the power houses at the projects. The notification assumes significance in the backdrop of escalation in the dispute between the two States over project works and hydel generation at Srisailam, Nagarjunsagar and Pulichintala reservoirs. While AP has been demanding notification of the boards’ purview for long, Telangana has been opposing it on the premise that handing over operation of projects without clarity on water share of the two States would not serve the purpose. Defusing tensions “Although, the Centre’s act is aimed at defusing the increasing tension between the two States over water sharing and power generation, it is likely to sail through murky waters since regulation of water — project wise supply for irrigation and drinking needs as also hydel generation — is going to be a tough job in the absence of clarity on water share of the two States as also the project-wise allocation,” a retired senior engineer who spent long years at one of the common projects said. The notification issued by MoJS has also made it clear that “mere inclusion of any unapproved projects in the schedules of boards’ purview does not confer them the status of deemed approval and the State governments shall get the unapproved projects appraised and approved as per the provisions of the Reorganisation Act within six months from July 15.” If approvals are not obtained within the stipulated time, such completed unapproved projects shall “cease to operate”. According to the Gazette notification, the list of unapproved projects in the Krishna Basin include — Telugu Ganga, Veligonda, Handri-Niva, Muchumarri, Galeru-Nagari, Siddapuram and Guru Raghavendra (all in A.P.), Srisailam Left Bank Canal, Kalwakurthy, Nettempadu, Palamuru-Rangareddy, Dindi, AMRP, Bhakta Ramadasu and Thummilla (all Telangana), Muniyeru (joint) and some projects taken up for diversion of Godavari water to Krishna Basin. Similarly, unapproved projects in the Godavari Basin as per the notification are — Pattiseema, Purushothapatnam, Chintalapudi and Venktanagaram (all in A.P.), Kanthanapally, Kaleshwaram (additional capacity), Pranahitha, Gudem, Mukteshwar, Sitarama Ramappa-Pakhal, Tupakulagudem, Modikuntavagu, Chowtpally Hanumanth Reddy and Kandukurthi (in Telangana).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-notifies-purview-of-krishna-godavari-boards/article35376031.ece

17 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Take steps to maintain temple land: HC directs Collector||Taking serious note of the fact that the land belonging to the Kothandaramasamy Temple in Y. Othakadai was being used to dump garbage and for open defecation, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed the Madurai Collector to form a team comprising experts in order to educate the people. A Division Bench of Justices T. S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi observed that people have to be sensitised. The court also took note of the fact that sewage was let into a PWD canal that was abutting the temple land and directed the authorities to take action against the people involved in such activities. The court directed the authorities to conduct periodic inspections in order to ensure that the temple land and the canal were properly maintained. The court hoped that the menace would be stopped. The authorities could use pamphlets to educate the people, the court said. The court was informed that the temple land measuring 9.49 acres was fenced now. But, the local people were still trying to use the land to dump garbage and were letting sewage in the canal. The court said the authorities concerned could cut off the water supply of the people who indulged in such activities. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by K. Kavitha, a resident of Y. Othakadai. The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities concerned to clean and maintain the canal and the temple land. She complained that meat, fish and poultry stalls were dumping waste into the canal and stench emanated from the land. But for placing a board, the temple authorities have not taken any steps to maintain the land. Despite earlier directions from the High Court to clean and maintain the canal and temple land, no steps were taken, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-steps-to-maintain-temple-land-pwd-canal-hc-directs-collector/article35376608.ece

17 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||eNAM helps farmers earn better profits||The National Agriculture Market or eNAM - an online trading platform for agricultural commodities - which has been functioning in Madurai and Usilampatti regulated markets, is helpful for farmers in earning better prices for their commodities. The eNAM scheme was being implemented in the Madurai regulated market since March 2018. Similarly, the scheme has been implemented in Usilampatti regulated market from April 2020. A total of 2,740 farmers and 76 traders have registered with the regulated market in Madurai. In Usilampatti regulated market, 141 farmers and 21 traders have registered. Madurai market committee secretary V. Mercy Jeyarani said that the scheme was being implemented with an aim to help farmers earn higher profits. During times when there was a lower price for commodities in the market, the farmers could store their produce in the godown at the regulated market and later sell it to the traders for higher profits. Under this scheme, the sample of agricultural produce was collected from farmers and given to the traders. The traders would then assess the produce and bid the price that they were willing to pay through the eNAM application. “At the Madurai regulated market, there is a special lab which will assess the physical and other parameters of the commodities. Based on this, an analytical report will be uploaded on the online portal everyday. This will help traders to assess the quality of the produce,” said Ms. Jeyarani. The farmers can sell their produce to the trader who has placed the highest bidding amount. There will be no middlemen or intermediary between farmers and traders. Till date, 2,190 metric tonnes of paddy, maize and pearl millet of 205 farmers were sold through the Madurai regulated market. A total of 405 traders have bought these commodities for more than Rs. 4 crore. In Usilampatti regulated market, 81.93 metric tonnes of paddy, maize and pearl millet, of 35 farmers were sold. A total of 44 traders have bought the produce for over Rs. 18 lakh. Inter-mandi trade and trade with mandis belonging to other States have also happened. Proposals have also been sent to introduce the eNAM scheme in Vadipatti and Tirumangalam regulated markets, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/enam-helps-farmers-earn-better-profits/article35376691.ece
17 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Acquitted persons can redact name from ruling: HC||Coming across a case in which a man acquitted of all charges sought to redact his name from the court order to protect his right to privacy, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed that there is a prima facie case made out by the petitioner and he is entitled to redacting his name from the judgment. Referring to the landmark Supreme Court judgment in Puttaswamy vs Union of India on the right to privacy, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that if the essence of the judgment was applied to the case at hand, even a person, accused of committing an offence and acquitted of all charges, would be entitled to redacting his name from the court order in order to protect his right of privacy. “Today, the world is literally under the grips of social media. The background of a person is assessed by everyone by entering into Google search... There is no assurance that the information that is secured from Google is authentic. However, it creates the first impression, and depending upon the data that is provided, it will make or mar the character of a person in the eyes of society,” the judge said. Further, he said, the legislature had so far enacted laws protecting the identity of victims who were women and children, and their names were not reflected in any court order. Therefore, their names got redacted automatically and no one would be able to identify the person who was a victim in a given case. This sufficiently protected the person and privacy of the person. This right had not been extended to an accused person who was acquitted of all charges. Despite acquittal, the name of the accused got reflected in the order. The petitioner faced criminal proceedings for an offence under Sections 417 (cheating) and 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code. He was convicted and sentenced by the trial court. The petitioner appealed against this judgment at the High Court. The court acquitted the petitioner of all charges. The court also took note of the fact that the Delhi High Court had passed an interim order in a similar issue, directing the websites concerned to redact the name of the petitioner. The case was adjourned till July 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/acquitted-persons-can-redact-name-from-ruling-hc/article35376240.ece

17 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||U.T. gets Rs. 517 crore as first tranche of GST compensation||The Union Territory has received Rs. 517 crore as compensation to offset the GST shortfall for the year, amid a troubling decline in revenue and heavy losses inflicted by the extended run of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fund allotted for Puducherry was part of an estimated Rs. 75,000 crore released on Thursday by the Finance Ministry to the States and Union Territories. When contacted, Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said the amount was released as a first tranche of the total resource gap estimation to the tune of Rs. 1,050 crore. “Now, that the first tranche of the GST compensation has been released, the rest of the amount is expected to come in during the second half of the fiscal,” he said. The Finance Ministry had released the funds as a cover for the decline in GST revenues during a downturn in the economy, precipitated further by pandemic-related losses. The funding is in addition to the normal GST compensation being released every two months out of the actual cess collection. According to a Finance Ministry statement, this follows the decision at the 43rd GST Council Meeting held on May 28 that the Central government would borrow Rs. 1.59 lakh crore and release it to the States and Union Territories on a back-to-back basis to meet the resource gap. The amount is as per the principles adopted for a similar facility in FY 2020-21, where Rs. 1.1 lakh crore was released to the States under a similar arrangement. The Rs. 1.59 lakh crore would be over and above the compensation in excess of Rs. 1 lakh crore (based on cess collection) that is estimated to be released to the States/UTs with legislature during this financial year. In the Ministry’s reckoning, the sum total of Rs. 2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in 2021-22. The release of GST compensation has been funded from borrowings of the Government of India in 5-year securities, totalling Rs. 68,500 crore and 2-year securities for Rs. 6,500 crore issued in the current financial year, at a Weighted Average Yield of 5.6 and 4.25% per annum respectively. The funds for Puducherry represented a share of the total estimated shortfall for the year. According to the breakdown of the amount, Rs. 472.19 crore is the amount released for the 5-year tenure while Rs. 44.81 crore is for the 2-year tenure. The Ministry said it had frontloaded the release of assistance under the back-to-back loan facility during 2021-22 to the tune of almost 50% of the total shortfall for the entire year in a single instalment to help the States/UTs formulate a robust response to the COVID-19 situation and to step up capital expenditure. The balance amount would be released in the second half of 2021-22 in steady instalments, the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-gets-rs-517-crore-as-first-tranche-of-gst-compensation/article35376536.ece

17 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Centre profiteering from oil price hike: Cong. MP||Congress Member of Parliament S. Jothimani has accused the Centre of making huge profits from the frequent hikes in prices of petroleum products. Addressing a press conference here along with senior Puducherry Congress leaders, the MP said the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government had made huge profits due to the periodic hike in petrol and diesel prices. “The profiteering by Centre has not benefited the common man. The huge tax collection has only benefited the BJP and the profits gained were used to help corporate houses and for election purposes. The money gained was used to topple Opposition-ruled State governments,” she alleged. She said there was no point in asking the State governments to cut excise duty as the Centre had gained the most from the hike in duty. There was also no point in making in any comparison with the UPA government, she added. The MP said in 2014 while the Centre collected Rs. 6.45 per litre as excise duty, the State governments collected Rs. 3.03 per litre for petrol. In 2021, the Centre collected Rs. 32.33 per litre while the State governments collected 57 paise for petrol. The comparison of the share of excise duty collected for diesel also gave a similar figure, she said, adding that the Centre had gained the biggest share from the hike in the price of petrol and diesel.  Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, Member of Parliament V. Vaithilingam, PCC chief A.V.

17 July 2021||Ramanathapuram,TAMIL NADU||We will find a solution to problems being faced by fishermen: Minister||The demands of the fishermen community here would be looked into with the objective of not only giving relief, but finding permanent solutions wherever possible, assured Minister for Fisheries, Fishermen Welfare and Animal Husbandry Anitha R. Radhakrishnan here on Friday. Speaking to reporters, he said that the Ministers and officials have been directed to understand problems, inspect and interact with stakeholders. He said that the fishermen have demanded a fair pricing for their catch. On most occasions, the middlemen made money and the fishermen got paltry sums and this disparity would definitely be wiped off, he said. From the infrastructure point of view, the fishermen have demanded a storage facility. Currently, they were forced to sell at a price fixed by the exporters. They have also asked for a fish landing centre at Rameswaram on the lines of the one at Kundukal. A detailed study would be made on the financial aspects and the implementation methodology, the Minister said. On the need to enhance financial assistance to the fishermen during the annual ban period, he said that it would be considered after discussing the same with the Chief Minister. The Minister said that the Ramanathapuram MLA Kadarbasha Muthuramalingam has made a representation for establishing a Fisheries College here. It will also be considered on a positive note. On the issues relating to fishermen being humiliated by the Sri Lankan Navy, he said that the CM was aware of the problem and he would take it up with the Union government. Collector J. U.

The school has managed to increase student strength year-on-year and with the total strength crossing 600 students, school authorities are now working on approaching the State government for increasing classrooms and strength of teachers. A. Banumathi, headmistress, said that in 2019, the total strength was 340 students. During 2020, it increased to 475 and now 620 students. Ms. Banumathi said that teachers from the school went door-to-door and distributed notices to improve admission. She added that two hoardings were also placed near the school announcing the admissions. A teacher from the school said that the improvement in school infrastructure and the pandemic may have contributed to the increase in strength as over 100 students have joined here leaving private schools. “Almost all classrooms have smart televisions and there are better facilities for sports here. Students from as far as Steel Plant have got admission in the school”, said a teacher. School authorities said that they would now need six teachers and five classrooms additionally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pu-school-sets-record-in-admissions/article35376278.ece

According to police, the deceased, working as an acting driver for tourist cab operators, had taken loans from local residents a few months ago. Recently the lenders had asked him to repay the loan with interest amounting to Rs. 40,000. Stunned by the demand, Subramanian tried to settle the issue with the lenders through some prominent persons in the locality and finally it was decided that the issue would be settled if Subramanian repaid Rs. 15,000 to the lenders on or before July 15. One of the lenders called on Subramanian’s family on Thursday when he was not at available at his residence and insisted that he must honour his commitment without fail. When Subramanian returned home, his wife Sumathi informed him about it which subsequently led to a wordy duel between the couple. Later, Sumathi left home in anger to her relative’s house in the same locality and Subramanian is said to have ended his life on Thursday night. On receiving information, Madukkur police seized Subramanian’s body and registered a case.

17 July 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Canal link to be studied to meet demand of farmers||The long-pending demand from farmers in Budalur block seems to have attracted the attention of the official machinery with Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver making an inspection visit recently to Sengipatti where two irrigation canals - Uyyakondan extension canal (UEC) and Kattalai High Level Canal (KHLC) - entered Thanjavur district from Tiruchi. While the UEC branches off from the Cauvery at Pettavaithalai and fills up the Vazhavanthankottai lake near Tiruverumbur on the border of Tiruchi-Thanjavur districts, the KHLC branches off from the Cauvery at Mayanur to fill up Poigaikudi lake near Tiruverumbur. These two canals enter Thanjavur district through Budalur block and feed 84 lakes and ponds in Budalur and Sengipatti areas. However, the flow into and subsequent release of water from the Vazhavanthankottai and Poigaikudi hugely depend on the off-take of water flowing through these canals by farmers in Tiruchi district. Thus, the farmers who used to take up paddy cultivation in about 8,000 acres in Budalur and Sengipatti areas land in trouble every year in view of the paltry realisation of water in the above-said lakes, sources said. Hence the local farmers and farmers’ organisations in Budalur block were demanding that the two canals be linked with the Grand Anicut Canal passing through Budalur block at a distance of fewer than five kilometres from these two irrigation canals. Their plea seems to have finally attracted the attention of the officials with the Collector making a spot study on Wednesday to explore the possibility of implementing the suggestion put forth by the farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/canal-link-to-be-studied-to-meet-demand-of-farmers/article35376226.ece

17 July 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘Entrepreneurs Clinic’ set up||The Thoothukudi District Tiny and Small Industries Association (THUDITSIA), District Industries Centre and the Entrepreneurship Development Cell have established ‘Entrepreneurs Clinic’ at THUDITSIA’s office in Muththammal Colony here to encourage and guide the aspiring entrepreneurs to start their own business modules in the town. The clinic will sort out the problems being encountered by the entrepreneurs. Addressing a meeting after inaugurating the clinic, Collector K. Senthil Raj said the objective was to encourage and guide entrepreneurs willing to start their own business ventures in the town having several advantages like Chennai with excellent road, rail, air and port connectivity. The abundant availability of quality power generated from wind, solar and coal was another advantage. With the ongoing expansion works and night landing facilities, the Thoothukudi Airport is all set to receive wide-bodied aircraft and handle more flights everyday. While sufficient quantity of water from the Tamirabharani could be drawn for industrial purposes, water recycling system to be created in SIPCOT Industrial Complex would be an added advantage. “We’ve drawn plans to start a mega furniture park in the SIPCOT Industrial Complex. Steps are being taken to create a ‘Food Park’ near Thoothukudi while knitting industries are coming up on the Thoothukudi – Madurai Industrial Corridor. A mega oil refinery is to come up near Thoothukudi with foreign investments. Against these encouraging developments, new entrepreneurs should come out with their own ideas and business ventures for which the ‘Entrepreneurs Clinic’ will be a catalyzer,” he said. He exhorted the skilled and qualified youth to make use of the entrepreneurship development programmes of the Union and the State Governments that carry attractive subsidies. He informed that 30% of the waste getting generated in the matchstick industry was being used by the locals and the remaining 70% waste would be given to the paper mills. General Manager of District Industries Centre Swarnalatha, president of THUDITSIA, general secretary Raj were present. Later, he inaugurated a special camp for vaccinating the differently-abled in the presence of Corporation Commissioner T.

A lot of parameters were involved in the resurfacing work as it involved the safety of flights. The resurfacing works were being done with a combination of bitumen and graded metal. Mr. Sri Krishna said the project suffered setbacks during the course of its execution due to COVID-19 lockdown and the restrictions clamped in view of the spread of the viral infection which led to short supply of bitumen and labour issues besides inclement weather conditions on and off as well.  Rs. 18-crore work The resurfacing works which were being executed at a cost of Rs. 18 crore were initially carried out during night hours. The entire project would be completed before this month-end, Mr. Krishna said. The resurfacing of the Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta taxiways had been completed. Resurfacing works in the link between the isolation bay and the main runway and in the link between the parallel taxiway and the runway were also over, he said.

17 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Free data scheme must continue, say teachers||College teachers are curious to know if the State government will retain the scheme of free 2GB data per day to students initiated by the previous regime. The scheme, which became operational from the beginning of this year for four months till completion of the 2020-21 academic year, benefited 10 lakh students to attend online classes and take up examinations. The scheme covered all students enrolled in government and government-aided arts and science colleges, polytechnics, engineering and scholarship-funded private institutions. The government is yet to take a stand on whether or not to continue with online classes for the academic year 2021-22 or to restart offline classes. “The admission process for undergraduate programmes is yet to begin. Yet, it would be a huge relief for students and teachers if the government makes an announcement on the status of the scheme beforehand,” said David Livingston, zonal president, Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers’ Association. Continuity of the scheme, in any case, will be of high utility to students now that the University Grants Commission (UGC) has recommended ‘blended learning,’ college heads say. Blended learning Blended Learning, the concept note of UGC states, transforms the teacher’s role from knowledge provider to coach and mentor. It is what makes the classroom interaction more student-driven, bottom-up and customised, it states. The important features of blended learning, according to UGC, constitute increased student engagement in learning, enhanced teacher-student interaction, time management and flexibility, improved student-learning outcomes, more flexible teaching and learning environment and better opportunities for experiential learning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/free-data-scheme-must-continue-say-teachers/article35376228.ece

Poonniammal sells flowers for a living. They reside in Nellivasal Nadu, a small tribal village on Javadi Hills in Tirupattur and belong to the Malayali tribal community. On Thursday, they received community certificates for their children from the district administration, led by the Collector Amar Kushwaha. They have been waiting for the certificate for more than three years. The pandemic further delayed the process. The easing of lockdown restrictions helped these tribals to get the certificates to enrol their wards in the lone Forest Government Higher Secondary School and obtain benefits of welfare schemes. “Apart from field-level reports from the VAO and the Tahsildar, I visited their hamlets on the hillock to verify their claims for community certificates. Most of the beneficiaries are students. Due to the pandemic, certificates were given to their parents,” P. Alarmelmangai, Sub-Collector, Tirupattur, told The Hindu . Nellivasal Nadu is one of the 36 villages in Javadi Hills. These villages, located 35 km from the foothills of the town, come under Tirupattur taluk, one of the four taluks in the newly formed district. On average, each village has around 9,000 people. Most residents belong to the Malayali tribal community, who depend on farming and cattle rearing for their livelihood. Apart from paddy, they cultivate tamarind, jackfruit, mango, lemon and coconut for at least two seasons every year. Community certificate is crucial for the residents here to enrol their children in the school and avail themselves of government schemes. More than 2,000 applications were received from the villages in the hillock for the past three years. Of these, only 500 applicants have been scrutinised so far. Among them, 230 people, mainly from Nellivasal Nadu, Pungampattu Nadu and Pudur Nadu villages, were given certificates in the first phase on Thursday. Tiruvannamalai MP C.N. Annadurai, Jolarpet MLA K. Devaraji, and Tirupattur MLA A.

He was speaking after coming out of the Naganur Rudrakshi Mutt, along with M.B. Patil, former Minister, and other Congress leaders. He responded to a query posed by journalists to Mr. Patil and said “Now we are suffering from problems including some leaders creating hurdles for other Congress leaders. This should stop. Once this stops, we will come to power automatically.” Asked who was creating problems for their party colleagues, he smiled and said: “You know it very well’’. “We are not suffering from any other problems. If we remain united, we will come to power. There is no doubt about it,’’ he said. Lakshmi Hebbalkar, Congress MLA, refused to respond to the veteran leader’s comments. “He is a very senior and highly respected leader. I will not comment on it. I will only say that the Congress will make all attempts to woo the Lingayat voters to our side,’’ she said. Mr. Patil said that the Congress had never favoured the trend of some persons declaring themselves as leaders or candidates for Chief Minister or other positions. “There cannot be any self-declared leaders in the Congress. It would be wrong to say that I am the leader of the Lingayats in the State or that I am a CM candidate. If would be proper if the people say that. Anyway, our party has never entertained such trends.’ “Our present focus is to bring the party to power. The party should win 125-150 seats in the 2023 Assembly polls, and then the party high command should collect the opinions of the legislators and choose a leader.” To a query, Mr. Patil said it was wrong to say that there was discontent in the Lingayat community that the Congress had not given enough representation to its leaders. High command informed “However, we have carried our concerns to senior Congress leaders like Randeep Surjewala, asking the party high command to give higher responsibilities to Lingayat leaders.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/infighting-in-congress-must-stop-says-hukkeri/article35376307.ece

The Nrupatunga Hill is an asset to the region. Sadly, its biodiversity is reducing. It has to be protected by declaring it as a biodiversity heritage spot. Local waterbodies and flora and fauna should be preserved, he said. He was speaking at a meeting of officers at the Hubballi-Dharwad city corporation. He asked officers to encourage eco-tourism. It could start with conservation and development of lakes. We have to take steps to preserve waterbodies without damaging their original nature. Steps should be taken to stop waste water entering lakes. Less of concrete should be used to develop the lakes and promote marine life, he said. He asked officers to retain green cover in the city while implementing smart city projects. Funds should be released to increase green cover, he said. He asked officers to take up afforestation activities by bringing in saplings from private nurseries if needed. Officers have told me that the city corporation has several gardens with a total area of 300 acres. That land should be covered with plants, he said. He asked officers to protect the lake in Sadhanakeri, named after Da Ra Bendre. Corporation Commissioner Suresh Itnal said the city had taken up afforestation in Tolankere. As many as 120 of the 524 parks and gardens in the twin cities have been developed. There were 35 lakes and tanks in the twin cities, but only Unakal lake and Tolankere were under the corporation’s control. They were being developed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/declare-nrupatunga-hill-as-a-biodiversity-heritage-spot/article35376303.ece

17 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||We will execute Mekedatu project ‘cent per cent’, says CM||Responding strongly to an all-party delegation of Tamil Nadu urging the Centre to prevent Karnataka from going ahead with the Mekedatu balancing reservoir project, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday assured people of the State that his government would execute the project completely. “I assure people of Karnataka that we will execute the Mekedatu project cent per cent,” Mr. Yediyurappa told reporters in New Delhi before meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss with him about the clearances related to the project. “We have already convinced Tamil Nadu that Mekedatu project will not affect their interests. I have even written in this regard to them. But somehow, they have remained stubborn,” he said. Scope as per law “However, we have scope as per law to take up Mekedatu project. I will discuss everything and make efforts beyond my capacity to implement the project. Let there be no confusion in this regard,” he said, while making it clear that the project would benefit both the States. Earlier, members of an all-party delegation from Tamil Nadu who met Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Delhi, said the Centre had assured them that Karnataka would not be allowed to carry out any construction on the Mekedatu dam project on the Cauvery until approvals were granted by the Central Water Commission and the Cauvery Water Management Authority. Meanwhile, Mr. Yediyurappa, who arrived in Delhi on a two-day visit, said he would hold consultations on Saturday on development works related to Karnataka with the newly appointed Ministers from the State. He said he would also meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other senior leaders before returning to the State on Saturday evening. Mr. Yediyurappa’s meeting with the Prime Minister lasted barely for about 10 minutes. After the meeting, the Chief Minister told reporters that he had sought Central assistance from the Prime Minister for various projects being taken up in Karnataka and that he had responded positively. A release from his office said, Mr. Yediyurappa requested the Prime Minister to declare Upper Bhadra project as a national project and also sought financial assistance of Rs. 6,000 crore for Bengaluru Peripheral Ring Road project. Mekedatu project and establishing the U.S. Consulate were also discussed, stated the release. Political speculations When asked about speculations of a possible leadership change, Mr. Yediyurappa said he was not aware of such things. His Delhi visit had created curiosity in the wake of demand by a section of the party leaders that there should be a leadership change. Speculations were rife that Mr. Yediyurappa may try to flex muscles and silence his detractors by appealing to the party central leaders to allow him to reshuffle his Ministry. He is expected to make the pitch on Saturday. But it remains to be seen how the party central leadership would respond to his plea, as some of the party old-timers reportedly want a change of guard.  We have already convinced Tamil Nadu that Mekedatu project will not affect their interests. I have even written in this regard to them. But somehow, they have remained stubborn. B.S.

Yediyurappa on Friday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allocate at least 1.5 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine per month to Karnataka. He made the appeal during a videoconference chaired by the Prime Minister to interact with Chief Ministers of all States to take stock of the COVID-19 situation. The Prime Minister asked the States to take precautions in the wake of an increase in the number of cases in Europe and other countries. Briefing the Prime Minister about the preparations made by Karnataka to tackle the third wave, Mr. Yediyurappa said the State needs five lakh doses of vaccine a day. So far, 2.62 crore doses have been used in Karnataka, he pointed out. The Chief Minister said the number of COVID-19 cases had reduced to around 1,900 a day in Karnataka, and around 400 in Bengaluru. The test positivity rate had declined to 1.42% while mortality rate reduced to 1.25%. He said the State government had given freedom to Deputy Commissioners to take a call on restrictions to be imposed in their respective districts based on test positivity rate, number of new cases, and recommendations of the technical advisory committee. He said as part of preparations to handle the third wave, the number of oxygenated beds, ventilator beds, and paediatric ICUs were being increased in all health centres. The necessary equipment for treatment was being purchased, besides setting up new RT-PCR and genome sequencing laboratories. He appealed to the Centre to provide 800 neonatal and paediatric ventilators under the PM CARES fund. Mr. Yediyurappa requested the Prime Minister to allocate oxygen production centres with a capacity of 40 PSA to taluk hospitals and decentralise the system of allocation of liquid medical oxygen. He also sought increase in the allocation of Amphotericin-B used for treating mucormycosis and IVIG for children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-appeals-to-pm-to-allocate-15-cr-doses-of-vaccine-a-month/article35376207.ece
17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Urban-rural vaccination difference only 2%, govt. tells HC||The State government on Friday told the High Court of Karnataka that there is only 2% difference between urban and the rural areas in administering of COVID-19 vaccine doses. Of the total 2,57,79,659 doses administered in the State, 1,25,78,804 (49%) have been administered in rural areas, and 1,32,00,855 (51%) in urban areas as of July 12, according to a statement filed before the court. Also, the government said that 17,786 vaccination centres have been registered on the CoWIN portal, out of which 11,267 are in rural areas and 6,519 in urban areas. The statement was filed before a Special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar during the hearing of PIL petitions on issues related to COVID-19. As the State’s data of vaccine showed that there will be shortfall of vaccine for administration of second doses for the remaining days in July and August, the Bench hoped that the Union government would consider this aspect while allotting vaccine. In response to recommendations made by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, the government told the Bench that districts were told in the last week of June to hold catch-up session to immunise left out children, particularly in slums, construction sites and places where migrant workers reside. The district administration were also asked to conduct house-to-house survey to identify left out children. Meanwhile, the government clarified to the Bench “beneficiaries are free to register and avail vaccines at government centres even if they have taken their first dose at private vaccine centres.  AB-ArK scheme The government said that 2,46,429 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have availed treatment under Ayushman Bharath-Arogya Karnataka (AB-ArK) scheme irrespective of whether or not they fall above or below the poverty line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/urban-rural-vaccination-difference-only-2-govt/article35376205.ece

17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Have you chosen the right sport? Find out here||In what is said to be the first of its kind facility in South India, a sports laboratory that would assess and tell a sportsperson if they have chosen the right sport for their body frame is coming up in Karnataka. The Rs. 29 crore facility in government-run Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Trauma and Orthopaedics in Bengaluru is touted to be the second such facility in the country after the State-run Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. The foundation stone for the new building that will house the laboratory was laid on Thursday. “Some budding sportspersons do not know which kind of sport they are fit to pursue. They may be fit to play cricket but may be playing football. An early assessment of the body will help them perform better,” institute director H.S. Chandrashekar told The Hindu. Since the Centre is promoting sports in a big way, the government initiated the project to identify talent at an early stage, he said. The equipment will assess the ability of the shoulders, biceps, forearms, legs and all groups of muscle before providing an assessment. “Trained coaches will be appointed to help. A large number of children in rural areas are skilled but may not have chosen the right sport and may end up unsuccessful,” Dr. Chandrashekar said. The facility will be offering free services to children from BPL families. Clinic and gym Besides the sports lab, the new state-of-the art sports medicine facility will be equipped with a sports clinic and a full-fledged gym to offer treatment and rehabilitation to injured sportspersons of the State. Among others, the facility will have an astro turf, running track, weights section, high altitude room and cryotherapy. “Bengaluru has been identified as a hub for cricket, football, tennis, hockey and badminton. Karnataka has a large pool of aspiring sportspersons in rural areas. It is very expensive for them bear treatment and rehabilitation costs when injured,” Dr. Chandrashekar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/have-you-chosen-the-right-sport-find-out-here/article35376212.ece
17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Vaccine indenting deadline extended for pvt. hospitals’||With private hospitals expressing practical problems in raising indents at short notice, the Friday deadline set by the Centre to indent vaccines under the 25% quota for private sector has been extended till July 21, claimed H.M. Prasanna, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA). Although 15 lakh doses of vaccines are available under the 25% quota for private hospitals in Karnataka this month, indents for 6.48 lakh doses had been raised till 7 p.m. on Friday night. However, Arundathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission, said the next available slot for indenting will be for the next month’s quota. “We have no information as of now about another slot this month. With 6.48 lakh indents raised till 7 p.m. on Friday, the indenting portal on CoWIN is still open. But, we are not sure if hospitals will be allowed to indent by July 21 for this month,” she told The Hindu.  Asked if indenting by private hospitals will be allowed only once a month henceforth, she said there was no information on this from the Centre. “We assume that it will be once a month or once in a fortnight. There is no clarity yet,” she said. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said although the indenting portal is still open, private hospitals should indent “at the earliest” to ensure that the entire lot of 15 lakh doses available for this month is lifted. “We are in mid-July and it will take few more days for vaccines to be dispatched. Any further delay in indenting will result in the hospitals losing out on procuring the entire lot,” he said. Some private doctors said they have been able to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers as and when required. “The indenting exercise is a farce and only indicates that the Centre is not able to ensure equitable distribution to all States. The shortage is also artificial as we have been able to get vaccines by making direct payment to the manufacturers as and when required,” said a doctor who runs a hospital in Rajajinagar.  Although 15 lakh doses of vaccines are available under the 25% quota for private hospitals in Karnataka this month, indents for 6.48 lakh doses had been raised till 7 p.m. on Friday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccine-indenting-deadline-extended-for-pvt-hospitals/article35376209.ece
17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Markets in city reopen after nearly three months||After nearly three months, two major wholesale markets that were shut down during the second wave have been allowed to reopen. While the historical K.R. Market reopened on Thursday, Kalasipalyam market will open to traders and the public on Sunday. The BBMP has accorded conditional approval to reopen the markets. In a recent order, it stated that traders must ensure that COVID-19-appropriate behaviour (CAB) is adhered to by employees and customers, and also introduce measures to prevent overcrowding. Shop owners and visitors have been urged to make use of the testing and vaccination camps on site. Temperature scanners must be used and the market premises must be kept clean, stated the order. BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Revenue and Markets) S. Basavaraj told The Hindu that the BBMP would take action in case the conditions were not complied with. G.M. Divakar, of K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association, told The Hindu that around 70% of the 2,200 shops had reopened. However, footfall dropped drastically, with just around 5% of direct customers visiting and the remaining being wholesalers and retailers. “We had just around 25% of usual business during the festival and wedding season that coincided with the lockdown,” he added. Following the second wave, citizens started consciously avoiding crowded areas. “With the closure of Avenue Road and ongoing development work around the market area, footfall has dropped drastically. While there are retailers selling fruits, vegetables and flowers outside the market, inside there is hardly any activity,” he said. R.V. Gopi, president, Kalasipalyam Vegetable Wholesale Market, said preparations are under way for the reopening. While the market was closed, traders were asked to shift to temporary markets in Singena Agrahara, near Electronics City. “Traders struggled in the temporary market that had no facilities. The traders’ body spent money to put up sheds, repair poor roads and construct toilets,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/markets-in-city-reopen-after-nearly-three-months/article35376202.ece

Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Science (RGUHS) on Friday announced that colleges will be asked to reopen on Monday. However, only students, teaching and non-teaching staff who have taken at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine will be permitted to attend offline classes. Colleges have been closed since March during the onset of the second wave of COVID-19. While they were allowed to hold online classes, students faced the same problem that they did last year during the lockdown. They pointed out that online classes were not effective as they were unable to grasp concepts without practical exposure. In an order issued on Friday, N. Manjunath Prasad, Principal Secretary, Revenue Department said that medical, dental, nursing and allied health care institutions can reopen with immediate effect. The order also stated that colleges and other institutions should strictly follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and follow SOP and guidelines issued by the concerned department. Jayakar Shetty, Vice Chancellor, RGUHS, said that most students have taken both doses and were ready to return to colleges. “We will be issuing the order on Saturday and will also list out detailed SOP that institutions have to follow. We will ask colleges to tweak their infrastructure to ensure physical distancing among students,” he said. Any person violating these measures will be liable to be penalised under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code, stated the order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/medical-dental-colleges-to-reopen/article35376201.ece
17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC dismisses Jayachandra’s plea on Sira bypoll||The High Court of Karnataka has dismissed a petition filed by the former Minister T.B. Jayachandra questioning the election of C.M. Rajesh Gowda of the BJP to the Legislative Assembly from Sira constituency in the byelection held in November 2020. The petition was rejected on the ground of not adhering to Section 82 (a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, that makes it mandatory joining all the contested candidates as respondents to the petition when a petitioner seeks a declaration that he himself may be declared as elected. Justice R. Devadas passed the order in terms of the Section 86(1) of the RP Act, 1951, which specifically imposes a condition on the High Courts to dismiss such election petition which does not comply with the provisions of the Section 82. As Mr. Jayachandra, while questioning the legality of Dr. Gowda’s election, had made a plea to declare himself as the duly elected candidate but had made only Dr. Gowda as respondent, leaving out other candidates who had contested the byelection. “The legislature in its wisdom has made the observance of certain formalities and provisions obligatory and failure in that respect can only be visited with a dismissal of the petition,” the court said while referring to restrictions imposed on the High Court on entertaining election petitions that do not conform to the procedural norms laid down in the RP Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-dismisses-jayachandras-plea-on-sira-bypoll/article35376312.ece
17 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Drip irrigation subsidy will continue: B.C. Patil||The State government has decided to continue with the earlier system of providing subsidy for micro irrigation system for farmers. The decision was announced by Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil close on the heels of experts from agricultural and horticultural sectors questioning the rationale behind withdrawing the subsidy for a water-conserving system. Agriculture Minister told reporters after reviewing the progress of kharif agricultural activities with departmental officials in Bengaluru that following Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s instructions, the department had continued with the earlier system of providing 90% subsidy for drip/micro irrigation system for farmers with a landholding size of up to two hectares and 45% subsidy for farmers having land-holding of 2 to 5 hectares. There will not be any subsidy for those having more than five hectares of land. Though agriculture experts have welcomed the Minister’s announcement, they have sought clarification on whether the government had decided to continue with the subsidy for value addition/processing and mechanisation too which are an integral part of initiatives for doubling farmers’ incomes. The Minister said his department had set a target of conducting crop survey on 2.1 lakh fields this kharif season. Farmers were to conduct survey of their own land through an app-based system, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drip-irrigation-subsidy-will-continue-bc-patil/article35376313.ece

17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Stop leachate from reaching Phalguni river’||As a report of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) disclosed that leachate from Pachchanady landfill mixed with rain water is reaching the Phalguni, the High Court of Karnataka on Friday directed the Commissioner of Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) to come out with immediate steps to stop this nuisance. Terming the status of management of landfill at Pachchanady as ‘shocking state of affairs”, the court said that the report of the KSPCB clearly shows violation of the provisions of the Sold Waste Management Rules, 2016 by the MCC. Despite report of inspection of landfill and river itself shows violation of the SWM Rules, the KSPCB is hesitating to initiate criminal action against the officials of the MCC for violation of the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1985 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act, 1974, said a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj observed in its order. The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, which had complained about the plight of the victims of Pachhanadi landfill slide incident of 2019 and non-implementation the 2016 Rules by the MCC. “...the leachate mixed with rain water, which is stored in leachate collection, which is full and over flowing is being discharged into storm water drain that ultimately joins Phalguni river through tributary,” stated the he KSPCB, which conducted inspection on court’s earlier directions. The report also noted that “darkish coloured contaminated water (leachate) flowed from Pachchanadi solid waste dumping yard through tributary/stream, ultimately joins Phalguni river.” The KSPCB said that water samples collected at different locations are set for testing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stop-leachate-from-reaching-phalguni-river/article35376706.ece
17 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to deport illegal foreign nationals||The State government has formed a committee led by the Principal Secretary (Prison, Civil Defence and Auxiliary Services) to track down foreign nationals living illegally in Karnataka and deport them to their countries. This comes close on the heels of the Bengaluru police’s campaign against foreigners overstaying their visa. The committee, with a pan-State mandate, will have a Foreigners Regional Registration Officer and the State intelligence chief, among others. It will submit a monthly report to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on action taken, a communique from the State government said. Meanwhile, the police are developing an app for tenant verification by landlords. “The exercise is not limited to foreign nationals, but all tenants. It will hopefully solve the issue of illegally staying foreign nationals, as landlords will be expected to upload passport and visa details. Most foreign countries and other states have such systems in place,” said Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. On Friday, the Hennur police conducted a raid on 50 houses and detained 30 foreign nationals residing there without valid documents. They also conducted a similar drive on Thursday, raiding a total of 60 houses across the city based on tip-offs and booking 38 foreign nationals for staying without valid documents.

17 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Convene a meeting of shopkeepers immediately’||Demanding a meeting within 24 hours to resolve the stand-off between shopkeepers and the municipal corporation officials at the “to be developed” Super Market in Dharwad, KPCC media analyst P.H. Neeralakeri has urged the municipal commissioner to suspend officials who, according to him, have violated the law while evicting shopkeepers. Addressing presspersons along with some of the shopkeepers of Super Market in Dharwad on Thursday, Mr. Neeralakeri demanded that the shopkeepers against whom, he said, injustice has been meted out should be called for the meeting to find an amicable solution. He also said that he will strongly condemn the “atrocities” on the street vendors operating in the Super Market area. Mr. Neeralakeri said that starting from 1977, the municipal corporation has kept the issue pending without making honest attempts to resolve it. The main reason for the crisis is the lack of coordination between the officials which consequently has kept the problem unresolved. “If we observe various orders of the High Court of Karnataka and the Supreme Court from 1986 to 2021 at various points of time, we see that in the Writ Petition (No 7466/1986) between Pragati Chikka Vartkara Sangha (Pragati Small Merchants Association) and the municipal corporation, the corporation has filed an undertaking stating that it will give adequate cooperation to the merchants,” he said. The court has also observed that development should be taken up without affecting the day-to-day business and the municipal corporation should consider the petitioners plea regarding facilities. In this connection, two applications are pending before court, he said. Mr. Neeralakeri also said that the police instead of protecting the interests of shopkeepers are helping the corporation carry out what he added “atrocities” by suddenly evicting them. “Without making alternative arrangements, evicting shopkeepers is a clear violation of court orders, urban development regulations and human rights,” he said. He sought to know who will help the 70 shopkeepers who were evicted from the Super Market area without being provided any alternative arrangement and who will provide compensation to them. Mr. Neeralakeri, along with Shivashankar Hampannavar, Shreeshailgouda Kamatar, Narayan Ladwa and others, demanded that action be taken against Assistant Municipal Commissioner Sabarad and Assistant Commissioner of Police Anusha G. for what he said violating the law while evicting shopkeepers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/convene-a-meeting-of-shopkeepers-immediately/article35376297.ece
17 July 2021||HYDERABAD,KARNATAKA||Tiger numbers go up in Amrabad Reserve forest in Telangana||Lovers of the striped cat have some news to celebrate. The number of tigers in the Amrabad Tiger Reserve may have gone up since the last census conducted in 2018. The latest annual Wildlife Census Report during Phase IV Tiger Monitoring released by the Forest Department on Friday vouches that the numbers of the big cat has definitely increased in the reserve. As against the 12 tigers counted during the All India Tiger Census in 2018, the latest survey has enumerated a total of 14 individuals of the species. What’s more, only 10 of the total tigers matched the existing database, which means four are new members recorded for the first time in the current year. Of the total, five tigers are male, and seven female. Gender of two more tigers could not be known, which were marked ‘Unspecified’ in the report. Field Director, Amrabad Tiger Reserve, B. Srinivas clarified that the 14 tigers were the ones observed as part of the survey. There might be more tigers in the reserve which may not have been covered in the survey. Nine ranges Phase IV monitoring has been conducted in nine ranges out of 11 in the reserve, divided into three blocks. Indirect evidence such as scat, pug marks, scrape and rake marks were collected in grids the size of two square kilometres to begin with. Later, double sided camera traps have been deployed in the 276 selected grids. For each camera trap location, interval of 800 meters to two kilometres were ensured. The total 552 camera traps were monitored for about 45 days, with data being downloaded two to three times from each camera. Based on the pattern of the stripes, the individual tigers have been identified, and compared with the existing database. Population density estimation of wild ungulates too has been taken up as part of the census. Water hole census has been introduced this year in addition to the Line Transect Method usually adopted for estimation of population density. Accordingly, at least one water body was covered from each beat, to count the number of animals visiting it to quench thirst. A total of 181 water bodies were surveyed in one day for twelve hours between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. During the water hole census, a total of 43 species were recorded which included 17 mammals, 25 avians, and one reptile. Three species were also noted of domestic cattle varieties, including cattle, sheep and goat. Highest count was that of spotted deer at 482. Other prey animals such as Nilgai, Sambar, Chital, wild pig were recorded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tiger-numbers-go-up-in-amrabad-reserve-forest-in-telangana/article35376308.ece

The contact farmer of the KVK, Kalaburagi, Sharanbasappa Patil, a native of Halsultanpur village in Kalaburagi district, bagged ICAR-Jagjivan Ram Innovative Farmer Award-2020 for his innovative contribution to agriculture. The awards were announced at a virtual programme conducted from New Delhi on the ceremony of 93rd Foundation Day of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) on Friday. The function was attended by Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Parshottam Rupala, Union Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shobha Karandlaje, Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Research and Education & Director General of ICAR Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra, a senior officer at the Union government Ajay Sawhney and others. UAS-R Vice-Chancellor K.N. Kattimani, Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute director V. Venkatasubramanian, Director of Extension of UAS-R D.M. Chandargi, head of KVK, Kalaburagi, Raju Teggellai, and other senior farm scientists participated in the event from their respective offices. The Kalaburagi KVK, headed by entomologist Raju Teggellai, was chosen for the award among the 722 KVKs presently functioning in the country for its outstanding extension activities in the Kalaburagi district and surrounding areas. Its contributions that helped farmers in the areas of crop selection, machine technology, soil health management, soil and water conservation, rainwater harvesting, dryland agriculture, millets processing, dairy, stall-fed goat farming, high-density planting, integrated plant and disease management, vacuum packaging, beekeeping, terrace gardening, banana and mushroom cultivation, farm pond, and others, apart from the supply of planting materials to the farmers in need were considered for the award. “The national award to KVK, Kalaburagi, is a result of a collective effort of all the scientists working and farmers associated with it. I am happy that our extensional activities are recognised at the national level. We have practically shown that even a farmer with small landholding and limited resources can financially do well employing new crop varieties and newer farm technologies under the guidance of farm scientists. I appeal to the farmers who migrate to bigger cities like Bengaluru in search of livelihoods to stay back at their native villages and undertake agriculture using modern farm technologies under the guidance of agriculture scientists and we, the farm scientists at KVK, Kalaburagi, are there to guide them,” Mr. Teggellai told The Hindu thanking all the stakeholders who stood with his KVK in its experiments that paved the way for the national award.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/national-honour-for-kalaburagi-kvk/article35376294.ece
17 July 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Hampi sees increase in footfall after lockdown restrictions are lifted||Tourists have begun to make their way to Hampi, a World Heritage Site that was closed for over two months during the second wave of COVID-19. The site was opened to visitors in the last week of June. Though the Union government had decided to open sites managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) from June 16, Hampi remained closed for some more days owing to a high number of COVID-19 cases in Vijayanagar and Ballari districts. The administration lifted restrictions on June 24 after the positivity rate dropped below 5% in the twin districts. Slow start Yet, footfall remained unimpressive as the administration continued with curfew on weekends. As per the ASI data, 365 tourists bought tickets at the Lotus Mahal counter and 422 at the Vittala Temple counter in the first three days after the reopening. There were several instances of tourists from other States arriving during weekend and returning disappointed. The removal of weekend curfew on July 3 triggered enthusiasm among people, with good weather adding to it. As per information provided by the ASI, 1,966 tourists, including a foreign national, visited Hampi on July 10 and 1,964, including two foreign nationals, on July 11. The daily footfall on weekdays has crossed 750. This has raised the hopes of all who were dependent on tourism activities — taxi drivers, tourist guides, hoteliers, home-stay operators, shopkeepers, and roadside vendors. ‘Badly affected’ Gopal, a tourist guide, told The Hindu : “Hampi has around 150 tourist guides. The two lockdowns proved to be very bad for us as we didn’t have any other means of livelihood. I worked on an MGNREGA project for a few days. But, when the government stopped that project, I had to borrow money to feed my family. Sudha Murty of Infosys Foundation helped guides by offering Rs. 10,000 twice. Now, we are happy that Hampi is finally open.” However, COVID-19 scare is such that many tourists prefer to visit the sites on their own instead of hiring a guide to minimise interaction while travelling from one monument to the other.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hampi-sees-increase-in-footfall-after-lockdown-restrictions-are-lifted/article35376310.ece

The landslip occurred at around 10.40 a.m. and was notified to the Railway authorities who effected regulation, diversion, and cancellation of services. Occurring after the Kulashekara tunnel on the Padil-Jokatte section, the landslip triggered by heavy rains brought down a portion of the retaining wall too thereby blocking the track.

17 July 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||PWD restores sunken concrete slab on Maravoor Bridge||The Karnataka Public Works Department on Friday achieved a feat when it restored a semi-collapsed concrete slab of the major bridge across Phalguni (Gurupura) river on Airport Road in Mangaluru a month after its displacement. One of the slabs on the bridge at Maravoor towards Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) sunk by a few feet on June 15, prompting the authorities to immediately prohibit traffic on the bridge while vehicles to and from the airport as well as Kateel were made to take alternative roads. Executive engineer with PWD, Mangaluru, Yashavanth Kumar told The Hindu that the slab that had sunken by about 2.5 ft was lifted to its original position using state-of-the-art equipment and technology by Friday afternoon. Work on complete restoration of the bridge was on war foot and the bridge would be reopened for traffic by installing necessary safety measures and conducting load tests in about two weeks, he said. PWD’s assistant executive engineer K.T. Chandrashekharaiah said at times over 100 men worked day and night to restore the slab. The Well Foundation (comprising two ‘D’ type structures) that was laid upto about a depth of 10 mts had sunken as it was not cast on a hard rock. Consequently, the particular slab came to be seated directly on the top of the pier resulting in the gap. With the expert advice from R.K. Jaigopal, managing director of Struct Geotech Research Laboratories Pvt., Ltd., Bengaluru, PWD, executed the challenging restoration work. The foundation was initially stabilised with boulders, sand dredging and sand blasting. River water was diverted from the location by building a coffer dam. There was also the issue of high tides and low tides affecting the water level. After strengthening the foundation, work of lifting the slab using sophisticated jacks and expansion joints were lifted. Pedestal caps were installed and bearings were placed carefully on them to support the slab. Before allowing traffic on the bridge, load testing beyond 40 tonnes would be undertaken to test the work. Mr. Chandrashekharaiah said the rejuvenation work should last long. The department intends to keep the bridge in service even after completion of the new parallel bridge that is under construction by suitably strengthening foundations of other piers too, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pwd-restores-sunken-concrete-slab-on-maravoor-bridge/article35376708.ece

17 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Now, ‘holige’ made from cocoa beans||Cocoa beans have now found a new value addition in the form of ‘holige’ or ‘obbattu’ (sweet flatbread). The value addition is the result of a joint initiative of Venkatramana Punacha, near Vitla, and Srikrishna Shastri of Puttur in Dakshina Kannada. Cocoa beans are widely used as the primary raw material for making chocolates, beverages, and confectionery products, among others. Mr. Punacha told The Hindu that of the 450 ‘cocoa holige’ made by them since Thursday, 75 had been sold. They made the ‘holige’ using the flour of dry cocoa beans after frying and peeling them. After the product was shared on social media, he got many queries on preparing it from people in Bengaluru, Belagavi, Raichur, Kasaragod (Kerala), and parts of Dakshina Kannada. Mr. Shastri, who gave the idea and came up with the recipe, said sugar and not jaggery was used for preparing the ‘holige’. Jaggery can also be used, he added. He said he thought of using cocoa beans for the recipe as ‘holige’ is also made using pineapple, carrot, and dates by deviating from the traditional recipe. Devi Prasad of Punacha, who tasted the product, said some more research and development was required to further enhance its quality by addressing the issue of cocoa butter prevailing in the dry beans. “Its texture is very smooth and some more sweet will have to be added,” he said. Considering the high price of dry cocoa beans, this ‘holige’ should cost more than other varieties, Mr. Prasad said. Mr. Punacha said the authorities of the Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO), Mangaluru, had come forward to offer their expertise to address the issue of cocoa butter. Cocoa is mainly grown as an inter-crop in arecanut plantations in Karnataka and Kerala. It is also cultivated in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. According to the Directorate of Cashew and Cocoa Development, Karnataka’s cocoa production from 14,134 hectares stood at 3,542 tonnes during 2019–20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-holige-made-from-cocoa-beans/article35376317.ece

Mutt seer Vishwavallabha Tirtha Swami felt the need to raise a massive forest for wild animals and birds on the land and plant saplings of sandalwood, teak, a variety of fruit-bearing trees, and medicinal plants. A statement from the mutt here said the seer also wanted the land to be rich with groundwater and has directed digging of a 5-foot deep trench around the land besides digging several pits and a tank (Madaga) inside the property.

17 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MUDA layouts need more attention, says Minister||Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar and Minister for Urban Development B.A. Basavaraj on Friday inaugurated the project of distributing drinking water by the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) at Vijayanagar 4th Stage here. “MUDA has developed several layouts and many of them were yet to get all necessary basic amenities. The problems they were facing are being addressed and facilities are being provided,” Mr. Somashekar said, after the inauguration. Mr. Somashekar said he had believed that layouts in Mysuru were more developed than those in Bengaluru. “But, I found that a lot of work needs to be done in layouts developed in Mysuru after my inspection. When I discussed the problems with Mr. Basavaraj, he said he would make all efforts to address the problems and help them see development.” The district in-charge Minister said the State Cabinet has approved a sum of Rs. 377 crore for developing roads, underground drainage, drinking water supply, street lights and parks in layouts under the limits of MUDA. Mr. Basavaraj said a decision would be taken for spending a sum of Rs. 98 crore for developing basic amenities in the new MUDA layouts. The government has given priority to addressing drinking water problems in every district. Such efforts had been done in Mysuru district with the Minister in charge getting the projects cleared. The Hale Undawadi drinking water project has been taken up at a cost of Rs. 350 crore to improve drinking water supply to Mysuru city. Water would be sourced from the KRS backwaters, he added. Appeal G.T. Deve Gowda, MLA, said Vijayanagar layout in Mysuru is reckoned to be one of the largest residential layouts in the State. However, it lacks basic amenities and the government should look into the needs. MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev, Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham, MCC Commissioner G. Lakshmikanth Reddy and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/muda-layouts-need-more-attention-says-minister/article35376439.ece
17 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Minister’s remarks spark outrage||The remarks of the Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj in favour of reconstruction of the Devaraja Market and Lansdowne Building in the city have sparked outrage among conservationists. The Minister ,who was in the city on Friday, inspected a few development works in progress besides paying a visit to the Devaraja Market, Lansdowne Building and the Town Hall. Mr. Basavaraj said there was no way Devaraja Market or Lansdowne Building in their present condition could be conserved and they will be rebuilt incorporating the same design. While it would cost Rs. 100 crore to rebuild Devaraja Market, the Lansdowne Building is expected to cost around Rs. 45 crore, said the Minister adding that “one could see results in two months’’. Mr. Basavaraj said there are nearly 730 tenants in the market and alternative arrangements would be made to enable them to carry on their daily business till the market was reconstructed following which they would be accommodated again. ‘Contempt of court’ However, conservation architect Yashaswini Sharma pointed out that the issue was already pending before the High Court which had issued a stay against demolition and hence the Minister’s remarks on a matter which was sub judice amounted to contempt of court. Though the Minister claimed in his interaction with the mediapersons that the court stay on demolition of Devaraja Market has been vacated, the original petitioners denied it. Sri Raja Chandra and Gouri Satya, who are among the petitioners fighting for the conservation of the heritage structure, said the matter has been adjourned for August and the stay has not been vacated. The petitioners had brought a stay from the High Court which restrained the Mysuru City Corporation and the State government from acting on a resolution for demolishing the Devaraja Market and the Lansdowne Building which was passed in December 2019 by the Special Heritage Committee. Meanwhile, critics have also questioned the need for spending huge amounts on new buildings during the pandemic when the existing structures could be conserved at a fraction of the cost. Town Hall The Minister also visited the Town Hall where a multi-level parking facility is under construction since years but is not yet functional. Calling for expediting the works, he expressed confidence that the facility could be thrown open to the public soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ministers-remarks-spark-outrage/article35376441.ece
17 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘New layouts need proper UGD system’||Former Minister and MLA representing Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency in Mysuru G.T. Deve Gowda has urged Urban Development Minister B.A. Basavaraj to come up with a comprehensive Under Ground Drainage (UGD) system for the new layouts approved by Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) that had come up outside the Outer Ring Road (ORR). Mr. Gowda, who had been visiting residential localities outside the ORR in Mysuru such as Bharath Nagar and Police Layout to discuss the grievances relating to basic amenities, drew the Urban Development Minister’s attention to the pathetic condition of the UGD in the smaller layouts formed on areas that were spread across one acre, two acres or five acres. “Though these layouts had septic tanks, their capacity is limited to 100 to 200 people”, he said. In view of the limited capacity of the septic tanks set up by the developers of small layouts, the UGD water is found overflowing on the roads and drainages alongside, posing a lot of inconvenience to the general public. Mr. Gowda said the condition of the UGD even in villages outside the ORR in Mysuru was deplorable. Though septic tanks had been set up, these tanks were overflowing with the UGD water and entering the lakes in the village, thereby polluting even water bodies, he lamented. Hence, he said setting up a comprehensive UGD system for Mysuru was very much essential. He urged Mr. Basavaraj to ensure that four treatment plants were set up in four different directions of the city so that the UGD water from the residential layouts and the villages outside the Ring Road in Mysuru is treated. Such a move will benefit the residents of Mysuru city as well as Mysuru taluk, he said in the letter written to Mr. Basavaraj. It may be mentioned here that Mr. Gowda, who visited Bharath Nagar last week, noticed the overflowing UGD from the houses built about two decades ago by the Karnataka Slum Development Board. Though the Board officials said the responsibility of ensuring civic amenities rests with the respective local body, Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) said its jurisdiction ends with ORR. Assurance Mr. Gowda, however, promised the residents of Bharath Nagar that he will have the UGD pipeline replaced with a pipeline having a larger diameter to prevent the UGD from overflowing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-layouts-need-proper-ugd-system/article35376437.ece
17 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Industry owners flag Koorgalli CMC issue||Industries in Mysuru have urged the district administration to ensure that works including issuance of documents for property registrations and mortgage loans and promoting industrial development in Koorgalli and Belavadi industrial areas, on the city outskirts, are unaffected until the City Municipal Council (CMC) comprising Koorgalli, Belavadi and Hinkal Gram Panchayats, becomes fully operational. The CMC merging the three GPs was created to upgrade the civic infrastructure of the new areas without burdening the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). The GPs had become part of Mysuru with the city’s rapid expansion, and the areas under GPs were facing hurdles, including solid waste management and cleanliness. “We have been told that the changeover from the GP to CMC may take at least two to three months though the government is yet to post requisite number of staff to make the CMC at Koorgalli fully operational. Until then, some alternative arrangements should be made to ensure that industries and public were not put to hardship for getting government records,” said Suresh Kumar Jain, Secretary, Mysuru Industries Association and MSME Council. He told The Hindu that the Koorgalli Gram Panchayat no more exists now and the staff had been posted elsewhere. Koorgalli is one of the important industrial areas in Mysuru. It takes at least two to three months as told by the Municipality officials for the CMC to become fully functional. Till such time, no tax can be paid and Forms 9 and 11 were not available. Loans against mortgage in banks and property registrations will stop in the absence of documents. Therefore, the issue needs to be resolved soon, he pleaded. “The KIADB puts conditions for setting up industries after allotting sites. If industries don’t get loans in time because of lack of documents, the industrial development gets delayed, causing difficulties to the entrepreneurs,” he argued. The MIA secretary said the issue has been brought to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner and his intervention has been sought.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/industry-owners-flag-koorgalli-cmc-issue/article35376436.ece

The dam has attained its maximum level following heavy rains in its catchment areas. The Minister, accompanied by MP Pratap Simha, Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan, Arkalgud MLA A.T. Ramaswamy, Periyapatna MLA Mahadev and others, visited the dam and offered ‘bagina’ amidst the chanting of hymns by priests. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Somanna said the dam irrigates crops in about 1.60 lakh acres covering Kodagu, Mysuru and Hassan districts. Lakes in the dam’s command area would be filled up benefiting the local population. Somawarapet in Kodagu; Periyapatna, Hunsur; K.R. Nagar in Mysuru district; and Arkalgud in Hassan district get irrigation facilities from the dam, he said. Later, Mr. Somanna chaired the Irrigation Consultative Committee meeting of Harangi Dam at Kushalanagar. He said unauthorised layouts in Kushalanagar need to be controlled and added that layouts that get flooded when Cauvery river overflows need to be protected. Mr. Ranjan said no new layouts have come up in Kushalanagar in the last three years because of floods. Retaining walls can be constructed to prevent flooding in Sai and Kuvempu Layouts in the town. A sum of Rs. 130 crore had been estimated for removing silt from the dam, he said, adding that Rs. 75 crore was announced in the budget presented during the previous coalition government but it made no headway. The MP said calculated release of water from the dam after assessing the rain conditions in its catchment areas can help to address the problem of layouts getting flooded because of water release. A.H. Vishwanath, MLC, said coordination among various departments was essential to tackle the flood situation in Kodagu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/harangi-dam-full-bagina-offered/article35376306.ece

17 July 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Work to replace faulty pipeline from Nov.||The work to replace the defective pipeline under the Alappuzha drinking water project will begin in November, Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine has said. Speaking at a review meeting of various drinking water projects at the Collectorate here on Friday, Mr. Augustine directed the officials concerned to initiate steps to begin the work to replace the 1,427-metre pipeline at Thakazhi and Kelamangalam by November last. As the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) will stop pumping in order to carry out the work, the Minister said alternative measures would be taken to supply drinking water to consumers in Alappuzha municipality and eight nearby grama panchayats. Apart from the 30 borewells already operational, 14 more would be drilled. The move to replace the defective pipeline comes after an inordinate delay. Although a high-level meeting convened by the then Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 had decided to replace the pipeline in three months, the work never took off due to various reasons. The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the KWA with Central assistance under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) in 2017. Most in Thakazhi However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 60 times, the majority of them at Thakazhi, in the past four years, disrupting the water supply to residents in Alappuzha municipality and eight nearby grama panchayats along with damaging the Ambalapuzha-Thiruvalla road. Earlier, inaugurating the expansion/renovation of the KWA’s water distribution network in Alappuzha municipality and nearby grama panchayats, Mr. Augustine said the KWA would establish a mechanism to address issues related to drinking water supply and other complaints. The project, which is being implemented at Rs. 211.71 crore under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, will benefit 2.23 people in Alappuzha, Aryad, Mannancherry, and Mararikulam South.

Working as an aircraft maintenance engineer in Kuwait, he returned home on leave in November 2020, but could not fly back due to a raging COVID-19. The curtain has fallen on his expatriate life. "After realising that I won't be able to go back, I contemplated a few ideas, but soon settled on paddy cultivation," says Mr. Vijayakumar. He is joined by his brother-in-law Yedhu Krishnan, another Gulf returnee. The duo recently revived cultivation under the State government's Subhiksha Keralam project on the 25-acre Maveli padashekharam in Thakazhy that had remained fallow for 17 years. “We have spent Rs. 4 lakh for farming and are hoping for a good yield,” says Mr. Vijayakumar. More such people are taking up farming in Kuttanad.. Suresh M.U., Anujith Udayakumar, and John Joseph, all three Gulf returnees, are busy growing paddy after transforming the 30-acre Kallepuram Vadake padashekharam that had remained fallow for two decades. The trio from Kunnumma first ventured into farming in the last puncha crop season (first crop). Their initial experience, however, turned out to be a failure after the torrential downpour in May washed away the crop in its entirety. But it did not prevent them from farming during the additional crop season (second crop). “We have suffered a loss to the tune of Rs. 11 lakh in the puncha season. Our sheer love for paddy cultivation has led us to do farming in the second crop season,” says Mr. Suresh. Government help Sreerekha R., principal agricultural officer, Alappuzha, says the Agriculture Department is providing all help to Gulf returnees for farming. The government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 40,000 per hectare, which included Rs. 35,000 for farmers and Rs. 5,000 for landowners to make fallow lands cultivable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gulf-returnees-turn-to-paddy-farming/article35376423.ece

Her cherished dream came true four years ago when she joined the Assam Rifles, the oldest paramilitary force in India. Ms. Pillai, from Bharanikavu in Alappuzha, then 21, left for the northeast so excited as it was her chance to serve the nation as a servicewoman. After serving in volatile Nagaland and Manipur, she moved to conflict-ridden Jammu and Kashmir earlier this year. She is a member of a Rifle Women unit of the Assam Rifles being deployed in Ganderbal in the valley. The lone Keralite in the unit, Ms. Pillai works in the Information Warfare squad but often does tough soldiering. “My father, Keshava Pillai, served the nation as a soldier of the Assam Rifles. He died 13 years ago. I always wanted to become a soldier like my father. I love this uniform and am proud to serve my country,” says Ms. Pillai, adding that her biggest strength is fearlessness.       Info collection Being part of the Information Warfare squad, she is involved in the collection of vital information along with bridging the gap by building bonds with local people, especially womenfolk. “Before we came to Ganderbal, the local people had never seen women soldiers. Women and girls were so reluctant to talk. They were afraid of us. Now the situation has changed. They have started to interact and girls are taking selfies with us. We try to alleviate the fear factor and instil confidence in the local populace. Many young girls are looking up to us for inspiration and want to dream big,” she says. Ms. Pillai and other members of the all-women unit are regularly deployed for patrolling, while also being called to assist male soldiers during security-related operations. They help in frisking women and children, conducting cordon and search operations. “We deal with women and always act professionally with a humane touch,” she says.

Fr. Sebastian Kochupurackal, general convener of the HRSS, said here on Friday that if cases were filed against farmers, the HRSS would launch a stir and would give legal support to the farmers. ‘Protecting culprits’ He said the farmers had cut the trees on their title deed land as per the government order. The Forest Department was trying to protect those who had misused the order instead of taking action against them. He said that the government had not taken a stand on this issue, which was unfortunate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tree-felling-forum-to-support-farmers/article35376397.ece

T. Sasikumar, State general secretary, Desiya Saksharatha Pravarthaka Union, said as many as 1,860 Preraks in the State had been denied honorarium for the past three months even despite the pandemic. Pay denied Earlier, the honorarium used to be paid by the civic bodies concerned, but the government started disbursing it to the civic bodies through the Mission in 2017, Mr. Sasikumar said. The honorarium was hiked to Rs. 10,200 and Rs. 15,000 a month for Preraks and nodal Preraks respectively that year. Since then, many a time the authority has failed to pay honorarium in time. Moreover, it fixed targets for Preraks to claim honorarium, he said. “We get a meagre income compared to government employees. Inordinate delay in payment of honorarium will affect our lives. Hence, we are planning to start an indefinite agitation, he said. Demands Mr. Sasikumar also raised demands such as paying honorarium before 5th of every month, disbursing it through civic bodies, beneficiary schemes like provident fund and pension for Preraks, and adding Preraks to the health security scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/preraks-under-kslma-to-launch-indefinite-stir/article35376327.ece

The proposal envisages an integrated system enabling an end-to-end digital solution for all the services being provided by the university. “The software application-cum-learning management system will be of immense help in bringing modules like admission, academics, evaluation, publication of results and distribution of the degree certificates online,” said Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas on Friday. The project proposal stated that the system would help in conducting the proposed online degree, certificate and diploma programmes of the university. The digital platform will also serve in providing the innovation repository for the government’s young innovators’ programme initiated by the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC). Better planning Mr. Thomas said the system would provide comprehensive data on the varsity’s affiliated colleges in a single click. It would help in improved planning and efficient interaction between the institutions and the varsity, he said. The online platform will have mobile apps, facilities for digital payment of fee, and other services meant for students and teachers. It will have provision to carry out a quality assessment programme that includes rating of the academic services being offered to the students and feedback from teachers on various programmes. The project implementation time is expected to be six months to one year. Enrolment ratio The project proposal pointed out that the system would help in increasing the gross enrolment ratio in the higher education sector in the State by speeding up various processes such as admission, conduct of exams, and valuation of answer scripts. The shift to online mode would help achieve the goal, it said.

17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Drive to continue against use of communication devices: MVD||The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) will continue the clampdown on motorists who use hands-free communication devices while driving, even as it faced widespread ridicule in the form of social-media trolls, official sources said. This is in accordance with the Motor Vehicles Act, which prohibits the use of any portable device, be it hand-held or hands-free, to communicate. This was because the impact of communicating on any hand-held or other device was akin to becoming temporarily blind to the surroundings. Stricter punishment Earlier, the offence attracted penalty in the form of suspension of driving licence. Now, such motorists could be made to remit a fine and also to attend community service or do driver refresher training. This was because the offence was now considered as “dangerous driving” in the amendment made to the Central Motor Vehicles Act, said Arun C.D., Motor Vehicle Inspector, Ernakulam RTO office. “It has now become tough to detect the offence since most people wear a mask and drive. Still, alert personnel can detect it. Details like call records are collected if there is an accident and a doubt arises that a motorist was speaking/communicating over any device while it occurred. Research done worldwide shows that 20% of accidents are caused by distractions caused by cell phone usage. This is more than the percentage of accidents caused by drunk driving,” Mr. Arun said. Sole exception The sole exception as per rules, is relying on such devices that are mounted on the dashboard without affecting the driver’s concentration, for route navigation, MVD sources said. Impairs faculties The Director of Institute of Driver Training and Research, Edappal, P.M. Mohammed Najeeb, who is a doctorate holder in driver psychology, said that the perception process happened in the brain. Hearing, seeing and speaking were interlinked. A cell phone, whether it was hand-held or hands-free, impaired all these faculties and increased the possibility of accident by four times. Safe driving was possible only if a driver was able to scan the entire road. “The focusing of the attention of hearing will impair his other senses, mainly that of sight. He will fail to assess his vehicle’s speed and its distance with other vehicles, resulting possibly in collision with other vehicles or veering off the road. A similar thing happens when he quarrels with co-passengers or is focused on discussing a serious topic in depth. The social media outburst that followed when the MVD began enforcing the rule is nothing but issues being raked up for arguments’ sake,” Mr. Najeeb, who retired from MVD as Deputy Transport Commissioner, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drive-to-continue-against-use-of-communication-devices-mvd/article35376671.ece
17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘RTC to operate buses on routes suggested by local bodies’||The demand raised by MLAs to resume Kerala State Road Transport Corporation  (KSRTC) bus services on different routes and to operate buses in coordination with local bodies will be looked into on a priority basis, Transport Minister Antony Raju has said. The KSRTC was willing to operate buses on routes suggested by local bodies if they provided funds for maintenance, he said at a meeting of MLAs from the district convened here on Friday to discuss issues pertaining to the Transport Department. “This will help feasible operation of buses without incurring loss. This will be akin to the RTC’s Bus on Demand [BOND] initiative,” he said. Vypeen buses On permitting the entry of about 120 mofussil buses from Vypeen into the city, he said a legal issue ought to be overcome by amending the Motor Vehicle Rules. “Back in June, I directed NATPAC to submit a study report in this regard in three months,” he said. The MLAs sought steps to improve the condition of bus stands and to augment amenities. They demanded extension of Water Metro services to more Greater Kochi areas. Responding to the MLAs’ demand for steps to strengthen the Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA), Mr. Raju said efforts were under way to appoint adequate number of technically qualified personnel to the authority, heeding to a long-pending demand. Septic tank waste On being apprised of the grave health issue posed by unscrupulous operators dumping septic tank waste on the wayside and in waterbodies, Mr. Raju directed Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) officials to initiate stern action, including cancellation of lorry permit and suspension of driving licence. The MLAs also expressed concern about the safety hazards posed by overloaded goods vehicles, the damage they caused to roads, and the sound and air pollution caused by illegally altered vehicles, especially two-wheelers. They took exception to many private vehicles sporting registration number plates with red band to mislead people that those were government vehicles. In addition, vehicles bearing ‘Press’ sticker and ambulances were being used for many illegal activities. Mr. Raju directed MVD personnel to step up vigilance and to bring such motorists to book. Eldhose Kunnappilly, MLA, demanded the setting up of a modern computerised driving test track of the Perumbavoor Sub RTO office in vacant land of the Muvattupuzha Valley Irrigation Project. Mr. Raju termed it a good suggestion. He also released an action plan readied by MVD officials as part of the Safe Kerala project to prevent accidents, by handing over a copy to all MLAs. Mr. Raju said the KSRTC was unable to operate low-floor AC buses due to low patronage, especially since a bulk of youth was working from home. Referring to the proposed relocation of the KSRTC’s Ernakulam bus stand to Karikkamuri, the Transport Minister said it would be done in tandem with Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML). The MLAs who took part in the meeting were Anoop Jacob, Antony John, T.J. Vinod, K.J. Maxi, Mathew Kuzhalnadan, Eldhose Kunnappilly, K. Babu, P.T. Thomas, Anwar Sadath, Roji M. John, P.V. Sreenijin and K.N. Unnikrishnan. The Transport Minister also inspected Shops on Wheels, a mobile lubricants’ retail shop that will function in a modified KSRTC bus at Ernakulam Boat Jetty bus stand. It will be inaugurated on July 23. “It is a joint initiative of the KSRTC and HPCL. The lube oils will be sold at 15% less than MRP while the KSRTC hopes to get up to Rs. 50,000 per month as profit from each outlet. A similar project will come up in Aluva too,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rtc-will-ply-on-routes-chosen-by-local-bodies-says-minister/article35376389.ece
17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kerala Police clock 1 million followers on Instagram||When the Kerala Police joined Instagram, some of the major police forces where already on the popular social media platform. But more than two-and-a-half-years down the line, they have pipped all of them to emerge as the first police force anywhere in the world to have touched a follower base of one million. A post on Instagram to mark the one million mark on Friday received more than 82,000 likes in a matter of hours. The other major police forces within the country, including the Mumbai and Bengaluru police have been left far behind. “That even the Interpol and the New York police have far fewer followers signify our popularity,” said an official associated with the social media cell of the Kerala Police. The State police joined Instagram to reach out to youngsters. They soon garnered eyeballs with short videos, including memes and informative ones. “Our most popular video till date was the one posted a couple of months ago. It featured an excited lot of stray dogs approaching a sub inspector at Nemam, who fed them without fail every day. Another video that showed how the police are available for the service of the public through the odds was also immensely popular,” said the official. The Facebook page of the State police already has 17 lakh followers and its Twitter handle around 2 lakh followers. Shortly after they joined TikTok, the Central government banned it by which time it had logged close to a million followers. Now, they have joined the Indian social networking platform Koo recognised by the Central government. While the social media presence of the Kerala Police has been immensely popular, they weren't spared of brickbats either. In June last year, they had to lift a video titled “PC Kuttanpillai Speaking” from their YouTube channel after some online commentators and women activists derided it as police’s attempt at “roasting”, a phenomenon of outspoken online criticism popularised by a young Malayali youngster by the name Arjun at that time. The police had formed its social media cell under ADGP Manoj Abraham back in 2018 till which time its Facebook and Twitter accounts had a nominal presence. A five-member team proficient in social media from among the force was recruited that year based on a test. Now, an editor and cameraman has also been recruited to further enhance the capability of the team.  Growing presence Social media cell formed under ADGP Manoj Abraham in 2018 Facebook page has 17 lakh followers; Twitter handle has 2 lakh followers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-police-notch-up-1-million-followers-on-instagram/article35376328.ece
17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||TPR remains steady in ‘D’ category local bodies||Nine of the nearly 19 local bodies in Ernakulam that had figured in the ‘D’ category on the basis of the average weekly test positivity rate (TPR) for COVID-19 continue to figure in the list for the second consecutive week, according to official estimates. They include Chellanam, Nayarambalam, Ezhikkara, Pallarimangalam, Njarakkal, Elankunnapuzha, Vazhakkulam, Choornikkara, and Thrikkakara. TPR had shot up in four panchayats compared to the weekly assessment done last Wednesday. The panchayats are Nayarambalam, Pallarimangalam, Vazhakkulam, and Choornikkara. In the case of Nayarambalam, the rate went up from 18.01% to 29.15% in the latest evaluation. The local bodies in the ‘D’ category have a TPR above 15%. The remaining local bodies where it has remained above 15% for the second consecutive week include Chellanam, Ezhikkara, Njarakkal, Elankunnapuzha, and Thrikkakara. Neethu Binod, chairperson of Nayaramablam panchayat, referred to the limited number of persons turning up for testing as the main reason for the spike in rate. Only those in quarantine are undergoing tests, she said. The current active caseload of the panchayat is 140. Creating awareness Ms. Binod pointed out that only 50 to 70 persons were turning up for tests daily. “We are now trying to increase the number by setting up more testing centres and creating awareness among the public. Around 8,000 of the total population of nearly 24,000 in the panchayat have received vaccination, she said. Khadeeja Muhammed, chairperson of Pallarimangalam panchayat, said only those who had some kind of symptoms were turning up for testing. “There is considerable decline in the number of persons coming forward to undergo testing despite our earnest efforts. We have now requested traders, daily wage workers, and drivers to undergo testing to bring down TPR, which went up to 21% this week compared to the previous 19.42%, she added. Vazhakkulam panchayat, which witnessed a spike in TPR from 18.08% to 20.08% in the latest assessment, has also ramped up testing to contain COVID-19 spread. Gopalakrishnan C.K., president of the panchayat, said even primary contacts were showing reluctance to get tested. “We had instances where those who had accompanied infected persons, had refused to give samples for testing. The attendance was only 60 to 100 at camps set up for three to four panchayats together in the last few days,” he said. On vaccination, Ms. Muhammed and Mr. Gopalakrishnan said there had been a drop in the availability of doses. “We have now received permission to scale up spot registration, and efforts are on to vaccinate those aged above 60 years,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tpr-remains-steady-in-d-category-local-bodies/article35376684.ece
17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A space for transpeople to go home to||A year ago, a teenage boy from Pathanamthitta dropped out midway through graduation and abandoned his home unable to declare his sexual orientation to his family. Since then, he had a sex reassignment surgery (SRS), turned a transwoman and ended up in a home for transgenders engaged in sex work in Coimbatore. The youngster’s family remains under the impression that he is away on a job. Later, the person fled to Kochi and took refuge in the transgender shelter home here for a while. Most of the 55 transwomen who have taken shelter at the home at different points since it turned operational in March-end have similar or more harrowing tales to share. It is the only home for transwomen in Kerala under the Social Justice Department, the other in Thiruvananthapuram being for transmen. At present, the home has nine residents. “Unlike popular perception, the nightmare for transpeople does not begin once they announce their sexual orientation to their families and get ousted consequently. It dates back to their childhood when they were sexually abused even by parents and teachers, taking advantage of their confusion and generally docile nature,” said Greeshma Saji, a counsellor. In many cases, even the families receptive of their existential reality are forced to send them away fearing public humiliation. Many residents of the home go and stay with their families, as the home permits such a three-day visit. Surgery With the government assistance for SRS often getting delayed, desperate transpeople are often forced into sex work for raising resources for the twin surgeries, each of which costs around Rs. 1.20 lakh. “This is a very sensitive community, which easily trusts people and hence ends up exploited,” said Ms. Saji. “Mostly, those who don’t have a place to go or recover after SRS take refuge in the home. Those who either have the transgender ID issued by the government or at least applied for it are admitted here. The facility is being publicised through the social media accounts of the Social Justice Department and those of the transgender community,” said Subair K.K., District Social Justice Officer. While the stay is restricted to three months, it is extended on compassionate grounds. The home funded by the Social Justice Department is being run by Jyothis Bhavan under the CMC Vimala Province, which has been running a general shelter home for over four years now. The home has five staff members, while the services of a doctor and a psychiatrist are available on call. “We can accommodate 20 members at a time. Information about the home is increasingly being spread through word of mouth among the transgender community,” said Sister Teslin, superintendent of the home.  Unlike popular perception, the nightmare for transpeople does not begin once they announce their sexual orientation to their families and get ousted consequently Greeshma Saji Counsellor||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-space-for-transpeople-to-go-home-to/article35376667.ece
17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||PWD readies report to widen MG Road-NH bypass stretch||Even as the State government and Kochi Corporation have fast tracked preparatory works to develop the MG Road-Pullepady-Thammanam-NH bypass into a 22-metre-wide four-lane road, uncertainty prevails over an overbridge that would have to be built at Kathrikadavu to ensure steady flow of vehicles along the road. This comes in the wake of the need to acquire land at a width of at least three more metres on either side of the overbridge that was envisaged by government bodies, including the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB), which was entrusted with executing the road widening project to augment east-west connectivity in the city. “We hope the government and civic agency step in and help acquire the extra land needed for the bridge,” official sources said. The PWD (design wing) has, in the meantime, readied a draft DPR of the four-laning work. While not mentioning the overbridge that was proposed at Kathrikadavu, it has mooted a two-lane overbridge parallel to Pullepady overbridge, apart from three small bridges on the stretch. A draft DPR which the PWD readied was handed over to KRFB - the special purpose vehicle which will execute the widening work. The KRFB must now take a call of whether to have the road at a width of 22 m that it envisaged or at 23 m as per KIIFB norms. Different components on the road - mainly the width of median and footpaths on either side, will be modified in accordance with their requirement, PWD sources said. A two-lane overbridge parallel to Pullepady bridge is expected to come up on the southern side. Among the three small bridges envisaged is one parallel to Karnakodam bridge (which was funded by Kerala Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI)). At Chakkaraparambu The stakeholders have also not taken a decision on whether a bridge or flyover will be built in the immediate future at Chakkaraparambu on Palarivattom-Vyttila NH Bypass, where the road that would begin at Padma Junction on MG Road will merge with the Bypass. "This will have to be looked into when the road is extended eastward to Seaport-Airport Road," Mayor M. Anilkumar said. The Kochi Corporation began the three-decade-long effort to widen Thammanam-Pullepady Road into a four-lane corridor. The civic agency passed a resolution handing it over to the PWD, which in turn entrusted KRFB with the widening work. Soil tests are over for the new bridges, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pwd-readies-report-to-widen-mg-road-nh-bypass-stretch/article35376678.ece

The neighbours raised an alarm after they heard an unusual noise and found a portion of the house slanting, following which the two occupants of the house rushed out. The inner wall of the house located on Beerankutty Road in Koonamthai crumbled, following which the building slanted. The occupants of the neighbouring house too were shifted to safety. Personnel of the Kalamassery Police and Fire and Rescue Service are camping at the site. “It has to be seen whether the house can be restored or whether a portion will have to be fully demolished and rebuilt,” said police sources. The truss and many other parts of the top floor of the house were dismantled to reduce weight. A demolition team that inspected the area said it would be tough to dismantle the house without damaging the adjacent house on which it was resting. The adjacent house too had developed cracks, said fire services personnel who visited the site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-daughter-escape-unhurt-as-house-collapses/article35376675.ece

17 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Hope’ restored for children on the edge||When the SSLC results were declared earlier this week, it was restoration of hope for 365 students who had all but given up. Either failed in previous attempts or dropped out of schools due to their circumstances, among them were even drug junkies, abused, fated to hard labour and those in danger of being lured into the world of crimes. Coming to their rescue was Hope, a programme being implemented under social policing initiative of the Kerala Police with the help of the NGO Mission Better Tomorrow (MBT). Since it was launched in 2017 by IGP P. Vijayan, when he was in charge of the Ernakulam Range, over 2,500 students from various police districts across the State have benefited from the programme. “The range had about 8,000 goondas at that time, and it was found that most of them were either school dropouts or victims of abuse. Thus was born the programme, which could be described as pre-emptive policing aimed at motivating those teetering on the verge of the world of crime and hand-holding them back to a life of hope, thus getting rid of potential criminals,” said Mr. Vijayan. Bridge course A bridge course was offered under the programme to help them scale the gap since they left the world of learning. They were also given skill development training enhancing their employability. “Now, we plan to engage them for voluntary work in palliative care units and homes of the intellectually challenged. For them, it's about returning something to society,” he said. Ananda Mani, coordinator for MBT in Kozhikode, said that the initiative had not only helped to mainstream the children but helped to improve their familial circumstances through group counselling. The only three to fail out of the 55 prepared under Hope had failed only in a single subject. Buoyed by the success of the programme, MBT now plans to scale up the programme beyond Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hope-restored-for-children-on-the-edge/article35376673.ece

Therefore, the government should come forward to ensure that. It would otherwise amount to watering down the philosophy of free education to all,” he said. “Interest-free loan doesn’t work.

When a contempt of court case for not implementing a directive to remove obstructions caused by a liquor outlet in Thrissur came up for hearing, Justice Devan Ramachandran observed that if the Excise Department and Bevco launched a comprehensive audit of the infrastructure facilities and suitability of each liquor shop, a lasting solution could be found to the problems of crowding as well as nuisance caused to other shops. The court said the Excise Commissioner and Bevco would have to ensure that every retail counter was accounted and the collective dignity of society and customers were adequately protected. Inadequate outlets Excise Commissioner S. Ananthakrishnan submitted in his affidavit that inadequate outlets was the primary reason for overcrowding. The number of outlets based on population was low in the State compared to other States. Tamil Nadu , Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh had 5,580, 3,938 and 2,800 outlets respectively, while Kerala had only 306 outlets. That means one shop was catering to the needs of more than one lakh population. Therefore, he had given a proposal to the government to explore the possibility of increasing the number of outlets. He submitted that the outlets on the Kuruppam road in Thrissur and near the High Court junction would be shifted to suitable places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-for-audit-of-bevco-facilities/article35376414.ece

In his petition, Vishnunarayanan C.V. from Kottayam pointed out on Friday that the notification issued by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) inviting applications for the posts of Sabarimala and Malikappuram melsanthis stipulated that the applicants must be from the Malayala Brahmin community. According to the petitioner, the appointment to the posts of melsanthi was a secular act.

17 July 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Govt. takes over properties illegally occupied by YMCA||District Collector B. Abdul Nasar on Friday took over 84 cents of land and a building that was illegally occupied by the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) at Chinnakkada, the city centre of Kollam. The office of the Special Tahsildar LA (NH), that had been functioning in a rented building at Kavanad, was shifted to the building. The decades-long legal proceedings came to an end with the takeover following a government order issued on July 14. Repealed in 1960 The land was allotted to the YMCA as per the ‘Kuthakappattam Rules, 1947’ that was repealed with the enactment of the Kerala Land Assignment Act, 1960. As per the Act, the lessee must submit an application to renew the contract, but the YMCA failed to file any application despite repeated requests from the District Collector and the Tahsildar. Lease not renewed According to the Revenue officials, the YMCA has not renewed the lease or paid the arrears and they have been using the land for commercial purpose. The lease was cancelled as per Rule 17 of Rules for Assignment of Land within Municipal and Corporation Areas, 1995, and a notice was issued in 2007. Though the Kollam Collector had cancelled the lease after observing all the legal formalities, the YMCA submitted a revision petition before the government and filed a case at High Court challenging the order. The court had directed the government to take a decision on the revision petition and hearings were held. After the hearings it was observed that the lease can be considered cancelled with the enactment of the new rules in 1995 and the possession of government land by the YMCA is illegal. ‘Lawful action’ The action taken by the authorities against the illegal possession was considered lawful as all steps were taken as per the KLC Act. The government order to take over the land was issued after rejecting the revision petition submitted by the YMCA. The order also points out that many government offices are functioning in private buildings in Kollam city and it would be a great relief for the government to move these offices to the YMCA-owned buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-takes-over-properties-illegally-occupied-by-ymca/article35376402.ece

17 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Poor lane discipline brings back accidents to Ghat Road||Poor lane discipline and speed limit violations have emerged as threats again for motorists on the accident-prone Thamarassery Ghat Road, which was renovated recently. The haste shown by small vehicles to overtake heavy ones, including trucks and goods carriers, is cited as a major risk factor on the inter-State mountain road. According to members of the Ghat Road Protection Committee, the police are yet to crack the whip on rampant violation of lane discipline. In the absence of a permanent mechanism with surveillance camera, the practice cannot be curtailed, they said. Wayside traders are of the view that the widening of hairpin curves to facilitate easy movement of heavy vehicles has had a detrimental effect, as violation of speed limits by small vehicles has become rampant. Incidentally, amateur riders and tourists resort to reckless race through the mountain pass, they attested. “The absence of a permanent rescue mechanism on the road is a matter of concern. In the event of an accident, rescue teams have to come from distant locations, which hits the pace of life-saving efforts,” said V. Manoharan, a local volunteer. He complained that the demand to sanction an ambulance for the mountain pass was yet to be addressed. Meanwhile, the Ghat Road Protection Committee has sought an effective mechanism to regulate the speed of vehicles during monsoon in view of slippery roads. Those unfamiliar with the route are likely to face safety challenges thanks to the freehand enjoyed by other motorists in the absence of proper checking, the committee reminded. “A proper enforcement of lane discipline can largely contribute to safe driving on the route, but the police are indifferent to the demand. Though wayside parking has been banned to ensure passengers’ safety, it is more honoured in the breach than in the observance,” said K. Sukumaran, another local volunteer. He called for fining those who flouted lane traffic rules on the spot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poor-lane-discipline-brings-back-accidents-to-ghat-road/article35376330.ece

The Kozhikode railway station was chosen among the 23 stations in the country and is the only one in the State to be redeveloped along with the Gandhinagar station under the Swiss Challenge Method a decade ago. At present, the project is moving at a snail’s pace, with the consultant appointed by the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) still preparing the detailed project report (DPR) to transform the facility in line with international standards. Incidentally, just half of the 44-acres available at the station is used now. That leaves immense scope to commercially exploit the prime real estate around the station to make it a nerve centre of Kozhikode city. Modern amenities The initial proposal was to develop the station at a cost of Rs. 75 crore after leasing out four sites, measuring 4.4 acres, to a successful bidder for 45 years. Providing an airport-like experience to passengers with facilities such as luxury hotel, arrival and departure segregation, food and beverages outlets, canopy roofing, escalators, and passenger lounges was proposed. The project has undergone major changes since its inception and under various Railway Ministers, including Suresh Prabhu and Piyush Goyal. They included revising the project estimate to Rs. 200 crore. Last month, Kozhikode MP M.K. Raghavan, who met RLDA Vice Chairman Ved Parkash Dudeja in New Delhi, had said that the project would have taken off in April this year but got delayed due to the pandemic. “The railway authorities have promised that tenders would be floated by December after the preparation of the DPR and its approval by the technical committee,” he said. The project was announced during the tenure of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre in 2010.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/railway-station-modernisation-project-moving-at-snails-pace/article35376332.ece
17 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Medical stipend norm may give room for misuse||The provision on stipend in the draft regulations for compulsory rotating internship has been termed to be vague as it could give ample room for private medical college managements to deny payment to MBBS interns. According to sources, the regulations were published by the National Medical Commission (NMC) on April 21. The provision on stipend states that “all interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate fee fixation authority as applicable to the institution/university/State”. Mandatory service Compulsory rotating internship is the mandatory one-year-service for medical graduates in hospitals attached to a medical college or any other approved teaching hospital. Public health professionals pointed out that a public notice by the Medical Council of India (MCI) on January 25, 2019, on Graduate Medical Education regulations had stated that “all the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State government medical institution/Central government medical institution in the State/Union Territory where the institution is located”. It was, however, not gazetted till the Board of Governors of the MCI was dissolved. The NMC replaced the MCI in September last year. There has been long-pending demand to have a uniform stipend for interns across medical colleges as some private colleges are being accused of paying meagre amounts to them. K.V. Babu, Kannur-based public health expert, said it was unfair to entrust the fee fixation authority with the payment of stipend, which was the right of the interns. He said the Kerala High Court, in an order on October 29, 2015, had directed PMS College of Dental Science and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, to pay stipend to BDS interns at the rate of what was being paid at government dental colleges in the State. In a mail to NMC Chairman Suresh Chandra Sharma, Dr. Babu said the provision could be rephrased as follows: “All the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State Government Medical Institution/Central Government Medical Institution in the State/Union Territory where the institution is located.”  Long-pending demand to have a uniform stipend for interns across medical colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medical-stipend-norm-may-give-room-for-misuse/article35376523.ece
17 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Preraks in the lurch after a lifetime dedicated to literacy||Persevering to help the State achieve 100% literacy was kind of an addiction for Balakrishnan E., a Saksharatha Prerak for Kunnamangalam grama panchayat. He was just one of the hot-blooded educated youngsters, who, back in the nineties, threw away possibilities of well-paying careers, to be part of the mission to promote literacy. Over 20 years down the line, Balakrishnan, like most other Preraks, feels that he spoiled his future, though he is satisfied with his accomplishments. “Most people we guided to complete standards 4, 7 and 10 equivalency tests have advanced much in their life and careers, while we are left in the lurch unable to make both ends meet,” said Vijayan A.P., another Prerak from Kunnamangalam. There are 1,800 Saksharatha Preraks in the State who work for meagre honorariums ranging from Rs. 8000 to Rs. 10000. Still, they are forced to work without much rest throughout the year. “State- and district-level officials are paid Rs. 80,000 to Rs. 1 lakh a month, while most of us have not received honorariums for at least six months, and some have not even received the money in a year,” Mr. Balakrishnan said. The State Assembly in 2017 had fixed the monthly wages of nodal Preraks at Rs. 15,000, Preraks at Rs. 12,000, and assistant Preraks at 10,500. Despite that, higher officials devised strategies for not paying them their dues. “The Saksharatha Mission has neglected the Government Order” Mr. Vijayan alleged. “State Literacy Mission Director P.S. Sreekala brought in the ‘target system’, which insisted that Preraks should enrol 101 persons every year. This may be possible in the tribal belts or rural areas but not in moderately developed panchayats where such courses are not in demand,” he explained. The Saksharatha Mission has been cutting wages of Preraks who have failed to meet the target. Besides, Preraks complained that they were rarely reimbursed for expenses incurred during field work, especially in remote areas. The families of Preraks are in dire straits, and financial troubles have pushed some of them beyond the edge. Mr. Balakrishnan’s daughter, who reportedly ended her life for failure to realise her civil service dreams, is a case in point. Most Preraks have been in the field for around two decades and have dedicated their youthful years to the cause of complete literacy. But they are not eligible for any benefits once they retire at the age of 60. Most wished they had shifted their job, but found it too late, as most of them are in their 50s.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/preraks-in-the-lurch-after-a-lifetime-dedicated-to-literacy/article35376323.ece

Performing the State level inauguration of the disbursal of aid to the differently abled under the aegis of the Kerala Handicapped Persons’ Welfare Corporation in Kozhikode, the Minister said that efforts would be made to create an environment in which the differently abled persons in the State could overcome their physical difficulties and mental challenges, and be a part of society without any inhibitions. “All efforts will be made to enable them to reach heights in their career and education. Steps have been taken to make all schools and colleges in the state differently-abled friendly”, the Minister said.

Local councillor P.K. Nasar said he would submit a report to the Corporation Secretary on Monday, besides seeking a joint survey of the banks of the canal by various departments. It was on July 14 that the corporation’s town planning wing served a stop memo on the construction of a building which is barely three metres away from the canal at Puthiyapalam, in clear violation of the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) rules. The councillor and a building inspector, along with activists of the Kallai River Protection Committee had visited the spot on the previous day and demanded that the construction be stopped. But work resumed just minutes after the group left, following which the councillor informed the police. “The violation was due to negligence on the part of officials,” Mr. Nasar said, adding, “The builders had sought clearance for the construction in 2011 and did not renew the permit for 10 years. The CRZ rules came into effect in 2016. When the builders sought renewal of permit, corporation officials should not have encouraged it.” The corporation will lift the stop memo provided the builders procure permit from the CRZ authority, which is quite unlikely, as the distance between the building and the canal is insufficient to obtain such a clearance. The Irrigation Department is in charge of determining the boundary of the canal as well as the Kallai river. Now that projects are in place to dredge the canal to make it suitable to be made part of the national waterway and to ensure free flow of water, a survey is essential to determine the boundaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporation-to-inspect-crz-violations-at-puthiyapalam/article35376333.ece

So for many households in Kerala, the evenings of the next 31 days are devoted to reading Ezhuthachan’s Adhyathma Ramayanam Kilippattu . This time, you could also watch, from the comfort of your home, the tale of Lord Rama in classical dance forms over the next one month. A unique online dance festival, curated by city-based Bharatanatyam dancers N. Srikanth and Aswathy, opens on Saturday. Interestingly, it features only male dancers, who are perennially sidelined by oragnisers of dance festivals. “ Ramayana is the story of Lord Rama and we felt it would be nice to have an exclusive festival for male dancers,” says Srikanth. “Besides, we wanted to put the male dancers in the limelight only once.” All the shows, which open today, will feature the character of Rama. “I have ensured that there will be no repetition of an item,” he says. “Each dancer will be choreographing a different song.” Hit by pandemic And those dancers are drawn from different parts of India and even overseas, from countries such as Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. “We thought of organising such a festival because the practice of reading Ramayana during a specific month is unique to Kerala,” says Aswathy. “When we spoke to the dancers, they all wanted to be part of it.” The dancers, of course, are among the worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of them have not been on a stage for well over a year. “Online festivals like these give the performing artistes an opportunity to perform, though there is nothing like dancing on the stage in front of an appreciative audience,” says Aswathy. “We have been able to get a group of excellent dancers for the festival.” Most of the dancers will perform Bharatanatyam. But a couple of Kuchipudi dancers have also been roped in and there will be an Odissi performance too. You could watch the festival on the YouTube channel Rasanubhava Official from 6 p.m. onwards over the next one month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/this-karkadakam-an-online-dance-festival-on-rama/article35376412.ece

Mr. Sreedharan, who is the president of the Friends of Bharathapuzha (FOB), an organisation for the conservation of the river, said that removing the unused structures was a must to prevent flooding. He said the structures, including pillars, had reduced the river’s flow by 30% and had been the main cause of the floods in 2018 and 2019. The Bharathapuzha and the Thuthapuzha converge at Koottakkadavu and flow west through Kuttippuram and Thirunavaya to empty into the Arabian Sea at Ponnani. As two rivers meet at Koottakkadavu, it was natural that the flow of water was high there, Mr. Sreedharan said. Mr. Sreedharan visited Koottakkadavu on Friday and examined the possibilities of flooding. He said with the removal of the pillars, the old pulimutt should be restored. On new regulator There was demand for a new regulator at Kangapuzha in order to bring an end to the water shortage of Anakkara. A study report submitted by a committee headed by the former Agriculture Minister Mullakkara Ratnakaran had pointed out that check-dams and regulators in all panchayats would seriously affect the natural flow of the Bharathapuzha. Mr. Sreedharan too attested to the finding of the committee. He said there was no need for another regulator. The FOB had made a study on the situation in the Bharathapuzha following the floods of 2019 and submitted its recommendations to the government, which was yet to take any action on them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/remove-unused-structures-in-bharathapuzha-sreedharan/article35376601.ece

Only 10 of these persons have active disease at present. A 38-year-old man from Nedumcaud and a 52-year-old woman from Anayara have been newly diagnosed with the disease. The samples were tested at the virology lab at Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. Meanwhile, a joint review meeting called by the Health and Revenue Ministers here on Friday said that a coordinated action plan by the Health, Local Self-Government and Revenue Departments would be put together for implementation of control measures across districts to contain ZIKV and dengue infection. ‘Just one cluster’ Health Minister Veena George said that only one cluster had been found in the capital district, at Anayara. A total of 138 samples had been tested, out of which 30 tested positive. She said that dengue was being reported from all districts and that ZIKV and dengue containment could be taken together through the control of Aedes species of mosquitoes. She said that infectious diseases would have to be contained quickly so that the hospitals, which were already weighed down by COVID-19 care, was not overburdened. All districts have been asked to take the ZIKV and dengue alert seriously and to organise district-wise action plans and to strengthen containment activities. Ward-level sanitation committees would have to take an active role. Mosquito control Public should be made aware of the importance of mosquito control, especially within homes. Volunteers and agencies like Kudumbashree should be roped in for the same. Ms. George also said that micro-containment plans should be strengthened at ward-level in the context of the rising COVID-19 cases and that the districts should increase testing. Senior health and revenue officials, District Collectors and District Medical Officers were all present at the meeting.  Dengue is being reported in all districts and Zika and dengue containment can be taken together Veena George Health Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/2-more-zika-cases-in-capital/article35376410.ece

Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES) office-bearers led by State president T. Naseeruddin  met Mr. Vijayan at the Secretariat here. They said he was empathetic to their plight. Mr. Naseeruddin said the Chief Minister had not meant to sound harsh when he cautioned traders against violating the pandemic protocol. The cloud of misunderstanding receded when the traders met him in person, he said. The traders returned from the meeting with the promise that they could "anticipate a favourable decision" before Bakrid. The government promised to create a separate department to administer the retail sector. Onam season The traders told the government that floods and later COVID-19 had deprived them of three back-to-back Onam shopping seasons. Onam shoppers account for half of Kerala's annual retail business. The second wave of the disease had crippled the retail sector, causing severe loss of business and lengthy workforce lay-offs. Family-run neighbourhood convenience stores are the worst affected. Most ran on credit extended to neighbours. When their debtors failed to pay, many such shops had no option but to board up. CM’s assurance Mr. Vijayan agreed that extended shop timings and permission to open on all days would reduce crowding. He promised to consider the demand to allow textile, footwear, jewellery, mobile and fancy shops to open. The traders told Mr. Vijayan that the test positivity rate-based regulations merely pushed shoppers from high-spread localities to less-infected neighbourhoods where shops could open for limited hours and on alternate weekdays. The KVVES office-bearers said it was never their intent to challenge the government or upset pandemic regulations. "Traders are at their wit’s end. It’s a desperate situation for most. Hence, KVVES members decided to open for business. Some traders hinted that they would self-immolate in their shops if the police persecuted them for opening," an office-bearer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-expect-favourable-decision-before-bakrid/article35376425.ece

Mr. Vijayan had ordered the police off the heels of the BJP leadership. It was a quid pro quo for the Centre scuttling the investigation in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case to help Mr. Vijayan.

17 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Many in Karnataka await SC’s final order on sedition law||Student-activist Maridevaiah, booked for sedition in 2020 over a ‘Free Kashmir’ placard held by one of the protesters at an anti-CAA agitation in Mysuru, is keenly awaiting the Supreme Court’s final decision on the validity of the sedition law. Observations made by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana that it is a “colonial law” and that “it suppresses freedom” while hearing a petition filed by Mysuru-based activist Maj. Gen. S.G. Vombatkere (retd.), among others, has instilled hope among many. “We at the University of Mysore were the first among the State’s universities to protest against the CAA and the NRC. So I was targeted, though there are no grounds for sedition in the protest we held,” Mr. Maridevaiah said. State’s record As per the latest National Crime Records Bureau report, Karnataka has registered the highest number of sedition cases — 22 — in 2019. The sedition database put together by Article-14, a collective working on civil rights, Karnataka has registered 53 cases between 2010 and 2021, the fifth highest among States. Most of them were reported after 2019 — 22 in 2019, 10 in 2020, and one this year. The database also indicates that 20 of the 53 cases were filed over social media posts. On varied grounds Grounds for cases have varied from a placard held to a slogan raised at a protest, especially during the anti-CAA protests. The former Minister U.T. Khader was booked for sedition for his statement that there would be unrest in the State if NRC and CAA were implemented. The former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy were booked for sedition for protests against alleged partisan action by the Income Tax Department. Once charged with sedition, it is an uphill task to find lawyers to represent, get bail in lower courts, and one always ends up with vilification by sections of the media, Mr. Maridevaiah said. “The Mysuru Bar Association resolved not to represent me in the court.The police station in my village was alerted of the case, leading to stigma and harassment to my family.I was lucky to get an anticipatory bail, unlike others who spent long tenures in jail,” he said. Senior advocate B.T. Venkatesh, who has defended several booked for sedition, said though there had been clear guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court on what constitutes sedition, they are often not followed. “The apex court judgments also provide for discretion by both executive and judiciary as to what constitutes sedition. This is misused widely,” he said. Anyone’s complaint He also wondered how private persons could be complainants in sedition cases, which is an offence against the State. “Anybody can alert the State to an offence against it, but I feel only the State can decide whether it is seditious. Today anybody can give a complaint alleging sedition and the police register an FIR. Many of these complaints are politically and ideologically motivated,” he said, arguing for scrapping of the law. The former Supreme Court judge V. Gopal Gowda opined that sedition had no place in a parliamentarydemocracy. Commenting on guidelines laid down by the apex court often being given a go by, he said district courts come under the administrativesupervision of the High Courts, which must review and guide the lower judiciary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/many-in-karnataka-await-scs-final-order-on-sedition-law/article35376032.ece
17 July 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rock pythons falling prey to man-animal conflict in Chittoor||The incidence of pythons slithering into human habitations and getting killed in the process have been on the rise in the last few years. Forest officials blame it on mushrooming of human habitations close to forests and hills. In a majority of the cases, they say, the reptiles are getting killed by the shepherds or cattle-rearing villagers as pythons attack the livestock. But, most of such cases from the remote and forest-fringe villages go unreported. However, the official say that two incidents of villagers coming forward to rescue pythons in June are welcoming. In one incident, some youths sighted a python hatching eggs in a field near Satyavedu informed the forest officials, leading to the rescue of the reptile before it was released into the forest nearby. In another incident, an Ayurveda practitioner rescued a python by preventing the villagers from attacking it at Rajula Kandriga village near Nagalapuram. Later, the snake was safely released into Nagalapuram hills. A few months ago, a 10-foot-long python, which devoured a goat at the same village, was killed during the attempt the villagers to rescue the cattle. In October last year, a 11-foot-long python was stoned to death when it was trying to crossing a road at Baireddipalle in Kuppam division. In another incident, a 15-foot-long python was killed at Gundlanayanapalle village near Kuppam six years ago after it was mistaken for devouring a child. Wildlife Protection Act Some officials on the condition of anonymity say that there is no clarity whether such attacks on python are punishable under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar say that pythons play a vital role in preserving the biodiversity in forests. “People wrongly perceive them as predators. But, the snakes protect the forest cover from the menace of overgrazing, besides balancing the population of rodents, which harm certain plant species while digging for roots. Pythons also are friends of farmers as they keep rodent population in check. Unfortunately, we don’t maintain records pertaining to the python population and their casualties,” the official said and appealed to people not to kill pythons, but inform forest officials for their rescue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rock-pythons-falling-prey-to-man-animal-conflict-in-chittoor/article35376164.ece

17 July 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police crack Narasaraopet murder case||Police announced the solving of a murder case that had sent ripples through the city earlier this month, by arresting the victim’s son here on Friday. The Narasaraopet Rural Police said that the accused, identified as Kotipati Sai Krishna (33), had hired contract killers to murder his father K. Mallikarjuna Rao (56), on July 7. Police said that Mallikarjuna Rao, a real estate businessman, was himself accused of murder. In 2019, he had a falling out with his business partner Tadikimalla Ramesh, who was later allegedly murdered by Mallikarjuna Rao and Sai Krishna. Police had arrested Mallikarjuna Rao for Ramesh’s murder. Mallikarjuna Rao later walked out on bail. After getting bail, he reportedly entered into a relationship with a woman and started neglecting his family. Enraged over the affair, Sai Krishna decided to kill his father.

17 July 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Sonia’s government in 2023’||Telangana Congress president A.Revanth Reddy claimed that Congress was sure to come back to power in 2023 and once ‘Sonia’s government’ comes into being Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his ‘corrupt’ rule will be probed. Speaking at the dharna chowk where the Congress organised a protest against the rising fuel prices holding both the Central and State governments responsible for the hike, he alleged that apprehending future inquiries some people close to the Chief Minister were obtaining passports of other countries to escape Indian laws. Levelling severe allegations against State Intelligence chief Prabhakar Rao, he said KCR was continuing him in the post even after his retirement for indulging in ‘illegal’ activities. The Intelligence chief is hiring hackers to hack the phones of Opposition leaders, he alleged adding that he would have to face the law once KCR’s term was over. Highest taxes on petrol The Congress chief lambasted the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi for ‘fleecing’ people through exorbitant taxes on petrol and diesel. Both Modi and KCR were charging Rs. 33 per litre of petrol while housewives were burdened with an increase of LPG prices by over Rs. 400 since 2014 when BJP came to power. He said petrol prices were the highest in India compared to any country and even in a poor country like Pakistan it was just Rs. 53 per litre. Similar was the case with neighbouring Bangladesh and Burma. In India it was Rs. 105 per litre of which Rs. 65 were being charged as taxes by Modi and KCR governments, he said. MLA Seethakka charged KCR with crushing their protests using police force. TPCC working president T. Jayaprakash Reddy warned the police not to create hurdles in the peaceful protests while former PCC chief Ponnala Lakshmaiah said KCR and Modi were equally responsible for the skyrocketing prices. TPCC working president Anjan Kumar Yadav regaled the participants crticising the governments with his Urdu couplets. TPCC Campaign Committee chairman Madhu Yaskhi Goud targeted KCR and said the feudal attitude was being thrust on the downtrodden. TPCC working presidents Mahesh Kumar Goud, Geetha Reddy, senior leaders Damodar Rajnarsimha, Shabbir Ali, AICC secretary N.S. Bose Raju were among present. Tension prevailed as police took into custody all the leaders as they headed to Ambedkar statue to submit a memorandum as Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan was not available. The arrested leaders were shifted to various police stations. The Chalo Rajbhavan call was given as a part of the AICC decision to protest against the rising fuel prices and cooking gas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sonias-government-in-2023-says-revanth/article35376594.ece

Her party has been formed with the idea of standing against the TRS government and it is the “only Opposition” in Telangana, she said. “I do not think that the BJP or the Congress are playing their part in Telangana. The BJP leader says he has evidence against the Chief Minister but does not do anything about it. If, indeed, he has no nexus with the Chief Minister, why does not he put them out.

The case pertained to April this year when elections were held to the Mydukur Municipality. Mr. Sudhakar accused the police of forcibly taking party councillor Shaik Mahaboob Bi from his house and making her lodge a complaint that he had kidnapped her. She later joined the YSRCP and continued to be the councillor, Mr. Sudhakar alleged. The case had been withdrawn after the elections. “It shows how the ruling party is misusing the police machinery,” Mr. Sudhakar told The Hindu over telephone. He blamed Deputy SP (Mydukur) N. Vijayakumar, the then Mydukur CI Madhusudhan Goud and Ms. Mahaboob Bi for causing him mental agony. However, sources in the Police Department said that the Mydukur police had referred the case to the Proddatur police. “How can the TDP leader file a defamation case against an official in the neighbouring jurisdiction?” wondered a police official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-leader-files-defamation-case-against-police-councillor/article35376507.ece

17 July 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||An offer for failed SSLC students goes viral||A day after he offered free stay to students who failed in this year’s SSLC exams at his tourism facilities at Kodaikanal, which had since then gone viral on social media, Sudheesh K. received a call from an enthusiastic youngster from Malappuram district of Kerala on Friday morning. After a fairly long chat, Mr. Sudheesh, to his utter shock, realised that it wasn’t the youngster who had failed in the exam but his father many years ago. “He was under the impression that the offer was open to anyone who had ever failed the exam. I had to convince him that doing that would put me out of business,” he chuckled. Since he put out a flyer in his Facebook page offering students who failed in this year’s SSLC exams and their parents two days of free stay and food in his homestays and cottages at Kodaikanal, Mr. Sudheesh’s phone had literally rung off the hooks. “Everyone is talking about the winners while it is a lonely life for the losers, especially so when only very few have failed. Their despair will be so much more living amidst accusations and taunts. I made the offer as a show of solidarity,” said Mr. Sudheesh aka Sudhi Kodaikanal, originally from Kozhikode and settled in Kodaikanal for 18 years. The call from a young girl from a broken family in Kannur was especially moving. She wants to visit Kodaikanal to escape her dismal life at least for a couple of days but had none to take her. “I will make some arrangements to bring her here safely,” he said. Another youngster had already packed his bags to come to Kodaikanal alone as he couldn’t bear the taunts. He was told that he was welcome only with his parents as he was too young to travel alone. Mr. Sudheesh said he may extend the offer beyond this month if need be. Some travel agents too volunteered to bring in students and their families in a show of solidarity. The failed students, it seem, are not alone after all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/an-offer-for-failed-sslc-students-goes-viral/article35376039.ece

NIA counsel made the submission while opposing the bail plea of Swapna in the case registered by the NIA against her and other accused. The NIA alleged in a statement that Swapna and the other accused wanted to gain money by causing extensive and irreparable damage to the security and economic stability of the country. It further submitted that the accused had conspired, recruited people, formed a terrorist gang, raised funds and smuggled around 167 kg of gold from the UAE since November 2019 with a view to committing terrorist acts. The NIA said evidence had to be collected on the source of the smuggled gold and the involvement of others who facilitated the crime from the UAE.

17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘No work on Mekedatu sans CWMA nod’||The Centre has given its assurance that Karnataka will not be allowed to carry out any construction on the Mekedatu dam project on the Cauvery river until its Detailed Project Report (DPR) is approved by the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), according to members of an all-party delegation from Tamil Nadu who met Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Friday. Earlier this month, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa unilaterally announced plans to go forward with the long-pending project, exacerbating Tamil Nadu’s concerns that their farmers further downstream will be affected. In what seemed a rebuff to Karnataka’s ambitions, Mr. Shekhawat said all parties must adhere to the approvals procedure that has been clearly laid down for such projects. “Water is an issue of engineers and science, but it has unnecessarily become an issue of politicians and sentiment,” he told The Hindu after the meeting. “The State [of Karnataka] submitted its pre-feasibility report first and having studied it, CWC [or Central Water Commission] granted permission for the development of DPR in 2018. It was a conditional permission and the number one condition was that the DPR will only be accepted and considered further if it comes with the approval of CWMA. All stakeholder States are members of CWMA,” he said, adding that the DPR was submitted online in 2020 and last discussed at the CWMA’s virtual meeting two months ago. Karnataka and Telengana representatives urged that further discussions be held when the CWMA is able to meet in person, as it is a sensitive issue, added the Minister. The 13-member Tamil Nadu delegation, which included representatives from the opposition AIADMK and the BJP’s State unit as well, was led by DMK leader and State Water Resources Minister S. Duraimurugan. They handed over a memorandum which noted that “the implementation of Mekedatu project would affect the interests of Tamil Nadu’s farming community. It is an attempt to impound the uncontrolled flows in violation of the Final Award delivered by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal as affirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.” “Mr. Shekhawat assured us that there is no possibility of Karnataka going forward without CWMA approval,” said Mr. Duraimurugan. Congress representative A. Gopanna said delegates also expressed their concern that CWMA has not had a full-time chairperson for the last three years. “It is taking money from us, but the Authority is still functioning with a temporary chair, so then how can decisions be taken?” he said. “What is significant is that all parties in Tamil Nadu have united on this issue for the first time and vowed to fight together for the farmers of the state,” he said.

Narasimha Rao has said. Addressing the media on the sidelines of the party State meeting here on Friday, Mr. Narasimha Rao said, “The YSRCP government should offer clarity on Rs. 41,000-crore expenditure that is allegedly unaccounted for. The TDP government led by N. Chandrababu Naidu too had spent more than Rs. 53,000 crore, which was unaccounted for as exposed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.” “The BJP appreciates PAC Chairman Payyavula Keshav’s fight in respect of the Rs. 41,000 crore unaccounted for expenditure. We demand former Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu to speak on the unaccounted for expenditure during the Telugu Desam Party government’s term,” said Mr. Narasimha Rao. Referring to the 10% EWS reservation, Mr. Narasimha Rao said the State government delayed implementing the Central government’s decision. Gazette notification Mr. Narasimha Rao welcomed the Ministry of Jal Sakthi’s gazette notification on the jurisdiction of the Krishna and Godavari river management boards, calling it a historic decision to “strengthen the relationship between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.” BJP State president Somu Veerraju was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/probe-accounting-lapses-during-tdp-ysrcp-terms/article35376505.ece
17 July 2021||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Workers of UB unit in dire straits||CITU State vice-president D. Govinda Rao on Friday urged the government to take steps for reopening the United Breweries (UB) factory that had laid off nearly 2,000 workers following lack of orders from the State government. Addressing the participants who participated in a protest at Ranasthalam organised as a part of the ‘chalo tahasildar office’, Mr. Govinda Rao said the company, which used to produce six lakh bottles of liquor per day earlier, was not manufacturing even one lakh bottles now as the government’s new liquor policy encouraged only new brands. As a result, the factory was not in a position to provide work even for 10 days in a month, leading to denial of Provident Fund and ESI benefits to the workers, he added. CITU district general secretary P. Tejeswara Rao urged the government to restore orders to protect the interests of the workers. Tension prevailed for nearly an hour as the police did not allow the protesters to take out a rally at Ranasthalam. The police later arrested Mr. Govinda Rao, Mr. Tejeswara Rao and others for violating the police orders that prohibited agitations in the industrial area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/workers-of-ub-unit-in-dire-straits/article35376168.ece

17 July 2021||Thrissur,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP leaders unlikely to be in Kodakara chargesheet||The Kodakara black money heist case, which has put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the dock, may be reduced to a mere theft case, it is learnt. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case is planning to file a chargesheet at an Irinjalakuda court on July 23 without the name of any BJP leader. The SIT has questioned 19 BJP leaders, including State president K. Surendran, for hours in the case. With this, the controversial case may be reduced to a theft case after a 100-day investigation by the SIT. Only the 22 people remanded in judicial custody may be named in the chargesheet. It is not still clear whether statements of the BJP leaders may appear as ‘witness statements’ in the chargesheet. All the BJP leaders, questioned by the SIT, unanimously agreed that they knew Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh worker Dharmarajan, who brought the money. They told the police that Dharmarajan had the responsibility to distribute campaign material of the party. It is learnt that the chargesheet, however, links the BJP with the source of the money. But it can be investigated only by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The police still could not prove that the money was meant for the BJP’s election campaign. After filing the chargesheet, the SIT will hand over its detailed report to the ED. The police may also recommend handing over the case to the ED. An amount of Rs. 3.5 crore and a car were stolen by a gang at Kodakara on April 3. Though the driver of the car lodged a complaint about theft of Rs. 25 lakh, the police found that the actual amount involved was Rs. 3.5 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-leaders-unlikely-to-be-in-kodakara-chargesheet/article35376035.ece

17 July 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anivara Asthanam celebrated on a grand note at Tirumala||The annual Anivara Asthanam was celebrated on a grand note at the temple of Lord Venkateswara here on Friday. As part of the festival, accounts of the previous year were presented to the Lord for his perusal after which account books for the new fiscal were ceremoniously opened. Six pairs of silk vastrams were presented by the TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy and Additional Executive Officer A.V. Dharma Reddy to be adorned to the main deity and processional deities. Earlier, Tamil Nadu Endowments Minister P.K. Sekar Babu made a customary presentation of silk vastrams to the temple on behalf of the famous Sri Rangam temple. Later in the evening, the procession of Pushpa Pallaki was organised. The processional deities adorned with rare and precious jewels were taken around in a grand procession along the mada streets encircling the temple on an exquisitely decorated floral palanquin. Thousands of devotees lined up along the thoroughfares to catch a glimpse of the colourful procession. Officials said several quintals of flowers of varied hues went into the making of the floral palanquin. Florists from Bengaluru and Vellore were specially commissioned for the purpose. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Jawahar Reddy said that the festival signified the commencement of new accounts of the temple and was customarily observed on the last day of the Tamil month ‘Ani’ during the rule of Mahanths. But after the formation of the trust board in 1933, even though the TTD switched over to the regular financial year (April 1 to March 31), it was decided that the festival would be organised on the same day in honour of the age-old tradition. Pushpayagam Kanakambara Sahita Koti Mallepushpa Mahayagam’ began at Tiruchanur Sri Padmavathi Ammavari temple here on Friday. About 180 Ritwiks (priestly scholars) from across the Southern States are participating in the ‘Yagakratu’ for nine days under the supervision of Pancharatra Agama advisor Sreenivasacharyulu. On the first day, tens of kilograms of ‘Kanakambaram’ (crossandra) and jasmine flowers were offered to the goddess. The TTD has released online tickets to the public for viewing the ritual on a virtual platform. The event is also live telecast on SVBC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anivara-asthanam-celebrated-on-a-grand-note-at-tirumala/article35376170.ece
17 July 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||TUDA aims to plant 10 lakh saplings in Jagananna Colonies||Jagananna Colonies are set to become greener with the Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA) coming forward to plant a 10 lakh flower-bearing and fruit-bearing saplings in these new townships. The programme got off to an ambitious start at Mangalam village on the city outskirts on Friday, when Government whip and TUDA Chairman Ch. Bhaskar Reddy formally launched the distribution programme for his Chandragiri constituency. The colonies, being developed outside existing villages and towns, are meant to be standalone habitations having pollution-free environment and offering an exciting liveable ambience. Speaking after distributing the saplings along with TUDA Vice-Chairman S. Harikrishna and Secretary S. Lakshmi, Mr. Bhaskar Reddy said the saplings included fruit-bearing varieties like lime, pomegranate, gooseberry, guava, orange, custard apple, sapota and flower-bearing varieties like hibiscus, Parijatham, Nandivardhanam and Ganneru. “Every household will get two saplings in each category. Similarly, saplings will also be planted along the roads leading to the colonies to give a refreshingly new look”, he added. The village Panchayats would be vested with the responsibility of maintaining the plants and necessary orders had been issued to this effect. Mr. Reddy said that the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had envisaged planting 20 crore saplings across the state, as the forest cover had dwindled to a mere 23%. “Humans had learnt the importance of planting trees the hard way after the COVID-19 struck,” he pointed out and said the ‘green attempt’ would outweigh the ill-effects of urbanisation happening with the development of such colonies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tuda-aims-to-plant-10-lakh-saplings-in-jagananna-colonies/article35376172.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video-conference on COVID-19 control measures on Friday that Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) has been suffering due to the lack of tertiary health care facilities as it did not have tier-I cities like Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad, in spite of which it did reasonably well in controlling the pandemic.

The Chief Minister said the State received 1,68,46,210 doses of vaccine so far and 1,76,70,642 doses were administered, which was attributable to the savings of the vaccines.

Syamala Rao has said. Power generation Addressing the media on Friday, Mr. Syamala Rao said that Telangana had been generating electricity independently for the last 45 days in Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala projects “without the orders of the KRMB,” and it went further by issuing G.O. No. 34 to generate 100% power. “For power generation, the State governments are supposed to place indents with the KRMB,” he said. From June 1 this year, Srisailam reservoir had an inflow of 30.38 tmcft, of which 29.82 tmcft was utilised by Telangana for power generation, leaving the storage at 806.80 feet. The minimum level must be 854 feet for drawing water from the Srisailam reservoir through the Pothireddypadu head regulator on gravity basis and a water level of 881 feet must be maintained to use A.P.’s share of water, he said. Explaining the case of Pulichintala project, Mr. Syamala Rao said Telangana used 8 tmcft of water for power generation despite the KRMB’s objection. In the last 45 days, Telangana had used 66 tmcft of water for power generation despite raising of objections by A.P. and the KRMB. CM’s letter to PM In this context, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to ensure that Telangana stopped generating power. He had also highlighted the need for notifying the jurisdiction of the KRMB and handing over the project for provision of security by the CISF. In this case, the government had approached the Supreme Court to sort the issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-hails-notification-on-krmb-grmb-jurisdiction/article35376500.ece

17 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Senior Maoist leader Sudheer likely to surrender, says SP||Senior Maoist leader Chikudu Chinna Rao alias Sudheer is likely to come out of the banned outfit due to alleged differences with senior leaders. Sudheer who holds the rank of DCM (Divisional Committee Member) is the commander of Pedabayalu and Korukond area committees of AOBSZC (Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee). This was informed to the media by the Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao on Friday. Speaking to The Hindu , the SP said that the information was based on concrete intelligence reports gathered from the locals. “Sudheer has reportedly already walked out of the outfit and we welcome him to surrender, so that he can lead a normal life in the mainstream, with all the benefits, as promised by the government,” Mr. Krishna Rao said. According to sources, Sudheer, who is a native of Kondrum village in Injari panchayat in Pedabayalu mandal, is a tribal leader, and he has been facing difficulties with the senior non-tribal leaders. Based on documents seized from various surrendered and arrested Maoists and also documents recovered from various encounter sites, it has been clear that the Maoist party has been facing an internal strife between the tribal and non-tribal leadership. This was also confirmed by Maoist tribal leader from Jharkhand, Kundan Pahan, who also contested as an MLA, after surrender. Though the party is dependent on mass tribal base, who form bulk of the attack force, the leadership is reportedly still held by non-tribals from plain areas, primarily from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Both the Central Committee and the Politburo of the banned CPI (Maoist) is reportedly packed with non-tribals, and this has not been going well with the tribals, not only in AOB region but also in other Maoist hotbeds such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. In AOB region also there has been a conflict between the tribal and non-tribal leadership, ever since assertive tribal leaders such as Gemmeli Narayan Rao alias Jambri and Bakuri Venkataramana alias Ganesh were killed in encounters and Kudumula Venkata Rao alias Ravi had died a natural death, a few years ago. Since then Sudheer and Kakuri Pandana alias Jagan, the two surviving senior tribal leaders, were in command of AOB. But of late, it is learnt that Sudheer, has been facing problem with other senior non-tribal leaders such as Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, the secretary and chief of AOBSZC, Aruna, Mahendra and Suresh. It is learnt that Sudheer has been questioning the party’s atrocities against the tribals and killing of innocent tribals after branding them as police informers, on the order of non-tribal leaders, said Mr. Krishna Rao. Sudheer also reportedly expressed that the non-tribal leaders have been taking undue advantage of the innocence and simplicity of the tribals and tribal leaders in the party like him were being suppressed for questioning such acts. He also reportedly expressed that tribal leaders, cadres and militia members were being treated as mere pawns in the conflict with the security forces. Sudheer’s surrender could be a big blow to the Maoist party in AOB region, especially after the recent encounter at Teegalametta in Koyyuru mandal, in which six Maoists, including senior leaders such as Ranadev, Ashok and Nachike, were killed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/senior-maoist-leader-sudheer-likely-to-surrender-says-sp/article35376757.ece

17 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Rain batters roads, makes traffic crawl||Travel time went for a toss on Friday in Hyderabad as the condition of roads deteriorated due to overnight rain on Thursday. The flooded roads left behind a trail of sand, gravel and potholes turning them into dangerous spots for two-wheeler riders at many locations. If it was due to the ongoing work at Toli Chowki, Karwan, and Yakutpura, it was mayhem in Bahadurpura, Narsingi-Nanakramguda road. The civic corporation deployed an earthmover at Bahadurpura to fill the potholes but the moving traffic made it worse. The condition of inner lanes in many areas was even more dire with waterlogging and potholes. “It is difficult to go to office and return home daily. If the rain continues for two more days, situation may become worst. Please help us as early as possible. Since last year, we are facing the same problem during rains. All routes to reach the main road are flooding,” said Sowmya of Jillelaguda, tagging Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao. In the rain-affected eastern parts of the city, roads were gutted in Almasguda, Meerpet Chowrasta, and Jillelaguda, forcing commuters to take long diversions to avoid traffic snarls. The overflowing lakes of Jalapally dumped tonnes of sand and gravel on the parallel road connecting airport to Chandrayangutta. The ongoing pipeline work in Toli Chowki proved to be the bane as the mud and debris slowed down traffic. At Karwan, the ongoing work for which a traffic diversion has been created a fortnight back, affected traffic flow. Vehicles coming from Ziaguda and Purana Pul had to negotiate a nearly 200-metre stretch, where there was no road. The pile of sand, bricks and masonry to fill the water puddles didn’t help. “Aap Chandrayangutta ki road dekhe? Kitna bura haal hai wahan ka. Koi dekhne wala nahi hai. MLA saab kidar chup gaye ki. Toli Chowki ka haal dekhe? (Have you seen the condition of the road in Chandrayangutta? Have you seen the condition of the road in Toli Chowki? There is nobody to notice it. The MLA cannot be seen),” tweeted an IT professional narrating his woes. However, roads in the western suburbs remained unaffected except for the stretch below the Biodiversity Flyover where sewage mixed with rain water inundated the road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rain-batters-roads-makes-traffic-crawl/article35376569.ece

17 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP welcomes MoJS notification on river boards||The Bharatiya Janata Party has welcomed the decision of the Centre to notify the purview of the Krishna and Godavari waters under the respective management boards on Friday. Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said at a press conference in Karimnagar that instead of settling the raging rivers waters allocation amicably, the Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been trying to rouse emotions among people to gain political benefit. “Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is shedding crocodile tears after accepting 299 TMC of Krishna water allocation at the apex council meeting but has been attributing motives to the Centre ever since. He has to first apologise to the people of Telangana people for this, as we are ready to fight for the rightful share of the water to the State,” he said. SC Morcha Later, presiding over a meeting of the SC morcha at Vemulawada, Mr. Sanjay Kumar once again launched a tirade against the Chief Minister charging him of “high corruption, cheating the dalits after promising them of the CM’s post and even depriving the Deputy CM post, not fulfilling the promise of giving three acres land but going for commercial land sales,” and so on. “We are going to give tickets to the Scheduled Castes (SC) even in general category seats. The BJP is the only party which can save ‘Telangana Talli’ from the clutches of Mr. Rao. We stand stand by the oppressed and the poor. Mr. Rao is against the poor, and those protesting against his misrule are being crushed through illegal detentions. But, there is no need to fear for those fighting for true ideology and just cause,” he said. The BJP president accused the TRS government of not giving credit to the Centre despite getting largesse in the form of free foodgrains for distribution to the poor and funds for several welfare schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-welcomes-mojs-notification-on-river-boards/article35376589.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao is consulting legal experts on course open to the State government to keep implementation of the Central gazette notification on river water management boards at bay. This was disclosed by a TRS MP at the end of a meeting of the parliamentary party to discuss its strategy to be adopted in the monsoon session of the Parliament from Monday. A release of the CMO said Mr. Rao shared his mind with the participants of the meeting on the party stand that should be raised on various issues during the session. Mainly, he once again insisted that Telangana did not suffer injustice in irrigation sector due to projects taken up by Andhra Pradesh. He asked the MPs to raise their voice in confronting the Centre on share of Telangana in river water whenever the opportunities provided themselves in both Houses of Parliament.

Every year, around 1,500 to 2,000 patients get admitted at the Plastic Surgery department of the government hospital, including around 1,200 to 1,500 patients who suffered from various degrees of burns. At the time of inauguration, surgeons from the hospital said that chances of death increase if a person suffers from over 50% burns and that lives of such patients can be saved by using skin from the banks. The skin bank can become functional after the health staff undergo training at an established skin bank. Sources in the hospital said that the training will be initiated shortly. Skin is harvested from lower limbs, and back of cadaver donors, within 6 hours after death or from patients declared brain-dead.

17 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Call for a council for social work education||Professional Social Worker Association, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Professional Social Worker Association have petitioned to Vice President of India M. Venkaiah Naidu for creation of the National Council for social work education. President of the Telangana chapter Srinivas Goud Survi said that there was a burgeoning request from social workers across the country for recognition of their profession through the establishment of a council.

17 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Govt. failure on promises made me float party’||Founder of YSR Telangana Party Y.S. Sharmila has stated that it is not due to differences with her elder brother and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy she has floated the party but it is due to failure of the TRS government led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao on all fronts. “If I had any differences of opinion with my brother or wanted any post in AP, I would have stopped speaking to him rather than floating a political party here. I felt the need to bring back ‘Rajanna Rajyam’ (the governance of YSR) in Telangana as people are suffering in spite of getting statehood to the region, which they hoped would solve all their problems,” she said speaking to reporters here on Friday. She said late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was not against Telangana and it was on his insistence the issue of statehood to the region was included in the manifesto of UPA in 2004. She reminded the detractors of YSR, now in the Congress, that it was he who single-handedly brought the party, which was on the death-bed in the State, to power twice by mobilising public support with the help of his historic padayatra. Ms. Sharmila recollected that the Congress leadership was averse to YSR taking to padayatra, but he went ahead with his resolve and brought back the party to power. Her party’s basic goal is to carry on the ideology of YSR with the welfare of the marginalised sections being top on its agenda. Alleging that KCR had misused the opportunity given by the people and failed as the Chief Minister as unemployment grew four times during the last seven years. About 54 lakh unemployed youth had enrolled for employment and lakhs more did not enrol. ;She sought to know from the TRS government as to how the youth would react when forced into such a situation. As the heir of YSR she had every right to invoke his legacy and do good to people and also start her proposed padayatra from Chevella, as late YSR did, Ms. Sharmila said adding that people would turn down the party in power even in AP if Rajanna Rajyam promise is not delivered. She, however, said there appears to be efforts in that direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-government-failure-to-deliver-on-promises-made-me-float-party/article35376585.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao said the weavers’ community needs more political representation and assured them that they would get to hear good news on that front very soon. Speaking after welcoming former minister L. Ramana into the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) here on Friday, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said the weavers’ community had suffered much in the combined Andhra Pradesh due to lack of vision.

The community needs a political voice and Mr. Ramana, given his committed background, is the right choice, the CM said indicating that the former Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) president would soon be politically accommodated. “I know him for the last 25 years and he is a committed worker whichever party he is associated with.” Ridiculing those opposing the sale of lands, he said the government accrued Rs. 2,000 crore from the sale of 40 acres and this money would be used for the betterment of deprived communities. Several leaders, including member of political affairs committee of Telangana Jana Samithi Srishail Reddy Panjugula, joined the TRS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-admits-lv-ramana-into-trs/article35376592.ece

17 July 2021||New Delhi,||Reply to plea on opening Nizamuddin centre: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday gave the Centre two weeks’ time to respond to a petition to open the Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin centre, or markaz , which has been locked since March 31 last year after several people who attended a religious congregation there contracted COVID-19. Justice Mukta Gupta remarked that the Centre had not filed any reply in the petition filed by the Delhi Waqf Board. “Do you want to file or not?,” the High Court asked while clarifying that a status report filed by the Centre was on the limited issue of reopening the Tablighi Jamaat centre for the month of Ramzan. The court will hear the case again on September 13. On April 15, the High Court had permitted 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at the centre during Ramzan, noting there was no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship. Justice Gupta had then said that namaz be offered on “first floor above the basement” of the mosque, and “strictly in accordance” with the DDMA’s April 10 notification and other standard operating protocols. Safety paramount “Devotees require to perform namaz five times a day during the holy month of Ramzan but at the same time, care has to be taken that COVID-19—which is increasing exponentially in Delhi—does not spread and affect the health of the public at large and those who visit the mosque to offer namaz,” the court had said. The board, in its plea, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz —comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel — continues to be locked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/reply-to-plea-on-opening-nizamuddin-centre-hc/article35376430.ece

Police said Army clerk Paramjit and vegetable supplier Habir-ur-Rahman, who were arrested under charges of spying, will undergo psychological profiling to get more details in the case. Paramjit had instructions to pass on documents related to operations and had markings of secret and confidential on them, added police. The officer said that in 2019 Rahman had approached Pakistan High Commission for a visa before visiting his aunt’s home in the Sindh area of Pakistan. Making of an asset During the visa approval process, they understood that he supplied vegetables and meat in the Army cantonment area of Pokhran and he has good contacts in the Army. They used him as an asset and he was promised a hassle-free visa process and can visit his relatives in Pakistan for as much time as he wanted if he agreed to their demand. They lured him and entrapped him. When he was in Pakistan, two people met him and brainwashed him. After returning, he got in touch with Army man Paramjit, who was deployed in Pokhran area. “The Military Intelligence was keeping an eye on the activity of Paramjit and traced Rahman. But before we could reach their main handlers, the media leaked the details of the operation,” said the officer. Rahman knows some of his handlers with different names and we are trying to find out if these handlers are in India. We also found that he used social messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram to send the classified documents to his handlers, a senior police officer said. Police said that Paramjit is currently posted as a clerk at Agra Cantonment. He has been in touch with Rahman since February 2018. From Rs. 4000 to Rs. 50,000 “Initially, Rs. 4000 to Rs. 5000 were paid to Paramjit for every set of documents. In November 2019, Paramjit was posted in Agra where he had access to more discreet documents and therefore his payments were increased to Rs. 50,000 per month,” said the officer. Paramjit had a loan, and a chunk of his salary went as installment. Hence, he was in dire need of money. “We have recovered six mobile sets from Paramjit. They have been sent to the forensic science lab to get details of documents he shared with handlers,” said the officer.

17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Riot victim says he has little faith in police||Mohammed Nasir (35) is happy that the judiciary has understood his loss but has little faith in Delhi Police, a year after communal riots broke out and he lost an eye after being shot at. A Delhi court on Tuesday imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000 on police while dismissing their petition challenging a court order that directed them to file a First Information Report on Mr. Nasir’s complaint. Police had clubbed his complaint in another FIR already registered from the area. Speaking to The Hindu , the Ghonda resident said he called the Station House Officer (Bhajanpura) and another officer asking them if he should come to the police station for FIR formalities. They reportedly told him that they will call him if required. “The court had directed them earlier to file an FIR and they challenged it. The court has now dismissed their petition again but I don’t think they’ll still file it. They’ll find another way,” he said. However, he is happy about the court order, in which the judge had written that he does “not find any merit in this revision petition.” “The same accordingly stand dismissed with a cost of Rs. 25,000, which shall be deposited with Delhi Legal Services Authority by DCP (North-East) within one week from Tuesday and the said amount shall be recovered from the petitioner and his supervising officers, who have miserably failed in their statutory duties in this case after holding a due inquiry in this regard,” the order read. Pulling up the police, the order stated: “The investigation even in case FIR No.64/2020, PS Bhajanpura has been done in a most casual, callous and farcical manner.” Living in fear However, he said he and his family still feel scared in the neighbourhood. “Whenever there is a crowd, I get scared. I have called the police station also whenever I have felt odd but the response has been very casual. I had also sought protection and the court had ordered it in July last year but police have not been responsive,” he said. The court had ordered that the SHO should keep vigil at Mr. Nasir’s place and that he should be provided with mobile numbers of the SHO and beat officers who he can contact in an emergency. The SHO was asked to contact Mr. Nasir on alternate days to ask for his well-being and provide adequate security whenever required. “None of it was followed,” Mr. Nasir claimed. Mr. Nasir was shot on February 24 when he and his family were on the way from a hospital after his sister’s operation and had reached home safely in a cab but en route dropping the cab driver till Gokulpuri junction, he was shot at by a mob and he lost his right eye in the incident. He later gave a complaint to the police identifying the accused but they added his complaint to an existing FIR. Fight till the end “In the last one year, I have been threatened so many times by the people who I have named in my complaint to withdraw it and to even change my lawyer [Advocate Mehmood Pracha] but nothing can bring my eye back. I’ll fight till the end because it should not happen to anyone,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/riot-victim-says-he-has-little-faith-in-police/article35376427.ece

On April 30, the 34-year-old doctor was found dead at his residence and left behind a note along with videos detailing why he is taking the step. Hailing from Gorakhpur, he had got married in November 2020. In one of the videos, he said that he loved his wife but she used to often fight with him over family and monetary issues. She had also not been living with him for a few days and was living at her maternal house. In the video, he also mentioned how her mother used to stop him from calling the daughter and questions every time he would call to enquire about her health. The doctor’s father, a resident of Gorakhpur, said that he had submitted a complaint against his daughter-in-law alleging that she was the reason behind the doctor taking his own life and demanded an FIR on charges of abetment. “I have come to Delhi thrice and met with the officials at Malviya Nagar. They tell me that my case won’t hold in court. I have always told them to register my FIR and I’ll see what happens in court,” the father said. He is in Delhi for the fourth time in the last two-and-a-half months and is staying at a relative’s house in Noida. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said that inquest proceedings are under way and inquiry is being conducted||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/father-made-to-run-around-to-register-fir-on-sons-death/article35376428.ece

Joshi seeking initiation of the admission process for first year students at the College of Arts. The AAD contended that the Delhi Cabinet decision of merging it with Ambedkar University violated the relevant guidelines and that DU should conduct the admission process for the new batch.  Stating that the merging was a “unilateral attack” on the university, the letter added: “This is a part of a larger design to disintegrate Delhi University into pieces. DU is an integral whole and no unit will be allowed to be taken away from DU as this will adversely affect the high quality academic environment achieved by the collective efforts of all the units. We demand that the varsity administration should not repeat its slack approach on this issue...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/start-admission-process-at-college-of-arts/article35376434.ece

17 July 2021||Kochi,||Governor moots collecting anti-dowry bonds from parents||A meeting of Vice Chancellors of State universities convened by Governor Arif Mohammed Khan here on Friday recommended seeking an anti-dowry bond from parents at the time of admission of their children to educational institutions, stating that they would not give or receive dowry during the marriage of their wards. Stern stance Mr. Khan suggested that those appointed in universities also give an undertaking that they would not receive or accept dowry. “The parents will have to sign the anti-dowry bond at the time of admission. The degrees given by the universities are being used to demand more dowry. The universities have every right to ask the person who is going to receive a degree to sign a bond against dowry,” he said. “And they [universities] are not asking to sign a bond for something extra legal. This [dowry] is a punishable crime. The universities would be asking to sign a bond to uphold the law and not to break it,” the Governor added. Mr. Khan said the suggestions made by the Vice Chancellors on how to curb the dowry menace would be compiled after the next round of meeting scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram on July 21. ‘Paradoxical’ Recalling that it is paradoxical that the State has been witnessing dowry deaths despite having the highest literacy rate in the country, the Governor said demanding dowry was repugnant not only to womanhood, but human dignity as well. “Whatever a father wants to do [for his daughter], it should be between the father and the daughter. It should have nothing to do with the bridegroom and his family. In fact, they should not even know [about it],” Mr. Khan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/governor-moots-collecting-anti-dowry-bonds-from-parents/article35376033.ece

17 July 2021||Mumbai,||Heavy rain causes waterlogging, traffic jams||Heavy overnight rainfall in Mumbai led to waterlogging, traffic jams and disruption of suburban train services on Friday morning. The Santacruz observatory of the India Meteorological Department’s Mumbai regional centre recorded 253.3 mm rainfall in 24 hours up to 8.30 a.m, which was the second highest rainfall in a day in July over the last decade. However, an observatory in south Mumbai’s Colaba recorded only 12.8 mm rainfall in the past 24 hours. Parts of Kurla, Chunabhatti, Andheri, Dahisar, and Bhandup faced waterlogging, which led to traffic snarls. People in Kurla and Dahisar were put on high alert due to rising river levels. Around 250 residents of a slum in Kurla were evacuated as the Mithi river swelled. However, as water level of the river subsided, the people returned to their homes, officials said. Local services on the Central Line saw cancellations and delays. A Central Railway official said, “Due to heavy rain and waterlogging at Chunabhatti station, trains between Wadala and Mankhurd on the Harbour Line were stopped. Services on the slow and fast lanes were delayed due to bunching of trains.” The train services were restored by afternoon.

17 July 2021||Pune,||Record 99.95% students clear Class X exams in Maharashtra||In the results to the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or Class X exams announced on Friday, Maharashtra’s cumulative pass percentage in a pandemic-ridden educational year surged to a record 99.95%. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), which announced the eagerly anticipated results, said the State’s cumulative SSC pass percentage, which had crossed 99% for the first time, had improved by 4.65 points as compared to last year’s performance of 95.30%. Official websites crash However, within minutes of the results being announced, the official websites, on which they were to be displayed, crashed owing to the server load, much to the frustration of students. As many as 15,70,996 students of 15,75,806, students who registered for the exams, have cleared it. A total of 99.96% of girls who appeared cleared the exam, outperforming boys whose pass percentage was 99.94. As many as 83,262 students scored 90% and above, while in 27 subjects, students registered a 100% pass figure, informed Dinkar Patil, Chairman, MSBSHSE. Mr. Patil said, “6.3% of the total students, 83,262 of them, have scored above 90%, while 957 students have scored 100%. The pass percentage among disabled students was 97.84%.” More than 22,000 schools in the State have registered 100% pass performance, with all students in these schools clearing the exams. Of 82,802 students who were repeaters, 74,618 (or 90.25%) cleared the exams. Change in evaluvation Mr. Patil said the reason for the high pass percentage was chiefly the change in evaluation methods brought about upon the cancellation of the physical exams. Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Nashik divisions each registered pass figures of 99.96%, while Amravati registered 99.98% and Kolhapur notched 99.92%. 100% pass in Konkan Of the nine divisions, Konkan, where usually the least number of students appear, topped with 100% pass result, while Nagpur was the “lowest”, clocking 99.84%.  This year, with the COVID-19 pandemic prompting the State to scrap physical exams, students were evaluated on their marks in both Classes IX and X, with equal weightage assigned to performances in both classes. Of the total marks, 50% was based on the performance in Class IX. The remaining 50% was divided into two — with 30 marks based on the internal assessment of Class X and 20 marks reserved for practicals or homework or assignments in Class X.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/record-9995-students-clear-class-x-exams-in-maharashtra/article35376378.ece

17 July 2021||Moscow,||Russia slams U.S.’s ‘hasty’ Afghan pullout||Russia on Friday blamed the “hasty withdrawal” of U.S. and NATO troops for a rapid deterioration in Afghanistan’s security and warned of instability spreading to neighbouring countries. Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan have capitalised on the last stages of the withdrawal of foreign troops to launch offensives, capturing a swath of districts and border crossings, and encircling provincial capitals. “In recent days we have unfortunately seen a rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. Moscow meet “In light of the hasty withdrawal of the U.S. and NATO troops, there is huge uncertainty around the future of the political and military situation in this country,” he said at a conference in the Uzbek capital Tashkent. Russia hosted Taliban representatives in Moscow last week, where the insurgent group claimed to have control over some 85 percent of Afghanistan. Moscow is closely watching the Taliban’s advance and concerned about the potential for instability reaching neighbouring Central Asian countries of the former Soviet Union where Russia maintains military bases. Mr. Lavrov said the crisis had increased the threat of terrorism and worsened problems surrounding drug trafficking, which he said had reached “an unprecedented level”. “It’s clear that, in this situation, there is a real risk of instability spreading to neighbouring countries,” he said in Tashkent, according to the TASS news agency. Earlier this week, ex-Soviet Tajikistan said nearly 350 Afghan refugees had crossed its border fleeing Taliban advances. Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rakhmon conducted inspections at border guard posts on Friday, having earlier called up 20,000 reservists to bolster defences along the country’s shared border with Afghanistan. Russia’s Defence Ministry said this week it was staging military drills in Tajikistan where it has a base aimed at buttressing border security with Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-slams-uss-hasty-afghan-pullout/article35375973.ece
17 July 2021||Tashkent,||Won’t recognise Taliban govt. that takes power by force: U.S. Special Envoy||The U.S. will not recognise a Taliban government that takes power by force, said U.S. special Representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, striking a difference from the British Defence Minister, who suggested this week that the U.K. would engage with any government in power in Afghanistan. In an interaction, Mr. Khalilzad also said Pakistan must fulfil its “special responsibility” towards peace in Afghanistan  The Taliban do not seem to be waiting for the outcome of intra-Afghan talks, and are making advances on cities. We heard from the Afghan First Vice-President yesterday that Pakistan is threatening to use missiles, if the Afghan Air Force acts against the Taliban. What, if anything, is the U.S. prepared to do if the Taliban forcibly take power in Kabul, and try to take over the country? Well, there is no ultimate military solution, there has to be a political settlement for lasting peace in Afghanistan, and it has been made clear to the Taliban that not only ourselves, but many countries in the region and beyond will not recognise, will not assist the government that takes power by force. For an agreement that can produce stability, and peace and progress for Afghan people, we need two key features — it has to be broadly accepted by the Afghan people. And it has to have the support and acceptance of the neighbours and donors and other countries around the world. And for those two things to happen, there is a need for a political dispensation, for a political agreement, for political arrangements that produce an inclusive government that reflects the diversity of Afghanistan, and that government respects the fundamental rights of all Afghans, men, women. People of Afghanistan must be given the opportunity to have a say in the choice of how they’re governed and who governs them. And finally, that Afghanistan doesn’t pose a threat to the neighbours and beyond by allowing terrorists to use its territory, whether groups or individuals. There is an international consensus on these principles. And all the neighbours one way or the other have said the same. And so I know that there are military movements and developments, but ultimately what is needed is a political settlement for these aspirations for peace and development to be achieved. But what if that doesn’t happen? What is the U.S., if anything, prepared to do? We will continue to support the Afghan government. We have said that while forces withdraw, yes, that is ongoing. But we will support the Afghan security forces where the [U.S.] President’s budget has asked for $3.3 billion in assistance for the Afghan security forces. We will provide economic support, we will provide humanitarian support. And at the same time, we will work with others to press for these objectives that I described. You said the neighbours are on board, yet we see this threat apparently from Pakistan, saying they will practically give a cover to the Taliban if the Afghan Air Force were to act against them in Spin Boldak. I don't know whether the Pakistanis have said that, we don’t know that. The Pakistani Prime Minister is here, the Afghan President is here... I hope they will meet. It’s vital that Pakistan play its role in helping Afghans to achieve an agreement of the kind that I described. And Pakistan has a special responsibility in this regard. So we’re working with all sides in the service of those objectives. You met with the Indian Foreign Minister as well, and what are your expectations from India in all of this? India, of course, is a very important country in the region, with a long history with Afghanistan. And we had a good discussion with the Foreign Minister [S. Jaishankar], covering mostly Afghanistan. And we agree despite the challenges that exist, and we have to address those challenges, that a political settlement of the kind I described is the ultimate solution. There is really no military solution. Some may have the illusion that there may be a military solution. But the costs of pushing for a military solution will be very high, and it will not achieve the objectives that I described. The Taliban said they [don’t want to be shunned] and want to be accepted by the neighbours and by the international community as a legitimate actor, partner in the future. And those are aspirations that cannot be achieved if the military solution is sought.  Afghans must be given the opportunity to have a say in the choice of how they’re governed and who governs them||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/wont-recognise-taliban-that-take-power-by-force-us-special-envoy/article35375976.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Bring to justice those behind terror attack, China tells Pak.||Underlining China’s growing concern over Wednesday’s bus blast in Pakistan that killed nine Chinese workers, Premier and second-ranked leader Li Keqiang on Friday called on his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan to ensure those behind the attack were brought to justice. Mr. Li in a phone call said “China hopes Pakistan can provide assistance and use all necessary means to investigate the attack and bring the terrorists involved to justice,” the Communist Party-run Global Times reported, adding Premier Li “urged Pakistan to take effective measures to enhance the protection of Chinese personnel and organisations in Pakistan to avoid similar incidents.” He also “stressed the Chinese government pays high attention to the security of Chinese citizens and organisations overseas”. Pakistani officials had initially described the incident that claimed the lives of nine Chinese nationals, who were working at the Dasu hydropower project, part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, and four Pakistanis as an accident, before subsequently saying traces of explosives had been detected. China said it had dispatched a work team, which had arrived in Pakistan and would “coordinate” with local authorities as investigations progress. The Global Times said Mr. Khan had invited Mr. Li for the phone call and “expressed his sincere condolences to the Chinese government” and “reported the progress of the current investigation and follow-up work”. Mr. Li “thanked Pakistan for the immediate rescue and investigation after the blast”. Chinese experts have speculated that the Pakistani Taliban or Balochistan outfits were likely behind the attack. Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times “Balochistan terrorists and the Pakistani Taliban were possible sponsors”. He said the group “in recent years targeted Chinese projects in the country, and launched attacks on Chinese tourists, as well as businesspeople, as they know that Pakistan attaches great importance to China-Pakistan ties, and they aim to use such attacks to sabotage bilateral relations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bring-to-justice-those-behind-terror-attack-china-tells-pak/article35375968.ece
17 July 2021||Schuld,||Europe reels from worst floods in years, 126 dead||The death toll from devastating floods in Europe soared to at least 126 on Friday, most in western Germany where emergency responders were frantically searching for missing people. Residents were caught completely off guard by the torrent, dubbed the “flood of death” by Germany’s top-selling daily Bild . Streets and houses were submerged by water in some areas, while cars were left overturned on soaked streets after flood waters passed. Some districts were completely cut off from the outside world. “Everything was under water within 15 minutes,” Agron Berischa, a 21-year-old said. Several people were feared dead in a landslide in northern Germany. At least 24 people were confirmed dead in Euskirchen, one of the worst-affected towns just to the north. “I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said from Washington, where she met with President Joe Biden. The number of casualties in Rhineland-Palatinate has reached 60, bringing the national toll to at least 103, authorities said. In Ahrweiler, around 1,300 people were unaccounted for, although local authorities told Bild the high number was likely due to damaged phone networks.  In Switzerland, lakes and rivers were also swelling after heavy overnight rainfall. In Belgium, death toll jumped to 23 with more than 21,000 people left without electricity in one region. The army has been sent to four of the country’s 10 provinces to help with rescue and evacuations. Luxembourg and the Netherlands were also hammered by heavy rains.  Some parts of western Europe received up to two months’ worth of rainfall in two days, according to the World Meteorological Organization.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/europe-reels-from-worst-floods-in-years-126-dead/article35375971.ece
17 July 2021||COLOMBO,||China to send more vaccines to Sri Lanka||China will gift Sri Lanka an additional 1.6 million doses of Sinopharm, the country’s Embassy here has said, while the island nation expands it COVID-19 vaccine coverage, with the aim of welcoming tourists and urgently boosting revenue-inflow. The move takes the total vaccines gifted by China to Sri Lanka to 2.7 million doses. Additionally, Sri Lanka has procured 6 million from China so far. Another 2 million procured doses are scheduled to arrive during the third week of July, while Colombo plans to purchase a further two million in the last week of July, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy told The Hindu . By the end of the month, Sri Lanka would have purchased a total of 10 million Sinopharm vaccines. Amid Sri Lanka’s persisting third wave of the pandemic — 1484 cases and 50 deaths reported on Thursday — President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has instructed officials to expand vaccination coverage, his office said. Sri Lanka also reopened the country for tourists, further easing restrictions on Friday for fully vaccinated travellers, except from India, and select African and South American countries, from where passengers are still barred entry into Sri Lanka.  Vaccine coverage According to government sources, the island nation is counting on the possible revival of its tourism sector to face its severe economic crisis, of draining foreign reserves in the face of a daunting debt repayment schedule in the coming months. Beginning in January this year, Sri Lanka has been administering Covishield, Sinopharm, Sputnik and Pfizer vaccines, and a majority of those vaccinated has got Sinopharm jabs. Data published by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health showed that, as of Thursday, more than 51 lakh people have obtained their first shot, with nearly 80% of them receiving Sinopharm. Over 16 lakh people —  or nearly 8% of the adult population — have received both doses, and over 70% of them took Sinopharm. Japan to send doses Meanwhile, with some 5 lakh people awaiting their second dose of AstraZeneca, Colombo has been trying to tap other sources, after India stopped exporting vaccines. Earlier this week, Japan said it would provide 1.45 million doses of AstraZeneca Vaccine Manufactured in Japan to Sri Lanka. On Friday, the country received 1.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine from the United States, through the ‘COVAX Facility’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-to-send-more-vaccines-to-sri-lanka/article35375970.ece

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The vaccine scamster of Kolkata||A hoarding in blue and white bearing the logo of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) hangs outside an office located on the third floor of a building in Kasba. Unlike the dingy, cramped offices that define the KMC, this space, in a building referred to as the UCO Bank building, on Rajdanga Main Road, has a cheerful look. It is festooned with balloons in the official colours of the West Bengal government, blue and white. The hoarding lists in exhaustive detail the activities carried out by the civic body: ‘Urban Planning and Development’, ‘I&PR’ (Information and Public Relations), ‘Urban Management’, ‘Environment and Heritage Department’. And so on. These are all not what they appear to be — signs of a celebration; they are, in fact, the only remains of an audacious vaccination racket that has been carried out from these premises. In charge of the scam was a stocky man aged 28, Debanjan Deb, who had been masquerading as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer for about a year. The fact that Deb managed to dupe businessmen, officials and people and carry out a racket while posing as a government servant has left the Mamata Banerjee government red-faced, investigating officers astounded and the people scared. Acts of deceit Deb had mastered more than just the art of putting up a fake hoarding. He had learned to use government logos and letterheads, email from fake government accounts, and even create bank accounts that sounded official to those interacting with him. While Deb mostly masqueraded as the Joint Commissioner of KMC (the post was vacant then), he also sometimes posed as the Secretary of the Information and Cultural Affairs Department. Deb looked like an official in every sense to an untrained eye. He used a Toyota Innova SUV, bearing the registration number WB06R-0999. The car was fitted with a blue beacon light, the symbol of power. It also had a flag, and logos and stickers representing the Government of West Bengal. Deb’s Salt Lake residence had an ‘IAS Officer’ plaque on the gate. A 50-m area around the house was declared as a ‘no vehicle zone’. Deb’s social media profiles provide a glimpse of how he created and cultivated this fake identity. The bio of his Twitter account (@DebanjanDeb07) describes him as a ‘Public Servant’. He first posted from the account as a ‘public servant’ in October 2020. Among his initial posts was a photograph of him greeting the former Mayor of Kolkata and Chairman of the Board of Administrators, KMC, Firhad Hakim. Between October 2020 and April 2021, when he stopped tweeting, Deb posted several photographs with prominent personalities including Ministers and MPs of the Trinamool Congress. He retweeted information from the account of Egiye Bangla, the digital interface of the West Bengal government. Many of his posts were about RT-PCR tests carried out at different centres of KMC and other activities related to managing COVID-19 in the city. A few tweets were also about the Central government. He put up about 50 tweets and retweets between October 2020 and April 2021, each designed to give the impression that he is a government servant. On Instagram, Deb’s account describes him as a ‘Film Lover, Music Lover, Food Lover and an inveterate traveller’.   Blowing the lid off the scam For months, Deb organised awareness drives on COVID-19 and distributed masks and sanitisers. He took bribes from businessmen. He operated the vaccination scam from the heart of the city — no one suspected anything amiss. His latest fake COVID-19 vaccination camp would have gone unnoticed too had it not been for Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty. Deb and his team invited the actor-turned-politician to the ‘vaccination camp’ organised at the Kasba office where Chakraborty decided to take a vaccine shot. Deb did not miss the opportunity to sit next to her and be photographed. He seemed calm and composed — the videos and photos clicked at the event betray no emotion. But Chakraborty grew suspicious when she did not get a message after receiving her shot. “I was told that I would receive it shortly. I immediately asked my office to enquire whether the people present at the site had received registration messages. The people present there said they had not received any such message,” she said. Chakraborty said she had agreed to go to the camp as she was told that people with disabilities were being vaccinated there. She brought the matter to the notice of the city police immediately. Deb was arrested the same evening. “During the enquiry, several irregularities were noticed. It was revealed that the vaccination camp was running without any permission from the Kolkata Police, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation or any other government department. It also came to light that Deb is not an IAS Officer...,” reads the affidavit filed by the West Bengal government before the Calcutta High Court. Deb was detained and arrested on June 22. A couple of days after Deb’s arrest, Kolkata Police Commissioner Soumen Mitra broke his silence and described the actions of the accused as “inhuman”. “It can be nothing more than the workings of a distorted mind,” he said. The ‘vaccines’ Once Deb was arrested, one of the biggest challenges for the investigators was to trace how he had procured COVID-19 vaccines. Once they recovered vials bearing the labels of ‘Covishield’ and ‘Sputnik V’, they began to examine whether the vaccines were genuine. On hearing about the racket, hundreds of agitated people, who had been administered vaccines at the Kasba office, started to come forward claiming that they were feeling unwell. The KMC rushed a team of doctors on June 24 to check on these people. Scores of them came to get themselves checked, complaining of headache, body pain and general discomfort. “I have been feeling unwell ever since I heard that the vaccines could be fake. I have headache and nausea,” said Kaushik Das, a security guard at the Kasba New Market area. Das and several others who queued up at the KMC health facility were also worried about how they would get their second dose as they had not received the vaccination certificate after their first dose. The first list prepared by the civic body suggested that 102 people, mostly shopkeepers at the Kasba New Market area, not far from Deb’s office, were among the vaccinated. A medical officer of Borough XII, who was present at the camp, said that none of them had any serious symptoms. Most of them were suffering from panic attacks, he said. Meanwhile, a team from the State Forensic Science Laboratory collected the vaccine vials from Deb’s office. The results came as a shock. The report of the forensic team said that the ‘Covishield’ labels had been pasted on glass vials of Amikacin Sulphate, used to treat serious infections caused by bacteria such as meningitis, while the ‘Sputnik V’ labels had been pasted on vials containing Triamcinolone Acetonide, which is used to treat inflammation, allergic reactions and various skin conditions. The investigation turned a page when the police found that Deb had organised as many as six camps at his Kasba office between June 11 and June 22 and one camp at City College on Amherst Street on June 18. A total of 802 people had been administered these injections at these camps. Fake accounts, orders, letters How was Deb able to pull off such an outrageous operation? Not only did he organise seven ‘COVID-19 vaccination camps’ in the city in just 10 days but he also employed several people to work for him. Some of the people questioned claimed that they were recruited by the KMC and were paid regular salaries. A few of Deb’s employees said they took a test and even paid a bribe to Deb, who had posed as the Joint Commissioner of KMC, to get the job. Some of the employees said that their salaries had been credited from an account called ‘WB FINCORP’, which appeared to be official but was not. The account was similar to the KMC hoarding outside Deb’s office at Kasba — it looked credible. The police have seized five accounts of Deb and two other accounts: M/s WB FINCORP and M/s KMC Planning & Development UPD Kasba. The fact that Deb managed to open an account in the name of the KMC in a private bank surprised Hakim even more than his own photograph with the accused that Deb had tweeted. “How can someone open a fake account of the KMC with fake documents,” Hakim wondered. It turned out that Deb had used fake holograms of the KMC to get bank accounts in its name. For getting holograms for fake work orders, Deb had provided fake acceptance letters and approval letters from the ‘KMC’ to a businessman in the Dalhousie area.   As the investigation gathered pace, the police arrested some accomplices of Deb. Among those arrested was Kanchan Deb who had posed as a high-level official of the KMC. Kanchan is Deb’s cousin. Soon after his arrest, Kanchan spoke to the media about how he was unaware of the things that Deb had done. He also falsely claimed that he and his family got vaccinated at one of the vaccination camps organised by Deb. Another accused, Sarat Patra, was arrested for impersonating a medical officer and injecting people at one of the camps. Days later, Deb’s security officer, Aurobindo Baidya, was arrested. Deb had hired a private security guard who was instrumental in getting several people from the Sonarpur area to get vaccinated at the camps in Kasba. By the end of June, the police had arrested nine people in connection with the vaccination scam. The Kolkata Police have set up a special investigation team comprising 17 members of the detective department. The investigation is being supervised by the Joint Commissioner of the Kolkata Police. The motive The obvious reason for Deb’s elaborate plan seems to be financial gains, said investigators. Deb, they said, was disposed towards criminal activities even during his college days. A Zoology teacher, who liked acting, said that Deb had once duped him on the pretext of securing a ‘technician card’ for him to get work in the Bengali film and television industry. The son of a retired Deputy Collector of the State Excise Department, Deb graduated in Zoology from Charuchandra College in Kolkata. He later got admission for a Master’s course in Genetics at the University of Calcutta, which he never completed. According to his close friends and family, he appeared for the Civil Services Examination in 2014 and failed to crack it. Once the scam was out in the open, several businessmen alleged that they had also been duped by him. Most of them had been promised tenders to supply COVID-19 essentials and other medicines to state-run facilities. Deb forged documents to make them appear as though they had been issued by the Government of West Bengal. He used fake stamps, fake seals and impressions, and operated from fake emails ids and bank accounts created in the name of the KMC. Not only in Kolkata but businessmen about 500 km north in Siliguri also said that Deb had taken money from them and promised to set up an office of the Tea Board in north Bengal. “From the scrutiny of the bank account traced till date, it has been revealed that there has been a transaction of Rs. 2.80 crore (approx.) in the said accounts and a considerable portion of the said money have been found to be siphoned off in different accounts,” reads the affidavit filed by the Kolkata Police in the Calcutta High Court. The police also pointed out that Deb, using forged documents, had deposited a sum of Rs. 77,13,000 in the accounts. According to Atin Ghosh, MLA and member, Board of Administrators, KMC, Deb even took a little over a lakh to vaccinate about 100 employees of a non-governmental organisation. A major embarrassment The scam created ripples in the political circles in the State. While distancing her government from the issue, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described the accused as being “worse than a terrorist”. She said, “You should not publicise the names of cheats, thugs and impostors. If you don’t take his name and ask about the impostor, then I will respond.... How can someone display such audacity. This has nothing to do with the government.” Deb’s duplicity brought major embarrassment to the State government. Days after his arrest, a bust of Rabindranath Tagore in Kolkata’s Taltala area, which was unveiled on February 26 this year, was located with the name of the impostor IAS officer on the plaque. The plaque had the names of a local MP, an MLA and a former Mayor of Kolkata, among others. The civic officials tried to cover his name with black ink. When that didn’t work, they finally destroyed the plaque on June 25 in the presence of several television news cameras. The Opposition parties, particularly the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had a field day as the controversy continued to make headlines for days. Party members hit the streets, clashed with the police during a march to the KMC, and organised a law violation programme in Kolkata, where several leaders courted arrest. BJP leaders wrote to the Union Health Ministry seeking its intervention in the issue. By the first week of July, the Enforcement Directorate had started a probe into the scam. A number of writ petitions were filed before the Calcutta High Court demanding a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The High Court said in its observation that the inquiry “does not show that there is any deficiency in the conduct of this investigation, the facts do not warrant investigation by the CBI”. In its July 9 order, the court said that Deb along with his collaborators have been “able to deceive a large section of innocent people, lure them to take vaccination from him at a serious risk to their lives”. The story of Deb has had a snowball effect. In the last week of June and first two weeks of July, many impostors operating across the State were caught. They included a man claiming to be the CBI counsel, a youth claiming to be a CBI officer, and some pretending to be Crime Investigation Department officers and officers of the State Police. One of them even pretended to be a member of the National Human Rights Commission. All of them had a modus operandi similar to Deb’s — they spun their own webs of lies and operated fake social media profiles. While investigations continue, the city police are busy keeping a watch on the roads and noting down the numbers of vehicles that have beacons on top.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-vaccine-scamster-of-kolkata/article35375967.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||India needs a renewed health-care system||India has a new Union Health Minister after the recent cabinet reshuffle. So, what does the new Health Minister need to learn from previous experience, and what unfinished tasks need to be taken forward? As citizens, how should we expect the Government to perform better on the public health front, given the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic? If the Union Health Ministry acts upon the following health system lessons, this would not only enable improved handling of COVID-19, but would also have widespread positive impacts extending much beyond the COVID-19 situation. Two States and a comparison For any population, the availability of functional public health systems is literally a question of life and death. This is evident by comparing two States which currently have the highest number of COVID-19 cases in India — Maharashtra and Kerala. Their per capita gross State domestic product (GSDP), reflecting the overall economic situation in each State, is similar. However, their COVID-19 case fatality rates are hugely different — this being 0.48% for Kerala and 2.04% for Maharashtra, with the shocking implication that on average, a COVID-19 patient in Maharashtra has been over four times more likely to die when compared to one in Kerala. A major reason for such critical divergence is likely to be the huge differences in the effectiveness of public health systems. Kerala has per capita two and a half times more government doctors, and an equally higher proportion of government hospital beds when compared to Maharashtra, while allocating per capita over one and half times higher funds on public health every year. Despite Maharashtra having a large private health-care sector, its weak public health system has proved to be a critical deficiency. In contrast, robust government health-care services in Kerala have translated into: a more effective outreach, timely testing, early case detection and more rational treatment for COVID patients, which all together reduce fatality rates. Existing evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic provides a clear message: a neglect of public health systems can mean large-scale, avoidable losses of lives;  hence, public health services must be upgraded rapidly and massively as a topmost priority. Focus on public health Talking of priorities, if the Rs. 20,000 crore or nearabout allocated for the Central Vista project were to be utilised instead to set up oxygen plants, two-thirds of the over 25,000 government hospitals across India could acquire their own oxygen source, thus helping to save the lives of lakhs of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. A larger programme which requires the immediate attention of the Health Minister is the National Health Mission (NHM); since 2017-18, Union government allocations for the NHM have declined in real terms, resulting in inadequate support to States for core activities such as immunisation, while systemic gaps affect the delivery of COVID-19 vaccination. Although urban people across India have experienced major shortages of public health services during COVID-19, the condition of the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) remains pathetic. This year’s Central allocation for the NUHM is Rs. 1,000 crore, which amounts to less than Rs. 2 per month per urban Indian. This situation must change, and as recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee, for reaching National Health Policy targets, the Government must allocate Rs. 1.6-lakh crore for public health during the current year. This would amount to a doubling of the present central health Budget, which could enable major strengthening of health services in rural and urban areas across the country. Private sector regulation Another clear priority that has been highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic is the need to regulate rates and standards of care in the private sector. Massive hospital bills have caused untold distress even among the middle class; COVID-19 care often costs Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh per week in large private hospitals. The ‘Remdesivir panic’ was significantly linked with major overuse of this medicine by unregulated private hospitals, despite the drug lacking efficacy to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Although various determinants have contributed to the Mucormycosis outbreak, irrational use of steroids in COVID-19 patients, especially diabetics, appears to be an important factor. Yet, despite accumulating evidence on the need for comprehensive regulation of private hospitals, the central government is yet to take necessary steps to promote the implementation of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act (CEA). Passed in 2010 and presently applicable to 11 States across India, this Act is not effectively implemented due to a major delay in notification of central minimum standards, and failure to develop the central framework for regulation of rates. Responding to public distress, around 15 State governments invoked disaster-related provisions to regulate rates for COVID-19 treatment in private hospitals. However, initiatives from the central government to promote regulation of private hospitals during the COVID-19 situation are conspicuously inadequate. Learning from stark market failures during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensive regulation of private health care in public interest now must be a critical agenda for the new Health Minister. NITI Aayog prescriptions A logical corollary of the first two lessons is that health services should not be further privatised. However, flying in the face of health-care distress faced by ordinary Indians during the last 16 months, NITI Aayog has recently published the document, ‘Investment Opportunities in India’s Healthcare Sector’ (https://bit.ly/3em8myP). This promotes further privatisation of health care in a country which already has one of the most privatised health systems in the world. Published in the midst of widespread experiences of large-scale overcharging and irrational care by private providers during the COVID-19 epidemic, the report fails to acknowledge the negative aspects of unregulated private health care; neither is there any mention of the need for regulation of private hospitals. Instead, the document celebrates the COVID-19 epidemic as a prime business opportunity to be exploited, stating that ‘in the hospital segment, the expansion of private players to Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations, beyond metropolitan cities, offers an attractive investment opportunity’. Proposals for handing over public hospitals to private operators, who would presumably now run these key public institutions on commercial lines under the ‘Viability Gap Funding’ scheme are deeply worrisome, especially since public health services which were hitherto free of cost, would begin to be charged for. Assuming that the Union Health Ministry has a primary mandate to shape national health policy in India, the Health Minister must assert his authority to stop such moves for further privatisation, which might benefit health-care corporates but would be damaging for ordinary people. To conclude, this is a time when it is critical to rebuild people’s trust in public health systems. This would help in overcoming COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy while strengthening the promotion of healthy behaviours necessary to deal with the current wave of COVID-19 and prevent a third wave. This would be done best if the new Health Minister acts on three core health system lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic — a need for strengthening public health systems; regulating private health care, and preventing further privatisation of the health sector. It is not unjustified to expect our new Health Minister to present an example to the people of India, by acting decisively for public health systems.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||An irrational draft population control Bill that must go||Many of us working in the field of public health and social development have been taken aback, if not downright shocked, by the recently announced draft Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021 (https://bit.ly/3eoMRh3) that focuses exclusively on making a two-child norm a law, specifying various incentives and penalties for contravention. The burgeoning negative reaction to this proposal derives from a variety of inherent dangers, but also because most experts would agree that the conceptual clarity on ‘development being the best contraception’ and the irrationality of incentives-disincentives had been, ostensibly, long settled. As early as 1994, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (UN 1994); to which India is a signatory, strongly avers that coercion, incentives and disincentives have little role to play in population stabilisation and need to be replaced by the principle of informed free choice. This principle is also echoed in the National Population Policy 2000, which unequivocally supports a target-free approach and explicitly focuses on education, maternal and child health and survival, and the availability of health-care services, including contraceptive services, as key strategies for population stabilisation. The logic and rationale for this global and national articulation against incentives and disincentives, and in favour of the developmental measures mentioned above applies as much to Uttar Pradesh and other States today as they did when these policies were formulated. Signs of stabilisation Consider the rationale below with the facts as they stand: The population of India, and Uttar Pradesh is on the road to stabilisation regardless of coercive policies such as the two-child norm. The fertility rate for Uttar Pradesh (National Family Health Survey, or NFHS-4) is 2.7, compared to 3.8 10 years ago (NFHS-3). This trend is correlated with improvements in health indicators for the State, such as infant mortality rate (IMR), maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and malnutrition, in the same period. There are many States that have attained the replacement-level fertility rate of 2.1 by NFHS-4 such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, West Bengal (excluding Union Territories and some northeastern States); all of which have much better development indicators. For instance, by NFHS-4, child mortality rate in Uttar Pradesh is 78 compared to seven in Kerala and 27 in Tamil Nadu. Women with 10 or more years of schooling stand at 33% in Uttar Pradesh compared to 72% in Kerala and 50% in Tamil Nadu. Thus, there is much scope for acceleration of population stabilisation through better delivery of health and education services. Issue of child sex ratios Second, one of the greatest concerns with coercive policies such as the two-child norm is their potential impact upon child sex ratios in a society that has such a high preference for male children. That this concern is only too real is well demonstrated by the example of China that had to detract from its stringent one-child norm, first in favour of a two-child norm and then to remove targets altogether, after experiencing a disastrous reduction in its child sex ratio. Considering that Uttar Pradesh is amongst the worst across Indian States, with the lowest child sex ratio of 903 compared with 1,047 in Kerala and 954 in Tamil Nadu, and that; unlike other development indicators, this has deteriorated in NFHS-4 compared to NFHS-3, why it would want to take such a foolhardy misstep is hard to understand. The correlation between poor socioeconomic status and family size also impacts the potentially discriminatory effect of the proposed measures upon communities that house the poorest of the poor, such as the religious minorities and Dalits, as already pointed out by many. Leaving these communities out of political and administrative spaces as well as curtailing their access to welfare is hardly likely to advance any kind of social justice or equity. In our experience with poor communities that are often blamed for not exerting population control, a vast majority are keen to receive and actively seek contraceptive services. With an unmet need of 18% in Uttar Pradesh (as compared to, for example, 10% in Tamil Nadu), it is the State that is failing to provide a service at all to almost a fifth of its people that actively seek it, and services with quality to a far higher percentage. If the law has to be used to correct the situation, why do we not see a move to enact ‘the Right to Healthcare’ as being demanded by health groups for decades? And why do we not find penalties upon the State for failing to provide services on demand within a reasonable period of time within this law itself? We still have memory of hundreds of lives needlessly lost and human rights violations in almost criminal sterilisation ‘camps’ that the Supreme Court of India had to step in to regulate ( Devika Biswas vs Union of India & Others , Petition No. 95 of 2012). Most recently, a disabled man from a village in Uttar Pradesh was lured into going for a COVID-19 vaccination and was forcibly sterilised instead to fulfil targets. A wrong path to follow Clearly, as is evident in so many antiquated ‘control’ measures the state has been displaying in recent times, the Government has no trust in the ability of its citizens to take well-reasoned steps for their own welfare. Rather than do its job as a supporter of these decisions, and a duty bearer towards their rights, the state visualises itself as a paternal figure that must ‘control’ a recalcitrant immature populace at best, and a policeman wielding the law as an instrument of imperiousness at worst. This irrational and ill-considered proposed Act should be retracted forthwith if the Uttar Pradesh government has any appreciation for the collective understanding based on decades of scientific evidence of what does and does not work for population stabilisation. Instead, we are seeing other State governments displaying signs of following its lead. Clearly, it is easier for our governments to blame the victims of maldevelopment and apply penalties upon them than be held accountable for their own failures in delivering basic services of health and education.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Overdue review||It is gratifying to note that the Supreme Court, while indicating its intention to reconsider the sedition provision in the IPC, has raised the question most relevant to the issue: “Why does Section 124A continue in the statute book even after 75 years of independence?” The Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana, has also pointed to its rampant misuse by the police across the country, and reminded the Government that it was a legal provision that the colonial regime had used to suppress the freedom movement. The issues flagged by the CJI may set the tone for what would be a comprehensive reconsideration of a section that has been frequently and wrongfully used, especially in the last few years, to suppress dissent, criminalise strident political criticism and taint opponents with the tag of being ‘anti-national’. Even though it is often argued that the misuse of a law alone does not render it invalid, there is a special case to strike down Section 124A because of its inherent potential for misuse. There is a pattern of behaviour among all regimes that indicate a proclivity to invoke it without examining its applicability to the facts of any case. Recent cases show that sedition is used for three political reasons: to suppress criticism and protests against particular policies and projects of the government, to criminalise dissenting opinion from rights defenders, lawyers, activists and journalists, and to settle political scores, sometimes with communal hues. It is not to be forgotten that the section was upheld in 1962 by a Constitution Bench mainly by reading down the import of the terms “bring into hatred or contempt”, or “to create disaffection towards the government established by law” and limit its scope to only those instances of speech or writing that show a pernicious tendency to create public disorder. Without this attenuated interpretation, the restriction imposed on free speech by Section 124A would have been declared unconstitutional. The Court is now seized of several cases that seek a reconsideration of the 1962 verdict, citing more recent judgments expanding the scope of fundamental rights and doctrines that have been subsequently evolved. In particular, the “chilling effect” that a law may have on free speech and the vague and ‘overbroad’ definition of sedition that renders both provocative and innocuous speeches or writings equally liable for prosecution, are points to be examined. In 2016, the Government itself admitted in Parliament that the definition of sedition is too wide and requires reconsideration. The Law Commission’s consultation paper in 2018 had said: “In a democracy, singing from the same songbook is not a benchmark of patriotism... People should be at liberty to show their affection towards their country in their own way.” While issuing fresh guidelines and safeguards is one way of quelling the potential for its misuse, it will be more helpful if Section 124A is struck down altogether.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/overdue-review/article35375741.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Rising again||Fresh daily cases of the coronavirus, globally, after touching a new peak of over 0.9 million on April 28, began to drop steadily, reaching a low point on June 21, when only over 0.3 million cases were reported. But there has been a rise in cases, again globally, since then. July 15 saw 0.53 million daily cases and the second week of the month witnessed nearly three million new cases. A total of 188.9 million cases have been reported worldwide as on July 15, driven in most countries by the highly transmissive Delta variant. A total of 111 countries now have this variant. Brazil, India, Indonesia, the U.K. and Colombia have reported the most cases in the past week, with the sharpest increase being in Zimbabwe (72%), Indonesia (44%), the U.S. (38%), Bangladesh (35%), and the U.K. (30%). Many Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, where the spread was under control, have also been reporting a high number of daily cases. Indonesia has seen a surge in new cases, with each day witnessing a sharp increase over the previous day. With 56,757 cases on July 15, Indonesia is now the new Asian epicentre; India reported over 39,000 cases on July 15. According to WHO, COVID-19 deaths are increasing again after falling for nine straight weeks, with the sharpest upticks in Africa and Southeast Asia. On July 7, the total global COVID-19 deaths crossed four million. It took just 90 days for the last million deaths to occur, the shortest time span for every one million deaths recorded. The U.S. and much of Europe have demonstrated how high vaccination coverage can sharply reduce the number of deaths and even hospitalisation. For instance, with over 87% of the adult population vaccinated with one dose and over 67% with two doses in the U.K., there have been fewer hospitalisations and deaths despite spikes in cases. In the U.S., the case rise is largely in States with low vaccination coverage, and deaths mainly in the unvaccinated. Over 55% of the U.S. population has had one dose; 48% are fully vaccinated. This brings the focus back on increasing vaccination coverage and striving for global vaccine equity to prevent deaths and the emergence of deadlier variants. Ironically, the discussion in some countries is on a booster dose even while health-care workers in many African countries have not been fully vaccinated. Israel has begun giving booster shots to people with a compromised immune system, while the U.S. has ruled out booster shots for now. With several Indian States reporting vaccine shortages, strict adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour even by the fully vaccinated is the only way to delay and reduce the impact of a third wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rising-again/article35375742.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Curbs on Mastercard to hit card issuance by five banks’||Five private sector banks, including Axis Bank, Yes Bank, and IndusInd Bank, are to be impacted by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to ban Mastercard from issuing new cards for not complying with local data storage guidelines, according to a report. HDFC Bank would also have been affected but the lender is already facing restrictions by the RBI on issuance of new cards (debit, credit or prepaid). Besides, Bajaj Finserv and SBI Card may face problems as they were also issuing cards of this payment gateway. As per the report by global brokerage Nomura, in all, seven financial institutions would not be able to issue new cards as they sourced significant numbers from Marstercard. Issuance of new cards via another payment gateway would take 2-3 months as it involves technology integration and other modalities. “RBL Bank, Yes Bank and Bajaj Finserv lending are most impacted, in our view, as their entire card schemes are allied with Mastercard,” the brokerage said. As per Nomura, RBL Bank, Yes Bank and Bajaj Finserv were fully dependent on Mastercard for card issuance while dependence of IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank varied from 35-40%. RBL Bank said on Thursday it had entered into an agreement with Visa Worldwide for issuance of credit cards on the platform.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/curbs-on-mastercard-to-hit-card-issuance-by-five-banks/article35375727.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Demand strong, challenge is with supply: Mercedes-Benz||Mercedes-Benz India is seeing strong demand for its products. However, supply-side constraints are driving up waiting periods for customers, Santosh Iyer, vice president, Sales and Marketing, told The Hindu . “When you talk purely about the demand side, we are seeing a very strong order bank and bookings coming in. If we add up what we are able to sell along with the demand, we are almost back to even [the] 2019 level. But we are unable to cater to this,” he said. He added that for some cars such as the Maybach GLS and G63 AMG, the company had started taking orders even for the next year, and the waiting period for different models currently ranges between four weeks and six months. “For us, the bigger challenge is on the supply side in the second half of the year because with the festival season and our product portfolio, we expect the demand to continue. If we are able to supply, we should definitely see a good H2 also,” he said. “There is a logistics issue so the availability of certain components and parts, including semiconductors, cause a bit of challenge... Since the pandemic is global and the automotive components come from different parts of the world, the overall supply chain is under stress and there are delayed shipments. It all adds to our challenges,” he said. The firm introduced two products on Thursday: the Mercedes-AMG E 53 4MATIC at Rs. 1.02 crore and the Mercedes-AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+ with a price tag of Rs. 1.7 crore. “[This] takes our total tally to 10 launches in the year,” Mr. Iyer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/demand-strong-challenge-is-with-supply-mercedes-benz/article35375725.ece
17 July 2021||MUMBAI,||Time to be brave, stretch fiscal deficit goals if need be: Kamath||Veteran banker K. V. Kamath on Friday said it is ‘time to be brave’ for the government, and it should stretch the fiscal deficit target set in the Budget, if need be, to push growth. He said benign interest rates of less than 8% and abundant liquidity were also necessary to seize what he called as a 25-year growth runway opportunity awaiting the country. The government has targeted to get the fiscal deficit at 6.8% for FY22 in the Budget presented early this year. However, ravages of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in calls for more spending by the government even as the revenue collections decline. “This is a time to be brave,” Mr. Kamath said, speaking at an event organised by the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “That is the only way out of the challenge that we have. To the extent that you need to stretch the Budget, you do it.” He said the government had already been brave while presenting the Budget and had said that they were willing to stretch the deficit to make sure that the country continues to be on a growth path. Fiscal slippage Mr. Kamath, who had a long stint with ICICI Bank, said he does not feel that the fiscal slippage will be very wide because of the wide variety of innovative financing options available to raise money for projects and also monetisation. He said the biggest risk was that of project execution, which, if taken care of by the government, would make private investors interested in projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/time-to-be-brave-stretch-fiscal-deficit-goals-if-need-be-kamath/article35375733.ece

17 July 2021||beijing,||China starts long-awaited carbon trading scheme||China introduced its long-awaited emissions trading system on Friday, a key tool in its quest to drive down climate change-causing greenhouse gases and go carbon neutral by 2060. The scheme was unveiled with China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, seeking to take a global leadership role on the climate crisis in the lead up to a crucial UN summit in November. China has hailed it as laying the foundations for what would become the world’s biggest carbon trading market, forcing thousands of Chinese companies to cut their pollution or face deep economic hits. Analysts and experts say much more needs to be done if China is to meet its environmental targets, which includes reaching peak emissions by 2030. Pollution caps The scheme will set pollution caps for big-power businesses for the first time, and allows firms to buy the right to pollute from others with a lower carbon footprint. The market will initially cover 2,162 big power producers that generate about a seventh of the global carbon emissions from burning fossil-fuels, according to data from the International Energy Agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/china-starts-long-awaited-carbon-trading-scheme/article35375738.ece

17 July 2021||HIROSHIMA,||Bach visits Hiroshima to mark first day of Olympic Truce||IOC President Thomas Bach got a mixed reception in his visit on Friday to Hiroshima to mark the first day of the so-called Olympic Truce. Bach’s vice president John Coates also appeared on Friday in Nagasaki, the second city that was hit by an American atomic bomb in 1945. Bach and Coates have been meeting daily with Japanese officials from Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, repeating their message that the Olympics will be “safe and secure.” He was accompanied to Hiroshima by Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo Olympic organising committee. Bach laid a wreath and observed a minute of silence in the rain in front of the Peace Memorial Park cenotaph. Faint voices of protesters, who were kept at a distance, could be heard shouting “go home Bach” and “you’re not welcome here.” Dozens of protesters were seen near the Atomic Bomb Dome with signs that read “Cancel The Olympics” and “No Bach.” “You should understand you are not welcome here,” one protester said, speaking into a microphone. “The COVID-19 situation is getting worse, it hasn’t come to an end, and I wonder why this has to go ahead,” said Sayuri Yamada, who identified herself as a medical worker. She was not among the protesters. Unnecessary risks She said she did not oppose Bach’s visit, but raised questions about running unnecessary risks for the Olympics. “It’s not that I don’t want him to come absolutely,” she said. “But rather, thinking about the safety of people, including the athletes, my opinion is like he doesn’t have to do this at a time when the risk is high.” Takayoshi Kayano, who said he was an office worker, respected Bach’s right to visit but raised other issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bach-visits-hiroshima-to-mark-first-day-of-olympic-truce/article35376186.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Fearless Indians have Tokyo in their sights||India’s shooters have the onus of bagging a rich haul of medals in Tokyo, after having drawn a blank in Rio. In recent years, they have gained in strength and consolidated their dominance, topping the medals table in a series of World Cups from 2019, especially in rifle and pistol, in awe-inspiring fashion. Even in the last World Cup, when the medals were hard to come by for the Indian team that was training in Osijek, Croatia, Asian Games gold medallist Rahi Sarnobat delivered a resounding gold in 25-metre sports pistol. It is her second Olympics after London 2012, and the 30-year-old Rahi has the maturity and the technical acumen to silence the world in the fascinating event that demands accuracy at high speed. The strength of the current Indian squad is its ability to shoot high scores in qualification and unflinchingly hit the bull’s eye in the finals.  Staying in the moment  The youngsters, such as Manu Bhaker and Saurabh Chaudhary have no fear, as they stay in the moment and execute their technique, without allowing the pressure of expectations to weigh them down. Manu has three chances to win medals in her maiden Olympics, while Saurabh has two. In the mixed event, introduced in this Olympics, they have been unbeatable, save for one instance, since 2019. In the shadow of Asian Games gold medallist Saurabh, lawyer Abhishek Verma has made remarkable progress. In 2019, Saurabh and Abhishek shared the gold in the four World Cups, two apiece. Iranian Javad Foroughi has won two World Cup gold medals in air pistol this year to shift the focus away from the Indians breathing down his neck. The Chinese have stayed away from competition this season and could strike with a vengeance in the Olympics. Apurvi Chandela and Elavenil Valarivan have been equally dominant in women’s air rifle, making the gold an Indian preserve in three World Cups and a World Cup Final. Both have not been that sharp this season, and that will make them hungry to be at their best in Tokyo. Divyansh Singh Panwar had finished 2019 as World No. 1 along with Saurabh and Elavenil. He had won the mixed gold with Elavenil in the Delhi World Cup in March, apart from individual bronze. Yashaswini Singh Deswal is World No. 1 in women’s air pistol and can make it lively with Abhishek in the mixed event as well. World Championship silver medallist Anjum Moudgil, former World champion Tejaswini Sawant, two-time Olympian Sanjeev Rajput, Asian Games silver medallist Deepak Kumar and dynamic youngster Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, who won gold in the demanding rifle 3-position event in the Delhi World Cup, have the ability to rise to the occasion.  In Tokyo, hope will spring every day when the Indian shooters are in action.   The squad    Men    10m Air Rifle: Divyansh Singh Panwar, Deepak Kumar. 10m Air Pistol: Saurabh Chaudhary, Abhishek Verma. 50m Rifle 3 Position: Sanjeev Rajput, Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Everyone has ups and downs’||Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s prowess as a quality seamer was never in doubt. It is only fitness concerns which have posed a few roadblocks along the way. His troubles date back to 2018 when a back injury forced him to miss the Test series in England. He suffered a hamstring problem during the 2019 ICC ODI World Cup, before a thigh injury caused Bhuvneshwar to sit out of a large part of last year’s IPL and the entire Australia tour. The Uttar Pradesh pacer made a strong comeback earlier this year in the white-ball leg of England’s visit to India. On flat tracks, Bhuvneshwar showed great control to finish with economy rates of 4.65 and 6.38 in the ODI and T20I series respectively. This even led skipper Virat Kohli to state that Bhuvneshwar deserved to win the ODI Man of the Series Award. Despite the good returns and high praise, Bhuvneshwar did not find a spot in the Indian squad which travelled to seamer-friendly England for the World Test Championship final and five-Test series. Instead, he was named vice-captain for the limited-overs tour to Sri Lanka. The 31-year-old is happy to be involved in international cricket, even if he is part of a unit shorn of big stars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. “I don’t think you can classify either team — the one in England, or the one in Sri Lanka — as the main team. They are both Indian teams,” Bhuvneshwar said in a media interaction on Friday. On his injury concerns, he said: “Injuries happen; everyone has ups and downs. I’ve worked on how to get over injuries quickly. There are a few other things, like workload — how to recover quickly after playing a match. The physios and trainers give me some advise. Apart from that, my training and approach has remained the same.” Bhuvneshwar is keen to work closely with former India captain Rahul Dravid, who dons the role of coach for this tour. “He (Dravid) tries to keep things really simple. When things are simple, you can enjoy everything,” he said.  He (Dravid) tries to keep things really simple.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Abhinav — lone individual to live the golden dream||It was the unquenchable desire to excel, a systematic approach and the military discipline that fired Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore to the silver medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics. With the nation having gained the confidence of reaching the Olympic podium after the bronze by tennis ace Leander Paes (Atlanta, 1996) and weightlifter Karnam Malleswari (Sydney, 2000), Rathore helped India take a bigger leap of faith with his prowess in double trap. An unstable wooden flooring had robbed air rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra of a medal in Athens. Rathore had said then that Abhinav would be a World champion one day. Abhinav, who became a World champion in 2006 in Zagreb, beat defending champion Zhu Qinan in his backyard for the gold in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The Athens experience had helped Abhinav to be detached about the result, and prepare to be the best. A misaligned rifle before the final could have shaken the hardest of competitors, but Abhinav tuned it in no time to deliver 10 best shots that helped him overcome a two-point deficit before the final! At London in 2012, Vijay Kumar captured the rapid fire silver medal, while Gagan Narang narrowly missed the silver in air rifle. Two medals had given hopes of a bright future. However, it was not to be in Rio, in 2016. India drew a blank in shooting. Abhinav missed a medal by 0.1 point. Jitu Rai made the air pistol final and narrowly missed the free pistol final. Gurpreet Singh missed the rapid fire final after placing seventh. Mairaj Ahmad Khan missed the skeet final in the shoot-off.  It is time to revisit the glorious past, and enhance the glory in Tokyo.   Roll of honour   Gold: Abhinav Bindra (10m Air Rifle), 2008 Beijing  Silver: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore (Double Trap), 2004 Athens; Vijay Kumar (25m Rapid Fire Pistol), 2012 London  Bronze: Gagan Narang (10m Air Rifle), 2012 London||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/abhinav-lone-individual-to-live-the-golden-dream/article35376079.ece
17 July 2021||Chennai,||Tamil Nadu coach selection: CAC has quite a job on hand||Tamil Nadu’s Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) will meet over the next few days and name the State coach for the coming two seasons. The panel, comprising S. Suresh (chairman), U.R. Radhakrishnan and Sudha Shah, have quite a job on hand as the issue is a complex one. The coach for the last two seasons — his contract has now run its course — former Tamil Nadu all-rounder D. Vasu, hasn’t done badly at all. With him as coach, the team, following a disastrous season, reached the final of both the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament and the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 competition in 2019-20. And in 2020-21, the side went on to win the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament in an emphatic fashion. Owing to Covid restrictions, Ranji Trophy could not be held last season. The indications are Vasu wants to continue in the job. And he has the results to back him. It can be argued that Vasu has delivered. Then again, the issue has several layers. Influential skipper Dinesh Karthik has been an influential skipper for Tamil Nadu, carrying the seniors with him, encouraging the younger bunch, turning around Tamil Nadu’s fortunes and helping the State team reclaim its status as a heavyweight in the domestic circuit. Now, it is common knowledge that the relations between Vasu and Karthik are strained in nature. The communication between them on key issues is open to question. In fact, when this writer queried Karthik on Tamil Nadu’s success in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he was quick to highlight assistant coach R. Prasanna’s inputs and contribution. Now, Prasanna is another name for the top job and has the backing of the skipper. Karthik too, as several others in the team, has played the game with Prasanna who comprehends the demands of modern-day cricket, having represented the State till 2015. When the CAC meets to select the coach, the choice might be narrow but not easy in nature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tamil-nadu-coach-selection-cac-has-quite-a-job-on-hand/article35376624.ece
17 July 2021||New Delhi,||Nagal makes the cut for Tokyo||Sumit Nagal on Friday made the cut for the men’s singles event of the Tokyo Olympics as large-scale withdrawals pushed him inside the qualification mark, and the Indian tennis player is now hoping that competing at the biggest stage will settle a “few things” that are bothering him in his career. The All India Tennis Association (AITA) paired him with Rohan Bopanna for the men’s doubles competition by withdrawing Divij Sharan’s nomination since singles players are getting priority in entering the doubles draw. Nagal was ranked 144 on June 14, when the ATP rankings were to be considered for direct entries but consistent withdrawals helped him. “I knew it (cut-off) was gonna drop. Things are different this year, compared to any other Olympics. Nonetheless, I feel very happy. I am getting a chance to represent the country. I can’t complain much about it,” Nagal said from Germany. The 23-year-old will enter the Olympics with some disappointing results this season as he has suffered seven first round defeats on the Circuit, including at the Australian Open. In six Challenger events, he made the quarterfinals only thrice. “To be honest, I have been struggling with a few things, I am not going to name it. Getting into Olympics will hopefully change things in my career. It’s going to be an amazing experience. I will give my 100 per cent on the court.” Nagal did not share what was bothering him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nagal-makes-the-cut-for-tokyo-games/article35376081.ece
17 July 2021||London,||Kane ‘our player’ says new Spurs boss Nuno||Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo issued a hands off warning to clubs interested in Harry Kane on Friday amid speculation over the England captain’s future. Kane is reportedly keen to leave his boyhood club this summer in the search for the first silverware of his career. Premier League champion Manchester City has been strongly linked with a move for Kane as it looks to replace all-time top goalscorer Sergio Aguero, who has moved to Barcelona on a free transfer. But former Wolves boss Nuno, who was appointed as Jose Mourinho’s successor, is expecting his prized asset to return to Tottenham for pre-season training. “Harry is our player. That is period. No need to talk about anything else,” said the Portuguese, who was finally appointed on June 30, over two months on from Mourinho’s sacking. “Now is the moment for Harry to recover his energy and when Harry comes again we will have time to speak and have good conversations. I am looking forward to him joining the group and start working together. Harry is one of the best players in the world, that is all there is to say.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kane-our-player-says-new-spurs-boss-nuno/article35376381.ece

The 21-year-old had his £40,000 watch stolen en route to his McLaren sports car just outside Wembley. The British motor racing team then revealed that a police investigation is underway and, although Lando was left unhurt, he was still in shock after the incident. Norris was one of many sporting figures and celebrities present at Sunday’s showpiece alongside former England’s player David Beckham and Hollywood star Tom cruise. Speaking to Sky Sports , four days after the incident at Silverstone on Thursday, Norris opened up on a physically and mentally tough experience, also admitting he had been struggling to sleep since. “I’m fine... but I’ve been better, I can say that . I’m not in perfect condition, I’m not going to lie,” said Norris, a home favourite for this weekend’s F1 race. McLaren Racing can confirm that Lando Norris was involved in an incident, after the Euro 2020 final match at Wembley, during which the watch he was wearing was taken,” McLaren stated in a release on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lando-norris-not-in-perfect-condition/article35376218.ece
17 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Umpire Fine on the threshold of history||It is nearly two years since he last officiated a badminton match, but international umpire Fine C. Dathan is not worried. He is the only umpire from India who has been nominated by Badminton World Federation (BWF) to officiate in the Tokyo Olympics. Fine C. Dathan is confident of his ability and COVID-19 induced restrictions, which forced him to miss a few international tournaments, doesn’t bother him. Fine is on the threshold of an unique achievement as an umpire after having officiated in practically all major tournaments including the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, World Championships, Super Series, Thomas and Davis Cups and Sudirman Cup. The Olympics was the only major event which was missing from his ‘resume’ and he is happy that he will be adding it soon. “Officiating in the Olympics is the ultimate dream for any badminton umpire. It is a rare opportunity as BWF only gives one chance to an umpire and chooses the best from its elite panel for the Olympics,” said the assistant professor of physical education. “I became a BWF elite panel umpire in 2014 and I have officiated in all major tournaments around the world and witnessed some memorable matches from close. It is a privilege. The BWF grades its umpire and I must have got the maximum grading points to make the cut for Olympics.” A former Kerala University player, Fine passed the NIS diploma course and also coached the Kerala Schools badminton team for almost eight years. Fine, who started his umpiring career in 1994, is thankful to KBA’s former secretary S. Muralidharan in mentoring him. “It is a great gesture from KBA to grant me a financial assistance of Rs. 1 lakh. It feels good to be recognised at home. I wish to thank Murali sir for guiding me in my career,’’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/umpire-fine-on-the-threshold-of-history/article35376188.ece

The Australian Olympic team’s chef de mission Ian Chesterman told media in Tokyo on Friday that de Minaur was “shattered” over the news. “We are very disappointed for Alex,” Chesterman said. “It has been his dream to represent Australia at the Olympic Games since he was a child.” De Minaur, Australia’s top-ranked men’s player at No. 17, was scheduled to play both singles and doubles. It was unclear if de Minaur’s doubles partner John Pearce would maintain his spot on the team. “Alex undertook both the 96-hour and 72-hour PCR test as required by the Japanese authorities and unfortunately both returned a positive result,” the Australian Olympic Committee said in a statement from Sydney. “He was due to fly to Tokyo on July 18 from his base in Spain. Alex has not been in contact with other members of the Australian Olympic team since returning a negative test on July 5th.” Chesterman said de Minaur returned a negative test at Wimbledon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/de-minaur-pulls-out-from-games/article35376189.ece
17 July 2021||CHENNAI,||Madras High Court clears decks for conduct of MRC election||The Madras High Court on Friday cleared the decks for the conduct of Madras Race Club (MRC) election scheduled to be held through e-voting between July 20 and 22 for the post of management committee members. Justice V. Parthiban refused to restrain the club from conducting the election until the disposal of a civil suit preferred by its member K. Shashabindhu Das. He said the plaintiff did not make out a case for interim injunction. “Your plaint averments are sketchy and you have hardly made out any case for injunction. You have come up with rickety pleadings,” the judge told the plaintiff’s counsel and allowed the election to be held as scheduled. The judge adjourned the case to July 30 after directing the plaintiff to file his reply to MRC’s plea to reject the plaint. He found nothing wrong in holding e-voting since physical voting during COVID-19 was not advisable. Tenure getting cut The decision was taken after hearing arguments advanced by the counsel for Mr. Das who claimed that his tenure was getting cut short by two months because of advancing the election which was supposed to be held in September. Observing that the plaintiff appeared to have some axe to grind, the judge refused to stall the election on such a ground. He brushed aside the plaintiff’s contention that MRC was spread over 100 acres and that election could be held over there by maintaining physical distance. “There are Government restrictions in place against gathering of many people in a place and therefore your argument for physical election does not cut much ice,” the judge remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/madras-high-court-clears-decks-for-conduct-of-mrc-election/article35376217.ece

17 July 2021||KOLKATA,||Vijender flags former athletes’ employment issue||Olympics and World championships medallist boxer Vijender Singh has highlighted the concern of some famous former athletes, who have been employed with Haryana Police for several years. Vijender, who has taken to social media to raise the issue, said these athletes should be treated with respect. “On one hand you are promoting ‘Cheer For India’ and on the other hand you are not giving them promotions. They were stars at the peak of their careers. They should get what they deserve,” said Vijender. “They fulfil all terms and conditions. Someone like (hockey player) Mamta Kharab was appointed in 2007 and (wrestler) Geetika Jakhar in 2008 but they have not got promotions yet. “In Punjab, (shooter) Harveen Srao and (hockey player) Jugraj Singh have been promoted. It’s about respecting an athlete who has performed at the highest level,” said Vijender. Nine sportspersons, most of them Arjuna award winners, were appointed as Deputy Superintendents of Police between 2007 and 2010. They include inaugural World T20 cricket star Joginder Sharma, former hockey captain Sardar Singh, boxers Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar, World championships medallist wrestler Ramesh Gulia, hockey player Surinder Kaur and mountaineer Mamta Sodha apart from Mamta Kharab and Geetika Jakhar.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Importance of Upanishads||The Vedas have portions which are referred to as Karma Kaanda. They tell us how to perform yagas, and what mantras are to be recited during these yagas. Each of these yagas is for a specific purpose. If one wants to reach svarga loka, one has to perform Jyotishthoma Yaga. If one desires wealth, one must perform Vaayavya Yaga. The Upanishads represent the Brahma Kaanda. When we say Vedanta, it indicates the Upanishads, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. ‘Anta’ means end. The Upanishads come towards the end of the Vedas and are therefore called Vedanta. Sage Vyasa wrote the Brahma Sutra, elaborating on the doctrines of the Upanishads. Brahma Sutra has commentaries by different schools of philosophy. Ramanujacharya’s commentary is called Sri Bhashyam. For a prapanna, it is the Brahma Kaanda which is important. He seeks to be in Sri Vaikuntha, and is not interested in the material gains for which yagas are prescribed. He is not interested in svarga, where one’s stay is temporary. So he will not do Jyotishthoma Yaga. He does not run after money, and so he will not perform Vaayavya Yaga. It is not that wealth per se is shunned. He earns what is needed to run his life smoothly. He is not greedy, and will not resort to illegal means to acquire wealth. If the Karma Kaanda section is not that important to a prapanna, why do we praise the entire Vedas, including this portion? Although many devatas are praised in the mantras for the yagas, ultimately, whatever is offered goes to the Supreme One. Krishna makes this clear in the Gita. Whether it is the Karma Kaanda or the Brahma Kaanda, the Vedas are not easy to understand. To understand the Vedas, we need to study the Itihasas and Puranas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/importance-of-upanishads/article35376006.ece

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Enter the konnakol r ap||In the musical world, Scarborough conjures up images of Simon and Garfunkel. Across the Atlantic Ocean, its lesser known namesake, a Toronto neighbourhood known for its confluence of Asian cultures, inspires a serenade in Tamil music producer Yanchan’s newly released EP, Scarborough Beat Tape . With 10 instrumental tapes, Yanchan immerses hyperlocal details of his Canadian hometown in a decidedly Tamil flavour — through the soundscape of freestyling mridangam and ghatam. Seen as a traditionally Carnatic instrument, the mridangam is having a moment in hip hop and rap. What we see then is a chemistry between a genre that has historically sought to rebel against the establishment and one that is very much the establishment. Carnatic hip hop has found an audience in the Indian diaspora in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and Malaysia. Yanchan’s work in this genre is demonstarted best in the Mrithangam Raps series, in collaboration with Tamil Canadian rapper Shan Vincent De Paul. “I grew up with a foundation in Carnatic music. Until high school, that was all I listened to. When I was 13, I lived in Chennai for three months to learn the mridangam from my guru, Neyveli B. Venkatesh,” says Yanchan. He grew up listening to Drake. “I would play hip hop in my car and analyse the rhythmic patterns and beats. I started noticing similarities between these beats and the ones I played on the mridangam. They sounded similar to grooves in Adi talam, Rupaka talam…” says the 21-year-old, who calls his sound a combination of Carnatic music, Tamil film music and hip hop. Mridangam gets the spotlight “The instrument never tells you what genre it belongs to,” says Viveick Rajagopalan, a mridangam exponent based in Mumbai. As the founder of the Ta Dhom project, Viveick collaborates with vernacular rappers from the city to create a sub genre of Indian hip hop — as seen in Gully Boy ’s ‘India 91’. Viveick wanted to pull the mridangam out of the layers of percussion it is hidden in, and make it the principal sound, moving it from supporting role to lead. “I took those drum patterns heard in Western music and played them on the mridangam, which gave rise to the collective sound of the Ta Dhom project,” he says. Since 2015, he has been meeting young rappers and sharing the basics of konnakol and talam with them, to provide a foundation for the rhythmic poetry of urban rap. “I didn’t want to come in with the traditional approach of Carnatic music (with its rituals),” says Viveick. “What was interesting to me was that instead of aping the West, these guys were rapping in their mother tongue. I wanted to push (that Indian-ness) even more. For instance, a lot of rappers still have scatting and phrasing that’s typically Western,” he says. As a rapper, your flow and intonation is what makes you stand out. And according to Viveick, an understanding of konnakol gives you a better understanding of rhythmic structures and helps you write phrases in more interesting ways. “It’s like this: for a layperson, a chair is a chair. But when a carpenter sees it, he sees its parts: its height when you’re sitting, when you’re standing.” Rappers Swadesi, MC Tod Fod, MC Mawali have been part of this project. The project’s second EP is set to be released and will feature MC Dehat rapping in Bhojpuri. “If you can count the beats, count the gap, you can write with more intention,” says Tamil rapper Kalaivanan Kannan, who goes by MC Kalai. “I don’t learn the raag, just the taal and the konnakol , the time structures, meters, the gati (flow).” The added knowledge also makes it easier for him to collaborate with other independent bands. The universality of it Classical music has spilled over to other genres before. Pandit Ravi Shankar, and now his daughter, Anoushka, have brought Hindustani to raga rock. Hip hop songs by Missy Elliot and Kid Cudi use Indian classical undercurrents. Tamil film music regularly builds on Carnatic; as proven by icons from Ilaiyaraaja to AR Rahman. “We want to show how versatile Carnatic music is,” days Mahesh Raghvan, of Carnatic 2.0, the group that blends Carnatic music with “whatever is fresh, with anything to do with pop culture, electronic music, and hip hop.” Their experiments led them to writing ‘Mylapore Rap’ last year. In the past year, however, the rise of virtual spaces brought on by the lockdowns has also increased the accessibility to Carnatic music, bringing it out of kutcheris and sabhas. “Learning Carnatic music for four to five years also gives you a good foundation for whatever genre you want to try next,” says Mahesh. In Washington DC, singer-songwriter Hrishi Balaji had a similar realisation in high school. In June, the 25-year-old rose to Internet fame with his Carnatic remixes of pop songs. Hrishi’s freestyle swaras over BTS’ ‘Butter’ and The Weeknd’s ‘Blinding Lights’, among others have gone viral on TikTok and Instagram. “I want to create a sense of familiarity and a sense of shock for the Western ear, while being true to both sensibilities,” says Hrishi. It is hip hop’s subversive nature that allows space for experimentation, believes Viveick. “The whole rap culture is raw and non-conformist, so there is no template on how you have to play, or how it should sound,” he says. This subversion also has to reflect in its lyrics for a song to be true to hip hop’s history of standing up to power. When Shan and Yanchan rap, they talk about their families who had to flee Jaffna during the Sri Lankan Civil War. MC Mawali and Swadesi, while rapping in the style of konnakol , are talking about overcoming systemic obstacles. “Emotions are universal,” says Yanchan. “With any song, your goal should be to speak your truth, speak from your experience, and hope that it connects to your audience.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/enter-the-konnakol-r-ap/article35376345.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Primed and ready||What do players who love kabaddi, a contact team sport, do during lockdown? They resort to home-grown techniques to stay agile and in touch with their signature moves, as leading players Rahul Chaudhari and Pawan Sehrawat discovered over the last 15 months. After a lull in 2020, the sport is back on its feet this year, with Nationals held in March. Now, players are training hard, and looking forward to the Pro Kabaddi League, expected to be held later this year. Rahul Chaudhari: Tamil Thalaivas Although Rahul has played just one season for Chennai in the Pro Kabaddi League, he already has loyal fans. They call him the ‘Thalapathy’ of the team. He hopes to return that love in the upcoming season, which he has been looking forward to for more than a year. The pandemic put a pause to most sporting activities over the last 15 months, but kabaddi players were among the most frustrated of the lot, he says. “To feel the rush that kabaddi gives, it has to be played as a team. The sport requires many players, in close quarters, and that has not been possible since the pandemic.” However, Rahul has been bettering his raiding techniques by practising a few moves alone. “It isn’t ideal, but that is the best I could do given the circumstances,” says the 27-year-old. The Delhi-based player has come a long way since he began playing kabbadi in school. “I went to a government school, and the other kids who went to CBSE or ICSE boards did not even know what kabaddi was. They used to look down upon us who played it,” recalls Rahul. But all that has changed in recent years, thanks to Pro Kabaddi League, which, like IPL, gave the sport a fillip by packaging it for TV audiences. Now, a growing number of fans, who fondly call Rahul ‘poster boy’, watch his every move, on and off court. His stylish haircut, tattoos and workout regime have gained popularity, especially during the lockdown. Pawan Sehrawat:Bengaluru Bulls If you visited Pawan Sehrawat’s home in Bawana village near Delhi last year, you would probably have bumped into him running up and down the stairs. Or jumping from one place to another. These techniques have been part of the lockdown jugaad for the 25-year-old  to  keep in touch with kabaddi. Pawan’s nickname is ‘hi-flyer’ because he reaches a height of almost five feet when airborne from the ground during a match, in a bid to escape the grasp of his competitors. This special jump is the result of many years of practice, which continued through lockdown as well. “When I was young, I was healthy, and so my coach told me to concentrate on power kabaddi and not jumping techniques. But I was fascinated by that skill and worked a lot on my core body to perfect the jump,” he recalls. All that came in good stead when he took on the field at Pro Kabaddi League. Now, he has come to be known as one of the best raiders in the sport. Although the last 15 months were dull for him, he says he kept at it: practising raids at home and at a stadium nearby. “I also have the habit of watching a lot of old kabaddi matches on television, to get references on how other players go about their job. Watching Pardeep (Narwal), I learnt how to do the dubki move (ducking low to evade defenders). Watching Siddharth Desai, I learnt how to use the power aspect. I keep trying to learn new skills to stay relevant to the modern needs of the game.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/primed-and-ready/article35376346.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||From Amrtisar, with love and water||I was in central Delhi the other day when I recalled a wedding reception I’d attended in one of the bungalows there. An army of experts had come from Punjab to cook for the guests. Not only did they arrive with old recipes and some special ingredients, they even carried huge jars of water from Amritsar. It’s the water that gives the dishes a special taste, one of the ustads had told me as he started making Amritsari kulchas by carefully placing the rolled out dough in a blazing tandoor. Since then, the Amritsari kulcha has been on my mind. This regional speciality, unlike its counterparts from other parts of the north, is not soft all over but is crisp, with a smooth core. It is also stuffed with boiled potatoes, onions, and some other ingredients, smeared with a dollop of butter, and then served. Last week I thought we would order some for a nice rainy day lunch. I found a place called Amritsari Kulcha Hub at Delhi’s Geeta Colony (phone no: 7011157374) and asked for an onion paneer kulcha (Rs. 130), a mixed kulcha (Rs. 110) and aloo pyaz churchur naan (Rs. 140). These came with chholey and onion chutney. The kulchas were indeed crisp on the outside and soft within. Though they tasted similar, I enjoyed the mixed kulcha the most. The stuffing consisted of boiled potatoes, cottage cheese and onions, all mixed with some masalas. What was remarkable, however, was the chholey , which had been cooked with a light hand. The chholey gravy -- runny, mildly spiced and cooked in hardly any oil — went well with the somewhat heavy kulcha . The chutney was rather good, too — again not the thick kind of chutney as we know it, but almost like a light dish of chopped onions in a tart and thin sauce flavoured with tamarind. The eatery, I am told, was set up about two years ago and delivers through Zomato. They have a cheese stuffing section too. It offers aloo cheese kulcha (Rs. 140), aloo pyaaz cheese kulcha (Rs. 160), and mixed cheese kulcha (Rs. 180). For those who can’t have enough of paneer and cheese, there is even a paneer cheese kulcha (Rs. 200). What makes Amritsari kulcha special is the fact that it is baked in an open fire, or a tandoor. As a child in Delhi, I remember all the tandoors, called Sanjha Chulha, set up in residential areas. People would line up there with kneaded dough, and a man would make a stack of rotis in the tandoor. The kulcha uses the same technique, though the stuffing, butter, and masalas give it a special taste. I don’t know if Amritsari Kulcha Hub used local water or had it transported from Amritsar, but it sure did hit the right spot.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Omega||When it comes to sports timekeeping, Omega is always on the ball. An Olympic event is filled with data – the most obvious being the time in which a race is won. But as sensors proliferate, get smaller and in the case of some sports can even be attached to the athletes themselves, the amount of information generated has grown. Alain Zobrist, CEO of Omega Timing talks about how the nature of time-keeping has changed at the Olympics. “We’ve got motion sensors and positioning systems. We’re using computer vision and artificial intelligence in these systems already but for sure this is going to be developed in the future. Where we will end up in a couple of years is very difficult to say, but without a doubt we will certainly make a couple of steps forward for the Winter Olympics in Beijing, a little more than six months from now, and the Olympic Games in three years in Paris.” Time to train smarter While the focus has always been on ‘the final result’ — the records that may be broken, the gap between first and second place and the increasing exactitude (currently measurable down to the millionth of a second) of an athlete’s performance — Zobrist explains how data is changing the way athletes will train. “So far, we had a very good understanding of what happens at any start of the race as well as any finish of the race, and now with our new sensor technologies we’ll be able to understand also what happens in between, during the entire performance of an athlete.” Consequently, we’ll be able to see how athletes got to their results. Where did they lose time, where did they gain time? Where did they lose or gain points?” This data, which will allow athletes and their teams to train smarter, will also be used by broadcasters in their on-screen graphics. Biel-based Omega has brought innovation to each new Games since its association began in 1932. That includes devices that ‘film time’ like the Magic Eye (or the Racend Omega Timer), which has seen its photoelectric cell count increase to four for the 2016 games. This year, the excitement is around Speed Climbing, one of five new sports being introduced at Tokyo. About it, Zobrist says, “It’s going to be the second sport now after swimming, where the athletes are going to be able to stop their times themselves,” with the help of touchpads at the end of the course. Tracking athletics It’s still athletics that is the most challenging sport to track. Multiple athletes on the track at once requires additional coordination between the time keepers on the field, the timing room and the data handling room. Finally, what does this innovation spell for Omega, the watchmaker better known for being on the wrist of James Bond? Zobrist explains, “It really is two different worlds today. Mechanical or watch-making is fundamentally different from timekeeping of sports events. But the roots are the same, with the stop watches that Omega used in 1932.” And there is a sharing of values – “precision, accuracy and attention to detail”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/omega/article35375877.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||I think not||I think it was Winston Churchill who said ‘No pair of glasses is rosier tinted than the ones we wear to look in the mirror.’ It was either him or my istriwallah , Marimuthu. He smokes cigars, too, from time to time, so my confusion is understandable. Anyway, given below are a couple of examples that prove the point emphatically. We’ve all met this guy. Or a version of him. He’s had a cushy life, he’s sent off two thankless kids to some dubious university in Australia or Rwanda. His wife, the poor thing, is searching for a humane way to bump him off. And you have to listen to him because he’s paying for the drinks. It’s only a matter of time before he rubs his belly affectionately as he laments the passion he gave up on as a young man. ‘You remember, no?’ he says with a faraway look. ‘How I absolutely loved cricket [it could just as easily be music, cycling, wig-making or proctology], and totally lived for it. My only regret in life is giving it up. And all because of Dad, sigh. He said he’d commit suicide if I didn’t take over the family business. If only I’d kept at it, I would have played for India. Pucca.’ Notice how anyone who gave up his ‘passion’ is always the guy who could have been the next Sunil Gavaskar, Shah Rukh Khan, Vyjayanthimala Bali or Milan Kundera? Never the next Rohan Gavaskar/Kamaal R Khan/Yogeeta Bali/Sirish Kunder. You want to interrupt at this point, but you don’t because he’s serving good single malt. You want to say ‘I think not. That’s not how I remember it. If memory serves me right, you were astoundingly bad at cricket. In fact, you were 13th man in a team that didn’t have a 12th man. Which means, if one of the eleven couldn’t make it, they’d have picked Pankajam Mami, in whose compound we used to play, ahead of you, to open the attack. What family business? Your daddy was a loan shark. You were recruited as his henchman. You ‘gave up’ your ‘passion’ because you are a greedy and lazy and used to be called thevangu in school. And had you continued pursuing your ‘passion’, the highest you could have made it would have been dry-cleaner of Team India’s uniforms. Now calm down and pour me another drink.’ Similarly, I’m totally done with these author bios that you see on book covers, blogs and social media pages. I came across this one the other day conjured up by a woman I used to know. ‘Antaryami Kunjumon Bhattacharjee is a trained classical singer who, while not writing, alternates her time between Vietnam and her cottage in the hills. She is also a painter, and teaches Aikido in her spare time.’ No, you’re not. Your real name is Muniyamma. You made up your current name by choosing random names from Hoichoi and Mallu movies and stringing them together. You couldn’t write your own laundry list if it was dictated to you. By ‘trained classical singer’, you mean you listened to an M S Subbulakshmi tape on an electric train. And, as far as I remember, your only Vietnam connection is that your father worked as an extra in Sivaji Ganesan’s Vietnam Veedu . Also, just because you beat up your old boyfriend once with a can of Nerolac paint doesn’t make you a painter. Or a self-defence instructor. Now stop it. Stop it, I say. All of you.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Paris checks in||As Covid-19 restrictions ease around the world, cities are slowly coming back to life. Especially Paris, where nightclubs are once again pulsing with music, and the Haute Couture Week just wound up its fashion extravaganza. Adding to the hope in the air is the reopening of La Samaritaine — the grand Art Nouveau department store that current owner, the French luxury group LVMH, had closed 16 years for a complete overhaul — and Cheval Blanc Paris. The latter, housed in a 1928 building designed by Henri Sauvage, is the brand’s first urban hotel (others in the LVMH chain have addresses in the French ski resort of Courcheval, the Maldives, and St Tropez on the French Riviera, to name a few). Scheduled to open on September 7, the boutique property features 72 rooms, five dining spaces, and stunning views of the river Seine. On a cool evening, sitting at my desk in Mumbai, I gaze at Pont Neuf, Paris’ oldest standing bridge, bathed in the afternoon sunlight, as brand spokesperson Nastasia Morin takes us on a Zoom tour of the property. Though on video, I miss the frisson of excitement that a physical walkthrough entails — the scent of turned down sheets, questions about where particular doors lead — we do get the time to appreciate the eclectic interiors, outfitted by architect Peter Marino, showcasing a range of artworks from the 1930s to the present. The rooms are large, and feature custom iron chandeliers and a neutral palette. “A point from the Art Deco style is that we have the same shades of colours, but different materials, so it’s really rich in terms of textures,” says Morin.  Relax with Dior  With LVMH at the helm, it is no surprise that Cheval Blanc Paris is home to the world’s first Dior Spa, in addition to Michelin-starred dining and the kind of all-encompassing luxury that is a hallmark of its fashion and lifestyle brands. Think staff uniforms — with musketeer cuffs, embroidered pockets, and gold buttons with a signature parquet pattern — designed by fashion house Patou’s artistic director, Guillaume Henry. A 30-metre pool, with a bespoke mosaic by Michael Mayer, is another of the property’s offerings. Among the food and beverage offerings is the dinner-only restaurant, Plénitude, where three Michelin-star chef Arnaud Donckele will preside over the tasting menu. With travel still on a slow burn, the hotel’s dining options are a way to get locals and domestic travellers to experience the brand, shares Morin.  Magasincheck  As for La Samaritaine, which reopened in June, the 20,000 sq metre emporium includes housing (both social and luxury) and office spaces. “We believed that it’s through diversity that we could really bring life back into the area,” said Jean Jacques Guiony, the chairman and CEO of La Samaritaine, at a live-streamed press conference last month. “We wanted this place to be an area where people lived, worked, came to eat, to shop — 24 hours a day, seven days a week.’’ After the 16-year renovation, it is “the smallest of the department stores in Paris, but it is the largest concept store”, says Eléonore de Boysson, a regional director for DFS Group, the luxury retail operator for the store. Among the 600 brands being sold there, visitors will find everything from global behemoths to “French niche brands”. For those looking to make their way quickly from Cheval Blanc Paris for a spot of shopping, there is a secret elevator connecting it to the grand magasin (store). Something guests will be happy about as the hotel’s 1st Arrondissement location welcomes many new names, including the recently-opened Pinault Collection museum, and the Fondation Cartier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/paris-checks-in/article35375868.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||MUSIC: the gatekeepers are changing||Earlier this year, Singaporean Tamil entrepreneur Metakovan aka Vignesh Sundaresan ignited an entire movement about the way art is valued in the digital world when he purchased an NFT artwork for $69 million. Then in late April, Metakovan once again made headlines for purchasing an NFT of Tamil singer-composer Kaber Vasuki’s 2012 demo version of a song called ‘Vasanam’. He bought it for the price of 50 ethereum, a cryptocurrency which roughly converted to Rs. 1.5 crore at the time of sale. Although Vasuki is a Chennai-bred artist who is now based out of Toronto, the deal — conducted on international NFT marketplace OpenSea — made him a record holder in terms of Indian-origin musicians who have sold their music on the blockchain. Over the phone from Canada, Vasuki recalls how he met Metakovan in 2012 in Chennai at a writer’s workshop. They became friends, with the latter contributing to Kurangan’s album crowdfunding campaign for Azhagu Puratchi in 2014. “He’s interested in independent arts, in artists who have new perspectives and who are trying to do something original,” he adds about Metakovan. Shifting power to musicians What NFTs are doing for art, they’re also doing for musicians — creating a new idea of patronage at a time when earning music royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count due to the pandemic. As Vasuki puts it, musicians are often “forced to accept deals that may not be in your best interest”. Having researched cryptocurrency, he likes the infrastructure coming up around this new world. “It’s like you have a decentralised monetary network. Also, it’s permission-less,” he says. Kolkata-bred, Mumbai-based drummer, tabla artist and percussionist Sambit Chatterjee was convinced about the power of NFTs after he came across news of Vasuki’s sale. He and his bandmates in What Escapes Me decided to sell their original demo of a sarod-infused metal track called ‘Section 66 Pt. 5’. It’s currently available on Indian NFT marketplace and cryptocurrency exchange platform WazirX on their bespoke currency, valued at 2121 WRX or $2,307.65. “When it comes to us, these things are more of collectibles for people who want to keep rare things to themselves,” says Chatterjee, who has also got a recurring royalty set on it. An open market WazirX, which has been wooing Indian musicians through July, announced nine “spotlight musicians” — including Chatterjee, pianist Lydian Nadhaswaram, beatboxer Abhishek Bhaskar and electronic producer Kohra aka Madhav Shorey — who will launch NFTs exclusively on their platform this month. Vishakha Singh, vice president of the NFT Marketplace at WazirX says electronic artists are one of the most eager music communities when it comes to selling NFTs on WazirX and reasons that it is because “they are heavily into tech”. Kohra, who is also a graphic designer, confirms this. His eerie audio-visual work ‘Kaliyuga 2025’ is a 31-second clip that’s selling for 3000 WRX or $3,240. In the world of cryptocurrency and NFTs Kohra feels there is a uniform space. “There’s no hierarchy in terms of who has access to what. Even if you’re a nobody, you can be compensated in an honest market space,” the DJ-producer says. Keeping the faith Kohra is testing the waters, as are several musicians around the world on different platforms. Singh at WazirX tells artists not to be disheartened if they haven’t sold their NFT yet (Kohra and Chatterjee are yet to see a bid) and to keep adding more collectibles. A day ago, electronic dance music festival, Sunburn, announced its collaboration with WazirX to launch their collection of NFTs around music and art (starting July 23). They claim 49% of their fanbase on social media expressed their interest to invest in NFTs. As for Vasuki, will he be putting out another NFT soon? He says he’s keeping his ear to the ground and looking out for initiatives which he believes “have potential to be hugely disruptive”. He adds, “I’m waiting to see how this intersection between crypto technologies and music business plays out over the next year or two.”  Even if you are a nobody, you can make money and be compensated in an honest market space. – DJ-producer Kohra||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/music-the-gatekeepers-are-changing/article35375961.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Farhan Akht ar in the ring||Plan-A doesn’t always work out. And, it’s not always a bad thing. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Toofaan , in which Farhan Akhtar plays boxer Aziz Ali, was slated to hit theatres last October, but the pandemic struck and circumstances changed. Written by Anjum Rajabali and Vijay Maurya, and based on an idea by Akhtar, the film dropped on Amazon Prime Video a week before the beginning of the Tokyo Olympics. “This is a film about sports and we have a very promising contingent of athletes who are going to Tokyo, including nine boxers. They all did really well at the Asian Championships (in Dubai) and won a lot of medals,” says Akhtar over a Zoom call. Rising from the fringes  Toofaan (its promo featured on a billboard at New York’s Times Square) chronicles the transformation of Aziz Ali aka Ajju Bhai, a henchman from Dongri, to a national level pugilist. While the story might be fictional, Akhtar believes it does mirror the reality of boxers the world over. Echoing boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard who said ‘boxing is a poor man’s sport’, the writer-musician says, “Most boxers have come from underprivileged backgrounds; they’ve come from a life of systematic discrimination, crime and poverty. Life hasn’t dealt them a fair hand, and the only way for them to create a life for themselves is by using their bodies and their fists. Even if you look at boxers in India, they are predominantly from the North East, villages of Haryana — they’re fighting for something more than just a medal”. Akhtar isn’t wrong. Across boxing history, there’s a pattern of players coming from the streets or disenfranchised groups. “There is a lot of money in boxing, but rich people don’t ask their kids to become boxers. I was recently listening to a podcast of Mike Tyson, and they asked him about his son getting into boxing now. With this big smile on his face, Tyson said he had asked his son ‘Why are you doing this? You don’t need to, you’re going to a private school. You’re going to meet some animal in the ring like me who’ll want to bust your face in’,” he adds. Boxing fan forever The 47-year-old says he was introduced to boxing way back in the early 80s when Mohammad Ali first visited India for a series of exhibition matches. “One heard stories from people who were lucky enough to meet him. Also, there was Rocky (1976) that put boxing on the cinematic map for everyone.” Though Akhtar never stepped into the ring himself, he was fascinated by the sport. “I always found something very visceral about the sport. It is a test of character and strength — it’s brutal but there’s beauty to it, and it’s captivating to see two people in a ring trying to outthink, outlast and outpunch each other.” Ali might have introduced Akhtar to the sport but he belongs more to ‘the Mike Tyson generation’. As his interest in the sport increased, he expanded his knowledge to include former greats like Joe Frazier and Jack Johnson and the more contemporary athletes like Manny Pacquiao. Starting from scratch This film marks Akhtar’s second collaboration with Mehra. Their first was the biopic Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), which won him a National Award. To portray the late Milkha Singh, the actor trained for five to six hours a day for months. It was no different for Toofaan . “As much as I enjoy watching boxing and boxing films, getting in there and actually learning to do it is way tougher than you’d imagine.” Unlike BMB , this film required him to learn a whole sport from the beginning. “Boxing is a lot more demanding than track and field. Also, running wasn’t new to me as I had competed in school.” For Toofaan , he trained for three months first to look like a boxer and then an out-of-shape father of one. Produced by Excel Entertainment, a production house Akhtar founded along with Ritesh Sidhwani in 1999, Toofaan is also the actor’s first film to go straight to streaming. He describes the OTT space as a ‘level playing field’. “You can’t hide behind star power, glitz and glamour, good music or a great location. If the story is not engaging, you’ll press that button on your remote and move on.” Back as director? Akhtar’s plans for keeping viewers glued to seats are almost all in place. As a producer there is Phone Bhoot , a horror comedy starring Katrina Kaif; and Rishi Kapoor’s last film Sharmaji Namkeen . There is also a documentary where he’s collaborating with sister Zoya and Salman Khan on their lyricist fathers Javed Akhtar and Salim Khan. There have also been stories of him joining the cast of Ms Marvel from the Marvel Cinematic Universe but he’s keeping mum for now. “My only confirmed plan is to do a film with Ashutosh Gowarikar. Given the pandemic situation though, only time will tell when we’ll start,” says the actor who started his cinematic journey as a director almost exactly two decades ago with Dil Chahta Hai . Toofaan is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video   Watch the actor in conversation withKarishma Upadhyay on weekend.thehindu.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/farhan-akht-ar-in-the-ring/article35375889.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||‘It’s 90% art, 10% music’||With the setting up of homegrown platforms like WazirX and Terrain.art, the market for non-fungible tokens is booming. Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX, admits it is still early days, in India and globally. “What’s interesting, however,” he says, “is that unlike what usually happens with new technology — where it is adopted in the West and then reaches us — NFTs have been on par in the country. We are creating our own platforms.” Edited excerpts:  What are the top categories that WazirX is looking at?  At present it is mainly 90% art and 10% music. But we won’t be restricting ourselves. People are expressing interest in exploring sports, spirituality and the like. We are also toying with the idea of converting real world art into NFTs. Another market is the influencer space. India has one of the largest networks in the world and, until now, they monetised mainly through sponsored content. NFTs can give the influencer economy a new opportunity. For example, a travel influencer can turn the first photo he or she clicks at a destination into an NFT. Are NFTs democratic? Besides bringing in ownership and originality, NFTs are also democratising the ability to monetise one’s creativity. Just like blogging made everyone a writer, NFTs are making everyone an artist — opening up the field to meme and GIF makers, TikTok and Reel creators, podcasters, tweeters, etc. What’s next? At the moment we only have fixed rates on WazirX. An auction tab is one of the most requested features that we are working on. We are also tweaking the way that we get artists on board, by building a referral system. — Surya Praphulla Kumar    Musicians link up: NFTs are creating a new idea of patronage at a time when earning music royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count due to the pandemic.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Cannes: return to film festival normalcy||I am experiencing a welter of emotions as I sit at Nice airport, departing the 74th Cannes Film Festival after an absolutely bonkers 12 days. Arriving on the Riviera and seeing festival goers and holiday makers frolicking in the sunshine, unmasked, was a forceful reminder of the freedoms we took for granted until March 2020, which were snatched away. To get into the Palais, the festival’s main venue, aroused a different emotion — fury — as we were told that even the double vaccinated delegates, if not from the EU, would have to undergo a Covid test every 48 hours and present the negative results at security to be granted entry. The test process was charming — hawking and spitting into a funnel attached to a tube to collect a goodly amount of saliva. But, as with all things in this pandemic era, we got used to this too. Once inside the cinemas, masks had to be strictly worn throughout the screenings. As each screening began with the Cannes logo animation, it was greeted with thunderous applause, signifying hope and relief that we are back to doing what we love — experiencing cinema in a theatre. And, when the opening credits began rolling on Asghar Farhadi’s A Hero at the Grand Theatre Lumiere, tears welled up in my eyes from the sheer joy of being there to experience it. And so to the films… As people expect me to work for a living, I didn’t see as many as I would have liked to. A Hero , another Farhadi examination of a cross section of Iranian society, sees a master working at the peak of his powers. Wen Shipei’s Are You Lonesome Tonight? features the redoubtable Sylvia Chang and Eddie Peng, is another addition to the burgeoning Chinese neo-noir genre and pays homage to many filmmakers including Jia Zhangke, Wong Kar Wai and Edward Yang, to name just three. The stars, including Timothee Chalamet, Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray, were out in force for Wes Anderson’sThe French Despatch. Lea Seydoux had to cancel her visit as she tested positive for Covid. I watched Bangladeshi filmmaker Abdullah Mohammad Saad’s searing Rehana with our own Anurag Kashyap and we were both left shell-shocked by the sheer power of the film. The film is a systematic takedown of patriarchy and features a tremendous central performance from Azmeri Haque Badhon, one of Bangladesh’s top actors. The film deservedly got a standing ovation and Badhon was overcome with emotion at the reception it received. Rehana is already going places, is all I can reveal at this stage. Rahul Jain’s Invisible Demons , a terrific — and scary — look at pollution in Delhi, also received a standing ovation. The film is a worthy follow up to his Sundance-winnerMachines. Like Saad, Jain is also going places. Mark Cousins’ The Storms of Jeremy Thomas is a free flowing look at Oscar-winning producer Thomas’ ( The Last Emperor , Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence , Crash ) eclectic career. It was a pleasure to speak at length to them after the film. Not every film was good, so let’s leave it at that and move on to that other aspect of Cannes, the parties. From sales agents’ soirées to private barbecues in the hills to a raucous Philippines karaoke night, I managed to show my face at a few, purely for anthropological reasons, I hasten to add. And at the after party following the world premiere of a French film, which we got into because my filmmaker friend knew the director’s sister, as one does, I felt another emotion — fear. People were crammed together, mask-less, by a hotel rooftop terrace, and I for one, felt gratitude that the festival was making us test every 48 hours.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||ART: Expanding the definition of ‘artist’||Delhi-based sculptor and artist Shovin Bhattacharjee, 45, has been creating digital art since 2002. Among the first Indians to list his work as an NFT, he says, “I have always faced the challenge of limited buyers because the notion still persists that digital art is not authentic art”. The concerns relating to copyright add to buyer hesitation. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are helping change that by enabling creators and collectors to verify authenticity by encrypting an unforgeable signature on the blockchain. Christie’s sale of Everydays: The First 5000 Days by the cryptoartist Beeple made news in March both for its $69 million price tag and the fact that a leading auction house had sold an NFT. “As the portals [such as Ethereum, Flow, and homegrown WazirX] create a unique code for each work, there is a record of ownership. [A new block of immutable code is added each time the artwork changes hands.] So my digital works are now better received and valued,” says Bhattacharjee, who recently sold his first NFT, titled Exploration , a digital print on canvas for 1.4 Ethereum that takes a gentle jibe at artist Subodh Gupta’s milk cans from the early 2000s. What’s spurring interest? Provenance and transparency are the big drivers of the NFT boom. “Creating fakes has been happening for ages,” says fine art professional Aakshat Sinha. NFTs, which are cyber equivalents of certificates of ownership of both digital or physical items — think GIFs, music, even casks of whisky — are providing the solution. “By putting information about a work’s provenance on the blockchain, it becomes a collectible. And as concerns about duplication and authenticity of digital art get resolved, more people will adapt to this new digital asset class,” says Bengaluru-based artist Harshit Agrawal. “In the Indian market, we’re already seeing this through platforms like Terrain.art and WazirX NFT.” Agrawal, who works primarily with artificial intelligence, started minting NFTs last year, after following the market closely for a couple of years. “The works I create lend themselves naturally to the NFT art category,” says the 29-year-old. When he first listed NFTs on SuperRare, a curatorial platform, he priced them conservatively, at around $1,000. “At the time, the market was new and even the legends who are selling their works today north of $100,000 were selling at $1,000-$2,000. Now my NFTs start at about $5,000 in primary sale,” he says, sharing that the price tags vary, depending on the nature of the art — 2D image, video, etc. Another advantage of NFT: secondary sales. Every time an artwork is resold, the artist gets royalty (between 5% and 15%), which, in theory, means the artist can earn in perpetuity. Opening up to new collectors Recently,a collaborative artwork between visual artist Santanu Hazarika and  pop icon Ritviz sold for approximately Rs. 30,000 within 10 seconds of going live on WazirX. Mumbai-based Hazarika believes that blockchain technology is dismantling the culture of gatekeeping. “It is important to remember that digital art was never considered fine art. But because of the NFT boom, there’s a huge shift in focus. It’s empowering,” he says. As artists, this is a massive development. Not only is it opening up the space to new collectors, but also expanding the definition of ‘artist,’ including everyone from meme makers to TikTok creators. The downside But there isstill an air of unease surrounding NFTs in India. “Often, the hefty fees paid to upload an NFT [mostly on international platforms] override the profits, unless you are a well-known artist who already commands a good price in the market,” says art historian, artist and curator, Koeli Mukherjee-Ghose. “For the funds charged, creative people are not supported by any legal advice or teams, who are working with the NFT infrastructure.” This is relevant considering the cryptocurrency market crashed recently, and how Indian banks are refusing to convert cryptocurrency into actual money (though the RBI has announced that they cannot refuse it). “Many have experienced instances where they are informed that the payment for their NFT sale has been uploaded, but it doesn’t reflect in the account,” she points out. Others like Delhi-based artist Pallav Chander believe that the physicality of art can never be substituted. “But NFT art can be a parallel market,” says the 30-year-old. “It is like a Pokemon card. It’s like a publicity stunt and, especially in India, until our market is ready to convert cryptocurrency into actual rupees, it will remain a fun, thrilling format to give yourself a rush of having sold your artwork for $50,00,000 in cryptocurrency that exists only online. In many ways, it is fictional.” Artists also predict that galleries will not push NFT art until they can ensure that they will get a good percentage in their kitty. “In the art world, it takes time for a trend to stabilise. Only 20% buy art because they love it; 80% consult, speculate and only then invest,” says Chander, adding, “NFTs will remain a digital handshake till all the kinks are worked out.”  Continued on page 4 Since designs are purely digital, a designer will not need tangible elements like rare textiles or seamstress skills, but a different sort of investment such as animators and 3D software like Houdini.P4 Fashion potential Musicians link up NFTs are creating a new idea of patronage at a time when earning music royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count due to the pandemic.P4 Musicians link up: NFTs are creating a new idea of patronage at a time when earning music royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count dueic royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count dueic royalties is a circuitous route and live touring NFT is more than an artwork; it has the potential to make the owning of artwork more democratic.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||FASHION: going beyond designers||We can create NFTs, mint them, scrutinise them… but can we wear them too? The fashion world is tightening its grip on the metaverse through not just digital fashion but also NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Over the past few weeks, I watched the newscape fill-up with headlines of this year’s Paris Fashion Week during which FHCM revealed a team-up with French NFT platform Arianee. The plan was to give away NFTs to selected attendees, buyers and journalists during Paris Fashion Week Men and Haute Couture Week, to further propel the ‘exclusive ownership experience.’ Curiosity about Indian fashion NFTs got me thinking and I spoke with some disruptors in this space. Could India crack this bubble too, as it has done with art and music? To my dismay, the Internet deep dive I went on was not very fruitful. But it brought me to Brooklyn-based digital creator Ravi Singh who minted the first traditional Indian fashion NFT collection. He’s also urging more digital artists to dabble in this new space — and best of all, he is not even a fashion designer! Singh predicts the fashion metaverse – or web3 fashion space – will see more entrants like him, along with the established names such as Gucci, Stella McCartney and Nike. He tells me that the NFT fashion space, still finding its footing, has the potential to create “an anarchist Utopia”. Technically, collectable fashion accessories or garments can be considered fine art and thereby it is “collectors who are collecting art”. So while fashion NFTs include visual art and design, it is not often everyday functional items like bags, watches or shoes. That is why when designer-artist Viraj Khanna (also designer Anamika Khanna’s son) explains the buying habits of fashion regulars in the luxury space, I pay heed. “People would want to own the NFT related to something that no one else would be able to own, almost like buying a painting. The one-off rare samples that couture designers have will also be in the picture,” he predicts. But who on earth would these buyers be?

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Tokyo drift: stadium to screen||It was August 2016. At the historic Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Japan promised to host an “innovative’’ Games in 2020, during the closing ceremony of the 31st Olympic Games. Shinzo Abe, the then Japanese Prime Minister, created a stir as he popped out of a green drainpipe, dressed as Super Mario, the star of the Nintendo video game series. To reach Rio in time, he was assisted by the beloved blue Doraemon cat with a pocket full of magic gadgets. Japan was optimistic about using technology to the hilt to host a memorable Games. And we felt lucky at the Maracanã to soak in the atmosphere. As athletes cheered and danced, and rain drenched the arena, Rio said, ‘ O brigado ’ and Japan said, “See you in Tokyo’’. Then came July 2020, when the coronavirus swept aside technology and human power. As the world stayed home and socially-distanced, the Olympics was postponed (pushing it closer to Paris 2024). And Japan got a new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, to face the challenges. Now, a year on, even as we finish watching the Wimbledon on television in disbelief — shocked at spectators without masks, thanks to vaccinations and virus testing — Japan has rocked the world by announcing that it will host the Games without spectators. The virus is causing havoc, triggering an emergency in Tokyo (only 15% of the Japanese have been fully vaccinated). In its attempt to deliver a “safe and secure Games”, Japan has wrenched the heart out of the Games.  Days of Games past  As a journalist who has attended four Olympics (starting with the 2004 Athens Games), I will miss the mood, the madness, the camaraderie this year. When Usain Bolt ran in Beijing, London or Rio, the atmosphere was electric. Michael Phelps, the ‘Flying Fish’, may have won 23 gold medals (unmatched by any athlete in Olympic history), but it was ‘Lightning’ Bolt who captured the imagination of the world. His wins, and his most-imitated victory pose, always turned packed stadiums into melting pots of colour, noise and emotions. It is impossible to imagine a Bolt or Phelps performing in front of empty stands, with only television cameras to keep them company. For me, today’s virus-ruled virtual world triggers endless memories of the golden past. Of Bolt with his hand on my friend (former Deccan Herald sports editor) Rajeev Kolasseri’s shoulder, discussing cricket and Sachin Tendulkar, after a press conference in Beijing in 2008 — where the sprinter completed the 100 metres with a mind-blowing world record of 9.58 seconds. Or the day after when sport shooter Abhinav Bindra won India’s only individual gold in Beijing. We shared a taxi, going for lunch from the shooting range. Afterwards, Bindra had a photo shoot for Deccan Herald proprietor-photographer KN Shanth Kumar on the streets of Beijing — with the backdrop of the Bird’s Nest and the Water Cube, the iconic athletics and swimming venues. The Chinese people were happy to greet him and take photos with him. Such ease of interaction, between the athlete, the public and the media is impossible to imagine these days. The Olympic aura is unmatched. We had the privilege to watch the best of athletes, as we travelled to the various venues, and sent back reports while literally on the move. It was hard, but it was joyous. We often changed our plans too, in an instant. I remember when wrestler Sushil Kumar won the bronze in Beijing, it was unexpected. He had lost early, and we had lost interest. But then there was a repêchage, and when we learnt that he was fighting his way back to win a medal, we dropped everything, grabbed a taxi, and rushed to the venue. Now, journalists have been asked to list their entire plan even before they reach Tokyo, and no changes will be entertained.  Is it all worth it?  “In terms of organisation, Beijing was the best Games. But for sheer participation of sports-minded people, warm and friendly, Sydney [2000] was my favourite,” recalls Bindra, who has competed in the last five Games. “Competition and results are not the only thing at the Olympics. The community comes together, and the people of the host country create that atmosphere.’’ As a member of the athletes commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), he was scheduled to be in Tokyo, but he has opted out. “I won’t be going; I will attend the meetings remotely. I don’t want to burden the system,’’ says Bindra, perhaps equally wary of enduring four days of quarantine in Tokyo, apart from facing the numerous other restrictions. Hosting the Games leaves a financial blow on the city and country. Most of the money is spent on constructing the stadiums. Tokyo’s National Stadium (one of eight venues to be used) was completed at a cost of $1.25 billion! Of course, an Olympics without spectators could cost a lot less, if planned judiciously. But is an Olympics without people better than cancelling it, as was the case after World War II? For the athletes, who have waited five years to showcase their prowess, it is worth the trouble. For the people of Japan, whose tax money has played a significant role in putting the Games together, it is a sad blow to be kept out of the enthralling exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/tokyo-drift-stadium-to-screen/article35375884.ece

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||ART: Expanding the definition of ‘artist’||Delhi-based sculptor and artist Shovin Bhattacharjee, 45, has been creating digital art since 2002. Among the first Indians to list his work as an NFT, he says, “I have always faced the challenge of limited buyers because the notion still persists that digital art is not authentic art”. The concerns relating to copyright add to buyer hesitation. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are helping change that by enabling creators and collectors to verify authenticity by encrypting an unforgeable signature on the blockchain. Christie’s sale of Everydays: The First 5000 Days by the cryptoartist Beeple made news in March both for its $69 million price tag and the fact that a leading auction house had sold an NFT. “As the portals [such as Ethereum, Flow, and homegrown WazirX] create a unique code for each work, there is a record of ownership. [A new block of immutable code is added each time the artwork changes hands.] So my digital works are now better received and valued,” says Bhattacharjee, who recently sold his first NFT, titled Exploration , a digital print on canvas for 1.4 Ethereum that takes a gentle jibe at artist Subodh Gupta’s milk cans from the early 2000s. What’s spurring interest? Provenance and transparency are the big drivers of the NFT boom. “Creating fakes has been happening for ages,” says fine art professional Aakshat Sinha. NFTs, which are cyber equivalents of certificates of ownership of both digital or physical items — think GIFs, music, even casks of whisky — are providing the solution. “By putting information about a work’s provenance on the blockchain, it becomes a collectible. And as concerns about duplication and authenticity of digital art get resolved, more people will adapt to this new digital asset class,” says Bengaluru-based artist Harshit Agrawal. “In the Indian market, we’re already seeing this through platforms like Terrain.art and WazirX NFT.” Agrawal, who works primarily with artificial intelligence, started minting NFTs last year, after following the market closely for a couple of years. “The works I create lend themselves naturally to the NFT art category,” says the 29-year-old. When he first listed NFTs on SuperRare, a curatorial platform, he priced them conservatively, at around $1,000. “At the time, the market was new and even the legends who are selling their works today north of $100,000 were selling at $1,000-$2,000. Now my NFTs start at about $5,000 in primary sale,” he says, sharing that the price tags vary, depending on the nature of the art — 2D image, video, etc. Another advantage of NFT: secondary sales. Every time an artwork is resold, the artist gets royalty (between 5% and 15%), which, in theory, means the artist can earn in perpetuity. Opening up to new collectors Recently,a collaborative artwork between visual artist Santanu Hazarika and  pop icon Ritviz sold for approximately Rs. 30,000 within 10 seconds of going live on WazirX. Mumbai-based Hazarika believes that blockchain technology is dismantling the culture of gatekeeping. “It is important to remember that digital art was never considered fine art. But because of the NFT boom, there’s a huge shift in focus. It’s empowering,” he says. As artists, this is a massive development. Not only is it opening up the space to new collectors, but also expanding the definition of ‘artist,’ including everyone from meme makers to TikTok creators. The downside But there isstill an air of unease surrounding NFTs in India. “Often, the hefty fees paid to upload an NFT [mostly on international platforms] override the profits, unless you are a well-known artist who already commands a good price in the market,” says art historian, artist and curator, Koeli Mukherjee-Ghose. “For the funds charged, creative people are not supported by any legal advice or teams, who are working with the NFT infrastructure.” This is relevant considering the cryptocurrency market crashed recently, and how Indian banks are refusing to convert cryptocurrency into actual money (though the RBI has announced that they cannot refuse it). “Many have experienced instances where they are informed that the payment for their NFT sale has been uploaded, but it doesn’t reflect in the account,” she points out. Others like Delhi-based artist Pallav Chander believe that the physicality of art can never be substituted. “But NFT art can be a parallel market,” says the 30-year-old. “It is like a Pokemon card. It’s like a publicity stunt and, especially in India, until our market is ready to convert cryptocurrency into actual rupees, it will remain a fun, thrilling format to give yourself a rush of having sold your artwork for $50,00,000 in cryptocurrency that exists only online. In many ways, it is fictional.” Artists also predict that galleries will not push NFT art until they can ensure that they will get a good percentage in their kitty. “In the art world, it takes time for a trend to stabilise. Only 20% buy art because they love it; 80% consult, speculate and only then invest,” says Chander, adding, “NFTs will remain a digital handshake till all the kinks are worked out.”  Continued on page 4 Since designs are purely digital, a designer will not need tangible elements like rare textiles or seamstress skills, but a different sort of investment such as animators and 3D software like Houdini.P4 Fashion potential Musicians link up NFTs are creating a new idea of patronage at a time when earning music royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count due to the pandemic.P4 Musicians link up: NFTs are creating a new idea of patronage at a time when earning music royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count dueic royalties is a circuitous route and live touring is still down for the count dueic royalties is a circuitous route and live touring NFT is more than an artwork; it has the potential to make the owning of artwork more democratic. It also brings in several kinds of new aesthetics, such as the ‘cute’ culture that is endemic to Korean pop artists, or the street art used by graffiti artists, and even indigenous styles that are intrinsic to India. It can redefine what ‘success’ in the art market means because it is still open and unique — Myna Mukherjee,curator-director, Engendered  “Honestly I am paying no attention to NFT’s.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Reviewing Q1 2021||The overall office market in Delhi NCR witnessed a net absorption increase of 5% in Q1 2021 quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q), with 1.07 million sq. ft, according to the recently-released JLL Office Market Update - Q1 2021. The report highlights that Noida contributed 55% of the net absorption, backed by strong pre-commitment in the new completions, followed by Gurugram’s 38% contribution. Select big-ticket transactions in Gurugram and Noida contributed substantially to the leasing activity. There were few relocations by occupiers in a bid to reduce real estate costs and obtain fresh office spaces on attractive lease terms. IT/ITES, BFSI, Healthcare, legal and consulting firms dominated leasing during the quarter, state the findings. Manish Aggarwal, MD, Delhi NCR, JLL India, says, “Delhi-NCR continues to be a vibrant location for the office market with well-established sub-markets and corridors. While Gurgaon and Noida have taken the lead in terms of development and infrastructure, the city itself continues to remain a highly preferred location. In total, eight projects totaling 4 million sq. ft. were added to the stock which stood at 129 million sq. ft at the end of the quarter,” adding that the NCR office market remains as a healthy, commercial one, and strong demand from IT/ITES, BFSI and law firms has fuelled the growth momentum thereby showing strong commercial growth in the capital city. Key highlights The vacancy rate stood at 29.3% as at the end of quarter, increasing by 140 bps over the previous quarter. Vacancy levels rose in select prominent prime business districts where occupiers either downsized current occupancies or shifted to locations with relatively lower rents.  Rents remained stable with developers offering increased rent-free periods on a case-by-case basis. It is expected that rents will continue to remain range-bound in the short-term as leasing momentum in the next few quarters will mainly hinge on the containment of the second wave of COVID-19 cases.  The overall office market in India witnessed a net absorption decrease of 33% in Q1 2021 quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q), with 5.53 million sq. ft. leased between January and March 2021. On a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis, net absorption in Q1 2021 stands at 64% of the levels witnessed in Q1 2020.  Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR accounted for nearly 80% of the net absorption during the quarter. Moreover, Bengaluru and Delhi NCR were the two markets which witnessed an increase in net absorption when compared to Q4 2020.  Pre-commitments in new completions played a significant role in driving net absorption. In the first quarter, 31% of the new completions during the quarter was already pre-committed. Maximum pre-commitment levels were observed in the southern markets of Bengaluru (51% of the new completions) and Hyderabad (45% of the new completions).  The leasing momentum in some of the larger markets have remained promising in the first quarter of 2021. The quarter witnessed gross leasing volumes of 7.5 million sq. ft. across the top seven markets. Interestingly, the larger market of Mumbai saw a massive jump in leasing volume from 0.5 million sq. ft in Q4 2020 to 1.6 million sq. ft in Q1 2021. This was majorly driven by select large pre-commitment deals in upcoming spaces within the BFSI space. Further, Delhi NCR saw a marginal increase in leasing volumes from 1.9 million sq. ft in Q4 2020 to 2 million sq. ft in Q1 2021.  New completions during Q1 2021 were recorded at 13.43 million sq. ft., a marginal increase of 5% q-o-q. In sync with net absorption, the markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR accounted for nearly 80% of the new completions during the quarter.  On a Y-o-Y basis, new completions across the top seven cities jumped by 56% from the 8.6 million sq. ft recorded in Q1 2020. Interestingly, new completions even surpassed the average quarterly levels of ~13 million sq. ft. witnessed during the historic year of 2019.      The subdued net absorption levels could not keep pace with new completions. This resulted in overall vacancy increasing from 14.0% in Q4 2020 to 14.9% in Q1 2021. Despite the rise in vacancy levels, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune continued to hover in single digits.  Office rents in Q1 2021 remained stable across the major office markets in India. With vacancy levels still below 15% and limited upcoming Grade A supply across key markets in the next few years, the office market in India continues to be tilted towards landlords.  Rents are expected to remain range bound in the short to medium term. However, landlords continue to be accommodative to the demands of occupiers and are providing flexibility via increased rent-free periods, reduced rental escalation and fully furnished deals to occupiers to close deals.  The increasing attendance in offices across the major markets before the second COVID-19 wave bears testimony to the confidence and commitment of corporates to get back to working from the office. It is important that landlords continue to be receptive to the demands of tenants and offer flexible options, in terms of space as well as value.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||MMR’s unsold inventory overhang dips||On examining the overall performance of the residential segment across the top cities in the last one year, it emerges that MMR was indisputably the best performer. At the end of Q2 2021, MMR’s (Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane) unsold housing inventory overhang reduced to 43 months from the peak of 55 months in 2020 amid Covid-19. This drop of 12 months’ inventory overhang is the biggest among all top seven cities. Currently, MMR’s unsold inventory overhang is close to being back to the level last seen in 2015, when it was 42 months. In contrast to the other top cities, MMR saw the maximum yearly decline of 6% in its overall unsold stock — from approx. 2.10 lakh units as on Q2 2020 to approx. 1.97 lakh units as on Q2 2021. Interestingly, MMR housing sales exceeded new launches in the last one year. The region saw total housing sales of approx. 58,170 units in the pandemic period between Q2 2020 to Q2 2021, while new launches stood at approx. 41,500 units. “Until just a few years ago, the property market in many areas of MMR was more or less defined by unaffordability,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, adding, “In that respect, the pandemic was a gamechanger for the region. Stamp duty cuts, extremely low home loan interest rates, and developer discounts and offers boosted MMR’s housing market in one of the most challenging and difficult years in remembered history.” A reduction in the overall cost of acquisition bottomed out in one of the most expensive regions in India is remarkable. Property prices in Mumbai had increased by as much as 7-10 times over the past 20 years. The average number of monthly incomes required to own a home in this city is the highest among major Indian cities at between 67-90 times of an average monthly income.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||I think not||I think it was Winston Churchill who said ‘No pair of glasses is rosier tinted than the ones we wear to look in the mirror.’ It was either him or my istriwallah , Marimuthu. He smokes cigars, too, from time to time, so my confusion is understandable. Anyway, given below are a couple of examples that prove the point emphatically. We’ve all met this guy. Or a version of him. He’s had a cushy life, he’s sent off two thankless kids to some dubious university in Australia or Rwanda. His wife, the poor thing, is searching for a humane way to bump him off. And you have to listen to him because he’s paying for the drinks. It’s only a matter of time before he rubs his belly affectionately as he laments the passion he gave up on as a young man. ‘You remember, no?’ he says with a faraway look. ‘How I absolutely loved cricket [it could just as easily be music, cycling, wig-making or proctology], and totally lived for it. My only regret in life is giving it up. And all because of Dad, sigh. He said he’d commit suicide if I didn’t take over the family business. If only I’d kept at it, I would have played for India. Pucca.’ Notice how anyone who gave up his ‘passion’ is always the guy who could have been the next Sunil Gavaskar, Shah Rukh Khan, Vyjayanthimala Bali or Milan Kundera? Never the next Rohan Gavaskar/Kamaal R Khan/Yogeeta Bali/Sirish Kunder. You want to interrupt at this point, but you don’t because he’s serving good single malt. You want to say ‘I think not. That’s not how I remember it. If memory serves me right, you were astoundingly bad at cricket. In fact, you were 13th man in a team that didn’t have a 12th man. Which means, if one of the eleven couldn’t make it, they’d have picked Pankajam Mami, in whose compound we used to play, ahead of you, to open the attack. What family business? Your daddy was a loan shark. You were recruited as his henchman. You ‘gave up’ your ‘passion’ because you are a greedy and lazy and used to be called thevangu in school. And had you continued pursuing your ‘passion’, the highest you could have made it would have been dry-cleaner of Team India’s uniforms. Now calm down and pour me another drink.’ Similarly, I’m totally done with these author bios that you see on book covers, blogs and social media pages. I came across this one the other day conjured up by a woman I used to know. ‘Antaryami Kunjumon Bhattacharjee is a trained classical singer who, while not writing, alternates her time between Vietnam and her cottage in the hills. She is also a painter, and teaches Aikido in her spare time.’ No, you’re not. Your real name is Muniyamma. You made up your current name by choosing random names from Hoichoi and Mallu movies and stringing them together. You couldn’t write your own laundry list if it was dictated to you. By ‘trained classical singer’, you mean you listened to an M S Subbulakshmi tape on an electric train. And, as far as I remember, your only Vietnam connection is that your father worked as an extra in Sivaji Ganesan’s Vietnam Veedu . Also, just because you beat up your old boyfriend once with a can of Nerolac paint doesn’t make you a painter. Or a self-defence instructor. Now stop it. Stop it, I say. All of you.

17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Omega||When it comes to sports timekeeping, Omega is always on the ball. An Olympic event is filled with data – the most obvious being the time in which a race is won. But as sensors proliferate, get smaller and in the case of some sports can even be attached to the athletes themselves, the amount of information generated has grown. Alain Zobrist, CEO of Omega Timing talks about how the nature of time-keeping has changed at the Olympics. “We’ve got motion sensors and positioning systems. We’re using computer vision and artificial intelligence in these systems already but for sure this is going to be developed in the future. Where we will end up in a couple of years is very difficult to say, but without a doubt we will certainly make a couple of steps forward for the Winter Olympics in Beijing, a little more than six months from now, and the Olympic Games in three years in Paris.” Time to train smarter While the focus has always been on ‘the final result’ — the records that may be broken, the gap between first and second place and the increasing exactitude (currently measurable down to the millionth of a second) of an athlete’s performance — Zobrist explains how data is changing the way athletes will train. “So far, we had a very good understanding of what happens at any start of the race as well as any finish of the race, and now with our new sensor technologies we’ll be able to understand also what happens in between, during the entire performance of an athlete.” Consequently, we’ll be able to see how athletes got to their results. Where did they lose time, where did they gain time? Where did they lose or gain points?” This data, which will allow athletes and their teams to train smarter, will also be used by broadcasters in their on-screen graphics. Biel-based Omega has brought innovation to each new Games since its association began in 1932. That includes devices that ‘film time’ like the Magic Eye (or the Racend Omega Timer), which has seen its photoelectric cell count increase to four for the 2016 games. This year, the excitement is around Speed Climbing, one of five new sports being introduced at Tokyo. About it, Zobrist says, “It’s going to be the second sport now after swimming, where the athletes are going to be able to stop their times themselves,” with the help of touchpads at the end of the course. Tracking athletics It’s still athletics that is the most challenging sport to track. Multiple athletes on the track at once requires additional coordination between the time keepers on the field, the timing room and the data handling room. Finally, what does this innovation spell for Omega, the watchmaker better known for being on the wrist of James Bond? Zobrist explains, “It really is two different worlds today. Mechanical or watch-making is fundamentally different from timekeeping of sports events. But the roots are the same, with the stop watches that Omega used in 1932.” And there is a sharing of values – “precision, accuracy and attention to detail”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/omega/article35376460.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Tokyo drift: Stadium to screen||It was August 2016. At the historic Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Japan promised to host an “innovative’’ Games in 2020, during the closing ceremony of the 31st Olympic Games. Shinzo Abe, the then Japanese Prime Minister, created a stir as he popped out of a green drainpipe, dressed as Super Mario, the star of the Nintendo video game series. To reach Rio in time, he was assisted by the beloved blue Doraemon cat with a pocket full of magic gadgets. Japan was optimistic about using technology to the hilt to host a memorable Games. And we felt lucky at the Maracanã to soak in the atmosphere. As athletes cheered and danced, and rain drenched the arena, Rio said, ‘ O brigado ’ and Japan said, “See you in Tokyo’’. Then came July 2020, when the coronavirus swept aside technology and human power. As the world stayed home and socially-distanced, the Olympics was postponed (pushing it closer to Paris 2024). And Japan got a new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, to face the challenges. Now, a year on, even as we finish watching the Wimbledon on television in disbelief — shocked at spectators without masks, thanks to vaccinations and virus testing — Japan has rocked the world by announcing that it will host the Games without spectators. The virus is causing havoc, triggering an emergency in Tokyo (only 15% of the Japanese have been fully vaccinated). In its attempt to deliver a “safe and secure Games”, Japan has wrenched the heart out of the Games.  Days of Games past  As a journalist who has attended four Olympics (starting with the 2004 Athens Games), I will miss the mood, the madness, the camaraderie this year. When Usain Bolt ran in Beijing, London or Rio, the atmosphere was electric. Michael Phelps, the ‘Flying Fish’, may have won 23 gold medals (unmatched by any athlete in Olympic history), but it was ‘Lightning’ Bolt who captured the imagination of the world. His wins, and his most-imitated victory pose, always turned packed stadiums into melting pots of colour, noise and emotions. It is impossible to imagine a Bolt or Phelps performing in front of empty stands, with only television cameras to keep them company. For me, today’s virus-ruled virtual world triggers endless memories of the golden past. Of Bolt with his hand on my friend (former Deccan Herald sports editor) Rajeev Kolasseri’s shoulder, discussing cricket and Sachin Tendulkar, after a press conference in Beijing in 2008 — where the sprinter completed the 100 metres with a mind-blowing world record of 9.58 seconds. Or the day after when sport shooter Abhinav Bindra won India’s only individual gold in Beijing. We shared a taxi, going for lunch from the shooting range. Afterwards, Bindra had a photo shoot for Deccan Herald proprietor-photographer KN Shanth Kumar on the streets of Beijing — with the backdrop of the Bird’s Nest and the Water Cube, the iconic athletics and swimming venues. The Chinese people were happy to greet him and take photos with him. Such ease of interaction, between the athlete, the public and the media is impossible to imagine these days. The Olympic aura is unmatched. We had the privilege to watch the best of athletes, as we travelled to the various venues, and sent back reports while literally on the move. It was hard, but it was joyous. We often changed our plans too, in an instant. I remember when wrestler Sushil Kumar won the bronze in Beijing, it was unexpected. He had lost early, and we had lost interest. But then there was a repêchage, and when we learnt that he was fighting his way back to win a medal, we dropped everything, grabbed a taxi, and rushed to the venue. Now, journalists have been asked to list their entire plan even before they reach Tokyo, and no changes will be entertained.  Is it all worth it?  “In terms of organisation, Beijing was the best Games. But for sheer participation of sports-minded people, warm and friendly, Sydney [2000] was my favourite,” recalls Bindra, who has competed in the last five Games. “Competition and results are not the only thing at the Olympics. The community comes together, and the people of the host country create that atmosphere.’’ As a member of the athletes commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), he was scheduled to be in Tokyo, but he has opted out. “I won’t be going; I will attend the meetings remotely. I don’t want to burden the system,’’ says Bindra, perhaps equally wary of enduring four days of quarantine in Tokyo, apart from facing the numerous other restrictions. Hosting the Games leaves a financial blow on the city and country. Most of the money is spent on constructing the stadiums. Tokyo’s National Stadium (one of eight venues to be used) was completed at a cost of $1.25 billion! Of course, an Olympics without spectators could cost a lot less, if planned judiciously. But is an Olympics without people better than cancelling it, as was the case after World War II? For the athletes, who have waited five years to showcase their prowess, it is worth the trouble. For the people of Japan, whose tax money has played a significant role in putting the Games together, it is a sad blow to be kept out of the enthralling exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tokyo-drift-stadium-to-screen/article35376461.ece
17 July 2021||July 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Farhan Akht ar in the ring||Plan-A doesn’t always work out. And, it’s not always a bad thing. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Toofaan , in which Farhan Akhtar plays boxer Aziz Ali, was slated to hit theatres last October, but the pandemic struck and circumstances changed. Written by Anjum Rajabali and Vijay Maurya, and based on an idea by Akhtar, the film dropped on Amazon Prime Video a week before the beginning of the Tokyo Olympics. “This is a film about sports and we have a very promising contingent of athletes who are going to Tokyo, including nine boxers. They all did really well at the Asian Championships (in Dubai) and won a lot of medals,” says Akhtar over a Zoom call. Rising from the fringes  Toofaan (its promo featured on a billboard at New York’s Times Square) chronicles the transformation of Aziz Ali aka Ajju Bhai, a henchman from Dongri, to a national level pugilist. While the story might be fictional, Akhtar believes it does mirror the reality of boxers the world over. Echoing boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard who said ‘boxing is a poor man’s sport’, the writer-musician says, “Most boxers have come from underprivileged backgrounds; they’ve come from a life of systematic discrimination, crime and poverty. Life hasn’t dealt them a fair hand, and the only way for them to create a life for themselves is by using their bodies and their fists. Even if you look at boxers in India, they are predominantly from the North East, villages of Haryana — they’re fighting for something more than just a medal”. Akhtar isn’t wrong. Across boxing history, there’s a pattern of players coming from the streets or disenfranchised groups. “There is a lot of money in boxing, but rich people don’t ask their kids to become boxers. I was recently listening to a podcast of Mike Tyson, and they asked him about his son getting into boxing now. With this big smile on his face, Tyson said he had asked his son ‘Why are you doing this? You don’t need to, you’re going to a private school. You’re going to meet some animal in the ring like me who’ll want to bust your face in’,” he adds. Boxing fan forever The 47-year-old says he was introduced to boxing way back in the early 80s when Mohammad Ali first visited India for a series of exhibition matches. “One heard stories from people who were lucky enough to meet him. Also, there was Rocky (1976) that put boxing on the cinematic map for everyone.” Though Akhtar never stepped into the ring himself, he was fascinated by the sport. “I always found something very visceral about the sport. It is a test of character and strength — it’s brutal but there’s beauty to it, and it’s captivating to see two people in a ring trying to outthink, outlast and outpunch each other.” Ali might have introduced Akhtar to the sport but he belongs more to ‘the Mike Tyson generation’. As his interest in the sport increased, he expanded his knowledge to include former greats like Joe Frazier and Jack Johnson and the more contemporary athletes like Manny Pacquiao. Starting from scratch This film marks Akhtar’s second collaboration with Mehra. Their first was the biopic Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), which won him a National Award. To portray the late Milkha Singh, the actor trained for five to six hours a day for months. It was no different for Toofaan . “As much as I enjoy watching boxing and boxing films, getting in there and actually learning to do it is way tougher than you’d imagine.” Unlike BMB , this film required him to learn a whole sport from the beginning. “Boxing is a lot more demanding than track and field. Also, running wasn’t new to me as I had competed in school.” For Toofaan , he trained for three months first to look like a boxer and then an out-of-shape father of one. Produced by Excel Entertainment, a production house Akhtar founded along with Ritesh Sidhwani in 1999, Toofaan is also the actor’s first film to go straight to streaming. He describes the OTT space as a ‘level playing field’. “You can’t hide behind star power, glitz and glamour, good music or a great location. If the story is not engaging, you’ll press that button on your remote and move on.” Back as director? Akhtar’s plans for keeping viewers glued to seats are almost all in place. As a producer there is Phone Bhoot , a horror comedy starring Katrina Kaif; and Rishi Kapoor’s last film Sharmaji Namkeen . There is also a documentary where he’s collaborating with sister Zoya and Salman Khan on their lyricist fathers Javed Akhtar and Salim Khan. There have also been stories of him joining the cast of Ms Marvel from the Marvel Cinematic Universe but he’s keeping mum for now. “My only confirmed plan is to do a film with Ashutosh Gowarikar. Given the pandemic situation though, only time will tell when we’ll start,” says the actor who started his cinematic journey as a director almost exactly two decades ago with Dil Chahta Hai . Toofaan is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video   Watch the actor in conversation withKarishma Upadhyay on weekend.thehindu.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farhan-akht-ar-in-the-ring/article35376444.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers’ protest: Delhi Cabinet rejects police’s panel of lawyers||The Delhi Cabinet on Friday refused to permit the Delhi Police’s proposed list of lawyers from appearing in the court cases related to the farmers’ protests. The cases were forwarded to the Cabinet by Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal. Earlier, Mr. Baijal had refused to let a panel of lawyers constituted by the Delhi government appear in the cases as public prosecutors. The Delhi government said the Central government, through the L-G, had been pressuring the Cabinet to give its nod to the list of lawyers sent by the Delhi Police but it had refused to allow police’s own lawyers from appearing as public prosecutors. The Cabinet also refused to allow the panel of lawyers recommended by the Delhi Police in the north-east Delhi riots case. The decision has been sent to the L-G’s office in continuation of the tussle between the Delhi government and the L-G. The Delhi government said the farmers have been constantly agitating against the contentious laws and the Cabinet observed that appointing lawyers of the police will devoid the case of fairness and impartiality. “It is the duty of every Indian to support the farmers of the country. We have not done any favour, but have fulfilled our duty towards the farmers of the country. Farmers are not criminals or terrorists. They are our ‘annadata’,” tweeted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after the Cabinet’s decision. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said it is unfortunate that the Central government, through the L-G, is acting as a constant roadblock in every “good step” that the Delhi government takes. Transfer subject “The appointment of lawyers is a transfer subject, which means that the elected government of Delhi has the right to choose which lawyer to appoint, as per the Constitution,” Mr. Sisodia said. He added that the people of Delhi have chosen Mr. Kejriwal as their leader to govern the Capital and that he should be allowed to do so without any obstruction from the L-G. “The Constitutional Bench set up by the Supreme Court gave a decision on July 4, 2018, directing that it is not the L-G but the Delhi government, which has the right and responsibility of making decisions with regard to transfer subjects. The L-G has Veto power as per the Constitution to give opinions and advice but does not have the right to declare what the Delhi government will do,” Mr. Sisodia said. He said the L-G has a “Veto power’ to be used in the rarest of the rare cases but Mr. Baijal was making a habit to exercise a Veto on everything the Delhi government does.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-protest-delhi-cabinet-rejects-polices-panel-of-lawyers/article35376365.ece
17 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Resume talks with farmers, Amarinder tells PM Modi||Citing the heightened cross-border threat and increased drone and other terrorist activities by ISI-backed groups, including plans by Khalistani oufits to target certain farmer leaders, Punjab Chief Minister Captain (retd) Amarinder Singh has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately resume dialogue with the agitating farmers and make concerted efforts to resolve their issues. The Chief Minister has proposed to lead an all-party delegation from Punjab for discussion with the Prime Minister to find a durable and amicable solution to the vexed problem of the prolonged farmer agitation, which he said, is threatening the social fabric of the State and impacting the economic activities as well. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Capt. Amarinder warned that the powers across the border “may try to play upon the charged emotions of our proud, sincere, and hard-working farmers” of Punjab, which has a long and live international border. “The situation is presently under control but I fear that provocative statements and conduct of some political parties and the emotional backlash might create law and order problems and also lead to irreversible damage to the hard-earned peace in the State,” he said. ‘Protests on for months’ In his letter, the Chief Minister pointed out that the farmers have been agitating for the past seven months on Delhi-Haryana borders, and also in the State, demanding repeal of these laws and their protests have been more or less peaceful so far. “It is a little unfortunate that multiple rounds of engagement between the Union Ministers and representatives of farmers’ groups have not proved successful,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/resume-talks-with-farmers-amarinder-tells-pm-modi/article35376357.ece
17 July 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan: three sisters crack the State Civil Services exam||Three sisters from a nondescript village in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh district have scored high marks in the State Civil Services examination, the final results of which were announced here earlier this week, with one of them making it to the allied services. The three young women are daughters of a farmer who had dropped out of school. Two elder daughters of the proud farmer, Sahadev Saharan from Bherusari village, are also officers of the Rajasthan Cooperative Service and Rajasthan Rural Development Service. The Rajasthan Administrative Service exam was conducted by the State Public Service Commission in 2018 and the results after the interviews were announced on July 13. Among the three sisters, Anshu Saharan has obtained the 339th rank, which will make her eligible for recruitment to one of the allied services. Ritu Saharan and Suman Saharan obtained the 915th and 945th ranks, respectively, while the final cut-off rank for general category women candidates is likely to be 741 and that for women candidates from Other Backward Classes (OBC) 695. Among the OBC women candidates, Ms. Anshu, Ms. Ritu and Ms. Suman have bagged 31st, 96th and 98th positions, respectively, which the family said was the result of their hard work and dedication despite the lack of facilities in their village. Mr. Saharan’s eldest daughter, Manju, is a Cooperative Inspector, while the next, Roma, is a Block Development Officer. Ms. Anshu and Ms. Suman completed their graduation in the Humanities stream with a first division from the Saraswati Vidya Niketan Girls College in Rawatsar. The college’s administrative head, Raja Ram Moond, told The Hindu on Friday that the two girls were studious and were focused on their career goals. Parents encouragement The Saharan family has emerged as a role model for Civil Services aspirants in the region. Though Mr. Saharan’s wife Lakshmi is unlettered, the couple encouraged their daughters to get the best possible education without a break despite their limited resources. The couple’s youngest son recently graduated from the National Institute of Technology at Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-three-sisters-crack-the-state-civil-services-exam/article35376354.ece
17 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha seeks 95% vaccine allocation for State||Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday demanded an increase in the allocation of vaccines for the State to 95%, and a reduction in the share available to private hospitals to 5%, in order to speed up the COVID-19 inoculation drive in Odisha. In a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and other Chief Ministers, Mr. Patnaik said that due to the low presence of private hospitals in the State, the lifting of vaccines from the 25% private hospitals’ quota had been less. “We had written to the Centre to increase the allocation to the State government to 95% and reduce the allocation to private hospitals to 5%. This will help us in increasing the pace of vaccination in the State,” he said. Mr. Patnaik said Odisha had performed very well in vaccination and its wastage was among the lowest in the country. “I would like to request that the vaccines for the age group of 12-18 years may be prioritised and rolled out at the earliest,” he said, voicing concerns over the anticipated third wave and its impact on children. Vaccine shortage Odisha has faced disruption in its vaccination drive due to shortage in the availability of vaccines. This week, vaccination had to be stopped in 24 out of 30 districts as Covishield doses ran out. As of now, 1,38,09,756 doses, including 1,08,16,744 first doses and 29,93,012 second doses, have been administered in the State. Currently, the State has stock of 4,61,500 doses of Covishield and 1,79,590 doses of Covaxin, which are grossly inadequate to carry out vaccination at the pace the State government had announced after a change in the vaccine policy from June 21. The State government had then declared it would inoculate 3 lakh persons per day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-seeks-95-vaccine-allocation-for-state/article35376355.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong., BJP workers protest outside CM house against water shortage||The BJP and the Congress on Friday held a demonstration outside the residence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to protest against water shortage in the Capital. The police stopped workers of both parties on their way towards the Chief Minister’s residence. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the Delhi government, which came to power with the promise to finish the tanker mafia in the city, is now minting money in connivance with them. He alleged that piped water supply is not being given in Delhi colonies so that “the tanker mafia could flourish”. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar alleged that for the past two months, Delhiites have been facing a severe water shortage but Mr. Kejriwal has been touring other States, promising “free power and water”. Mr. Kumar accused him of not being able to address the water shortage in Delhi for the past seven years. “As an election stunt, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal had given a fake assurance of providing 20,000 litres of free water to the people, though he was aware of the fact that the land-locked Delhi has to depend on neighbouring States like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for their water requirement. Hence, it would be impossible to give free water as Delhi gets less water than its needs,” Mr. Kumar said. He added that when Congress was in power in Delhi, then Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit would take decisions well in advance, including interaction with her counterparts in U.P. and Haryana, so as to ensure that people were not subjected to water crisis during the hot summer months. ‘No permanent solution’ “Mr. Kejriwal has not bothered to find a permanent solution to the water shortage of Delhi in the past seven years despite being in power. How is he going to other States and promising free water and power when has not been able to do it in Delhi,” the Delhi Congress chief said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-bjp-workers-protest-outside-cm-house-against-water-shortage/article35376370.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Now, all households will get clean drinking water’||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Vice-Chairman Raghav Chadha on Friday said the water treatment plants in Delhi will be able to function at their optimum capacities to deliver drinking water to all the households. He said this is possible as the Haryana government has released Delhi’s legitimate share of water. He said the water level in the Wazirabad pond — one of the most important reservoirs in the Capital — has increased from 667 feet to 674.5 feet after the Haryana government discharged Delhi’s rightful share of 16,000 cusecs of water. “It took three days for Delhi’s rightful share of raw water discharged by the Haryana government to reach Delhi today. The situation is now completely normal at the water treatment plants,” Mr. Chadha said. He added: “Delhi has suffered and struggled a lot because of the shortage of the rightful share of water that the Haryana government had withheld earlier The real face of the Haryana government has been exposed.” Water Minister Satyendar Jain met the DJB officials and instructed them to take stock of arrangements made for the ongoing Monsoon season. He instructed the DJB officials to ensure that the sewer lines work properly and should not create any hassle to residents. “It is the duty of the DJB officials to address every issue related to waterlogging and sewer blockage. In case any blockage arises due to excessive rains then water pumps should be used to extract excess rainwater creating a clog in a particular region,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/now-all-households-will-get-clean-drinking-water/article35376363.ece

Meanwhile, the city recorded 66 new COVID-19 cases with one death. A total of 76,459 tests were conducted during the 24-hour period with a positivity rate of 0.09%.

17 July 2021||New Delhi,||Reply to plea on PhD seats allocation, court tells JNU||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to respond to a petition seeking direction to reconsider its decision to allocate 100% PhD seats to Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) category candidates in its seven centres. In previous years The court’s order came on a petition by JNU Students’ Federation of India (SFI), which highlighted that in the previous years, the PhD seats in the seven centres of the varsity were filled up through both from JRF and non-JRF category candidates. However, in the current academic year 2021-22, JNU has “illegally, arbitrarily, unconstitutionally” through its e-Prospectus decided to fill up all 100% PhD seats through JRF category candidates, it said. The petition filed through advocate Ashok Aggarwal, said two UGC-NET-JRF examinations have not taken place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. UGC-NET-JRF exams, which were held twice a year have not been held in December 2020 or in May 2021. This meant, the non-JRF PhD candidates could not get an opportunity to take the UGC-NET-JRF examination for no fault of theirs, the plea said. However, as the entrance examination is not being held by JNU and all seats here have been allotted to JRF candidates, such candidates are left with no option at all to apply for PhD seats in these seven Centres, the plea contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reply-to-plea-on-phd-seats-allocation-court-tells-jnu/article35376372.ece
17 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||Youth accused of hate speech at mahapanchayat in Pataudi denied bail||The Sub-Divisional Judicial Court in Pataudi here on Thursday rejected the bail appeal of Ram Bhakt Gopal — accused of hate speech at a Mahapanchayat targeting a religious community — observing that “if such kind of persons are allowed to move freely...the very existence of communal harmony may be disturbed” and it would give a “wrong message to the divisive forces”. Judicial Magistrate First Class, Mohd. Sageer, observed that “the alleged offences committed by the accused person are very serious and severe in nature” and “at this juncture, the rights of the accused of his personal liberty cannot be preferred against the right of the society to peaceful communal harmony and balance lies in favour of the later”. ‘Harmful than pandemic’ He said such people were “harming this country more than the pandemic”. Appearing for the accused, advocate Kulbhushan Bhardwaj said he himself was present at the mahapanchayat. He argued that “due to early inflammatory speeches of other persons and charged atmosphere, the accused got carried away and that keeping in view of his young age and innocent mind, he be released on bail”. Mr. Bhardwaj said his client was arrested because he was an “outsider” and had “no political connections in the State”. He argued that this showed bias attitude of Haryana Police against his client. Another lawyer Avinash Mishra said the “personal liberty of the accused has to be given importance” and added that “video recording may be a creation of editing”. Arguing against the bail, Assistant Public Prosecutor for State, argued that the accused can interfere in free and fair investigation and can threaten and make pressure upon the complainant and other witnesses and can flee from the trial if he is allowed bail. Rejecting the arguments that the accused was being falsely implicated, Mr. Sageer said the “conscience of the court is utterly shocked while seeing the actual incidents which took place at that time, in video recording” and observed that “hate speech based on religion or caste has become fashion nowadays...” Mr. Bhardwaj said they would make an appeal for bail at the Sessions Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/youth-accused-of-hate-speech-at-mahapanchayat-in-pataudi-denied-bail/article35376359.ece
17 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Police prepare report to check adherence to COVID-19 guidelines at religious places||The Delhi police have prepared an intelligence report on religious places in the national capital that see higher footfalls, said a senior officer on Friday. The move has been taken after the second wave to check the implementation of COVID-appropriate behaviour in the areas. The report accessed by The Hindu found that a survey was done in all 15 police districts and the list includes religious places like Jama Masjid and Akshardham Temple. The report states that at Hanumaan Temple in Connaught Place and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, both in New Delhi district, COVID protocols are being maintained partially. Most of the people were seen without masks inside the temple and the gurudwara. According to the report, COVID-related guidelines were not being followed in the religious places in the south-east, south and north-west Delhi areas. It mentioned that in the south-east district, the Kalkaji Temple is open for devotees and the gatherings rise to around 100-125 people on regular days. The guidelines were also not being followed. The case was similar in the south district. There are 31 temples, 41 mosques, 28 churches and 19 gurudwaras in the area. “In the south district, all churches and nine masjids are closed for devotees. However, in two masjids, three mandirs and 10 gurudwaras, COVID protocol is not followed,” states the report. After getting reports from a special branch of Delhi police and district administration concerned, several markets, including Karol Bagh, Lajpat Nagar and others, were ordered to shut for a couple of days due to overcrowding and flouting of COVID norms. “We are regularly holding meetings with market associations and instructing them to avoid overcrowding and ask visitors to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour,” said a police officer. Teams in markets Meanwhile, all police districts have been instructed to be vigilant and ensure places with high footfalls follow COVID-appropriate behaviour. Teams have been deployed at markets and religious places to challan violators, said the officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-prepare-report-to-check-adherence-to-covid-19-guidelines-at-religious-places/article35376374.ece
