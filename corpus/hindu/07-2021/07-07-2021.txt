This was the surest sign that a Cabinet reshuffle, regularly postponed since the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, will finally take place as early as Wednesday evening. Former MP and former BJP president of the erstwhile combined State of Andhra Pradesh K. Hari Babu was appointed the Governor of Mizoram, while senior BJP leader and former Tribal Affairs Minister in Gujarat Mangubhai Patel was named the Governor of Madhya Pradesh. Former Speaker of the Goa Assembly Rajendra Arlekar will be the Governor of Himachal Pradesh. Several Governors saw a change in States. Former Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya has been transferred from Himachal Pradesh to Haryana, senior BJP leader from Chhattisgarh Ramesh Bais from Tripura to Jharkhand, Satyadev Arya from Haryana to Tripura, and BJP leader from Kerala S. Sreedharan Pillai from Mizoram to Goa. While it was a fairly extensive rejig in terms of Raj Bhavans, informed sources said the Cabinet rejig would be extensive as well. The Council of Ministers has around 28 vacancies, with only 53 of the 81 slots allowed under the Constitution occupied. Government sources said that as many as 20 new faces would be included, and in total, around 24 Ministers belonging to the Other Backward Classes would find representation in the Council of Ministers at the end of this exercise. “Among these new faces will be very young MPs, bringing down the average age of the Council of Ministers to probably its lowest ever since Independence,” said a senior government source. Sources said equal focus would be on the professional qualifications of Ministers as well as community representation issues. New Ministry The government has also decided to create a separate ‘Ministry of Co-operation’ with the aim of ‘Sahkar se Samriddhi’ (prosperity through cooperatives).The Ministry will provide a separate administrative, legal and policy framework for strengthening the cooperative movement in the country. It will, said government sources, “work to streamline the processes for ‘Ease of doing business’ for co-operatives and enable development of Multi-State Co-operatives (MSCS).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amid-cabinet-reshuffle-buzz-a-slew-of-gubernatorial-changes/article35182221.ece
07 July 2021||New Delhi,||GST mop-up in June falls below Rs. 1 lakh cr.||Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in June fell to Rs. 92,849 crore from Rs. 1.02 lakh crore in May, marking the first time after eight months that indirect tax collections fell below the Rs. 1 lakh crore mark. While lockdowns aimed at curbing the second wave of COVID-19 hit economic activity and moderated GST revenues in June, the Union Finance Ministry said the collections were 2% higher than a year ago and would improve from this month. “During May 2021, most of the States/UTs were under either complete or partial lockdown due to COVID,” the Ministry said, citing a 30% fall in e-way bill generation in May from April’s numbers. “However, with reduction in caseload and easing of lockdowns, the e-way bills generated during June 2021 is 5.5 crore (from 3.99 crore in May) which indicates recovery of trade and business… It is expected that while the GST revenues have dipped during the month of June, the revenues will see an increase again from July onwards,” it added. The June GST figures are related to business transactions made during May and also include taxes on domestic transactions between June 5 and July 5, due to extended compliance deadlines for taxpayers. Tax experts said the decline in GST revenues was expected. “With significant relaxations in lockdown and business supplies picking up the collections should see a definite uptick in the coming months,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-mop-up-in-june-falls-below-rs-1-lakh-cr/article35182215.ece
07 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Helmets make way for wrap-around safety||Vic Bath and colleague Dan Cummings at Zulu Alpha Kilo, an advertising agency in Canada, have partnered with Pfaff Harley Davidson to create a protective material for turbans that Sikh riders can use instead of helmets. “My father always dreamed of owning a Harley — it was his ultimate idea of freedom,” says Vic Bath, who is from a Sikh background. “Years later, when he finally got one I was able to see how much it meant to him. That got me thinking — it surely meant as much to other members of the community in Canada and abroad.” While certain provinces of Canada have made helmet exceptions for members of the Sikh community, the bike-riding dreams of many are put on hold as they can’t fit helmets over their turbans. Inspired by Sikh warriors of old who set out for battle wearing chain-mail under their turbans, the team sought to replicate similar head gear. Roping in Spark Innovations, a product design firm, they began to research various impact-resistant materials. They finalised on a composite of bullet-proof fabric, non-Newtonian foam and 3D-printed chain-mail. Non-Newtonian substances do not follow Newton’s Law of Viscosity; the foam used for the turban hardens on impact. The result was a material which was tough and tensile, possessing the dexterity of fabric: the Tough Turban. It can be wound in any way to suit the personal style of the wearer. Keeping in mind the interest of the riding community worldwide, the team from Zulu felt it best to open source the prototype of the Tough Turban and release it online. “We have received a lot of interest in the product from India and Thailand,” says Mr. Bath. Currently, the Tough Turban is a proof of concept/ prototype that is pending approval for use on the road, and the team at Zulu is working with manufacturing partners towards this next step.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/helmets-make-way-for-wrap-around-safety/article35182254.ece
07 July 2021||Ghaziabad,||Mathura court rejects bail plea of Kappan||A Mathura court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who has been in jail for nine months for various offences under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA. In his bail order, Additional Sessions Judge Anil Kumar Pandey said considering the seriousness of evidence, the court didn’t deem it fit to release the accused on bail. He noted that the charge against Mr. Kappan was that he, along with the co-accused, promoted enmity in society and affected communal harmony. The court also said that during the investigation, incriminating material was recovered from him and that he received foreign funding for damaging the integrity of the country. Mr. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 4, 2020 at Maant in Mathura district when heading towards Hathras village, where a Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered by four dominant-caste men. On June 15, a local court in Mathura discharged Mr. Kappan and others of charges under sections 151, 107 and 116 of the CrPC as the police failed to complete the investigation in six months. Describing the prosecution version as “highly improbable”, defence lawyer Wills Mathews reminded the court the petitioner was discharged of the offences that formed the basis of his arrest on October 5, 2020. Describing it as a fit case for bail, he said they would approach the Allahabad High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mathura-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-kappan/article35182366.ece

07 July 2021||Bengaluru,||Marks computation method offers advantage to II PU students||The government’s decision to promote fresh candidates currently enrolled in II PU without conducting exam, notonly offers 5% grace marks in addition to their actual score in I PU examination but also gives other additional advantages which will further inflate their scores. According to an order issued on July 5, all fresh candidates will be scored based on their SSLC and I PU marks that will be given 45% weightage each, and II PU internal assessments (10%). They will be awarded 5% grace marks in each subject, and 10 marks as internal assessment marks for II PU. Fresh candidates will be given full 10 marks for their internal assessments for this academic year, said R. Snehal, Director of the Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE). “We have devised this method as it has been decided to promote all the II PU students with the examination cancelled due to the second wave of COVID-19,” she said. In addition to that, while considering SSLC marks, the two languages where students have got their highest scores will be considered. This will inflate their overall percentage while giving 45% weightage for the SSLC marks. The order states that the decision to consider only two language papers was taken as students from central boards opt only for two languages. If candidates have appeared for three languages in Class 10 and the maximum marks of any of the papers is 125, this will be scaled down to 100 marks. After this exercise, the best of the marks in two languages will be considered and the average computed. Hence, 45% of the marks obtained in the two language papers and three core subjects in SSLC or equivalent exam will be computed. Later, 45% of the marks secured in each subject in I PU final exam will be added along with 5% grace marks in each subject. Finally, 10 marks of internal assessment will be added to each subject before computing the total marks in all the six subjects for the II PU final exam results. Ninge Gowda A.H., president of the Karnataka State Pre-University College Lecturers’ Association, said, “After a lot of deliberation, the expert committee has suggested a method that is fair and rational. Students now should not have any grouse even though the examination is cancelled,” he said. B.R. Supreet, principal of Oxford Independent PU College, said the evaluation system is very lenient. “However, we are glad that these scores will not be used in competitive examinations as the marks of even average students will be high.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/marks-computation-method-offers-advantage-to-ii-pu-students/article35182252.ece

Irrigation officials said the bund was damaged as spillover water got diverted due to a breach after a rise in the flood level. But there was no threat to villages, they added. Collector Kartikeya Misra told The Hindu that there was no flood threat to any affected villages in the Agency area, adding that the officials were monitoring the situation. On receiving information about the breach, police and Irrigation officials rushed to the spot. With water levels rising in the river, officials released water from 42 sluice gates. The approach channel was completely inundated due to the breach, the officials added. “With the backwaters stagnating for the last few days and floodwaters entering the river due to rainfall upstream and in the hilly areas, there are chances of more breaches in the Godavari bund, and there is a threat to some villages,” said M. Swamy, a resident. Road communication has been cut-off to many hamlets in Polavaram, Velerupadu, in West Godavari district and habitations were affected in Devipatnam and Yetapaka mandals in East Godavari district.

07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Super censorship’: MPs’ panel grills Ministry||The Standing Committee on Information and Technology headed by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, at a meeting on Tuesday, grilled the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on the “super censorship” clause introduced in the draft Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2021. The committee members, according to sources, asked the Ministry to explain the “reasons” and “motivation” for introducing the provision which allows the government to order recertification for a film already certified by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). This was the first meeting of the Parliamentary Panel on the Bill. The Ministry officials, sources said, were at pains to explain. “They claimed that the Bill has been misunderstood and that the Ministry itself will have no powers to censor any film. The Bill only allows the Ministry to return the film for recertification,” one of the members said on condition of anonymity. Ministry officials also said that the clause would only be invoked if the content of a film impinged on security and integrity of the nation. Not satisfied with the explanation, the members asked why, when there were existing penal provisions to deal with such a situation, did the Ministry felt it necessary to incorporate this in the Bill. “If any person or group feels that a film or part of it hurts their sentiment or imperils the country, they can go to court. Our basic question was why should this power to adjudicate be vested with a bureaucrat,” another member said. The members, sources said, also pointed to the Supreme Court order passed in 2000 that the government could not exercise revisional powers on films already certified by the CBFC. The Bill was placed in the public domain till July 2 inviting comments. Filmmakers across the country has slammed the Bill, with veteran filmmaker Adoor Gopalkrishnan calling it an attempt by the government to bring in “super censorship”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/super-censorship-mps-panel-grills-ministry/article35181991.ece
07 July 2021||New Delhi,||Leaders urge Kovind to act on Fr. Swamy death||Ten Opposition parties have urged President Ramnath Kovind to act against those responsible for foisting “false cases” on human rights activist Fr. Stan Swamy for his continued detention in jail and alleged inhuman treatment reulting in his death. The signatories to a letter to the President include Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister and Janata Dal(S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, his West Bengal and Jharkhand counterparts Mamata Banerjee and Hemant Soren, respectively, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, NC leader Farooq Abdullah, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and his CPI counterpart D. Raja. The Opposition parties said they were writing to express their “deep anguish” and to express “intense grief” and “outrage” at the death of Fr. Swamy, who was jailed last October under the UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act] in connection to the Bhima Koregaon case. The Opposition pointed out that he was denied treatment for his various ailments, including Parkinson’s. It was only after a nationwide campaign was conducted that even a sipper to drink liquids was made available to him in jail, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/leaders-urge-kovind-to-act-on-fr-swamy-death/article35182011.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Health officials flag laxity during travel||India has registered a decline of 13% in average daily new COVID-19 cases last week, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, said on Tuesday. However, he cautioned against letting the guard down during what is being called “revenge tourism”, in which people travel with a vengeance after being confined to their homes during the lockdown. At a press conference, Mr. Agarwal described the trend of tourists failing to observe COVID-appropriate behaviour in hill stations as dangerous. Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), too expressed a similar sentiment. “We have to be careful, responsible and cautious as the second COVID-19 wave is still on in some parts of this large country,” he said. The Health Ministry, in its presentation, added that 80% of new COVID-19 cases were now being reported from 90 districts with Maharashtra (19), Tamil Nadu (15), Kerala (14), Odisha (11), Andhra Pradesh (10), Assam (9) and Karnataka (8) leading the tally. “COVID surge in India began with a single case reported last year so we have to understand that we can’t afford to forget the spread and devastation this virus is capable of causing. We can’t let down our guard just yet. We are looking at strict local containment in areas and pockets that are seeing a large number of cases,” Mr. Agarwal said. He said the virus had not got exhausted yet. Quoting a recent online survey indicating gross violations in terms of use of masks and physical distancing, Mr. Agarwal noted that there was no compliance in 24%, limited compliance in 45% and good compliance in 29% of the survey respondents. “Vaccination and COVID-appropriate behavior are key to keeping the virus under control,” Dr. Bhargava said. Stating that 73 districts in India still have over 10% test positivity, while 65 districts have 5-10% positivity, he said that this trend was a cause of worry. To a question on vaccine boosters, he said that while it was known that COVID-19 antibodies persisted for seven to 12 months after infection, “we are still looking at the cover that vaccines offer in terms of the length of the time period. Research is on about booster doses.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/health-officials-flag-laxity-during-travel/article35182020.ece
07 July 2021||New Delhi,||Union Cabinet reshuffle likely today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to effect the first reshuffle in his Council of Ministers on Wednesday evening, sources said. Former Chief Ministers and MPs who have had administrative experience in other States would be part of the new Cabinet. Former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi are expected to be included as is Congress rebel Jyotiraditya Scindia. Power tussle NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party’s Pashupati Paras is also tipped to be included in the Cabinet, setting off an angry tirade from his estranged nephew, Chirag Paswan, who said he had written to the Prime Minister not to appoint Mr. Paras as a Minister in his government on the LJP quota. The slot became vacant after the passing away of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, which also plunged the party into a split. “Making him [Pashupati Paras] a Union Minister on LJP quota isn’t possible as the party’s executive board expelled him. I have informed the Prime Minister through a letter. If he is appointed, then I shall go to court,” Mr. Chirag Paswansaid. The Janata Dal (U) is also bargaining for more slots than they had been promised, which was basically one Cabinet post and a Minister of State berth. The party wanted two Cabinet berths. Late evening talks were being held between JD(U) national president and MP R.C.P. Singh and the BJP national leadership in New Delhi at the time of writing.  Influx of candidates The national capital saw an influx of candidates likely to take oath as Ministers. Apart from Mr. Scindia, Mr. Paras and Mr. Sonowal, sources told The Hindu that former Chief Minister of Maharashtra and currently BJP-supported Rajya Sabha member Narayan Rane has been asked to come to Delhi. He is expected to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The extensive Cabinet rejig and gubernatorial shuffle will not be the end of political appointments, as Mr. Gehlot’s exit from the Council of Ministers also means that the BJP will have to look for another Leader of the House for the Rajya Sabha, and another member for the party’s parliamentary board, its highest decision-making body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-cabinet-reshuffle-likely-today/article35181997.ece
07 July 2021||Mumbai,||A long struggle for medical bail||The death of 84-year-old tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy in a Mumbai hospital on Monday due to ailments exacerbated by his incarceration without bail in the Bhima Koregaon case, has turned the spotlight on the other accused in the case who remain in jail with medical conditions. The Bombay High Court and the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court have denied several interim medical bail pleas of the six senior citizens with co-morbidities over the past three years. Poet Varavara Rao is 81; Anand Teltumbde, former managing director and CEO of Petronet India Limited, is 70; writer and a columnist Vernon Gonsalves is 68; civil rights scholar and journalist Gautam Navlakha is 67; Shoma Sen, former head of the Department of English at Nagpur University, is 63; and trade unionist and human rights lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj is 61. Mr. Rao was granted interim medical bail of six months by the High Court on February 22 after it was rejected twice by the special NIA court. His wife, P. Hemalatha, had urged the court to consider his neurological and cardiac issues, along with other ailments such as piles, prostate enlargement, coronary artery disease, oedema, hypertension, acidity, sinus and migraine. Mr. Teltumbde has chronic bronchitis asthma, chronic cervical spondylitis, supraspinatus tendinosis and prostatomegaly; Mr. Gonsalves has hypertension and bleeding piles; Mr. Navlakha has colonic polyposis, chronic gastritis and hypertension; Ms. Sen has multiple ailments including osteoarthritis, glaucoma and high blood pressure, and Ms. Bharadwaj has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderate depression, osteoarthritis, ischaemic disease and tinea corporis (skin fungal infection). Treatment in jail On May 3 this year, Ms. Bharadwaj’s daughter Maaysha Singh moved the High Court seeking interim medical bail for her mother. The court, however, disposed of the case after it was informed that she had received medical treatment in jail. On August 28, 2020, the High Court had rejected the second medical bail of Ms Bharadwaj and said, “She is taken care of in so far as her health condition is concerned.” On May 29, 2020, the NIA court had rejected Ms. Bharadwaj’s interim bail plea on medical grounds due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in jail. On June 26, 2020, the special NIA court had for the second time rejected the interim medical bail pleas of Mr. Rao and Ms Sen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-long-struggle-for-medical-bail/article35182000.ece
07 July 2021||Srinagar,||Kashmir parties express unease||As the J&K Delimitation Commission arrived in Srinagar on Tuesday on its four-day consultation tour of the Union Territory (UT), Kashmir-based political parties questioned the timing of the exercise and expressed fears of it being “politically motivated”. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Awami National Conference boycotted the panel. A delegation of the National Conference (NC), which is part of the five-party Gupkar alliance, met the Commission headed by Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakesh Desai. “The J&K Reorganization Act, 2019 is palpably unconstitutional. We have challenged the Act in the Supreme Court, which is before the constitutional bench. The two pillars of the State — Executive and Legislature — must out of respect to the third pillar, judiciary, avoid implementing and exercising powers under an Act that is under scrutiny,” the NC said in a memorandum submitted to the Commission. The NC suggested that the delimitation be carried out after 2026 once the relevant figures of the census were published. The Commission, under the J&K Reorganization Act, 2019, is mandated to carve out seven more constituencies to the 83-member UT Assembly. It will meet more parties and civil society groups in south Kashmir, Jammu and the Chenab Valley in the next three days. A CPI (M) delegation, led by party’s J&K secretary Ghulam Nabi Malik, told the Commission the exercise should be carried out along with the rest of the country in 2026. He said the Commission assured the CPI (M) delegation that it will put the report in public domain and only after that the report will be finalised. Boycotting the exercise, PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Hanjura, wrote an open letter to the Commission. “The Commission lacks constitutional and legal mandate. There are apprehensions that the exercise is part of the overall process of political disempowerment of the people of J&K There are apprehensions that the process is aimed at realizing the political vision of a particular political party, and the views and wishes of the people of J&K would be considered the least,” he said. Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference also questioned the timing of the exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kashmir-parties-express-unease/article35182007.ece
07 July 2021||Patna,||Chirag bristles at possible Cabinet entry for Paras||After embarking on his Aashirwad yatra from Hajipur on July 5, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader and MP Chirag Paswan on Tuesday said he would go to court if his uncle and expelled party leader Pashupati Kumar Paras was inducted into the Union Cabinet. Mr. Paswan also slammed Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s government in Bihar and said the “countdown of this government has begun”. Amid reports that Mr. Paras, who leads the LJP rebel faction, will be joining Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet on July 8, Mr. Paswan said, “Making him a Union Minister on LJP quota is not possible as the party’s executive board has expelled him. I’ve informed PM through letter. If he is appointed Minister as MP of my party, I’ll move court but I’ve no problem if he is appointed as minister at the Center as an Independent MP or from JD(U) after joining it.” The LJP leader was addressing media persons at his residence in Patna. Earlier on July 5, Mr. Paswan was accorded a rousing welcome by party leaders and workers when he visited Patna and Hajipur to kick off his Aashirwad Yatra. Projecting himself as rightful political heir of his father and founder of the party, Ram Vilas Paswan, Mr. Paswan had said those who rebelled against the party were guilty of “betrayal”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chirag-bristles-at-possible-cabinet-entry-for-paras/article35182002.ece
07 July 2021||New Delhi,||CBSE to make surprise visits to schools preparing results||Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) officials will conduct surprise inspections of the school committees preparing this year’s Class 10 and 12 results, and will inspect the rationale document that is meant to ensure that the mark determination process is being done in an objective manner. The CBSE’s Controller of Examinations, Sanyam Bhardwaj, has written to all regional offices asking them to complete such inspections by July 12. In the letter sent on Tuesday, Dr. Bhardwaj asked senior officers of the CBSE’s regional offices to visit schools under their jurisdiction as a “top priority” in order to “verify the work done by the schools” and ensure that the Board’s result tabulation policy is being “implemented effectively”. “In order to have actual information of the result work of the schools, it may be ensured that while visiting the schools, no prior intimation be given to the schools and only sudden inspection is carried out,” said the letter. “The official visiting the school may also sign on documents inspected especially rationale documents,” it added. The CBSE Tabulation Policy for Class 12 marks gives a lot of discretion to school results committees to assign and even revise marks of individual students in order to ensure they align with the school’s historical performance. In order to reduce the possibility of bias, each panel must include two external members and also record the justification for all its decisions in a rationale document, Dr. Bhardwaj had told The Hindu . CBSE officials were being asked to take pictures of all the documents they inspected during their surprise visits and include it in a point-wise report to be submitted to Dr. Bhardwaj by July 12. Schools would be chosen for inspection so that all categories of schools — government, private, Kendriya Vidyalayas and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas — were covered, said the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbse-to-make-surprise-visits-to-schools-preparing-results/article35182025.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC comes to the aid of those in mental health institutions||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to ensure that patients in mental health institutions are tested for COVID-19 and vaccinated. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah directed States and Union Territories to extend cooperation and participate in the meeting of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to be held on July 12. It asked the States and the Union Territories to remove the discrepancies in figures submitted about the people treated but are languishing in the institutions and those who still need treatment. The Bench decided to monitor their welfare, terming it a sensitive issue. The court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Gaurav Bansal that nearly 10,000 people, fit to be discharged, were forced to live in mental hospitals due to social stigma. Additional Solicitor-General Madhavi Divan, appearing for the Centre, said there were some discrepancies in the data provided by the States and the matter had been pointed out to the governments. “It is a very serious matter. Many people who are cured may not be accepted by their families. Tell the authorities concerned to be serious and ensure that court’s order is complied with,” the court said. The Bench also objected to the practice of the Maharashtra government in shifting these patients to beggar homes as it was in violation of the Mental Health Act. Mr. Bansal pressed that those in mental health institutions be tested for COVID-19 and get the benefit of vaccination as they make up the most vulnerable section of society. The Bench said it is time the matter was taken up with alacrity, and directed the Chief Secretaries to send their representatives to participate in the meeting of July 12. The court posted the matter for further hearing on July 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-comes-to-the-aid-of-those-in-mental-health-institutions/article35182205.ece
07 July 2021||New Delhi,||Consulates remain open in Kandahar, Mazar: India||India is watching the situation in the Afghan cities of Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif closely, with concerns for its missions and diplomatic staff there growing as the Taliban gains control over a number of provincial cities, said officials. However, the government denied it had shut down operations at its consulates there, calling reports that said India was pulling out its diplomatic personnel “incorrect”. The Indian Embassy in Kabul said in a tweet, “Consulates in Kandahar & Mazar-e-Sharif are open, functioning. We DO HOWEVER continue to closely monitor the evolving security situation particularly around Kandahar & Mazar cities.” Operations at India’s other Consulates in Herat and Jalalabad were suspended in April 2020, when all Indian personnel were brought back to Delhi due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ahead of a full security review. Afghanistan’s security situation and future course are expected to come up as External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar travels to Russia on Wednesday for a three-day visit from July 7-9, and meets with his counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss “regional and international issues” along with bilateral ties. The developments were also discussed in a meeting between Afghanistan Ambassador Farid Mamundzay and Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla on Tuesday, as both Kabul and New Delhi monitor the situation in Afghanistan in the wake of the U.S. and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) troops pull-out. “Ambassador [Mamundzay] briefed the Foreign Secretary (FS) on the security situation in Afghanistan. FS assured our Afghan friends of India’s long-term commitment towards peace and prosperity in Afghanistan,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a tweet. According to an Associated Press report on Tuesday, the Balkh provincial Governor’s spokesperson Munir Farhad said that Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, India and Pakistan had all reduced their strength at Consulates in Mazar, and that Turkey and Russia had closed their Consulates down in the wake of the growing violence around Mazar. Officials in Delhi denied the downsizing of the Indian missions at this time, but said they are watching the developing situation closely, and were prepared to ensure the safety of all Indian personnel. About 50 diplomatic staff and security personnel remain in the two Consulates at Kandahar and Mazar, while the Embassy in Kabul runs most of the consular operations for the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/consulates-remain-open-in-kandahar-mazar-india/article35182029.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Postponed JEE-Main sessions to be conducted from July 20||The third and fourth sessions of the all-India engineering entrance examination JEE-Main will be held from July 20 to 25 and from July 27 to August 2 respectively, the National Testing Agency announced on Tuesday. The first two sessions of JEE-Main 2021 were already completed in February and March. Students are free to attempt the exam all four times if they wish to do so, with the best score being used for ranking and admissions. “Candidates who could not apply for the entrance exam earlier are being provided with a golden chance to apply again,” said Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, announcing the NTA decision in a video statement. The registration window is being opened for fresh applicants, while those candidates who had already registered for the April and May sessions can also make changes to their applications. Already, 6.8 lakh students had registered for the April exam and 6.09 lakh for the May session that had to be put off during the second wave of COVID. Applicants for the third session must submit their forms between July 6 and 8, while those applying for the fourth session can do so from July 9 to 12, said the NTA. The third session will be conducted only for BE and B.Tech candidates while the fourth session will be conducted for B.Arch and B.Planning as well as the engineering aspirants. To ensure COVID-19 safety and distancing protocols are maintained, the NTA has increased the number of testing centres from 660 in 232 cities to 828 centres in 334 cities.

07 July 2021||Pune,||Negative of PK finds its way to NFAI vaults||The city-based National Film Archive of India (NFAI) on Tuesday acquired the original camera negative of filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani’s popular satire PK . Besides the negative, Mr. Hirani handed over nearly 300 cans of initial rushes of the film and outtakes of his other hugely popular Aamir Khan starrer 3 Idiots (2009) to NFAI Director Prakash Magdum for preservation in the premier film archive. “The significance of the acquisition of the negative of PK (2014) is that it is one of the last films to be shot on celluloid,” said Mr. Magdum. Mr. Magdum said negatives of the director’s earlier films such as Munnabhai MBBS (2003), Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) and 3 Idiots (2009) — all major commercial successes — were already part of the NFAI vaults. “It is the duty of a filmmaker to ensure that the original negatives of his or her films are preserved for posterity and for the entertainment and study of future generations of cineastes and scholars. I appeal to all filmmakers to support the NFAI in this important endeavour,” said Mr. Hirani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/negative-of-pk-finds-its-way-to-nfai-vaults/article35181981.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||IT rules: Centre asks SC to transfer pleas to itself||The Centre has asked the Supreme Court to transfer to itself cases pending in various High Courts challenging the validity of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules of 2021. The High Courts, including Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Kerala, are hearing the petitions against the new IT Rules. The Delhi High Court is hearing the case concerning Twitter. Recently, the government informed the Delhi High Court that micro-blogging site Twitter had failed to comply with the law regulating tech companies rendering their services as ‘intermediaries’. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity), in an affidavit, said despite three months being granted to all Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) to comply with the Rules, Twitter has failed to fully comply with the same. Last week, Twitter informed the court that the interim Resident Grievance Officer and the interim Nodal Contact Person had resigned from their positions in June. The tech giant had said it was in the final stages of appointing a replacement. Meanwhile, “the grievances of Indian users are being addressed by the Grievance Officer”. On September 24, 2019, hearing a petition filed by Facebook, the apex court had shown deep concern at the utilisation of social media for committing crime. It said the medium had become a source for pornography. Paedophiles used social media in a “big way”. Criminals exploit it to run weapons, drugs and contraband. Hate and violence are shared and spread through these virtual platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/it-rules-centre-asks-sc-to-transfer-pleas-to-itself/article35182200.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi greets Dalai Lama on his 86th birthday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday morning greeted the Dalai Lama in a phone call on the occasion of the Tibetan spiritual leader’s 86th birthday. Mr. Modi said on Twitter, “Spoke on phone to His Holiness the Dalai Lama to convey greetings on his 86th birthday. We wish him a long and healthy life.” This is the first time Mr. Modi has publicly confirmed speaking with the Dalai Lama since he took over as Prime Minister in 2014. Mr. Modi and the Dalai Lama previously exchanged greetings on Twitter in 2015. Mr. Modi is also known to have spoken with the Dalai Lama on the phone previously, including to wish him on his birthday in 2019, but that call was not publicly acknowledged at the time. The July 2019 call came amid a period of India and China trying to repair relations following the 2017 border stand-off in Doklam. Mr. Modi travelled to China for an “informal summit” with President Xi Jinping in April 2018, and Mr. Xi travelled to Mamallapuram for another in October 2019. That process of repairing the ties was derailed with the May 2020 border crisis along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the June 15, 2020, clashes in Galwan Valley, marking the worst violence on the border since 1967. The LAC crisis remains unresolved, and talks to restore the status quo appear deadlocked. India has made clear to China that relations cannot be returned to normal unless there is full disengagement and de-escalation along the border. The tweet from Mr. Modi was seen as signalling to China that relations are, under the present circumstances, to some extent in uncharted waters. The Modi government has also made it clear that investments from China will continue to receive additional scrutiny and more than 200 Chinese apps remain banned, although bilateral trade in 2020 remained largely unaffected by the tensions. On Tuesday, greetings were also conveyed to the Dalai Lama on Twitter by Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari and Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-greets-dalai-lama-on-his-86th-birthday/article35182005.ece
07 July 2021||Mumbai,||Farm laws: Maharashtra tables amendments||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday introduced amendment bills in the State legislature to the three farm Acts passed by the Union government last August. The bill to amend the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, presented by Maharashtra’s Agriculture Minister Dadaji Bhuse, stated that farming agreement shall not be valid unless the price paid to farmer is equal to or greater than the minimum support price (MSP). It also proposed that the farmer and sponsor can make farming agreement below MSP with mutual consent for maximum period of two years. “For crops where MSP is not declared then they may enter into a farming agreement with a mutually agreed price,” it said. It has also made the provision for punishment of imprisonment of minimum three years for harassment to the farmer. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said the draft will be open for suggestions and objections for next two months and will be finalised in the winter session of the Assembly. State’s Co-operation Minister Balasaheb Patil introduced the amendment to the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which stated that ‘no trader shall trade in any scheduled farmers’ produce unless such trader has a valid licence of competent authority’. The draft bill has, however, clarified that ‘no licence or permission is required for marketing of agricultural produce such as fruits, vegetables, condiments, spices’. Chhagan Bhujbal, State’s Minister for Food, Civil Supply and Consumer Protection, introduced an amendment to the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, making provision for the State government to regulate or prohibit the production, supply, distribution, imposing stock limits under circumstances such as famine, price rise, natural calamity etc. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis claimed that the amendments are nothing but an eyewash and the State government is taking forward the policies of the Central government. “There was no need to delay the implementation of these Acts in the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-laws-maharashtra-tables-amendments/article35181976.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Delhi HC raps Twitter over officer posting||“How long does the process of appointing a grievance officer take? If Twitter thinks it can take as much time as it wants in our country, I will not permit that,” Justice Palli cautioned. Justice Palli directed Twitter’s counsel to come up with a clear picture of the compliance timeline by July 8, the next date of hearing. “Otherwise you [Twitter] are in trouble,” the judge warned. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, sought time to seek instructions on the specific timeline to complete the grievance officer appointment. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said there had been a non-compliance of the IT Rules by Twitter for over 42 days. “Facebook has removed 3 crore contents, Instagram has removed 18 lakh, Google has removed 3 lakh, Twitter can certainly do better,” the ASG said. The High Court also took strong objection to Twitter’s counsel informing it on the last date of hearing that the micro-blogging site has already appointed a resident grievance officer on May 28, 2021. In view of the statement, the court had granted time to Twitter to submit a counter-affidavit. “The said reply has been filed. A perusal shows that Twitter had as on May 31, 2021 only appointed only an interim resident grievance officer, which fact was not brought to the notice of the court,” the court noted. Twitter had failed to comply with India’s law regulating tech companies rendering their services as ‘intermediaries’, an affidavit by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-raps-twitter-over-officer-posting/article35181993.ece

07 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘Tele-law services empowering voiceless’||Offering legal assistance to needy people over telephone and video conference by lawyers and para-legal volunteers has given “voice of justice to the voiceless,” Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday. The Minister was addressing an event to mark the coverage of more than nine lakh beneficiaries of the government’s tele-law scheme, using common service centres (CSCs) to provide justice across the country. Mr. Prasad said the facility had been “a source of gender justice and empowerment”. To mark the occasion, the Minister released a special postal cover on tele-law — Reaching the Unreached. Urging lawyers and para-legal volunteers engaged in tele-law to keep their commitment, Mr. Prasad said tele-law had the potential to foster inclusive justice delivery and strengthening rule of law. Secretary (Justice) Barun Mitra pointed out that tele-law saw a 369% jump in the number of beneficiaries seeking legal advice during the last one year. Presently, tele-law programme is operational in 633 districts (including 115 aspirational districts) across all the States and Union Territories using a network of 50,000 CSCs. The CSCs help needy and disadvantaged people get legal advice from a panel of lawyers using e-interface platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tele-law-services-empowering-voiceless/article35181989.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Delhi HC raps Twitter over officer posting||Twitter admitted that it was currently not in compliance with the new IT rules as it was in the process of appointing a grievance officer and a nodal officer.  “How long does the process of appointing a grievance officer take? If Twitter thinks it can take as much time as it wants in our country, I will not permit that,” Justice Palli cautioned. Justice Palli directed Twitter’s counsel to come up with a clear picture of the compliance timeline by July 8, the next date of hearing. “Otherwise you [Twitter] are in trouble,” the judge warned. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, sought time to seek instructions on the specific timeline to complete the grievance officer appointment. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said there had been a non-compliance of the IT Rules by Twitter for over 42 days. “Facebook has removed 3 crore contents, Instagram has removed 18 lakh, Google has removed 3 lakh, Twitter can certainly do better,” the ASG said. The High Court also took strong objection to Twitter’s counsel informing it on the last date of hearing that the micro-blogging site has already appointed a resident grievance officer on May 28, 2021. In view of the statement, the court had granted time to Twitter to submit a counter-affidavit. “The said reply has been filed. A perusal shows that Twitter had as on May 31, 2021 appointed only an interim resident grievance officer, which was not brought to the notice of the court,” the court noted. Twitter had failed to comply with India’s law regulating tech companies rendering their services as ‘intermediaries’, an affidavit by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-raps-twitter-over-officer-posting/article35182201.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh gave the order on the plea filed by a married same-sex couple, where one of them is an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holder and his partner a U.S. citizen. The court tagged the fresh petition filed by Joydeep Sengupta and Russell Blaine Stephens to be heard collectively with four other pending petitions on the issue of declaring the Special Marriage Act and Foreign Marriage Act applicable to all couples regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation. Mr. Sengupta and Mr. Stephens, at present residing in Paris, said they got married in New York on August 6, 2012. They said they were preparing for their new role as parents and expecting their first child in July 2021. Mr. Sengupta is a Canadian citizen now and since 2011, he has been an OCI. Mr. Stephens said he wished to apply for the OCI status under the Citizenship Act as a spouse of an OCI cardholder to enable him to get a multiple entry, life-long visa for visiting India, where Mr. Sengupta’s family lives. The petition sought a direction restraining the Consulate General of India, New York, from declaring a spouse of an OCI applying for an OCI card to be ineligible for the same, merely on the ground that they were in a same-sex marriage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/same-sex-marriage-hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-fresh-plea/article35182027.ece

Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders and the European Union (E.U.) Human Rights Chief on Monday, “High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet and the U.N.’s independent experts have repeatedly raised the cases of Father Stan and 15 other human rights defenders associated with the same events with the government of India over the past three years and urged their release from pre-trial detention,” said the statement issued by the OHCHR spokesperson. In written responses to queries from The Hindu , OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssel said Ms. Bachelet had raised the cases both privately and publicly on “numerous occasions” including in a statement on “shrinking of civic space in India” last November. The U.N. Special Rapporteurs have also raised the issue of human rights defenders in a couple of communications to the Indian government, and are expected to release another update on the issue next month. “The High Commissioner has also raised concerns over the use of the UAPA in relation to human rights defenders, a law Father Stan was challenging before Indian courts days before he died,” the rights agency said, making a particular mention of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), that allows authorities to detain suspects without charging them, and allows courts to hold them without bail. “In light of the continued, severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more urgent that States, including India, release every person detained without a sufficient legal basis, including those detained simply for expressing critical or dissenting views. This would be in line with the Indian judiciary’s calls to decongest the prisons,” the OHCHR statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/release-bhima-koregaon-case-accused-un-body/article35181994.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Prarabdha karma||Sastras advise that an individual desirous of salvation should learn to gradually dissociate himself from the active involvements that he had been preoccupied with and begin to meditate on God with single minded devotion, at least during the last lap of his life. The Lord’s word in the Bhagavad Gita, that one can reach Him if only one is able to think of Him at the time of death, provides the motivation to make it a practice to meditate on Him in earnest at all times. But even for one steeped in bhakti yoga, to resist the pulls of attachment that might casually come in one’s way can become a difficult task is what the Jadabharata episode very vividly illustrates, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. Bharata’s compassionate nature towards the young orphaned deer had very subtly morphed into strong emotional attachment and this interfered with his usual daily practice of austerities. Instead of fixing his mind on God which had been his aim when he chose to live in solitude, he remembered the deer all the while so much so that this thought alone prevailed at the time of death. He was then born as a deer in his next birth. Interpreters feel that the prarabdha karma in his account took the form of this new fangled attachment to the deer. The same prarabdha continued in his next birth but now, though a deer, he was granted the knowledge of his past life. He became aware of the long years of penance he had spent in archana, aradhana and meditation and how this had taken a diversion. Brooding thus, the deer moved away from its herd and travelled towards the hermitage to wait for the end of its life. In the next birth, he was born as the realised Jadabharata and attained salvation at the end of his life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prarabdha-karma/article35182015.ece

Advocate Yug Chaudhry, representing Ms. Bharadwaj lodged at Byculla jail, was appearing before a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar. He said K.D. Wadane passed two significant orders — one on November 26, 2018, granting an extension of 180 days for filing the charge sheet as opposed to 90 days stipulated under the Code of Criminal Procedure; and the other on December 21, 2019, when he received the charge sheet, took cognisance of it and issued processes. Mr. Chaudhry showed to the court that both the orders were signed by Mr .Wadane. The designation in one order read ‘special judge’ and ‘special Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) judge’ in the other order. Mr. Chaudhry said Right to Information replies received from the High Court showed Mr. Wadne was an additional judge and not a special judge. He added that the UAPA neither has special courts nor special judges. The court said, “We wish to verify the information from the High Court registry” and posted the matter to be heard on July 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-seeks-records-on-plea-filed-by-bharadwaj/article35182014.ece

While 196 MLAs were in favour, 69 opposed the resolution moved by Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Partha Chatterjee under Article 169. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators voted against it. Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari said the passage of the resolution does not mean that the Council has come into existence. “Under Article 169, Parliament will have to provide for creation of the Council. This means that it has not been created,” Mr. Adhikari said. The Nandigram MLA said the Council will involve expenditure of hundreds of crores only to provide back door entry to those who lost in the Assembly polls. Senior Minister Subrata Mukherjee and deputy chief whip Tapas Roy said the BJP must first answer why hundreds of crores are spent on buying aircraft for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced the setting up of the Council during the run up to the Assembly polls. West Bengal had a Council till 1969 when a resolution passed in the Assembly for its dissolution.

07 July 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Oxygen shortage deaths: compensation hiked||The State government on Tuesday told the High Court that it has decided to enhance the compensation to the kin of 13 of the total 24 persons, who died of oxygen shortage at Chamarajanagar district hospital during May this year. The government said that an additional ex-gratia of Rs. 3 lakh would be paid in addition to Rs. 2 lakh paid earlier to the kin of three persons, who died between 10.30 p.m. on May 2 and 2.20 a.m. on May 3. And an additional Rs. 2 lakh ex-gratia would be paid to the kin of 10 others, who died between 2.21 a.m. and 9 a.m. on May 3. In case of 11 other patients, who died before 10.30 p.m. on May 2, the government said that it would await the report of the Commission of Inquiry for consideration of payment of additional ex-gratia in addition to the Rs. 2 lakh already paid to their kins. Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi told a Special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar that the government has decided to pay additional sum as ex-gratia in view of the proceedings pending before the Court without prejudice to the rights of either of the parties in the proceedings or claims made by any person in relation to death of 24 persons allegedly due to shortage of oxygen. A committee, set up by the Karnataka Legal Services Authority, comprising two former judges of the High Court had found from the records that 24 persons had died due to shortage of oxygen while also indicating that more patients could have died due to oxygen shortage. Though the government is contesting the number of patients died due to oxygen shortage, it has agreed to pay ex-gratia amounts based on observations made by the court on liabilities of the government.

07 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. workers protest in Ambattur||A large section of conservancy workers, employed by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) on contract through the National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM), staged a demonstration in Ambattur on Tuesday, demanding regularisation of their jobs. With their contract ending by the middle of this month, the workers demanded urgent intervention by the State government. Ku. Bharathi, State president of Uzhaippor Urimai Iyakkam (UUI), which spearheaded the demonstration with participation from a few other organisations, said the Madras High Court, in an ongoing case, had asked the Corporation not to terminate the services of these workers for three months. “Since that duration is also over and further hearing in the case is yet to happen, the workers are worried about their employment,” he said. V. Hari Prashanth, an affected worker and a zonal-level functionary of UUI, said there were nearly 1,500 conservancy workers engaged temporarily under the NULM in Zone 7 (Ambattur) of the Corporation alone. “With the conservancy work in the zone now being outsourced to Chennai Enviro Solutions Pvt. Ltd., which is part of the Ramky Group, we are at risk of getting terminated any time. Similar terminations have happened in other zones,” he said. According to him, the private company offered to absorb a small section of the 1,500 workers into its workforce. “However, the pay seemed to be even less than the poor pay we are getting now and they said they will not take people older than 50. Considering the number of years we have put in service, we want the Corporation to make all of us permanent employees,” Mr. Prashanth said. The workers said that they were paid at the rate of Rs. 391 a day. Appeal to CM He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had written a letter in January this year, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, in support of providing permanent employment to the NULM workers. “We are appealing to the Chief Minister to implement the same now,” he said. Joseph Samuel, Ambattur MLA, of the DMK, met the protesters and promised to take up the issue with senior Ministers on an urgent basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-workers-protest-in-ambattur/article35182323.ece
07 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CBSE’s move to have two terms, rationalise syllabus welcomed||The Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) announcement on reducing the syllabus andholding board exams twice during the 2021-22 academic yearin different formats, has been welcomed by schools as a move that will reduce the uncertainty and stress that students undergo during the pandemic. According to a notification from the CBSE, the 2021-22 academic year would be divided into two terms with 50% of the syllabus covered in each term and board exams held at the end of each term for classes 10 and 12. Continuous internal assessments will take place for classes 9 to 12 as well. “This is a great advantage for students and will definitely reduce their stress level since a lot of uncertainty hinged on the final board exam last year. Having a two-term pattern with two exams will ensure that students do not neglect the NCERT curriculum and stay committed to preparing through the year,” said C. Satish, Director-General, ABS Group of Schools. The board has said the first term exam would be a 90-minute paper with MCQs which will test them on 50% of the syllabus. “While the exam pattern is a new one, students are comfortable tackling MCQ and they feature prominently in several competitive exams. The move to have two term exams shows the preparedness of the CBSE to face possible disruptions that might arise owing to the pandemic,” said Ashok Shankar, General Secretary, CBSE Schools Management Association. Mr. Ashok pointed out that the board’s instructions include creating a student profile for all the assessments undertaken through the year and retaining the evidence in digital format which will ensure that there is some level of scrutiny and monitoring of how schools implement these changes. Srinivasa Raghavan, principal, Bala Vidya Mandir, said they greatly appreciated the move to have two exams for students of classes 10 and 12. “Owing to the pandemic and uncertainty, a change in the term and assessment process was necessary. I personally think that students of classes 9 and 11 too would benefit if this is extended to them,” he said. Last year, the CBSE had announced a 30% rationalisation of syllabus and for the current academic year, the rationalised term-wise divided syllabus as well as guidelines for internal assessments will be released soon. State Board schools Teachers from State Board schools meanwhile have been awaiting an announcement about the syllabus for the current academic year. Last year, the State government had reduced the syllabus by nearly 40% for students of senior classes. “Rationalising the syllabus as well as bringing in a two-term system would greatly help our students as well since the syllabus for senior students is lengthy and heavy,” said K.P.O. Suresh, president, Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Federation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cbses-move-on-class-12-exam-welcomed/article35182321.ece

Kargil Nagar is populated with low-income groups, and has been suffering due to poor civic infrastructure on all fronts, especially when it comes to dealing with rainwater stagnation. Its residents faced severe hardship during the December 2015 deluge, and were forced to vacate their houses for more than a month. As part of a flood mitigation project, the civic body included Kargil Nagar in the construction of a drain network. A senior Corporation official said the integrated storm water drain was being built at a cost of Rs. 142 crore. The 32.66 km project, once completed, would help find a solution to water stagnation, he added. The civic body is planning to construct storm water drains in all the streets and link the drain network to the Buckingham Canal. However, as this locality is on a lower level than Buckingham Canal, the civic body would be commissioning a shutter and a heavy-duty motor to pump out the water. Low-lying area The topography of Kargil Nagar was low when compared to the Buckingham Canal, to which the drain network would be linked. To prevent reverse flow from Buckingham Canal in case of heavy rain, the civic body would close the shutter in the collection point of the storm water drain and pump the rainwater into the canal using a 240 horsepower motor, the official said. The Corporation is building the storm water drain as part of the Kosasthalaiyar basin project, and will complete the work in 36 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-begins-work-on-stormwater-drain-in-kargil-nagar/article35182336.ece

Ravikumar on Tuesday said that 26 castes listed in the Backward Class lists and the Denotified Communities list in Tamil Nadu have been left out in the Union Government’s Other Backward Castes list. He urged the State government to ensure that their right to reservation is protected by getting these castes included in the OBC list. In a letter to the State Backward Classes Welfare Minister S.S. Sivasankar, Mr. Ravikumar pointed out that a number of castes listed in the Backward Caste list and the DNC list are missing in the Central OBC list. “Servai, Ansar, Ayira Vaisyar, Chaudhury, Kallar Kula Thondaman, Kannadinaidu, Karpoora Chettiar, Kasukkara Chettiar, Kongu Vaishnava, Kudikara Vellalar, Kuka Vellalar, Moondru Mandala 84 Oor Sozhiya Vellalar, Ootru Vala Naattu Velalar, OPS Vellalar, Paiyyur Koatta velalar, Kaththi Kaarar (Kanniyakumari district), Podikara Velalar, Pooluva Gounder, Reddy (Kanjam) Sheikh, Sundaram Chetty, Syed, Ukkirakula Kshathriya Nayakkar, Urikkara Nayakkar and Velar in the Backward Caste list and Servai (Tiruchi, Karur, Perambalur, Pudhukittai districts) listed in the DNC list are missing from the Union Government’s OBC list,” he said. Citing the example of Amrithavarshini, who belongs to Ayira Vaisyar community and had applied for a fashion technology course, Mr. Ravikumar said, “Aayira Vaisiyar is listed in Tamil Nadu’s Backward Class list. However, it is not featured in the Union government’s list. If it had been in the Union government’s OBC list, she would have secured 1,991 rank in the list. But, now, she has secured 10,528 in the rank list and has lost the chance to join the course.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/add-26-castes-to-centres-obc-list-vkc-urges-govt/article35182328.ece

While only 490 new units were launched in the market during the April-June quarter of 2021, 709 homes were sold during the three-month period, shows a report titled ‘Real Insight (Residential)-April-June (Q2) 2021’, a quarterly analysis of India’s eight prime residential markets by online real estate company PropTiger.com. In the second quarter, places like Porur, Siruseri, Tiruvallur, Pallikaranai and East Tambaram saw the maximum new supply. A majority of the new launches were concentrated in the less than Rs. 45 lakh price bracket, which accounted for 84% of the launches, showed the report. Of the total sales, 40% were concentrated in the Rs. 45 lakh to Rs. 75 lakh price bracket. Homebuyers preferred areas like Pallikaranai, Pallavaram, Perumbakkam and Padur in Chennai south and Mogappair in Chennai west. “While the impact remained largely the same on most markets, some were more vulnerable to the second wave of the pandemic because of being at the centre stage of activity. These markets will take longer to recover from the current shock,” said Mani Rangarajan, group chief operating officer of PropTiger.com. Unsold inventory in Chennai, which stood at 37,478, saw a marginal increase of 3% year-on-year in Q2 2021 due to muted launches, coupled with stagnant sales velocity. It stood at 37,697 units in the first quarter of 2021. According to the report, developers will take approximately 42 months to liquidate the current stock compared with 36 months in the same period the previous year.  While the impact remained largely the same on most markets, some were more vulnerable to the second wave because of being at the centrestage of activity Mani Rangarajan Group chief operating officer, PropTiger.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-hits-housing-market/article35182325.ece
07 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Southern Railway to install CCTV at 93 stations under Nirbhaya Fund||The Southern Railway will provide Integrated Emergency Response Management System (Video Surveillance System) at 93 stations under the Nirbhaya Fund. After the Railway Board asked general managers of all Zonal Railways to take a call on the installation of CCTV at railway stations, Southern Railway has floated tenders for providing the facility at these stations as part of measures to enhance passenger safety, particularly women. In a note issued in February this year, the Railway Board said the VSS project at 983 stations (across the country) under Nirbhaya Fund was entrusted to RailTel for execution in 2016. On the request of East Central Railway, South Eastern Railways, East Coast Railway, and Northeast Frontier Railway, the VSS project was assigned to the respective railways. As regards providing VSS in the remaining stations under Nirbhaya Fund, the matter came up for discussion during a meeting on Parliamentary Assurance in the Railway Board on January 16, 2021, and it was decided that General Managers of all zones may be advised to take a call whether they wanted to get the work of provision of CCTV executed at zonal-level itself or otherwise. "If they decide to execute the work at zonal-level and submit a request to Railway Board in this regard, the work of provision of CCTV in the respective zone may be taken away from M/s RailTel and transferred to the concerned zones along with requisite fund," the note said. While 136 stations were targeted for providing VSS, RailTel made the provision at only 43 stations under the Nirbhaya Fund. Asked if Southern Railway decided to install the CCTV on its own taking away the work from RailTel, Chief Public Relations Officer B. Guganesan said “Yes, at the remaining 93 stations, VSS work is being implemented by the Zonal Railway.” Apart from the Nirbhaya Fund, VSS work was sanctioned for 441 stations in Southern Railway in a Memorandum of Understanding dated June 25, 2020, and the work was handed over to RailTel by the Railway Board, Mr. Guganesan added. CCTV project was being executed by Indian Railways and RailTel and work was completed in 813 major stations while it was in progress at 47 more stations. A total of 756 stations were targeted to be provided with IP-based CCTV by the end of 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/southern-railway-to-install-cctv-cameras-at-93-stations-under-nirbhaya-fund/article35182308.ece

07 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Aavin asks KYC details without giving prior notice||Aavin has asked consumers to submit Know Your Customer (KYC) details to create a database of monthly card holders However, the move comes without any prior notice and consumers say they are curtly being told by staff at their respective zonal offices that they will get to renew their cards only if they submit their KYC details. Card renewal is done during the first half of the month at zonal offices, which in some cases are over 5 km away. Indira, a consumer, said it was unfair of Aavin to spring such an unpleasant surprise on them. “Due to the pandemic, we have not been able to renew at the local depots for over a year now and have to go to the zonal office. We are senior citizens and I am afraid to step out. We have asked our milk supplier to renew it for us,” she said. V. Devarajan, a consumer from Pallavaram, said, “They must remember that many are loyal customers, who do not switch brands, and have been paying advance amounts for several years. There are customers who have been with Aavin for over 30 years even. A month’s time can be given to submit these forms.” A milk supplier said though there was a list of ID proofs listed by Aavin, people were hesitant to provide them, questioning the safety of the data. “Recently, the data of the public distribution system was stolen. This is not the first time consumers have been asked to provide data. In the past decade, at least five attempts have been made,” he said. A retired official of Aavin said such a tough stance was not good for the milk major when competition is tough. “There are apps that provide milk at discounted rates. Aavin can provide an online link on its website and ask people to update. They could also provide an app that can be used to update KYC data,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aavin-asks-kyc-details-without-giving-prior-notice/article35182331.ece

Radhakrishnan, will meet the Union Health Minister in New Delhi on July 9 and discuss the issues of COVID-19 vaccine supplies and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Madurai, project. The Minister told reporters on Tuesday that at present, there was no vaccine stock in the State. The demand was high owing to more awareness, while vaccination of construction workers, sportspersons, persons with disabilities, mediapersons and pregnant and lactating women began across the State. Referring to BJP State president L. Murugan’s demand for a White Paper on the doses supplied, utilised and wasted, Mr. Subramanian said the government had been giving details of supply and utilisation every day. “Tamil Nadu paid Rs. 99.84 crore and procured 29,92,000 doses directly. This apart, the Centre has supplied 1,57,76,550 doses till now. Vaccines were wasted during the previous government... Before May, at least 3.5 lakh-4 lakh doses were wasted,” he said. While the total supplied doses were 1,57,76,550, the State had so far administered 1,58,78,600 doses, he said. “We have 63,460 doses at hand, including for the vaccination of mediapersons today [on Tuesday]. How did we manage to administer nearly 1.75 lakh more doses after overcoming the wastage? Around 10-12 persons can be vaccinated with a vial. If only four persons come for vaccination and a vial is opened, the remaining doses are wasted... This was how nearly four lakh doses were wasted earlier. Now we take into account the number of persons waiting and open the vial accordingly. By streamlining, we have avoided wastage,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/subramanian-to-meet-union-minister-on-friday/article35182294.ece

Last week, Sanam Shetty lodged a complaint with the Thiruvanmiyur police about abusive messages and threats to her on social media. She has acted in more than 20 films in southern languages and shot into the limelight after her participation in Tamil Bigg Boss 4 . She has been active in sharing her photos on social media. After investigation into her complaint, personnel of the Cyber Crime Cell traced the accused who was identified as Roy John Paul, a college student.

It also decided to order a probe into the loss of revenue caused to the public exchequer by not conducting court cases properly due to “largescale collusion” between government officials and traders. Justice S.M. Subramaniam passed the orders after being satisfied that State tax officer D. Mukundhan suppressed vital facts during the hearing of cases seeking tax exemption on sales turnover of intraocular lenses. He directed the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes to suspend the officer immediately and produce a copy of the suspension order. He ordered that proceedings must be initiated under the Tamil Nadu Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955 for misconduct, committing an act unbecoming of a government servant and dereliction of duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-suspension-of-tax-official/article35182334.ece

07 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Government schools adopt novel ways to boost admissions||With admissions for the academic year 2021-22 under way in schools, some government schools in Coimbatore district have come up with innovative ways to advertise the facilities available in their institutions in an effort to boost enrolment. Teachers from the Government Higher Secondary School at Vadachithur, near Kinathukadavu, prepared an audio message that runs for nearly five minutes to circulate on social media platforms such as WhatsApp. The audio message describes the facilities available such as English and Tamil medium classes, ‘smart class’ for classes 6 and above, computer laboratory, library and clean restrooms. “Government schools are not the symbol of poverty; it is the symbol of our pride,” proclaims the audio message. “Many are still under the impression that only private schools have the facilities [for the students]. Hence, we wanted to communicate all the facilities available in our school to the public,” said B. Senthilkumar, a Commerce teacher from the school who was involved in making the audio message. As per the directions of the school’s headmistress S. Bhuvaneshwari, the teachers also plan to hire an auto rickshaw and play this audio message via speakers to the residents of the nearly 20 villages surrounding the school, he said. With around 750 students already studying in the school, Mr. Senthilkumar expressed hope that the number of new admissions in his school would increase this year, as many parents are choosing government schools over private schools following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their livelihoods. Meanwhile, the Government Higher Secondary School at Othakkalmandapam has unveiled a ‘digital pamphlet’ for Class 11 admissions. Apart from listing the facilities available , the brochure comes with a QR code that takes the applicant to the school’s own website (www.ghssokm.in), where a digital application form is available. The school’s headmaster G. Ramesh said that copies of this digital pamphlet have been circulated among the school’s alumni via WhatsApp to reach potential applicants. “So far, we have completed 224 admissions for Plus One,” he said. Apart from the website, the school also has its own YouTube channel, where videos of its alumni talking about their experiences in the school have been uploaded, Mr. Ramesh noted. Established in 1968, the Government Higher Secondary School, Othakkalmandapam, now has a student strength of 1,030. Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer M. Ramakrishnan said these government schools and other schools that take up similar initiatives have been doing it out of their own interest and have been utilising the digital platforms well to reach out to parents and students for admissions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-schools-adopt-novel-ways-to-boost-admissions/article35182342.ece

07 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. finalises zoo development proposal, awaits CZA nod||The Coimbatore Corporation has finalised the proposal to develop the VOC Park Zoo on a 35.26-acre plot and submitted it to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) for approval. The proposed zoo would include the existing premises, the VOC Park and the Corporation’s land abutting the Coimbatore Central Prison complex, said sources familiar with the development. The Corporation was likely to give the Tamil Nadu Sports Development Authority the land currently used for basketball and volleyball instead of the VOC Park. The Authority had sought 5.6 acre from the civic body for constructing an indoor stadium, near the Nehru Stadium. The Corporation’s earlier proposal was to handover the VOC Park, but the civic body appeared to have reconsidered its decision and instead give the two basketball and volleyball ground, which together were spread over 6 acre, more than what the Authority had asked for, the sources said and added that to finalise the decision, Collector G.S. Sameeran and Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara had visited the Nehru Stadium, VOC Park, VOC Park Zoo and places nearby. The sources said the Corporation’s proposed zoo would be spread over 35.26 acre – 26.63 acre abutting the Prison complex, north of the Park Gate Road and 8.63 acre encompassing the present zoo and VOC Park. The land identified was much more than what the CZA had fixed for a medium zoo, said the sources. The new zoo would come under the medium zoo classification with amenities that matched those of big zoos. The Corporation’s plan for the zoo also integrated Semmozhi Poonga proposal, a plan kept in cold storage in the last 10 years. The then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi had announced the development of the Semmozhi Poonga at the Prison ground after the State government in 2010 had conducted the World Classical Tamil Conference. The medium zoo, planned at over Rs. 80 crore, could see the return of lion, other wild cats and exotic animals that were once in the city zoo, but had to be shifted for want of space. The officials’ visit and the Corporation’s revised proposal for the Zoo’s development had revived hopes of the city having a well-developed zoo, a dream remaining unfulfilled for over a decade, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-finalises-zoo-development-proposal-awaits-cza-nod/article35182347.ece

A senior official of the Tangedco here said the physical assessment of electricity consumption charges (meter reading) resumed from the mid of last month, when the lockdown restrictions were relaxed. The official also clarified that for consumers who had the assessment due after June 15, the Tangedco personnel were visiting their premises. Many consumers who had the assessment due in May or the first two weeks of June were asked to pay the charges that they paid during the corresponding period last year. If this amount was more than the consumption during the current period, the excess amount would be adjusted based on the consumption charges assessment that would be done in the coming weeks/months. Further, some consumers were asked to pay the additional security deposit this month. The official explained that the deposit collection was stopped during the lockdown period and resumed last month. If the consumption had increased and the amount was higher than the six month average already deposited with Tangedco, they would be paying the excess amount now. This was not for all consumers and was collected only from those who had excess consumption, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-resumes-door-to-door-visit-for-meter-reading/article35182350.ece
07 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore dt. achieves negative vaccine wastage as health workers find ‘extra dose’||The wastage of COVID-19 vaccines while administering doses to beneficiaries was about 4 % when the vaccination drive started in the district. With high demand for vaccines and skilful administration of doses available in each vial, the district has achieved ‘negative wastage’, according to the Health Department. An official in charge of the vaccination programme said the district was seeing negative wastage in the last one to two months as the health workers were able to tap the ‘extra dose’ available in vials. “Wastage occurred in the initial stages of the vaccination drives when people did not turn up as expected. Now the demand is on the higher side and there is no wastage,” said S. Senthil Kumar, Deputy Director of Health Services. The wastage factor was calculated by comparing the total vials utilised with the total number of doses administered, he said. COVID-19 vaccines available for use in the country are coming in multi-dose vials and they are advised to be used within four hours after opening. They also lack a vaccine vial monitor, a heat-sensitive material on the label which registers cumulative heat exposure over time. Due to the general practice of filling extra vaccine in vials, which is known as overfill, a vial of 5 ml will contain more than 5 ml of vaccine. A skilled health worker will be able to draw more than 10 doses of .5 ml each from a vial, depending on the overfill volume. “We were allotted vials for 100 doses on Tuesday. But the staff were able to vaccinate 128 people by utilising the maximum out of the overfill which varies from vial to vial,” said S. Cheralathan, Chief Medical Officer of Government Hospital, Periyanaickenpalayam. He pointed out that the syringes used for vaccination, .5ml syringe with short needle, reduced the dead space - volume of vaccine retained in the syringe after administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-dt-achieves-negative-vaccine-wastage-as-health-workers-find-extra-dose/article35182356.ece

07 July 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||Hike in water charges by Hosur Corpn. opposed||The Krishnagiri District Residents Welfare Association has objected to the hike in water charges by the Hosur Corporation. The Corporation has raised the minimum water tariff for residential connections to Rs. 125 per 6,000 litres, from the earlier rate of Rs. 40. The hike ,announced in November, 2020, is being implemented after being put on hold owing to opposition. The slabs are: Rs. 125 per 6,000 litres, Rs. 150 for 6,000 ltr to 10,000 ltr, Rs. 200 from 10,000 ltr to 20,000 ltr and Rs. 250 for above 20,000 ltr. For commercial connections, the hike is Rs. 500 per 10,000 ltr, Rs. 600 for 10,000 to 20,000 ltr, Rs. 700 for 20,000 ltr to 50,000 ltr, and Rs. 800 for above 50,000 ltr. Responding to the Hosur All Residents Welfare Associations in a letter in May this year, the Corporation Commissioner had stated that the hike was in consonance with the rates in other major Corporations. The tariff was Rs. 40 since 1997 and the hike after 24 years was necessitated by the input costs for sinking of bore wells and exploration of water sources. Further, the Hogenakkal water distribution scheme cost was much higher for the Corporation that was purchasing water from the Tamil Water Supply And Drainage Board. The association contested the letter by pointing out that the Coimbatore Corporation charged only Rs. 100 for up to 15,000 litres per month. It also said that the high rates fixed by the Hosur Corporation’s tariff was only in anticipation of future costs. Further, with a majority of the households yet to have water meters, and being supplied water only once a week or 10 days, an assumed quantum of supply would be arbitrary, it said. The association wanted the civic body to protect its water distribution assets, contain wastage through pipelines and check unregulated drawing of groundwater by private packaged water distribution units.

Superintendent of Police Ziaul Haque distributed six cameras to patrol teams in three police sub-divisions in the district. “We will get more cameras for police personnel in the remaining stations in the second phase,” he said. The personnel were trained to operate the cameras, and they will be mostly used to monitor major protests and during mass vehicle checks. Police personnel deployed at major junctions would wear these cameras, he added. Mr. Haque said the initiative would bring in more accountability, responsibility and transparency. The cameras will record high-resolution audio-visuals that will be stored on a memory card. The recorded footage may also be seen live from the police control room. The device will avoid confrontation between the police and motorists stopped for violation of traffic rules. “The conversations between both parties will be recorded. The footage will also act as evidence in incidents involving altercations or assaults to deter public servants from discharging their duties,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kallakurichi-police-personnel-provided-with-body-cameras/article35182721.ece
07 July 2021||KARAIKAL,TAMIL NADU||Karaikal-Jaffna ferry service expected to boost tourism||The proposed Karaikal-Jaffna Ferry Service, a component of the Sagarmala Programme of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways for the promotion of coastal shipping, has evidently been given a thrust by the Indian and Sri Lankan governments. Last week, Doraisamy Venkateshwaran, Deputy High Commissioner, Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission, Chennai, visited the MARG Port here to determine the facilities for the ferry service, covering a distance of 56 nautical miles. He held discussions with the Karaikal District Collector Arjun Sharma. Rajeshwar Reddy, Vice-president of port operations, MARG Karaikal Port, said the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commissioner inspected the facilities for start of the service. According to official sources, the service is will be implemented on a private-public partnership mode, with the MARG Karaikal Port acting as a facilitator. Availability of facilities, such as exclusive berth for passenger service at the Port, passenger terminal facilities with requisite amenities suiting Immigration and Customs authorities, uninterrupted power and parking facility, were assessed for the introduction of the ferry service, sources said. Last year, Union Minister for Shipping In-Charge held discussions with the Puducherry government for starting the ferry service between Karaikal Port and Kankesanthurai (KKS) Port in Jaffna, to derive the outcomes of reduced travel time, easy and cheap travel alternative, enhanced economic activities between the two countries and smooth connectivity for the pilgrims of both countries. Dredging work at the KKS Harbour was undertaken and completed by the Dredging Corporation of India, a public sector undertaking of the Indian government, to support domestic and regional commerce. The ferry service will, for sure, strengthen cultural, religious and economic links, A. Muthaiya, president of Karaikal Chamber of Commerce, said. “We only hope the service is started at the earliest,” he added. Religious tourism “Religious tourism will receive a thrust since many from the island nation will visit the famous temples in the Nagapattinam-Karaikal belt,” V.R. Dhanaseelane, president of Karaikal District Citizens’ Welfare Association, said. According to tourism and travel industry representatives in Karaikal, pilgrims from Sri Lanka will have easy access to Velankanni church, Nagore dargah, Tirunallar Sri Saneeswaran temple and other places of religious importance in the delta districts. Pilgrims from Tamil Nadu would be keen on visiting two prominent Hindu places of worship — the Keerimalai Naguleswaram temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the Maviddapuram Kandaswamy temple, dedicated to Lord Murugan, a travel operator said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karaikal-jaffna-ferry-service-expected-to-boost-tourism/article35182330.ece
07 July 2021||Krishnagiri,TAMIL NADU||Government focussing on enhancing financial support for women: Minister||Minister for Social Welfare and Women Empowerment Geetha Jeevan has said that the State government is focussing on enhancing financial support for women. Speaking at a function to distribute welfare assistance to the tune of Rs. 3.20 crore to women beneficiaries under the aegis of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Women Empowerment here on Tuesday, the Minister said steps were being taken to provide income support to families headed by women. Ms. Geetha Jeevan said with the State government announcing cash relief of Rs. 2,000 for transgenders during the pandemic, about 254 transgenders in Krishnagiri district would receive Rs. 2,000 directly credited to their bank accounts. About 510 women from 10 panchayat union were issued with marriage assistance worth Rs. 1.27 crore and marriage gold totalling 4080 grams at a cumulative cost of Rs. 1.92 crore. Earlier, the Minister also inspected the Integrated Women’s Service Centre at the government headquarters hospital and interacted with the officials. The Minister speaking on the sidelines of the function, said the marriage assistance scheme was put in the back-burner for lack of funds during the last three years by the previous AIADMK government. It has been revived on order from the Chief Minister, she said. The Minister said the marriage assistance scheme was first implemented in 1989 under the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. The scheme that began with Rs. 5,000 as marriage assistance was increased to Rs. 25,000 in 2009. Later, during the previous government, gold for marriage was introduced with four grams and later increased to eight grams. However, no funds were released to implement the scheme. Over three lakh petitions were pending before the government. The Chief Minister directed the immediate release of funds to the beneficiaries, Ms. Jeevan said. Earlier, in Dharmapuri, the Minister disbursed welfare benefits to the tune of Rs. 80.64 lakh to 150 beneficiaries. Incidentally, all AIADMK MLAs, including former Minister K.P. Anbalagan shared the stage with the Minister, where the marriage assistance was distributed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-focussing-on-enhancing-financial-support-for-women-minister/article35182461.ece
07 July 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Move to clear water channels for an ‘Ezhilmigu Madurai’||The Madurai Corporation has proposed to remove garbage lying in water channels for years together on a daily basis by deploying its conservancy team and machines in a big way across the four zones. Between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. daily, the teams would clear the water channels. The campaign, with the theme, Ezhilmigu Madurai, will be undertaken in one ward a day in each of the four zones. On day one, the civic authorities had chosen S Alangulam (Ward 4 in zone 1), Tirupalai (Ward 24, zone 2), Nelpettai (ward 50 zone 3) and Melavasal (ward 81, zone 4) for the mass cleaning activity. By deploying a little over 1,000 conservancy workers and providing them with tipper lorries, tractors, JCBs, mini-robot and fogging machines, the water channels will be cleared of sludge, garbage and debris. The objective is to ensure that every nook and corner of Madurai is clean in all aspects, officials said. Inaugurating the activity at Melavasal near Periyar bus stand, Finance Minister P. T. R. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said that the residents should be educated to keep the environment clean. The habit of dumping garbage on roads should be stopped forthwith. The residents should have the responsibility to use dumper bins. There had not been such cleaning activity over the last 10 years in the city, which posed health hazards to those who lived in unhygienic environments. The initiative of the civic authorities to clean up the channels was welcome. But, the people also should be responsible and ensure that the channels and underground drainage system were free from encroachments, the Minister said. Collector Aneesh Shekhar said that the mass cleaning also helps in preventing diseases like dengue. The drainage channels should not be used as a dump. Corporation Commissioner K. P. Karthikeyan said that senior officers in the Corporation had been entrusted with the task of supervising the mass cleaning activity and the public can share about specific locations which require such cleaning. The waste lifted from such mass cleaning would be transported to Vellakal at night and segregated for safe disposal, officials said. Eco-activists said that the civic authorities may explore the possibility of engaging the residents welfare association office-bearers in the wards concerned to assist in the campaign as volunteers.

Justice G. R. Swaminathan ordered notice in the contempt petition filed by S. Bhagyalakshmi of Madurai. She had earlier filed a writ petition before the court seeking a direction to restrain the State from allotting industrial and commercial plots in the SIDCO Industrial Estate in Kappalur. She had complained that there was political interference in the allotment process and it was not transparent. She sought a direction to declare the action of TANSIDCO in allotting plots to applications on outright sale basis dehors the procedure of plot allotment, as illegal. In her contempt petition, she pointed out that the authorities had stated before the court that the allotment orders in favour of the selected candidates were despatched on February 26. But they were despatched by registered post only on March 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-orders-statutory-notice-in-contempt-petition/article35182628.ece
07 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC moots web portal to keep tabs on detenu representations||Taking note of the fact that delays in considering the representations of the detenus were purposely made to get the detention order quashed by the court on technical grounds, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has mooted setting up of a dedicated web portal for the purpose of monitoring the representations. A Division Bench of Justices K. Kalyanasundaram and B. Pugalendhi observed that time and again the court had reminded authorities that though the detention orders were passed, most of them failed because of the delay in considering the representations. When such technical grounds were raised, courts were left with no option, but to grant the relief. Every detention order passed by detaining authority had to be approved by the government. The government approves the order of detention based on the materials placed before it and the basic materials for any detention order would be available with the government, the court observed. If at all any clarification was required from the authorities concerned on the representation submitted by the detenu, then it could be collected in no time through e-mail or fax from such authorities. Even then, there is an inordinate delay in considering the representation of the detenus. In fact, in some cases, the delay is artificially created to favour the detenu. With advancement in technology and in today's scientific world, several modes of communication are available, such as e-mail, fax, WhatsApp., etc, which can be best used. A dedicated web-portal has to be established so that every movement of the representation can be monitored. The judges said this delay in considering the representation can be avoided. We hope and trust that the authorities concerned would take necessary action in this regard. The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by one Machakalai of Madurai who sought to quash his son’s detention order. He was accused of an offence under the NDPS Act. The petitioner pointed out that there was a delay in considering the representation of the detenu and on this ground alone, the order of detention should be quashed. The court quashed the detention order and set at liberty the petitioner’s son Raguvaran unless his detention was required in any other case. He was confined in Madurai Central Prison.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-moots-web-portal-to-keep-tabs-on-detenu-representations/article35182435.ece
07 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||How Revathi raced against the odds||She used to practise sprinting barefoot because she could not afford shoes. But sheer determination helped V. Revathi of Madurai qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. At the camp for Olympics-bound athletes in Patiala on Sunday, Ms. Revathi was selected to represent India in the 4 x 400 m mixed relay event. She clocked 53.55 seconds and stood first in the 400 mrun. Her nearest competitor took 54.25 seconds. “It’s a dream come true more for my coach Kannan,” Ms. Revathi told The Hindu from Patiala, where she has been practising for the last two years. Having lost her parents at a young age, Ms. Revathi and her younger sister were brought up by their maternal grandmother Arammal, a farmhand. Amid the poverty that surrounded them, she ensured that they remained in school all these years even when she had to carry bricks in kilns during droughts. “Our relatives asked my grandma to send us to work so that she could rest at home. But she refused,” Ms. Revathi recalled. Free training It was Mr. Kannan, the coach at the Sports Development Authority stadium at Race Course, who identified the natural athlete in Ms. Revathi and trained her. When he offered free training at Race Course, she refused. “I could not afford Rs. 40 every day to commute by bus between my home and the stadium and declined the offer. But he got me a free seat and hostel accommodation at the nearby Lady Doak College. It was Kannan Sir who dreamt that I could make it to the Olympics, provided I worked hard,” she said. Mr. Kannan also financially helped the family; he helped her sister get a job in the police department, Ms. Arammal recalled. “But for my coach, I would have ended up working in an unit making springs for motorbikes,” Ms. Revathi said. When she was at the camp, the Railways offered her a job in August last.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/how-revathi-raced-against-the-odds/article35182307.ece

The Rs. 320 crore project envisages moving the Assembly to a newly-built multi-storied complex on a 14-acre site in Thattanchavady.  Fast-tracking project After chairing a meeting with Minister A.

07 July 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Courtallam looks dull sans visitors||Courtallam, which usually overflows with tourists visiting this town on the lap of the Western Ghats during this time to enjoy a bath in the waterfalls, now looks like a ghost town owing to the impact of COVID-19 and the lockdown.  As the south-west monsoon begins in June to drench the Western Ghats, the waterfalls – Main Falls, Five Falls, Old Courtallam Falls and small and cute Tiger Falls - would become ‘alive’ with gushing water attracting tourists from various parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Since the salubrious climate intertwined with intermittent drizzle and breeze would just be mesmerizing, the ‘annual season’ of Courtallam would draw lakhs of people. These tourists would ensure livelihood to over a lakh people. A conservative estimate reveals that Courtallam and nearby areas such as Tenkasi, Kasimajorpuram, Vallam, Piranoor Border, Shencottai and Puliyarai house more than 200 lodges and hotels. Besides, houses in and around Courtallam are taken on lease by contractors to convert them into guest houses to receive tourists coming in small groups to enjoy the season between June and August. Hotels, lodges and restaurants, which would become fresh with new coat of paint and minting money during this period are gathering dust now. Fruit stalls, all selling fruits endemic to this region like ramtan, mangusteen and other fruits like mango and jack fruit remain closed. A few hundred vendors would sell fruits in bikes and bicycles also. “All of them have lost their revenue due to the lockdown. Last year, after the lockdown came into force, some of us moved to Tenkasi to have roadside shops along Madurai Road. While we faced problems from the police, the lack of floating population, the tourists, made our attempt a failure and we suffered hefty loss. This situation continues this year also,” says N. Murugan, a fruit trader from Courtallam. Those who have taken on lease 200 shops of Courtallam Town Panchayat and Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment have suffered hefty loss. Those who used to sell thousands of chicken to hotels in Coutallam every week during the season did not stock birds this year. “Since the lockdown clamped in March 2020 is yet to go, the ban on tourists intending to visit Courtallam stays and those who earn something through their tireless hard work during this part of the year are now fish out of water. While most of the jobless auto drivers are now construction workers, those who were working in lodges, hotels and restaurants have moved out of the town in search of some menial jobs,” says Senthurpandian, a trader and BJP functionary from Courtallam. A section of traders, who have paid the lease amount to the Courtallam Town Panchayat and the Department of HR and CE for the shops, held talks with the officials on reducing or waiving the lease amount this year as they had suffered hefty loss last year. As the officials could not take a decision on their own, they have now approached the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court. “We lost the revenue during Courtallam season and the Sabarimala season last year as the devotees used to drop at Courtallam while on their way to the hilly shrine. We’re staring at similar situation again. We don’t know what is in store as the government, which has relaxed the lockdown. If the tourists are allowed to take bath in the waterfalls in a regulated manner, it will at least keep us afloat. Else, we’ll drown in the debt,” says Mr. Senthurpandian.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/courtallam-looks-dull-sans-visitors/article35182431.ece

07 July 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Kanniyakumari – Nagapattinam Highway to become four-lane||This is really good news for the trading community of this coastal town sending consignments to Thiruvananthapuram and Chennai as the existing 2-lane highway between Kanniyakumari and Nagapattinam is going to be upgraded into four-lane by National Highways Authority of India. Since this is going to be the first phase, the remaining section between Nagapattinam and Chennai will also eventually become four-lane.This new lane will considerably reduce the traffic between Kanniyakumari and Chennai via Madurai and Tiruchi. Duration of journey between Kanniyakumari and the Velankanni will come down as the proposed thoroughfare will provide hassle-free passage for vehicles, now encountering a few dozen speed-breakers while crossing the villages en-route. The only ‘nagging issue’ is that the NHAI, after completing this thoroughfare will certainly collect toll for every 60 km. Chairing a meeting held here on Tuesday, Collector K. Senthil Raj said the existing two-lane East Coast Road would become the four-lane highway to get the number ‘National Highways 32’. It would be formed between Kanniyakumari and Nagapattinam as four-lane highway in the first phase to become a boon to Thoothukudi residents, especially the traders as it would make the travel faster between Thoothukudi and Thiruvananthapuram in the other direction also as formation of four-lane between Kanniyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram had already been initiated. In the meeting held on Tuesday, he discussed the formation of four-lane between Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari via Tiruchendur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kanniyakumari-nagapattinam-highway-to-have-four-lanes/article35182632.ece

07 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||AAI team arrives to install upgraded ILS||A technical team from Radio Construction and Development Unit of Airports Authority of India, New Delhi, arrived here on Tuesday to install a new and upgraded Instrument Landing System (ILS) at Tiruchi international airport. The nine-member team is headed by a senior official in the rank of Assistant General Manager of the unit, whose functional responsibility includes installation and commissioning of communication and navigational systems. The team will start work from Wednesday to replace the existing ILS with a new and upgraded system that will aid in smoother landing of flights at the airport, said Airport Director, Tiruchi, S. Dharmaraj. With civil and electrical works connected with the project having been completed, the major task now is installation of the upgraded system comprising a set of 16 localiser antennae instead of the existing 12. To recap, the new set of localiser antennae, which has been procured, will be installed on a new concrete platform constructed as part of the ILS project on the end of Runway 27 adjoining Tiruchi-Pudukottai national highway. The glide path — another component of the ILS — will come up on the end of Runway 09 towards the Nathamadipatti side. Post-installation of the new system, flight calibration tests will be conducted ahead of its commissioning, Mr. Dharmaraj said. A flight calibration team will arrive at the airport to carry out the tests jointly with the Radio Construction and Development Unit team. Also, approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation will be obtained prior to commissioning. The plan is to complete the entire project by July-end, Mr. Dharmaraj.added. The new ILS system is coming up at the non-metro Tiruchi airport at a cost of Rs. 3.5 crore. The project, originally planned to be completed by March, has got delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic. The last year has seen only non-scheduled flights in operation at the airport. Flights were operated by Air India Express under Vande Bharat Mission and Air Bubble agreement only. The passenger footfall recorded at the airport during April 2020 to May 2021 was a little over four lakh, said airport sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aai-team-arrives-to-install-upgraded-ils/article35182426.ece
07 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Poor maintenance of public parks irks Tiruchi residents||Though city residents, especially morning walkers, heaved a sigh of relief with the reopening of public parks and roadside gyms in the city after a gap of nearly two months, poor maintenance and upkeep of the facilities has disappointed many residents. According to sources, the city has about 125 public parks including science parks, roadside gyms and walking tracks. Eighty parks of them were developed at different places including Cantonment, Airport, East Boulevard Road, M.M. Nagar, Shanmuga Nagar, Yogalakshmi Nagar in Srirangam, Babu Road, Crawford, Woraiyur, K.K. Nagar, Ayyappa Nagar, Mahalakshmi Nagar and Thennur during the last four to five years. Most of them boast of excellent infrastructure including green lawns, playing equipment for children such as swings, slides, sea-saws, climbers, merry-go-round, pedestrian pathways, open-air auditorium and leisure benches. While a section of them were developed with the funding of Smart City Initiative, several others were established under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Most of the parks, which had been closed since May 10 due to the spread of COVID-19 virus, were opened for the public on Monday. But, residents complain that many of them were not maintained properly for the last two months. Plants, grasses and climbers have been grown extensively, thereby suggesting that they have not been trimmed for long. In some sports, shrubs have grown unchecked. Garbage is strewn in many parks. Most of the fountains in the parks have no water. Similarly, toilets have also not been properly maintained. There were complaints that except for the parks situated in prominent places, several parks in remote areas had not been opened yet. It is said that morning walkers, who resumed walking on the walking paths on Monday, had encountered snakes in some parks. Shaken over this, some of them went on to lodge complaints with Tiruchi Corporation. “It is unfortunate that parks have been reopened to the public without maintenance. The authorities should have at least carried out a cleaning exercise before opening them for the public,” says P. Janardhanan of Bheema Nagar, a regular visitor to the Science Park at Anna Nagar.  S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu that he had received complaints about the maintenance of public parks. They would be looked into immediately. The Corporation was open to the idea of resident welfare associations taking over the operation and maintenance of the public parks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-maintenance-of-parks-irks-residents/article35182423.ece

07 July 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Redeem poll promise’||The Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam has urged the State government to procure paddy at Rs. 2,500 a quintal, an election promise given by DMK. Talking to reporters at Mannargudi on Tuesday, association general secretary P.R. Pandian called upon Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to fulfil the election promise since farmers, who suffered crop loss in the last samba / thaladi season, eagerly awaited implementation of the poll assurance. Ccrop insurance companies were yet to release any statement regarding the quantum of compensation to be disbursed to farmers who insured their s amba/thaladi crop last season. The State government, on its part, disbursed 100% compensation towards input cost following loss of standing crop due to unexpected rain during the harvest period. But the insurance companies were functioning with a profit motive for the last four years, he said. Hence, in order to save the farming community from the clutches of profit-oriented private crop insurance companies, the State government should implement its own crop scheme like in Gujarat, Maharashtra and other States. Stating that farmers found it difficult to avail crop loans since the power to grant credit vested in central cooperative banks since last year as per RBI instructions, Mr. Pandian demanded that a separate central cooperative bank be formed for Tiruvarur district and the power to disburse crop loan restored to primary agriculture cooperative banks. Mr. Pandian also demanded a separate registrar office be set up in Tiruvarur for the district. Meanwhile, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association staged a demonstration near the Income Tax Office at Kumbakonam on Tuesday demanding immediate disclosure of crop loss compensation and disbursement to farmers who had insured their samba/thaladi crop last season and suffered losses due to unseasonal rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/redeem-poll-promise-on-procurement-price-says-farmers-body/article35182417.ece

Special drives to ensure all residents got their Aadhaar cards as well as ration cards helped ensure that people received their rations on time.

However, special camps were organised to enrol them and these people too were now eligible to receive their rations, she said. She added that widows and transgender people too had been given ration cards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/increased-kerosene-allocation-to-the-nilgiris-recommended/article35182358.ece
07 July 2021||Vellore,TAMIL NADU||Farmers want solution to elephant menace||On most nights, 65-year-old G.M. Rajagopalan and farmers like him spend sleepless nights by the Palamaner Road running through Kottamitta village in Gudiyatham. They stand guard to chase wild elephant herds that descend from the nearby forest and destroy their crops. This is not the case in this village alone. Farmers from 30 hamlets under village panchayats such as Modikuppam, Dhanamkondapalli, Mordhana and Sengundram have been facing the problem due to elephants. Cultivation of mango, bananas, and groundnuts is common in these villages. “Sleep deprivation is a major problem as we stand guard at night, but we somehow have to protect our crops. Elephants enter our fields in search of water. During the day time, we chase away monkeys, deer and wild boar that destroy our produce,” said Mr. Rajagopalan.  Repeated requests The farmers claim that repeated requests to the government to solve the issue have not yielded any results. “Hence, a few affluent farmers have installed solar powered electric fences by spending money from their pockets. However, the poor farmers continue to struggle and they continue to face losses. Many of them have sold their land and gone out of the villages,” he said. One can find electric fences running alongside the Palamaner Road with warning symbols on them. Kamesh Deva, another farmer from Kottamitta village said that in the evening, the power is switched on. “The elephants which try to enter the field suffer a mild shock after coming in contact with the wire and they avoid entering the zone,” he added. He claimed that a few people had died after elephants trampled on them.

07 July 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen warned against using purse seine nets||The Villupuram district administration has warned fishermen of the district against using purse seine nets, which are banned by the State government. The administration said there would be serious legal consequences, besides seizure of boats and catch and withdrawal of welfare schemes. In a press release, Collector D. Mohan said the State government, as per the Fishing Regulation Act, 1983, had banned purse seine nets as it seriously harmed marine life. Officials of the Fisheries Department said several States had imposed a ban on purse seine fishing because it was a highly damaging and ecologically unsustainable method. Fishermen in the district should change their methods and make use of alternatives supported by the government, Mr. Mohan said. If they violate the ban, the boats used for fishing and the catch would be confiscated. Legal proceedings would be initiated against the violators, he said, and added that the welfare schemes being given to fishermen would be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-warned-against-using-purse-seine-nets/article35182449.ece

Meghanath Reddy has formed five inter-departmental teams to inspect fireworks units to ensure compliance with safety norms and crack down on illegal units. The action comes after accidents claimed several lives and left many injured in the last few months at fireworks units and unlicensed ones. While the accident at Sree Mariyammal Fireworks near Sattur claimed 27 lives, the recent one at an illegal unit near Thayilpatti claimed four lives, including a pregnant woman and a child. Each team will comprise officials of the Departments of Revenue, Police, Fire and Rescue and Industrial Safety and Health. The teams will conduct inspections in the taluks to be allocated from among Sivakasi, Vembakottai, Sattur, Virudhunagar, Rajapalayam, Srivilliputtur and Aruppukottai. “Each team will inspect three to five licensed units and at least one village that is notorious for illegal cracker manufacturing from Monday to Saturday. The teams will submit daily reports to the District Revenue Officer and the Collector,” Mr. Meghanath said. To keep the team members’ energy level up, the Collector has planned to change the officials of each team every week. “That way, the regular work of the officials will not be affected and each team will work with new vigour,” he said. Clear message The action will send out a clear message to the fireworks industry that there will be a continuous inspection for compliance with safety norms and the units found violating the safety rules will face action. Those involved in illegal cracker manufacturing at home will also face action, including under the Goondas Act. Complaints of violation of safety norms can be lodged with the Special Tahsildar (Match and Fireworks Unit Inspection) on 93426-94959.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/five-teams-formed-to-inspect-fireworks-units/article35182300.ece
07 July 2021||Virudhunagar/Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||12,492 pregnant women to be vaccinated in Virudhunagar||The district administration has started administering COVID-19 vaccine to pregnant women with a target to inoculate 12,492 expectant mothers in the coming days. Collector J. Meghanath Reddy inaugurated the drive at Mallankinaru Upgraded Primary Health Centre on Tuesday. As on July 5, as many as 3.81 lakh persons had been inoculated in the district, including 85,475 persons who received their second dose. Around 25% of those aged more than 18 years had been vaccinated. Special vaccination camps were being held for differently abled persons, transgenders, workers of various industrial units, government employees, leprosy patients and lactating mothers. Similarly, camps were being conducted to vaccinate people at crowded places, he said. Pregnant women could inoculate themselves on all Tuesdays when they visit their PHC for the regular check-up. On other days, the village health nurses would administer the COVID-19 vaccine in the sub-health centres. Vaccination would help the pregnant women to protect themselves and their babies from the infection, the Collector said. Vaccine shortage Even as the government is repeatedly appealing to the people to get themselves vaccinated against COVID-19, those who go to the vaccination centres in Dindigul are turned back as there is no stock of vaccine. So people return home disappointed. According to Health Department sources, so far four lakh people have been inoculated at the 14 vaccination centres in the district, and Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan had assured to replenish the vaccine stock within a week. Meanwhile, the number of positive cases in the district has come down drastically. The number of active cases as on July 5 is 386. The authorities have planned to vaccinate about one lakh people in the next two months. Those who are waiting for the second dose will be given priority. Health officials say there is no harm if there is a delay in getting the second dose. Despite relaxation in lockdown norms and dip in cases, people should continue to be cautious and remain indoors and venture out only if they had urgent work. Collector S Visagan on Tuesday reviewed the COVID-19 situation with officials. Though e-pass system has been withdrawn for visiting Kodaikanal since July 5, public parks, including Bryant Park, would remain closed and would be open at a later date, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/12492-pregnant-women-to-be-vaccinated-in-virudhunagar/article35182444.ece

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Withdraw Cinematograph amendment Bill, Chief Minister urges Centre||“A vibrant democracy must provide adequate space for creative thinking and artistic freedom. However, the proposed amendment seeks to restrict it by restoring the revisionary powers of the Union government that were struck down by the Supreme Court two decades ago,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the Act had provisions for approving and rejecting certification of films made on the basis of the prescribed guidelines; provisions for control over film-making were already available in Section 5(b) of the Act. “Given all these, it is considered excessive to add more laws to throttle the freedom of a creative form in the 21st century,” he said. If a film was certified for public viewing by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he said, it fell in the domain of the States as law and order is a State subject. But the Union government now wanted to go against the spirit of cooperative federalism and transgress the powers of the States and the CBFC. As a prelude to this amendment, the Film Certification Appellate Board, which had been functioning as an appellate body against the CBFC, was dismantled, he said. “I wish to reiterate that the Draft amendment restoring the “revisional power” to the Centre after it [a film] is certified by the CBFC is a misuse of the ‘reasonable restriction’ clause under Article 19(2) of the Constitution, and this Draft amendment itself is against the spirit of promoting rightful thinking in civil society,” he said. Curbing the creative thinking of the film fraternity and imposing conditions for making films were unjustified and ran counter to the “very ideals” of the Constitution. “Taking away the right to freedom of thought will only weaken our democracy, which has to be vibrant always irrespective of the parties in power,” Mr. Stalin said. He said it would be difficult to implement some provisions, such as the age-wise grouping under three categories, and certain amendments, like the provision to enable the Centre to direct the CBFC Chairman to re-examine a film after certification, would make film-making a very risky and uncertain industry. He urged the Centre to withdraw the proposed amendment and allow the CBFC functional autonomy “so that we remain as a progressive nation, where creative thinking ... blossoms without fear or favour”.

07 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Farmers remember Babagouda Patil||Some farmers organisations held a memorial meeting in Belagavi on Monday, for farmers leader and former Union Minister Babagouda Patil, who died recently. Members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Krishik Samaj and Hasiru Sene spoke of the contribution of the late leader in organising farmers in North Karnataka. “Farmers protests will be made more effective with the use of social media and involvement of young people, especially from rural areas,” Badagalpura Nagendra of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha said. He said that KRRS will soon have a constitution of its own that will dictate how leaders will be elected at village, taluk, district and State levels, and other issues. It will also help members decide on long-term plans for protests and responses to policy changes in the State and at the Centre. It will also help them in creating awareness, advocacy and training of farmers about current affairs and new farm technology. He said that the State government had not shown proper respect to Babagouda Patil’s mortal remains. He said that the KRRS will demand installation of his statute in Belagavi district. He said that the farmers movement had suffered due to leaders forming several groups. “But we should realise that and ensure that such mistakes are not repeated,” he said. He urged farmers groups to express solidarity with labour, women, students and other groups fighting for their rights. Farmers organisations will fight in unison against the new farm laws, social activist S.R. Hiremath said. He said that the protests in New Delhi and other places will not stop till the laws are repealed. He said that farmers had to unite not just to oppose farm laws but also to stop centralisation of power in the hands of a few. BJP leader and former Minister Shashikant Nayak said that he will support farmers agitations for fair price and other issues. He warned farmers against political forces that could weaken the movement. Leaders Chamaras Malipatil, Kalyanrao Muchalambi, Prakash Babagouda Patil, Shreeshail Nayak and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-remember-babagouda-patil/article35182475.ece

07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||K.R. Market to get ‘smart’ makeover||From escalators to drinking water dispensers and from traffic islands to seating areas, the historic Krishna Rajendra Market, also known as K.R. Market, is getting a facelift. Redevelopment and improvement works have been taken up by the Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. (BSCL). According to BSCL officials, the K.R. Market junction improvement work was taken up in February, while the reconstruction of the dilapidated meat market will be taken up soon. The work has been taken up with the objective of ensuring seamless connectivity in the area that witnesses high footfall. The junction is an important one and connects S.J.P. Road, N.R. Road, Avenue Road, Kalasipalya Market, and Victoria Hospital. The work taken up at a cost of Rs. 17 crore includes bus terminals, two traffic islands, and improvement of subway and plaza area, a BSCL official said. The official added that the theme of traffic islands would be finalised soon. The bus terminal improvement includes two carriageways that will be 220 metres in length and 9 metres in width. The white-topped carriageways will also have RO drinking water facility and obstruction-free footpaths.` The market junction has six subways, three of which are over 25 years old. The old openings are being repaired, while the six newer ones will have escalators, a first for any market in the city. Water seepage is a problem that has made the subway unusable. This issue is also being tackled, the official said, and added that the work is likely to be completed by November. The work, which also includes drinking water units/dispensers, toilets, seating area and refuge area in case of emergency situations, has been progressing at a much slower pace than anticipated, said G.M. Divakar, president of K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association. He said that if the work was delayed any further, it would affect the livelihood of lakhs of people dependent on the market. “We had sought a proper market approach from the metro station, adequate parking, drinking water and toilets,” he said and added that the vendors had recently met P.C. Mohan, Bengaluru Central MP, about the delay in the work. Admitting to slow progress of work, Mr. Mohan said that following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, labour was a huge issue as many of them were migrants. After relaxation of lockdown, the situation was likely to improve. He also said that he was closely reviewing the progress of the work to ensure it was completed without any further delay. Meanwhile, BSCL has finalised the tender for the demolition and reconstruction of the meat market. The work order for the Rs. 16-crore project has also been handed over to a contractor. Though the demolition of the dilapidated structure is yet to be taken up, the contractor has put up temporary structures to shift the vendors. BSCL officials said that around 60 sheds had already been put up and vendors would be shifted out soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kr-market-to-get-smart-makeover/article35182258.ece
07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vala had second-longest tenure as Governor of Karnataka||Outgoing Governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, who served as the first citizen of the State for six years and 10 months (2014-21), is the second-longest serving person in the post in Karnataka. Thaawarchand Gehlot was appointed to succeed him as the 19th Governor on Saturday. Khurshed Alam Khan (1991-99) served as the longest Governor of Karnataka, completing eight years and 11 months. Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, the last king of the Mysore province, served as the longest governor of the erstwhile Mysore State, between 1956-65. Though the Governor was appointed for a five-year period, Mr. Vala continued in the post after the Narendra Modi-led government retained power at the Centre in 2019. Mr. Vala served as Governor during the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah, the JD(S)-Congress coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy, and the present BJP government led by B.S. Yediyurappa.    Mr. Vala courted controversy after the 2018 State Assembly elections. After the fractured mandate, he invited the single largest party, which was the BJP (104), to form the government instead of the largest post-poll alliance comprising the Congress and the JD(S). Mr. Vala gave the new Chief Ministe, Mr. Yediyurappa, an 18-day period to prove his majority in the Lower House. Both the Congress and the JD(S) approached the Supreme Court and the court shortened the period from 18 days to three days and mandated that the House proceedings, including voting, should be telecast live. Mr. Yediyurappa announced his decision to resign in the House, stating that he could not prove majority. He was Chief Minister for just two days. Later, Mr. Vala invited alliance leader Mr. Kumaraswamy to form the government. The coalition government lasted just over a year and fell in July 2019 following the defection of 14 Congress and three JD(S) MLAs. Again, Mr. Yediyurappa was sworn in as Chief Minister and has continued in office since.    Ordinances Mr. Vala gave approval to many Ordinances promulgated by the BJP government during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike some previous Governors, he attended only a select few public functions and had limited media interaction. On Tuesday, Mr. Vala laid the foundation stone to the new building of the Chief Electoral Officer of Karnataka, Nirvachana Nilaya, through virtual mode from the Raj Bhavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vala-had-second-longest-tenure-as-governor-of-karnataka/article35182286.ece
07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Choosing Wisely’ task force makes recommendations for patients, HCWs||The Choosing Wisely initiative, started to promote conversations between patients and physicians about avoiding unnecessary medical interventions, has come out with 10 evidence-based recommendations on COVID-19 for the general public and healthcare workers (HCWs). A paper on the recommendations authored by an 18-member task force of public health experts including C.S. Pramesh from Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai and Giridhar R Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at Indian Institute of Public Health, Bengaluru has been published in Nature Medicine on July 5. The recommendations are related to following precautionary practices to decrease the risk of being infected; measures to be taken if someone has symptoms or has been diagnosed with COVID-19; vaccination; judicious use of drugs and investigations in managing COVID-19 and health systems and policies. According to the paper, the first two recommendations are most relevant in regions of high community spread and low vaccine coverage, whereas the remaining eight are relevant regardless of the setting. “Adopting and implementing the list of recommendations will promote more evidence-based implementation of policy and practices in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in various parts of the world. Most importantly, this list emphasizes the critical role that evidence-based medicine should serve, even during a raging pandemic,” stated the paper. The task force was created in April 2021 with multi-stakeholder involvement, with members drawn from various areas of specialisation. Patient and civil-society representatives were also included. Advisors to the group included leaders of the World Health Organization and senior government officials. “The recommendations for the prevention, care and control of COVID-19 include the best evidence available at present, and address practices that are common, inefficacious, of low value or harmful in the response to COVID-19 in several countries. All recommendations are based on robust evidence and can improve outcomes for pandemic control globally. These are especially relevant in low- and middle-income countries, where resources are scarce, government expenditure on public healthcare is low, and optimum utilization is crucial,” the paper stated. “We emphasize that these recommendations are not meant to replace treatment protocols; instead, they are intended to promote shared decision-making by patients and physicians, and to provide guidance to treating physicians and the general public,” the authors said. The paper also asserted the importance of maintaining essential non-COVID-19 healthcare areas such as cancer, tuberculosis, renal and cardiac disease, mental health and reproductive health even during major pandemics, as the consequences of not doing so are dire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/choosing-wisely-task-force-makes-recommendations-for-patients-hcws/article35182270.ece
07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Gauri Lankesh case: Government delay in challenging HC order irks activists||The State government’s delay in challenging the Karnataka High Court order of April 2021 related to the Gauri Lankesh murder case, forcing the victim’s family to approach the apex court and secure a stay order, has caused consternation among those fighting for speedy justice in the case. The High Court’s interpretation of the provisions of the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act (KCOCA), 2000, while quashing charges under the law against one of the accused in the murder of the journalist-activist, also has the Karnataka State Police worried. Justice K.S. Mudagal of the High Court quashed charges under the KCOCA, 2000, against one of the accused, Mohan Nayak, on the grounds that the accused did not have more than one prior chargesheet to charge him under the law. The government had argued that this need not be the benchmark in this case, as the other accused had prior chargesheets and Mr. Nayak was a member of the organised crime syndicate. Of the 17 accused chargesheeted and arrested in the case, only six have more than one chargesheet previously. Following the order, the other accused in the case have filed similar petitions. If charges under this law are quashed, it will help them get bail, the police fear. Given how other accused in past cases related to the Sanatan Sanstha have been absconding and been elusive for over a decade now, agencies fear bail to any of the accused is a security risk. The issue However, contrary to expectations, the State government did not challenge the order in the apex court even after two months and the bail petition of Mohan Nayak was set to come up. Kavitha Lankesh, sister of Gauri Lankesh, then approached the Supreme Court, which stayed the High Court order and served notice to the State government. The case will come up for hearing on July 15. Ms. Kavitha Lankesh refused to comment on the issue. Activists fighting for speedy justice want the State government to ensure prompt legal redressal. “We fear the good work in detection of the case is being undone by the incumbent government. We appeal that the government take stringent legal measures to punish the culprits. This cannot be seen only as an isolated act of murder, but as a larger plot to silence dissent, especially given it has now come to light that the same group was behind the murders of four writers and activists,” said V.S. Sridhar, spokesperson of Gauri Memorial Trust. Noted writer and linguist G.N. Devy of Dakshinayana, a writers’ forum formed after the murder of M.M. Kalburgi, said both the Union and State governments are duty-bound to assure the rule of law is upheld. “Any slacking in the legal fight will only mean shielding the accused in a heinous crime.” Meanwhile, the State police are also concerned with the interpretation of the KCOCA provisions by the High Court. “This not only affects the Gauri Lankesh case, but several other KCOCA cases. Practically, invoking the KCOCA against only those against whom there are two prior chargesheets and not against members of such a syndicate severely limits the law and its teeth to control organised crime,” a senior police officer said. “There are multiple apex court orders that have favoured our interpretation of the law. But the High Court has favoured another interpretation. So the apex court is the right forum to settle the issue,” said Praveen Sood, DG & IGP, Karnataka State Police.

07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rapido applies for permission to operate bike taxis in city||Ride-sharing company Rapido has filed an application before the State Transport Authority (STA) seeking permission to run bike taxi services in the city. In a press release, the company stated that it plans to hire 100 ‘women captains’ in the city by the end of 2022. They will be provided rental electric two-wheelers to help them earn an income as per their convenience. “With the recent order by the Karnataka High Court, ambiguity regarding bike taxi legality is now set to resolve. Candidates can confidently join Rapido as a captain to earn an income utilising their bikes as taxis, without fear of implications and objections,” said the release. The company claimed that the Karnataka High Court, in a recent case filed by a leading transport aggregator, observed that under the law, a motorcycle taxi can be used for hire on which a passenger could be carried on pillion. “The court further observed that a motorcycle taxi has been categorised as a transport vehicle by the Central government under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,” stated the release. A senior official with the Transport Department said they would allow electric bike taxis to be operated in the city. “The Central government has allowed operations of electric bike taxis in city limits. If any platform invests in e-bikes, employs riders and provides taxi services to customers by charging fares fixed by the government, they will be allowed. But no permission will be given to operate as an aggregator by attaching private bikes (white board) and run them as bike taxis,” said the official. Prior to the pandemic, the department had sent a proposal to the State government to allow e-bike taxis in the State. “It is before the Transport Minister for consideration. We have sought a minimum fare of Rs. 10 and Rs. 5 for every kilometre. We had also written to the Centre seeking directions on issuing permits for e-bikes,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rapido-applies-for-permission-to-operate-bike-taxis-in-city/article35182264.ece
07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Third wave: Sero survey, city-level expert team planned||With most models predicting the outbreak of the third wave in September-October, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is looking to constitute a team of experts and take up a sero positivity survey at the city level. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the launch of dedicated Anti-Rabies Vaccination (ARV) vehicles on Tuesday, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the civic body had already identified experts who will be part of the committee. The committee, which is likely to be constituted soon, will be able to guide the civic body in identifying areas that need to be improved in the management of COVID-19, said Mr. Gupta. The sero positivity survey will help the BBMP get an idea of the extent of antibodies prevalent in the city’s population, apart from those who have already tested positive for COVID-19. The BBMP is also working on a plan to upgrade its health facilities. The civic administration had extended assistance required for genome sequencing, a programme taken up by the State government and centre. Though there has been some delay in getting results of all the samples taken, the BBMP has received results of around 1,500 of the 3,000 samples taken. According to Mr. Gupta,the Delta variant was identified in nearly 70% of results. “Experts have already stated that it was the Delta variant that was the main driver of the second wave,” he added. Vaccination drives Though the positivity rate had come down, the civic body was working towards ensuring that 70% of the eligible adult population is vaccinated by the end of the month. The centre opened up the vaccination for citizens aged above 60 years, later 45 and above, and then those aged between 18 years and 44 years. “Only once all these categories are covered, vaccination for children may be opened up. But that is a decision that will be taken by the centre,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/third-wave-sero-survey-city-level-expert-team-planned/article35182267.ece
07 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ecotourism guidelines allow for temporary structures in forests||Conservationists and environmentalists are disconcerted by the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife’s nod to the guidelines on Ecotourism in Forest and Wildlife Areas 2021, which, among other things, allow for “temporary structures” to come up in forest areas. The committee, in its meeting this month, decided to recommend the guidelines which also have an indicative list of protected areas where ecotourism could be developed. Among these in Karnataka are the Bannerghatta National Park, Kudremukh National Park, Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, Daroji Bear and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuaries. The guidelines, mentioned in the tentative agenda of the 63rd meeting of the committee, makes a case for ecotourism saying that nature conservation entails interactions with people as a central concept. “Ecotourism has the potential to create significant opportunities for building public awareness and mass movement towards conservation of nature and natural resources while expanding overall returns to the economy, improving skill base, creating new knowledge and green jobs, and improving the livelihoods of the local communities,” it said. Ecotourism will be promoted on the basis of “science based planning,” it says, adding that the plan will “appropriately demarcate the ecotourism zone upon assessment of management requirements of the target wildlife, the habitat or the geographical entity, and their behavioural and ecological characteristics.” Allowing structures What is ruffling feathers is the site development aspect. While the guidelines promise to develop such zones in an “eco-friendly manner” by ensuring that the natural profile and ecological integrity of the site is maintained, they also mention that any ecotourism facility or structure on forest lands will be subject to the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. “No permanent structure shall be made/constructed to create ecotourism facility/structure, but temporary structures/facility made of predominantly natural material of local origin shall be allowed in protected area or on forest land,” the guidelines stated. Wildlife conservationist Giridhar Kulkarni said it was the second point that was not palatable. “Allowing temporary tourism structures on forest land without approval under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is definitely not in the interest of Forest and Wildlife as the move may open floodgates for tourism. I request the Central government to bring even temporary tourism structures on forest land under the ambit of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980,” he said. G. Veeresh, honorary wildlife warden, Chikkamagaluru, pointed out that the State’s Jungle Lodges and Resorts, for instance, was already operating in many places. “I hope they are looking at utilising existing structures rather than adding more. The policy also needs to be clear on tourist numbers and prevent overcrowding,” he said. Calling for informed restrictions, he said of existing homestays, more than double the legal numbers are illegal and the tourism department has no powers. The ecotourism guidelines bat for “homestays managed by local communities on non-forest land.” “What we need is a separate tourism policy for the Western Ghats, which is already under the onslaught of several issues,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ecotourism-guidelines-allow-for-temporary-structures-in-forests/article35182262.ece

As part of the initiative, it has committed to vaccinate at least 800 stray dogs every day in the city. On Tuesday, BBMP’s chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta and Special Commissioner (Animal Husbandry) D. Randeep launched the ARV vehicles that are separate from the fleet used to pick up dogs for sterilization. Currently, animal welfare organisations working with the BBMP are using the same vehicles for both Animal Birth Control (ABC) and ARV programme, which was slowing down the ARV progress. Each of the 8 zonal ABC/ARV service providers is sanctioned to outsource a vehicle, driver and two dog-handlers for the ARV in their respective zones at Rs. 73,186 per vehicle. The civic body has planned a systematic annual vaccination of at least 70% of the stray dogs across 198 wards. In a press release, BMMP said it has already completed intensive ARV in 44 wards, and is undertaking ring vaccination in areas where incidences of rabies have been reported. In August 2020, the BBMP launched a dedicated Rabies Helpline (+91 6364893322) for the public to report suspected cases of rabies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/world-zoonoses-day-8-arv-vehicles-launched/article35182260.ece

According to the police, the boy suffered from epilepsy, and the woman, who has neurological problems, lost her husband to COVID-19 during the second wave. After her husband passed away, Gayathri, and her sons Harshith, 5, and Suprith, 3, moved to her mother-in-law Padma’s house two months ago. “Her mother-in-law had gone to her hometown in Tamil Nadu to attend a funeral and had taken Harshith with her leaving Gayathri and Suprith at home,” said a police officer. On Sunday, a neighbour called Padma to inform her that he had taken Suprith to a private hospital after he had an epileptic attack, where he passed away. “There were ligature marks around the boy’s neck. When Padma, who returned immediately to Bengaluru, saw the marks she alerted the police especially as Gayathri was not giving her clear answers as to what had happened,” said a police officer. The police have taken up a case of murder and are awaiting the post mortem report. “Initial examination by the doctor suggested that the death could be due to strangulation,” a police officer said. The police have consulted a doctor so that Gayathri can undergo a detailed medical examination before she is taken into custody for questioning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/woman-booked-for-strangling-3-year-old-son/article35182274.ece

Mr. Nirani was reportedly told by the party Central leaders to visit New Delhi and he cancelled some of his scheduled programmes on Tuesday in Ballari and rushed to the capital. He is learnt to have met the Central leaders before returning to Bengaluru on thesame day. Mr. Nirani is also one of the aspirants for the post of Chief Minister if the incumbent B.S. Yediyurappa is replaced. Sources feel that Mr. Nirani may also be considered among a few others if the party high command decides to replace the Lingayat strongman Mr. Yediyurappa with someone from the same community. Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal continued his broadside against Mr. Yediyurappa and asked him to “gracefully step down”. He threatened to release documents pertaining to alleged corruption by the Chief Minister. He added that the mutt heads standing by Mr. Yediyurappa would have to flee from their mutts when he makes the expose. In another serious charge, Mr. Yatnal accused Mr. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y.

Under the 100 days campaign to provide water connections to anganwadi centres [launched on October 2, 2020 and ended on January 10, 2021], Kalaburagi district has made a mere 11.5% achievement. As per details provided by the Women and Child Welfare Department, of the total 3,130 anganwadi centres in the district, 2,146 anganwadi centres located in rural areas across the district were eligible for tap connections for potable water supply. Of these, only 247 anganwadi centres (11.5%) have got tap connections and overhead tanks installed. The following is the total number of anganwadi centres in each taluk, with tap connections given in brackets: Sedam taluk 288 (5), Aland taluk 374 (8), Shahabad 171 (8), Chittapur 196 (32), Afzalpur 199 (38), Jewargi 287 (40), Chincholi 271 (70) and Kalaburagi Rural 370 (46). Chief Executive Officer Zilla Panchayat Dilesh Sasi said that due to lack of coordination among the departments concerned, including Women and Child Welfare, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, and officials of National Rural Drinking Water Programme, the work has been delayed. Ensuring safe water to children is top priority, as they are the most vulnerable to water-borne diseases, Dr. Sasi said and promised that tap connections will be given to all the remaining anganwadi centres in the district by July-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-115-anganwadi-centres-have-got-tap-connections/article35182685.ece

07 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Clock Tower to Clock Tower one-way traffic proposal termed hasty||Traffic police personnel who have spent years managing traffic in the city feel that the proposal by Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) to introduce one-way traffic between Clock Tower and Clock Tower clockwise is a hasty one given the huge volumes of traffic at present. The proposal can be implemented after the service bus stand at State Bank is shifted to the outskirts of the city and the office of the Deputy Commissioner is relocated to Padil, said a retired senior officer. Otherwise, the central business district will be clogged with traffic jams, he cautioned. If at all footpaths have to be widened, it is not by reducing the road width but by using government land abutting both sides of Maidan Road. Roads were earlier widened considering the traffic flow when Bharat Lal Meena was the Deputy Commissioner. Successive police commissioners, including Sandeep Patil and P.S. Harsha, turned down the proposals earlier on the ground that it was not feasible given the traffic conditions. The space given for city buses inside State Bank Terminal is highly insufficient, he added. Retired Superintending Engineer, Public Works Department, B.S. Balakrishna, who has widened the main road in Tirthahalli town, said that he did not see any valid technical ground to make Maidan Road one-way. Minimum footpath width should be 6 ft, while Hampanakatte needs wider ones. It is a technical as well as a political decision, he said. Terming the proposal not a wise one, social activist G. Hanumanth Kamath said that transport projects should be based on vehicular and pedestrian density. Maidan Road does not see heavy footfall, he said and added that wider footpaths will only result in mushrooming of petty shops. Public money should be spent wisely and not on fancy projects, he said. Nigel Albuquerque from MCC Civic Group said that three satellite bus terminals on the North, East and South of the city will help decongest the central business district. If the Rs. 400-crore Pumpwell Bus Terminal could not be built, Smart City should take up these satellite terminals instead of spending on one-ways and beautification projects. Deputy Commissioner of Police Hariram Shankar said that the proposal will be implemented on an experimental basis and the traffic police will give feedback about its feasibility. However, there are apprehensions of traffic bottlenecks at Hamilton Circle once it is implemented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/clock-tower-to-clock-tower-one-way-traffic-proposal-termed-hasty/article35182639.ece

07 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. should bring fishermen under pension scheme: Shivakumar||D.K. Shivakumar, president, KPCC, said on Tuesday that the government should bring fishermen under the pension scheme. Speaking at an interactive meeting with fishermen in Udupi he said Kerala has implemented such a scheme. The State government should chalk out such a scheme to help fishermen in their old age. Stating that one fisherman in a day provided employment to 10 others subsequently, he said that instead of 31 litres of fuel a month, the government should provide 400 litres of fuel a month to fishermen. The government should supply diesel to fishermen at the subsidised rate of Rs. 50 per a litre and kerosene at Rs. 20 a litre. On a demand for an ambulance at Malpe port, Mr. Shivakumar said that he would ensure that the fishermen got it within a month either through an MLCs or an MP. Later, addressing presspersons Mr. Shivakumar said that he had been touring the coastal districts for the past two days to listen to the problems of fishermen. During his interaction with them in Mangaluru and Udupi he learnt about their issues. The Congress will chalk out a programme to provide justice to fishermen. He said that the BJP-led State government had said that it would provide Rs. 3,000 to 18,000 of three lakh fishermen during the pandemic. But he was not sure whether all of them got it. He was confident that the people would bring the Congress back to power in Karnataka in the next Assembly elections. Then it would take up programmes for the welfare of fishermen and weavers. Former Ministers Vinay Kumar Sorake and Pramod Madhwaraj were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-should-bring-fishermen-under-pension-scheme-shivakumar/article35182649.ece

07 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘DCC banks may write off loans taken by COVID-19 victims’||Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar on Tuesday said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was considering waiving loans taken in the District Credit Cooperative (DCC) banks by those who have succumbed to COVID-19. A formal announcement on this will be made soon, he added. Speaking at a programme organised to distribute crop loans to farmers for the current season from the Mysuru District Credit Cooperative (MDCC) Bank here, Mr Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, said he has asked the Managing Directors of Apex Bank and all DCC Banks for details about those who had taken loans and have died owing to COVID-19. The waiver would be announced soon after collecting all the details. Mr. Somashekar said the Chief Minister wanted crop loans to the tune of Rs. 20,810 crore given to nearly 30 lakh farmers this year. The banks had been told to achieve 100 percent target in disbursing loans like last year. “Last year, a 114 percent target was achieved in disbursing loans. This year too, the Chief Minister has asked us to surpass the target.The process of disbursing loans from cooperative banks for the current season was formally inaugurated at the Banquet Hall in Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru recently. The programme in Mysuru is the second stage of crop loan disbursement after Bengaluru and Bengaluru rural. I am visiting Kodagu on Wednesday for crop loan disbursement in the district. I will be visiting all 21 DCC banks in the coming days for distributing loans to farmers,” the Minister informed. Mr. Somashekar said the target last year was to disburse crop loans of Rs. 15,300 crore to 24.50 lakh farmers. However, 21 DCC banks disbursed Rs. 17,108 crore, achieving 114 percent target. Repayment Despite the pandemic situation and lockdown, those who had taken crop loans were promptly repaying the credit and 95 per cent of the loans borrowed from the banks had been repaid, he said, while thanking farmers for the repayment despite difficulties. On the alleged irregularities in Shivamogga and Kalaburagi DCC banks, he said steps had been taken in connection with the allegations and the crop loan disbursement will be done from those banks soon. All 21 DCC banks are in profit and therefore there were no hurdles in disbursing fresh loans to farmers, he added. MDCC Bank Chairman Harish Gowda, Mysuru Milk Union President Prasanna and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dcc-banks-may-write-off-loans-taken-by-covid-19-victims/article35182670.ece

Ashok on Tuesday said the district administration in Kodagu may consider forcible dislodgement of those staying in houses in areas identified as vulnerable to landslides, , if they do not relocate immediately as a precautionary measure in view of the onset of monsoon. Speaking to reporters in Madikeri, Mr. Ashok, who inspected Sri Chamundeshwari Nagar located on a hillock in the town, said cracks had been developed on a 6-km long stretch on the hillock where the people have been living. “I have told the Deputy Commissioner and the Tahsildar to issue notices to those living in the area to immediately shift out since they had been given houses in alternative locations. Despite getting houses built by the government, we have learnt that some have continued to stay in the old houses.” Mr. Ashok said the old houses at Sri Chamundeshwari Nagar would be handed over to the Forest Department once all of them move out. This is to ensure that nobody returns to live in the area. Likewise, old houses in other risk zones would also be handed to the Forest Department.  The Minister said there was no dearth of funds for constructing houses for the victims of floods and landslides in Kodagu. The Deputy Commissioner’s account has about Rs. 50 crore that could be used for building houses. “I am also ready to release Rs. 100 crore more.” The Department of Housing has sought Rs. 60 crore from the Revenue Department in connection with construction of houses for the remaining victims of Kodagu floods/landslides and the same would be released soon. The Minister also announced that those living unauthorisedly on the banks of the Cauvery would be getting alternative sites for construction of houses and each one of them would get a sum of Rs. 5 lakh.

CNNL’s Chief Engineer wrote a letter to the State government on July 1 about the safety of the dam, said CNNL’s Superintending Engineer Vijaykumar. Mandya MP Sumalatha has also been informed about the absence of cracks in the dam and its safety, he said. The CNNL official’s statement assumes significance in the light of the war of words between former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy and Ms Sumalatha over reported seepage in the dam. The department has already taken up work based on the Dam Safety Review Panel’s recommendation made after its visit in May 2014. Apart from grouting the dam structure and executing certain masonry work on the joints of the structure on the upstream side, Mr. Vijaykumar said work on replacing the sluice gates was also underway. “A total of 27 gates were replaced and the remaining will be replaced in due course,” he said. While the Dam Safety Review Panel inspects the dam once in ten years, a team comprising the Chief Engineer, Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer carries out a pre-monsoon inspection during May and post monsoon inspection during November and brings to the notice of the Government, if any, he said. With regard to illegal mining in the vicinity of the dam, which poses a risk to the structure, Mr. Vijaykumar said a team of officials from CSIR’s Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research in Dhanbad had visited the dam and the quarries. They have sought certain equipment for the inspection. “As and when their report comes, it will be submitted to the district administration”, Mr Vijaykumar said. However, he said there was no reason for the farmers to be concerned about the safety of the dam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-cracks-in-krs-dam-clarifies-cnnl-official/article35182473.ece
07 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Curbs on entry to Chamundeshwari temple||Chamundi Hills will be out of bounds for devotees and visitors on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and general holidays during Ashada season. The Mysuru district administration has imposed restrictions on entry to Chamundeshwari temple atop Chamundi Hills and Jwalatripura Sundari temple at Uttanahalli near the foothills during this period. Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham has issued orders banning entry to the two temples on July 9, July 16, July 23, July 30, August 6 and August 9. The district administration has also prohibited entry of devotees and general public on Saturdays, Sundays and general holidays. The curbs have been imposed to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of the general public. Entry to Chamundi Hills has been banned after 6 p.m. on all days. Residents of the area have been requested to carry their identity cards. Routine religious rituals and customs are, however, permitted to be carried out by the temple’s officials and priests within the temple premises. The order made it clear that entry to Chamundi Hills through the steps has been prohibited during the period. Similar restrictions on entry to Chamundeshwari temple were in place during Ashada 2020 too. The curbs were announced after the Executive Officer of Chamundeshwari temple said they were expecting between 60,000 and 100,000 devotees on each Ashada Friday while expressing difficulty in maintaining social distancing required to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when crowds gather in such large numbers. Temple authorities had pointed out that a large number of people visited on Saturdays and Sundays, besides general holidays while seeking the opinion of the district administration on allowing devotees during the month of Ashada. The Deputy Commissioner, in an order dated July 5, invoked provisions under Rule 12 of Karnataka Epidemic Diseases (COVID-19) Regulation 2020 and various provisions of Disaster Management Act 2005 to impose the restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/curbs-on-entry-to-chamundeshwari-temple/article35182668.ece

He told reporters in Mysuru that the State government had received a proposal from KSRTC for increasing fares in view of the rise in fuel prices. But, the government is averse to hiking fares, keeping in mind difficulties faced by the people due to COVID-19. Worried about COVID-19, the general public is still hesitant to travel by buses, he said while adding that the people were passing through a difficult financial phase on account of the lockdown. Increasing KSRTC fares at such a juncture will only add to the problems, he said. He said that KSRTC had incurred a loss of around Rs. 4,000 crore due to the lockdown when bus services had been withdrawn. Staff demands On the demands of KSRTC staff, Mr. Savadi said the government had agreed to eight out of their nine demands. The revenue generated by the corporation, which is plying buses only at 50% capacity, was not enough to meet even the fuel cost. The demand for a wage hike will be considered only after the corporation begins earning a profit. Leadership change He brushed aside the demands for leadership change in the State. He sought to make it clear that the party has not decided to change the leadership in the State and described the demand for change by certain legislators as their individual opinion.

07 July 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Scientific approach to lake conservation sought||As the State government plans to launch the multi-crore Vembanad Lake Conservation Project in the coming months, experts, environmentalists and stakeholders have called for a scientific and participatory approach to project planning and implementation. According to Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian, who attended a couple of meetings in connection with the project in recent days, the first phase of the project will begin in January 2022. Mr. Cherian said Rs. 100 crore was earmarked in the Budget for the first phase. Officials said the project was aimed at the eco-restoration of Vembanad Lake, a Ramasar site spanning several districts, through coordination of various government departments and people’s participation. Besides making the waterbody pollution-free, the project envisages the conservation of fisheries resources. “Biodiversity conservation should be at the forefront. Biological continuity of Vembanad Lake need to be established. All physical changes being planned as part of the project should ultimately ensure the conservation of living organisms and be beneficial to the ecosystem people like fishermen, clam collectors and so on,” said K.G. Padmakumar, Director, International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea-level Farming, Thottapally. Against dredging Mr. Padmakumar warned that dredging in the name of de-siltation would have a detrimental effect on the entire lake ecosystem. “Unscientific implementation of the project will be the final straw. Dredging has destroyed the Kochi Kayal, while the same thing is happening at Thottappally. Vembanad Lake needs de-silting not dredging,” he said, adding that the government needed to make clarity on the entire project. Area reduction According to a study carried out by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) a few years ago, the water carrying capacity of the lake has diminished by 78%. The lake has shrunk from 36,000 ha to 12,500 ha owing to widespread reclamation and encroachments. Today, it is one of the most-polluted waterbodies in the world. A report by the Kerala State Planning Board, ‘A Special Package for Post-Flood Kuttanad,’ notes that the “shrinkage of surface area and depth of Vembanad Lake is a major reason for the acuteness of Kuttanad floods.” KSSP district secretary Jayan Champakulam has urged the government to form a committee by including representatives of local bodies, people’s representatives, farmers, fishermen, and tourism and other stakeholders for the success of the project. “A detailed project report (DPR) should be prepared along with fixing priorities. The DPR should be subjected to public scrutiny. Apart from the joint committee, an expert committee should be constituted to provide necessary expert/scientific advice,” Mr. Champakulam said. Water-carrying capacity He said the accumulated waste, including plastic, should be removed from the waterbody and its water-carrying capacity should be increased. “Implementation of an Agriculture calendar in Kuttanad, opening of the Thanneermukkom barrage continuously at least a year, and bringing some restrictions on houseboat operations should be considered as part of the project,” Mr. Champakulam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scientific-participatory-approach-to-lake-conservation-sought/article35182561.ece
07 July 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||A makeover for Alappuzha canals||The network of canals that meander through the Alappuzha town has earned it the nickname Venice of the East. The famous canals, once abuzz with traders and travellers, however, lost their glory over the years and they became drains coated with weeds. Joining the efforts to clean and revitalise the canals is the local municipality, which has come up with the idea of floating gardens on the canals. Alappuzha municipal vice chairman P.S.M. Hussain said here recently that work had already begun on two floating gardens on the Commercial Canal. Experimental basis “We are doing it on an experimental basis. In the initial phase, we plan to cultivate marigold flowers with an eye on Onam. Later, sunflowers and vegetables will be cultivated. If successful, the project will be extended to other canals in the municipal area. It will change the face of Alappuzha town and attract tourists,” Mr. Hussain said. The gardens are being set up on floating rafts made of nets and coir geotextiles. Degraded water hyacinth and mud form the bed on which seedlings will be planted. “Using aquatic weeds will minimise its impact on the waterbodies. There is also no need to water the plants and apply fertilizer in this method,” Mr. Hussain said. The municipality has entrusted two young farmers — Sujith and Ajith from Kanjikuzhy — with the responsibility of overseeing the project. KIIFB funds The State government had sanctioned Rs. 108 crore under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for the Alappuzha canal rejuvenation project. The work, which began in February 2019, will be completed in four phases. The first phase of the project, which included the cleaning and deepening of nine major canals — Vade Canal, Commercial Canal, West Junction Canal, East Junction Canal, Uppootti Canal, Murinjapuzha Thodu, Kottaram Thodu, Alappuzha-Sherthala (AS) Canal, and Alappuzha-Ambalappuzha Canal — was completed at a cost of Rs. 39 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-makeover-for-alappuzha-canals/article35182606.ece

In a memorandum submitted to Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas, the organisation said that tourism had played a significant role in the economy of the district as the sector provided job opportunities to more than 30,000 persons. Moreover, the industry had contributed more than Rs. 1,500 crore to the government exchequer over the past three years. But incidents like the spread of the Nipah virus, the floods in 2018 and 2019 and the spread of COVID-19 had hit the industry and cast a cloud over the lives of thousands of workers. The revival of the destination by launching new projects was the need of the hour to rejuvenate the industry. For this, core changes should be made for the sectors including wildlife, farm, heritage, and cultural and adventure. They raised demands such as introducing vehicles of international standards at the eco-tourism centres for wildlife safaris and appointment of well-trained guides with safety support systems. An agri-museum, countrywide exchange programmes for farmers and development of agri sports should be part of development of farm tourism, they said. They demanded that the multi-crore cable car project across the Thamarassery Ghat Road should be implemented soon and a tourism-based master plan should be drawn up for the comprehensive development of the district. They also called for the construction of an airport in the district for better connectivity and enhance the inflow of tourists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-stakeholders-call-for-innovative-projects/article35182538.ece

The request comes close on the heels of the government decision to permit shooting of television serials from last week. Indoor shoot “We have requested the State government to permit indoor shooting of movies with a restricted crew. The shooting of movies could resume with people who have received two doses of vaccination,” G. Suresh Kumar, president of the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce, the apex body of trade bodies in the industry, told The Hindu on Monday. The shooting of movies and television serials was suspended following the second wave on April 29.   Mr. Suresh Kumar said that nearly 60 movies were held up at various stages of pre- and post-production work. Crisis “The crisis has taken a toll on the livelihood of many workers in the industry. Their resources have drained and we need to help them by resuming shooting,” he said. M. Renjith, president of the Kerala Film Producers' Association, said the producers were hoping that shooting would resume once the average test positivity rate drops below eight. “But it may take some more time to achieve it going by the current rate. Indoor works can resume if we get permission from the government,” he said. Relief package On the relief package required to save the ailing industry, Mr. Suresh Kumar said a request had been submitted before the government to do away with the entertainment tax on tickets charged over and above the Goods and Services Tax. “The government had waived the fixed electricity charges for cinemas up to May, and we hope that it would be extended further in view of the continuing deadlock,” he said.

The firm identified by the government for carrying out the work had quoted Rs. 54.9 crore for the rehabilitation of about 4.75 lakh cubic metres of municipal solid waste at the dumping site. A drone study carried out by NIT-Kozhikode in February as per the directions of the civic body found that about 5.51 lakh cubic metres of waste was lying at the site. The revised estimate of Rs. 70.95 crore was reached based on the study, according to senior officials of the corporation. A government order on June 27 asked the corporation to issue the work order to Zonta Infratech Pvt Ltd for the work. It has to be issued based on the report submitted by the NIT-Kozhikode on the quantity of legacy waste. The corporation has to issue the work order to the agency identified through the tender process for mandatory compliance of the Environment Protection Rules and also under the provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005, it said. Clear picture awaited The corporation authorities pointed out that the government has agreed to earmark funds available under the Kerala Solid Waste Management Project aided by the World Bank towards the cost required for rehabilitation of the site. The civic body had requested full government funding for removal of legacy waste citing financial burden on its exchequer. However, the corporation will have to bear a share of the expenses. A final picture on the funding pattern is expected soon, they said. Mayor M. Anilkumar said that the corporation will have to act as per the directions issued by the government. “Moreover, we have to abide by the directives issued by the National Green Tribunal on complying with the norms under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 without delay or face its legal consequences,” he said. The government had taken over the task of scientific management of waste accumulated at Brahmapuram in March last by invoking the provisions under the Disaster Management Act after the process initiated by the corporation got delayed indefinitely. The repeated fire incidents at the site and the threatening disaster situation were also quoted as reasons for the government action. The firm selected for the work will have to biomine the existing legacy waste and recover the entire area. It should ensure recovery of the land by cutting and levelling it to the maximum possible extent, aimed at getting a relatively flat land after biomining.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/biomining-of-legacy-waste-to-cost-about-rs-70-crore/article35182565.ece

While the previous government had promised to preserve it as a historical monument, the bridge, now in the custody of the Public Works Department and in a neglected state, is anything but that. “The bridge should be preserved for three reasons. For its historical and engineering significance and as a viable alternative path for motorists if the new bridge built parallel to it becomes inaccessible for some reason. An engineering marvel, it should be opened to engineering students to explore,” said Entrita V.A. a former councillor and activist. She said that the demolition of the rail bridge entwining it in 2017 was in itself a grave historical injustice and the road bridge should be spared of that fate. K.H. Haneesh who still takes the old bridge when the new bridge becomes crowded, said that road has become gutter-infested while its sides are increasingly getting covered in wild foliage. “The entry to the bridge from the Thevara side has become a dumping yard. The construction of an unscientific underpass hampering the access to the old bridge has also contributed to its neglect,” he said. Hibi Eden, MP, who during his previous tenure as MLA had raised the preservation of the bridge in the State Assembly, said that he will take up the matter yet again with the State government. “The bridge is a symbol of our rich heritage and should be preserved. It should be opened up to pedestrians and its potential as a tourism destination should be explored, like opening an eatery, without compromising its historical value,” he said. Mayor M. Anilkumar said that the corporation will bring the matter to the notice of the PWD Minister when he comes to the city. “The preservation of the bridge remains among the issues we have identified for redressal with the support of the government,” the Mayor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/history-remains-neglected-on-venduruthy-bridge/article35182559.ece

A major resource for book lovers, students, and researchers in the district, the library has been remaining closed for more than a year now. The library had downed shutters a couple of months after the plans to convert it to a virtual repository were announced by the chairman of its governing body and Kollam Collector B.Abdul Nasar. The project was announced towards the end of 2019 and the authorities had to close it in mid-March following the lockdown. “Many of us were dependent on the library for reference material and preparations to attend PSC exams. No other library in the district is equipped for this and though many libraries allowed entry after the first wave, this one has stayed shut,” says Sujith L, student. The library has around 15 staff and none of them had received salaries since the first lockdown. Reportedly, more than Rs. 20 lakh is required for clearing their salary bills alone, a major challenge posed by the dip in income and funding during the pandemic. Even before that, internal issues had been troubling the library and in June its employees had approached the authorities demanding job and clearance of salary dues. “An action plan for the smooth functioning was discussed at the last governing body meeting held at the chamber of the Kollam Collector. A three-member subcommittee was also formed to prepare a proposal to address the problems and another meeting was fixed to finalise the course of action. But the pandemic disrupted everything, but right now we are trying to bring everything back on track. If everything go as planned, we are hoping to open the library by August,” says K.Bhaskaran, governing body member. The PN Panicker Foundation in collaboration with the Indian Public Library Movement (IPLM) had offered to digitalise the library in 2019, but it also came to a standstill as there was no follow-up. As part of the project, members were expected to get access to nearly 1.5 crore digital documents, including video and audio files. “Though the foundation provided laptops, the training sessions were not held. There was no progress in digitalisation work after that,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-public-library-at-a-crossroads/article35182610.ece

The final-year students of Electrical and Electronics Engineering department and MCA department have developed an Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) system to convert digital electronic energy meters to smart meters, making them more reliable and efficient. “Smart energy meters are popular in countries that use smart grids. Instead of replacing all digital electronic energy meters with smart meters, we have opted to convert them, which is an affordable exercise. Using the method, energy consumption details can be collected remotely and transmitted to a cloud server through WiFi,” says Anoop S. Kumar, team leader. Others in the team include Joys Joseph, Arunjith P.M., Amal S., Ajith R. Nair, Aswanth T., Anusree Mohan, Aswin U. and Joseph Jose. The students believe that with the Kerala Fibre Optic Network (K-FON) project in progress, their idea can be adopted easily. The proposed system involves an external circuit that can be connected to the existing meters and the readings can be uploaded into the server. “For automatic billing and management of the collected data, a responsive web interface will be associated with the energy meter. With proper authentication, both service providers and consumer can access the web page from anywhere in the world. The total energy consumption and bill can be obtained from this webpage,” he says. Setting limits He says the system will enable consumers to regulate their energy use and help to improve the grid efficiency. Faculty members Sheeba R., Naufal N. and Nadeera Bevi S. guided the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/engineering-students-develop-automatic-meter-reading-system/article35182608.ece

The date of organisational elections will be decided during the upcoming meeting of the party State committee,” chairman Jose K. Mani said. Alongside the party memberships with the right to vote in organisational elections, a new system of ‘KCM Community Members’ will be brought in for those having affinity to the political ideology of the KC(M). The membership window, which will also be available online, will also enable expatriates having affinity to the party to become a part of its organisational structure. Besides expanding the membership base, the steering committee also decided to reinvigorate its feeder organisations. The State-level office-bearers of the party have been tasked with immediate reorganisation of these outfits. A disciplinary committee will be constituted to strengthen the party’s organisational practices and improve political and organisational discipline. Senior party leaders, including Thomas Chazhikadan, Roshy Augustine, and N.Jayaraj, were among those who attended the meeting||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kcm-to-conduct-organisational-elections/article35182613.ece

Inaugurating the programme, Minister for Forest and Wildlife A.K. Saseendran said care should be taken to maintain and nurture the saplings planted during afforestation programmes. “Taking a cue from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme participation in the project initiated at Mevalloor, the government would consider extending the initiative to other similar projects by the Forest Department,'' he said. As part of the greening drive, 3,000 saplings are being planted on four acres of land at Mevalloor. The Minister distributed Japanese model seed balls made by the Forest Department on the occasion. This is for the first time that the department is adopting the seed ball, made of various organic manures mixed with natural clay. C.K. Asha, MLA, presided over the function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greening-drive-launched/article35182604.ece
07 July 2021||Kottayam/,KERALA||Row over counsel’s ‘remark’ fizzles out||The controversy over the alleged defamation of former Finance Minister the late K.M. Mani by counsel of the State government in the Supreme Court, which set the stage for a stand-off between the Kerala Congress (M) and the CPI(M), appears to have fizzled out. Addressing mediapersons after a meeting of the KC(M) steering committee in Kottayam on Tuesday, party chairman Jose K. Mani said the reports that appeared in the media were clearly misleading and Opposition parties attempted to derive political mileage out of it. Pointing out that a clarification given earlier by Left Democratic Front convener A. Vijayaraghavan that the government had never described the late Mani corrupt, he said the KC(M) too found out those facts through its sources in New Delhi. ‘‘A verification of the affidavit filed by the government, a copy of which is with us right now, shows it has not taken Mani sir's name in the court,'' Mr. Mani said. Reiterating that K.M. Mani had been acquitted by the High Court and a Vigilance court in the corruption case, he said the counsel had been explaining the context of the ruckus inside the Assembly on March 13, 2015. “The media reports that came out, however, were indeed misleading and the rival parties used the occasion to attack the KC(M),” he added. Notwithstanding the public defence put up by Mr. Mani, the issue triggered a heated discussion in the steering committee meeting, official sources said. Mr. Mani, on his part, had expressed his strong objection to the lawyer's remark to the LDF leadership. (The State government had sought the Supreme Court’s permission to withdraw the criminal charges slapped on six LDF legislators for disrupting the Assembly proceedings. They had accused K.M. Mani of having lost the moral right to present the Budget by allegedly accepting bribes from an association of hoteliers to reopen scores of bars shuttered.) Earlier in the day, Mr. Vijayaraghavan, who is also CPI(M) acting State secretary, stepped out of a party State Secretariat meeting to deny media reports that the counsel had portrayed Mani as a “corrupt Finance Minister”. The media had distorted the proceedings in the court. The government had filed no such statement. Driving wedge He said that the LDF had agitated against the entrenched graft in the then United Democratic Front government. The UDF had conspired with a section of the media to drive a wedge between the CPI(M) and the KC(M), he added. Meanwhile, the Congress-led UDF Opposition has sought to pressure Jose. K. Mani to disavow the CPI(M) for “sullying” his father’s memory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-counsels-remark-fizzles-out/article35182581.ece
07 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Kozhikode Corpn. Council calls for action against dowry system||The Kozhikode Corporation Council on Tuesday unanimously passed a motion in protest against the increasing cases of dowry deaths and domestic violence in the State. Health standing committee chairperson S. Jayasree who presented the motion pointed out that there should be a combined effort to create awareness about the Dowry Prohibition Act among common people. Congress councillor P. Usha Devi spoke of the recommendations of the V.S. Achuthanandan-led Administrative Reforms Commission on the issue. “There should be dowry prohibition officers in every district and the clause in the Dowry Prohibition Act of giving dowry being a criminal offence should be removed, to encourage more people to come up against those asking for dowry,” said Ms. Usha Devi and called for the active intervention of the State government to wipe out the social evil through campaigns. BJP councillor Navya Haridas questioned the State’s declaration in 2016 that the dowry system would be wiped out from Kerala in five years. She suggested that those in responsible positions, such as that of the chairperson of Kerala Women’s Commission, should be appointed based on their merit alone. Plastic waste Congress councillor S.K. Aboobakker invited the council’s attention towards the mounting pile of plastic waste in the city as the Haritha Karma Sena has suspended collection of waste temporarily as it could not be taken to recycling plants in West Hill or Njeliyanparamba. Earlier, the council passed an adjournment motion demanding that the Central government control the price of LPG despite opposition from BJP councillors. CPI(M) councillor M.C. Anil Kumar, who presented the motion, said the price of cooking gas was heading towards the Rs. 1,000-mark very fast and criticised the Central government for not reining in petroleum companies. Opposition leader K.C. Shobhita pointed out that subsidies were no longer available and that the hike in cooking gas price was sabotaging family budgets. An adjournment motion proposed by K. Moideen Koya of the IUML on the need to revise the COVID-19 death list by including expatriates was rejected by the Mayor on grounds that it was not of emergency nature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-corpn-council-calls-for-action-against-dowry-system/article35182543.ece

It’s the time they run for safety from the river in spate. Green Care Mission, an environmental organisation at Koolimadu near Mavoor, has now come up with a Safe Care Centre to make life easier for them during tough times. At the organisation’s eco-shop Green Carpet, which has been converted into the Safe Care Centre, several modern life-saving equipment, some imported from Europe, are on show. The most sought-after product is a water ambulance. “It is a German speed boat equipped with all that is needed in an ambulance, including a stretcher and a tent. But I modified it in such a way that it can now be towed behind an SUV when on land and be pushed into water when required,” K.T. Abdul Nassar, coordinator of Green Care Mission, said. Another is a speed boat from Holland that has been modified to run using solar power. “Speed boats are not suitable for our river, which is very narrow. Waves lead to soil erosion on the banks. Besides, it is too noisy and the fuel could disturb the environment,” he said. He used a Korean electric engine that retained charge for 3 to 4 hours on the boat and added a solar panel to charge it, making the boat completely eco-friendly. A light weight fibre boat often used in ships is another attraction at Green Carpet now. The boat never capsizes, can be lifted by two people and can be used by five. “I got it from Gujarat,” he said. A floating tent that can be used to transport bedridden people during floods, a floating cage to protect pets during floods and a solar pump that could be used to pump water into tanks when there is power outage during floods are the other products that have been kept ready at Green Carpet, anticipating another flood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/saving-lives-from-iruvazhinji-in-spate/article35182552.ece

No, but we try to make them assume ownership and protect the toys.” That was the theory A. Pradeepkumar, the former MLA of Kozhikode North, applied to ensure the protection of all his pet projects in the constituency. Now when Butt Road Beach Bliss, the latest project he envisaged, has become a reality after he stepped down from the post, Mr. Pradeepkumar desperately hopes that people in the neighbourhood assume a sense of responsibility and protect the park from the destruction it endured a few years ago at the hands of vandals. The Butt Road Beach Bliss park was reopened by Minister for Tourism and Public Works P.A. Mohamed Riyas on Monday. It was first opened 10 years ago as an experiment at a cost of Rs. 2 crore, encompassing tiled pathways, a lagoon in the centre, and some minor landscaping, and since then has been a popular hub of morning walkers. It became a relaxation spot for families in the city unlike the much popular beach near the Corporation Office, which was visited by tourists too. But, maintenance fell short and it soon fell into the hands of miscreants. That even the wiring of lights in the park was stolen vouches for the extent of destruction that occurred. “The protection of public property is not in the hands of the officials who keep it under lock and key, but the public, who feels the responsibility to protect what is theirs, and, for it, a sense of ownership is necessary,” said Mr. Pradeepkumar. He had experimented with his theory at the Government Higher Secondary School in Nadakkavu, where despite initial instances of destruction, morning walkers and the elderly in the locality, who used the school grounds to relax, kept it safe. The newly opened Beach Bliss park now has walkways, musical fountain, cycle and skating tracks, cafeteria, children’s play area, and a lot more. It was renovated at a cost of Rs. 2.15 crore, which included funds from the District Tourism Promotion Council and the MLA. It is being maintained by the DTPC at present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/public-participation-needed-to-protect-beach-bliss-ex-mla/article35182542.ece

SM Street wore a deserted look. The Left-aligned Kerala Vyapari Vyavasyi Samiti, however, kept away from the protests. All the hotels and restaurants too downed their shutters in support of the strike. KVVES functionaries staged demonstrations in many places. A hunger strike was staged outside the collectorate.

College union chairman Shawn Thomas said on Monday that the demand to complete the construction of the wall was a long-pending one as the students had been complaining about the lack of security on the campus. However, a section of local residents were opposed to it. The roads within the campus are three-metre wide. Mr. Thomas claimed that the college authorities reportedly agreed to give up land to widen the road from Government Dental College to medical college crematorium up to 5.5-metre to address the local opposition. Now, local residents are demanding that the road be widened up to 12 metres. Mr. Thomas claimed that the college need not give up its land for the purpose. The college union is now demanding that the area leading up to the college stadium be retained. Mr. Thomas pointed out that surrounding walls had been built around the campuses of government medical colleges at Thrissur and Manjeri without giving up their own land. Over 4,000 students and around 2,000 hospital staff are staying in various hostels and staff quarters on the campus. “Six girl students were physically attacked in a month on the campus. There are frequent reports about bike thefts. Waste is being dumped on the campus recklessly. There is stray dog menace and anti-social elements using ganja and other drugs are active in the area,” he said. Though the construction for the wall had begun in April to strengthen security measures, a group of people obstructed it. Mr. Thomas claimed that the NGO Union too had offered support to their demand to complete the construction of the wall. The students’ union would launch a protest if the work was not completed at the earliest, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medical-college-union-opposes-move-to-give-land-for-road-widening/article35182540.ece

P. Rasheed Ahammed, a Syndicate member aligned to the United Democratic Front, claimed in a letter to the Chancellor that the university made the appointments violating the rotation points or charts of reservation and related norms as stipulated in Rules 14 to 17 of the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules (KS and SSR). He claimed that the university had also defeated the spirit of the reservation for persons with disabilities as it violated an order issued by the State government on October 30, 2019, by treating horizontal reservations, the quota for people with disabilities under clause (1) of Article 16 of the Constitution, as vertical reservations, the quota for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Communities. Though the percentage of reservation for the backward classes should remain the same even after providing for horizontal reservations, the rule had been violated in the appointments, he alleged.  ‘False claims’  He claimed that the appointment of 24 faculty members would become invalid. Though the university had declared 10 vacancies as ‘No Candidate Available’, there will be only seven such vacancies. It means the appointment of 24 faculty members would have to be revoked and 27 of them should be appointed afresh. The university’s claim that there were not enough eligible persons with disabilities was false, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/calicut-varsity-accused-of-sabotaging-quota-norms/article35182530.ece

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said on Tuesday that Feroke, Naduvannur, and Chelannur had TPR above 30%. It was above 20% in 16 other local bodies, she said. Dr. Jayasree said the misuse of the relaxations in restrictions would lead to a surge in fresh cases. People should take precautions as the Delta variant of the virus too had been detected in Kozhikode. Dr. Jayasree said the daily TPR was above 10% for the past 10 days. It was 10.91% on June 27, 10.98% on June 28, 12.94% on June 29, 11.32% on June 30, 12.18% on July 1, 11.07% on July 2, 11.48% on July 3, 11.99% on July 4, 11.88% on July 5, and 12.07% on July 6. As many as 1,425 people tested positive for the virus on Tuesday. The cases are going above the 1,400-mark after a gap of a month. It was on June 5 that 1,499 cases were reported from Kozhikode. Of the fresh cases on Tuesday, 1,410 were due to local transmission of the infection and the source of 13 others was not known. Kozhikode Corporation accounted for 374 locally acquired infections, Feroke 59, Madavoor 49, and Chelannur and Koyilandy 41 each. As many as 1,002 people recovered from the infection.

Jaimy Pandit, a class 12 student of Jyothis Central School, says she is glad that the new assessment scheme has been announced this early by the CBSE, saving them from last-minute surprises. “Even we were shocked when we heard the assessment scheme for our senior batch. We were worried if it would be continued for us. But the new scheme has come as such a huge relief.” Shaun G. John, a science student at St. Thomas Central School, too is glad that the board plans to conduct the examinations. Format Both agree that the two exams policy reduces pressure on students to a large extent. The multiple choice question format proposed in the first term that requires students to be very thorough will benefit them from the entrance exam perspective. Shaun though does have reservation about the rationalisation of the syllabus by 30% like last year. Schools, he says, may not teach the portions dropped from the syllabus, affecting those preparing for entrance exams. Jaimy, however, believes many schools cover at least the basics of the dropped portions if time permits. It also benefits those not attending entrance coaching. Good option Schools too see the CBSE decision positively. The Principal of a school says the assessment seems to be a good option in the view of the pandemic situation, and would address many of the difficulties faced by students. It leaves options open, and yet makes sure it will work. Jyothis Chandran, chairperson of the Jyothis group of schools, says the CBSE scheme should be appreciated as it allows enough time for students, teachers, and parents to plan accordingly. It is also flexible, taking into account all eventualities, and will save students from mental stress. Communication of information about internal assessments is also helpful, unlike in the case of class 10 and class 12 students of the past two years. Varghese Samuel, Principal of St. Thomas Central School, says the two-term formula, on the lines of the semester system in colleges, ensures students do not have to study the entire syllabus at one go. Weightage for every activity will also benefit students. The provisions for conducting exams in school are also welcome. Both Mr. Chandran and Mr. Samuel say the possibility of malpractice is also reduced since schoolteachers will not be preparing the question papers. The CBSE will provide the question papers and examinations will be held under the supervision of external examiners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cbse-assessment-scheme-welcomed/article35182562.ece
07 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State’s own OTT platform likely to unroll by Nov. 1||The State government’s proposed foray into the online content streaming space with the launch of an over-the-top (OTT) platform is a cultural intervention, rather than something prompted by the market or revenues, according to Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC) chairman Shaji N. Karun. Speaking to The Hindu , he said the plan is to launch the platform by November 1. ‘‘Even though the market is crowded with too many platforms, the government is taking this up as a cultural intervention, rather than looking at its viability. We do have an audience which is spread out across the globe. Even an OTT platform like Mubi, which has curated content, has its set of audiences. But, our priority will still be the big screen, with the films first getting a screening in the cinemas and then coming to the OTT platform,’’ Mr. Karun said. Major players Though major players such as Netflix and Amazon have been showing more interest in Malayalam cinema, it is mostly limited to films which they are ensured of a revenue. In the past one year, only fewer than 15 Malayalam films, a majority of them featuring big stars, have been taken up by these streaming platforms. Smaller, home-grown OTT platforms such as Neestream and Mainstream TV do not have the financial muscle to match the bigger players. The government's proposed platform might ensure space as well as some sort of revenue share for the lower budget, independent films that are struggling to see the light of the day. Smooth running ‘‘We have initiated conversations with firms handling the legal issues regarding streaming on international platforms, especially regarding the concerns of protection from piracy. Making a platform on our own would be ideal, as the data and content would remain with us, rather than with a third party, if we depend on an existing platform. In the initial period, we might have to engage consultants for the smooth running and to address streaming issues that might crop up,’’ says Mr. Karun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-own-ott-platform-likely-to-unroll-by-nov-1/article35182583.ece
07 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Sabarimala failed to woo voters: BJP||A meeting of BJP State office-bearers in Kasaragod on Tuesday reportedly went through the painful convulsions of examining the reasons for the party’s weak performance in the 2021 Assembly elections. As many as 60 leaders attended the conference. Some leaders argued that the BJP had tried and failed to garner Other Backward Classes, Dalit and Christian votes. The Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam and Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha gravitated towards the Left Democratic Front, rendering the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance impotent. The BJP was also unable to attract Christian votes in requisite numbers. A few opined that a significant section of voters arguably dismissed Sabarimala and ‘love jihad’ as a political gimmick to gain votes. Some felt the BJP should have cautioned its star national-level campaigners against harping on the issues. Often the BJP’s election rhetoric looked strident and hostile to undecided voters, particularly minorities. It disputably lacked appeal across the aisle and seemed tailor-made for the party’s traditional base. Other focus areas Some insisted that the party should have focussed on the Centre’s COVID-19 mitigation schemes and the vision of an emergent Kerala. A few alleged factional preferment in candidate selection and election fund allocation. They claimed inefficiency and lack of transparency in the handling of election funds. A few delegates claimed that the CPI(M) had coaxed BJP workers to desert the party in Palakkad and Varkala. They warned against keeping active workers out of the loop. The State leadership stressed the need for unity. The BJP resolved to find a path back to political relevance in Kerala. It tasked P. Sudhir, C. Krishnankumar, M.T. Ramesh, and George Kurian, all State general secretaries, and vice president A.N. Radhakrishnan to dissect the election campaign at the district level. BJP State president K. Surendran presided.

Kerala, which had been reporting 10,000-12,000 new cases a day on a regular basis for the past two or three weeks, reported 14,373 new cases on Tuesday when 1,31,820 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. The test positivity rate (TPR) also went up again on the day, touching 10.9%. The slow rise in cases is, however, yet to reflect on the State’s active case pool or hospitalisations, which have been remaining more or less steady for the past two weeks, presumably because the new cases and the recoveries reported daily are almost even. 10,751 recover The State’s active case pool now has 1,04,105 patients, with 10,751 reported to have recovered from the disease on Tuesday. The cumulative case fatality now stands at 13,960, with the State adding 142 deaths, which occurred in the past few days, to the official list of COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals with COVID-19 on Monday was 1,908, taking the total number of patients being treated for moderate or severe disease currently in hospitals to 24,139. Critically ill patients Total ICU admissions of critically ill patients dipped to 2,068 on Tuesday, while the number of patients requiring ventilator support also showed a dip at 765.

Training in using digital study equipment will be given to tribal children and, if need be, their parents. Study rooms (‘padanamuri’) will be set up in tribal settlements. The Chief Minister was addressing a meeting of District Collectors, district panchayat presidents, and Mayors on Tuesday in connection with a campaign to ensure digital education for all children in the State. The government believes all children need digital study equipment. Those who are in a position to buy equipment should avail themselves of interest-free loans announced by cooperative banks. Data collection Exact data on students who lack equipment should be collected under the aegis of school parent-teacher committees by conducting house visits. The data collection should be completed by July 15. A committee with grama panchayat/ward councillor as chairperson should be set up in schools. The school-level data should be codified by July 19 at the local body level and by July 21 at the district level to be handed over to the State-level mechanism. At the district level, a committee with district planning committee chairperson as head and the District Collector as convener will be set up. Those buying equipment for their child should be inspired to purchase equipment for another needy child as well, the Chef Minister said, calling for the support of all to turn the campaign into a mass movement. Participation of former students, well-wishers and cultural organisations should be ensured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/digital-education-will-be-ensured-for-all-pinarayi/article35182751.ece

Employees will be permitted to re-enter /amend their transfer-related options and a revised draft transfer list for 2021-22 will be published on July 12, the State-run water utility said in a July 5 order. This is the first time in the KWA that the general transfer process is being carried out online using the G-Spark software. The July 5 order noted that employees will be given the opportunity to re-enter their options by filing an application to their office heads. The latter are required to prepare the list of employees who have applied and submit before 5 p.m. on Tuesday. Individual applications will not be entertained, the KWA said. The employees who have their names in the list will be given time from 10 a.m. on Wednesday to 11.59 p.m. on Thursday to mention their options. The July 2 draft list had triggered a spate of complaints and employee organisations in the KWA had demanded immediate steps to redress the grievances. Soon after the first draft was published, unions representing KWA officers and other staff had urged the KWA management to sort out the issues and give employees the opportunity to re-submit options. In a July 3 letter to the KWA managing director, the KWA Employees Union (CITU) had pointed out that even employees who had not completed three years at a station had been listed for transfer to distant places although they had not requested it. In other cases, options given by employees were ignored, it had alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-transfer-list-kwa-issues-fresh-orders/article35182753.ece

Chinchurani has said that a vaccine manufacturing centre will soon come up at Palode The proposed unit, which has been granted approval by the Centre, will be established with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) assistance, she said. Inaugurating the World Zoonoses Day observance organised by Indian Veterinary Association (IVA) Kerala) here on Tuesday, she said the facility will manufacture vaccines both for animals and human beings. Attributing a majority of zoonosis outbreaks in Kerala to cattle import, Ms. Rani said the government will launch inspections at inter-State borders. “Quarantine for a week, or preferably 10 days, will be mandatory for all animals brought from other States. The Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development departments have also expressed willingness in taking over checkposts that have been lying vacant since the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) for the planned inspections,” she said. One Health approach Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development secretary Tinku Biswal, who delivered the keynote address, stressed on the need to push the One Health approach that entails due priority for human, animal and environment health. She questioned the commitment of the Animal Husbandry Department in ensuring the welfare of animals other than domesticated ones. Greater focus must be ensured towards the breeding practices and management of street dogs and other animals. Such factors have an impact on public health, Ms. Biswal said. Inaugurating a national seminar on ‘Multiple stakeholder approach in tackling emerging zoonoses’ on the occasion, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University Vice Chancellor M.R. Saseendranath said a wide range of issues including global warming, climate change and forest fires have led to an increasing trend of wild animals forced to leave their habitats and coming in contact with human beings. Such instances have led to transmission of zoonotic diseases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-unit-at-palode-soon-chinchurani/article35182761.ece

The concept which has been gaining traction among policy makers worldwide was key to the ongoing efforts in the prevention of zoonoses, they felt. Parag Nigam, Head, Wildlife Health Management, Wildlife Institute of India, who participated in the World Zoonoses Day observance here, called for inter-sectoral coordination among public health and veterinary services to deliver human and animal health interventions in rural areas. Proposing a shift from the classic approach to disease control, he also urged public health officials to think in terms of ecosystems that involved people, livestock, wildlife and natural communities. S.V.S. Mallik, principal scientist and head, Veterinary Public Health, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, said 868 (or 61%) of the known human pathogens were zoonotic in nature. Besides, 75% of emerging infectious diseases among humans including Ebola, HIV and influenza have an animal origin. Pathogen transfer According to him, pathogen transfer from wild species appears to be particularly prevalent, despite contact between humans and wildlife being rarer than with domestic animals. Public health expert B. Ekbal and Biju Soman, Professor, and Associate Dean (Health Sciences), Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies, also spoke at the session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/one-health-approach-to-tackle-zoonoses/article35182763.ece

The Sub-Inspector has been accused of assaulting Neyyattinkara resident Siyaj who had gone to the station for seeking permission for transporting soil. The alleged incident had taken place on February 7. While the commission had earlier ordered the Fort Assistant Commissioner to investigate the allegation, the latter had delegated the Thampanoor Circle Inspector with the responsibility. In his inquiry report that was found to be biased by the Commission, the Circle Inspector claimed there were several cases of illegal sand mining against the complainant. He, however, could not submit any documents to corroborate the claim. The report also did not prove the Sub-Inspector’s denial of the allegation against him. Stringent action must also be taken against the SI if he was found to be guilty. While the report must be submitted by July 30, the case will be considered on August 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-orders-probe-against-thampanoor-si/article35182765.ece
07 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Crackdown on illegal septage collection||The city Corporation has formed a special squad to crack down on vehicles being used for illegal septage collection, meat waste collection and drinking water distribution. In checks carried out over the past two days, the squad has seized two tankers involved in septage collection and drinking water distribution, without any license from the civic body. Four squads led by health inspectors have been formed with three members each for the purpose. The squads were formed in response to complaints, especially regarding illegal collection of septage and meat waste and dumping the same in public spaces and water bodies. Public can inform the squad regarding violations by calling 9496434517. It will function round the clock on a shift basis, since much of the illegal transport of waste happens during night time. “On the first day of checks, we found a tanker truck, which is not part of the Corporation's licensed list of septage collection vehicles, parked near Sreekaryam. Since there was no one inside the truck, we have seized the vehicle, which had an illegal sticker of the Corporation. The squads have been given the license plate numbers and owner details of all the vehicles used for septage collection and drinking water distribution. So, we can identify those who are operating illegally. The checks will continue in the coming days,” said Health Inspector S.S.Minu, who heads one of the special squads. As of now, there are 16 tankers which have been licensed by the Corporation for collection of septage waste. The city Corporation introduced a licensed system for private vehicles collecting septage waste in April 2019. Since then crores of litres of septage have been collected through the system, also becoming a new source of revenue for the civic body. The civic body thought about introducing a licensing system after they noticed rampant illegal collection across the city, with the collected waste being dumped in water bodies in different places. Public can log their requests for septage collection through the ‘Smart Trivandrum’ app, which can be downloaded from Google Playstore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crackdown-on-illegal-septage-collection/article35182768.ece

07 July 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Card to detect worms in goats||A farmer-friendly eye card, which can be used to detect worm infection in goats, has been developed by an Assistant Professor at the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (CVAS), Mannuthy. The ‘Anaemia Eye Card’, suitable for goats in humid tropics and can be used even by illiterate farmers, was developed as part of doctoral research by K. Syamala in the Department of Veterinary Parasitology, CVAS. Gastro-intestinal parasitism is deemed a major health concern in goats. Due to the indiscriminate use of anthelmintic (drug used to treat parasitic worm infection) for the control of helminth (worm) infection, anthelmintic resistance has become a concern in countries that majorly rear sheep or goats, says Dr. Syamala. Targeted selective treatment approach, using farmer-friendly tools, is found to be ideal for sustainable nematode control. Dr. Syamala’s eye card has been developed based on FAMACHA, an anaemia eye card developed in South Africa exclusively for sheep. Easy to use “The use of the card is quite simple. A farmer can compare the colour of conjunctival mucous membranes of the goat with the eye card, which has colour gradation depending on the infection severity,” Dr. Syamala says. For instance, anaemia scores (AS) corresponding to the colour of the membranes are calibrated as follows — AS 1: red, AS 2: red-pink, AS 3: pink, AS 4: pink-white and AS 5: white. Goats with AS 1 and AS 2 need not be treated, and those with AS 3 may be observed after two weeks for further evaluation and treatment. Goats with AS 4 and AS 5 have to be treated. With the effective utilisation of the eye card, it is possible to reduce the anthelmintic usage by about 72%. This will help avoid unnecessary use of medication and thus will contain drug resistance, notes Dr. Syamala. The eye card has been developed subsequent to the validation in 1,500 goats of 13 agro-ecological zones in the State. The research was conducted under the guidance of Dr. K. Devada, former director (Academics and Research), Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University  (KVASU). This project was carried out under the technical and financial support of the KVASU and Indian Council of Agricultural Research-All India Coordinated Research Project on ‘goat improvement’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/card-to-detect-worms-in-goats/article35182777.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||An attempt at shaking a societal norm||Dislodging ideas cast in stone requires more than a gentle push. In Sara's , director Jude Anthany Joseph and scriptwriter Akshay Hareesh attempt to shake from its foundation one such idea, which has been accepted as normal in society, and by extension in mainstream cinema. Sara (Anna Ben), an associate director in the film industry, wants to make a movie of her own. While working on the script for her dream debut, she meets Jeevan (Sunny Wayne) who is taking a break back home, away from the hectic life in the IT industry. They fall in love, with Sara especially being drawn to him for the fact that he shares her choice to remain child-free. But, as time passes, societal pressures begin to act on them. In his third outing too, Jude Anthany Joseph sticks to a woman-centric subject, but the similarity with the previous two films ends there, except for the relationship between Sara and her father, which is similar to the one in Ohm Shanthi Oshana . He also retains the somewhat light treatment that he gave for heavy subjects here too. It works at times, but at other times it leaves us wishing for something more concrete. What deserves applause though is the fact that the script never diverts from the central idea, which revolves around Sara's choice and her intense wish to become a filmmaker. The narrative is a deft balance between these two, for the societal pressures on her choice in turn has a bearing on her dream too. It also portrays her struggles to convince producers with her script. Brave reversal Yet, this is a brave reversal of years of glorification of motherhood and looking down upon those who dare to take a path of their choice. It is a study in contrast to films like the Salman Khan-starrer Sultan , which had a woman wrestler who was working towards an Olympic gold, giving up the dream after she becomes pregnant, with the script glorifying it. Anna Ben's assured performance goes a long way in propping up the film even in places where it sags due to below-par writing. Despite the glitches, Sara's is a commendable attempt at course correction on some deeply set societal norms. S.R. Praveen    Film: Sara's Starring: Anna Ben, Sunny Wayne Direction: Jude Anthany Joseph||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-attempt-at-shaking-a-societal-norm/article35182755.ece

07 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Have you seen if Twitter can control posts?’||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday asked the Uttar Pradesh police whether they had made basic inquiry on whether Twitter Communications India Pvt. Ltd. is “capable of controlling” the contents of a video related to assault on an elderly Muslim man in Ghaziabad before issuing a notice to the company’s managing director (MD) Manish Maheshwari. The court also asked the U.P. police whether they had ascertained whether Twitter India was an intermediary or not before summoning Mr. Maheshwari for questioning on behalf of Twitter in connection with a case registered for uploading and circulating the “communally sensitive” video. Justice G. Narendra posed these questions during the hearing of the petition filed by Mr. Maheshwari challenging the notice issued by the Loni Border police on June 21 asking him to join the investigation after he replied to their earlier notice of June 17 indicating that he was prepared to cooperate with the investigation through videoconference. To these questions, advocate P. Prasanna Kumar, appearing for the U.P. police, said the role of Twitter would have to be probed and the question of whether Twitter India was intermediary or responsible for controlling contents was a matter of investigation. Mr. Maheshwari was being summoned to ascertain persons responsible for controlling contents on behalf of the company as he has been designated as its MD, said Mr. Kumar “Is there anything to show there is some omission by Twitter... If there is an allegation under Section 376 [of IPC], potency is relevant. You are investigating against the company and to investigate you are required to identify the individual... This petitioner is nothing unless you can show he could have prevented it [circulation of video], the judge observed orally. Earlier, Mr. Kumar also contended that Mr. Maheshwari does not face the threat of arrest as he has been summoned only as a representative of Twitter India, which has been arraigned as an accused. It was also contended on behalf of the U.P. police that the High Court of Karnataka had no jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Maheshwari’s petition as neither whole or part of cause of action had arisen from the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. However, Senior Advocate C.V. Nagesh, appearing for Mr. Maheshwari, made it clear that Mr. Maheshwari was prepared to appear before the U.P. police physically for questioning but he expects an undertaking from the police that he would not be taken into custody as he was not a legal representative of Twitter India but was a mere employee. Referring to data of the Registrar of Companies (RoC) produced along with the petition on who are directors of Twitter India, Mr. Nagesh said that U.P. police could have got the information on who are the legal representatives of Twitter India. Mr. Nagesh, from the RoC records, read out three names, Sean Jeffrey Edgett, Winston Sei Seng Foo, and Anup Ashok Malashetty, stating that these are the three directors of Twitter India. The Senior Advocate also said it is the Twitter Inc, U.S., which has control over the contents and not Twitter India. The court adjourned further arguments till July 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/have-you-seen-if-twitter-can-control-posts/article35182168.ece
07 July 2021||Ghaziabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mathura court denies bail to Kerala journalist||A Mathura court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who has been in jail for nine months for various offences under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). In his bail order, additional sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey stated that “considering the seriousness of evidence”, the court did not deem it fit to release the accused on bail. The judge observed the charge against Mr. Kappan was that he, along with a co-accused, promoted enmity in society and affected communal harmony. The court also said during the course of the investigation, incriminating material was recovered from him, and that he had received foreign funding for damaging the integrity of the country. The court further said though Mr. Kappan described himself as a journalist, the identity card found on him was that of a news organisation that had wound up its operations in 2018. Mr. Kappan was arrested along with three others on October 4, 2020, at Mant in Mathura district, when they were heading towards Hathras village, where a Dalit girl had been allegedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper caste men.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mathura-court-denies-bail-to-kerala-journalist/article35182209.ece

Pat for officials “I am happy to note that the devastating wave of COVID-19 has abated to an extent and the case positive ratio has fallen to 3.36%. But we should be on the guard until the vaccination process is over. I appreciate the efforts of the administration and thank all the District Collectors for the wonderful work they have done. The entire administration, from the Collector down to the revenue and police personnel, and ASHA workers, has done well. The multiple strategies we have adopted, including imposition of partial curfew from May 5 and door-to-door fever surveys, have yielded good results,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy during the weekly review of the Spandana programme held on Tuesday with all District Collectors, Superintendents of Police and other heads of departments. Reiterating that one had to live with COVID-19, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government would ensure that everyone was vaccinated. He also said that the fever survey should be continued under the supervision of the Joint Collectors and ‘104’ helpline should be continued. “Ensure that Rt-PCR tests are continued as these are gold standard tests to identify positive cases. I also direct the Collectors to ensure that all COVID-19 designated hospitals are supervised and all facilities, including quality of food, availability of oxygen and sanitation, are monitored and a review held for every 15 days,” he said. He further said that COVID-19 services were offered at 322 hospitals, where 4,592 ICU beds and 3,196 nNon-ICU beds were available. There were 15,309 oxygen beds available. He also directed that all the hospitals be covered with CCTV network. Paediatric wards “We are not sure whether there will be a third wave, and we are also not sure of its effect on children. But we should remain on high alert and not let the guard down. Special paediatric wards should be set up at all the teaching hospitals. We are setting up 10 Litre oxygen plants at major hospitals,” the Chief Minister said. He also asked the Collectors to formulate an action plan for the next two months. On vaccination, he said that 1.28 crore people had been vaccinated so far. Of them, 32.58 lakh had received the jab twice and 96.25 lakh once. Inoculation of those below 45 years could start if the process for those above 45 years was completed. The Chief Minister also said that 16 teaching hospitals were being set up and incentives being given to private establishments who were willing to invest in the State. E-cropping Mr. Jagan also spoke on agriculture and asked the officials to focus on e-cropping, which could provide a one-stop solution to the problems faced in input subsidy, insurance, procurement and crop loans. He said that every cop was being geo-fenced. “We are celebrating July 8 as Farmers’ Day, and Rythu Bharosa Chaitanya Yatras will be held from July 9. I am directing the Agriculture Department to take action against those selling fake seeds and ensure loans are disbursed to tenant farmers,” he said. The Chief Minister appreciated the efforts of the Panchayat Raj and Rural Development departments in ensuring 17 crore person days. Minister for Health Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas and DGP Gautam Sawang were other present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chief-minister-plans-weekly-visits-to-the-ward-village-secretariats/article35182706.ece

07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Revanth meets sulking leaders||Newly appointed State Congress chief A. Revanth Reddy spent better part of his day on Tuesday calling on the sulking seniors, who missed the bus to become the TPCC president. An indication of all was not well within the party after Mr. Revanth Reddy’s elevation was available as TPCC vice-president Mallu Ravi visited the house of CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on Tuesday morning. He held brief discussion with Mr. Bhatti, who incidentally is also his brother. The CLP leader was in the race for the TPCC president’s post till he was pipped by Mr. Revanth Reddy, who managed to win the confidence of the central leadership. In the last one week, Mr. Revanth Reddy too met all the seniors, who by and large toed the party line and did not make an issue of the new appointments. He consciously avoided meeting party seniors like outgoing chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, Bhatti Vikramarka, T. Jayaprakash Reddy, D. Sridhar Babu and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and others. An impression was doing the round that he would not be able to garner the support of the sulking leaders. Nevertheless, he made a attempt to reach out to the party seniors. Accordingly, after Dr. Mallu Ravi met Mr. Bhatti, the new TPCC chief called on the latter at his residence. This was followed by visit to the houses of Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy, Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy and Mr. Sridhar Babu. Unity mantra Dramatically, after Mr. Revanth Reddy visited the residences of Mr. Bhatti, Mr. Uttam and Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy, leaders began singing unity mantra. Party sources maintained that backroom efforts were on since the last few days with TPCC vice-president Kusum Kumar, newly elected working president Mahesh Kumar Goud and AICC secretary Sampath Kumar who are understood to have prepared the ground for Mr. Revanth Reddy to meet the leaders, who till the last minute nurtured hopes of getting the coveted post. It was pointed out that Mr. Bhatti, Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy and others had different reasons to be indifferent towards Mr. Revanth’s elevation. “Mr. Bhatti and Mr. Sridhar Babu were upset that their integrity had been questioned after they met Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at Pragathi Bhavan in connection with the lock-up death of Mariyamma,” a senior Congress leaders told The Hindu . It was also noted that some other seniors were particularly irked by some social media posts showing them in poor light. One leader, whom Mr. Revanth Reddy met on Tuesday openly lamented that he was provoked to react against such posts. However, at the end of the day, Mr. Bhatti told reporters that all Congressmen should work towards victory of the party in elections. He extended all out support for Mr. Revanth Reddy in his new stint. Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy too said he would abide by the high command decision. “The time to compete for posts is over now. We all have to work together and refrain from groupism,” he said. AICC in-charge Manickam Tagore told The Hindu that with the new committee in place the party will go ahead with a united front. “We are strong now and Congress alone can defeat the TRS,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-chief-meets-sulking-leaders/article35182518.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||All-party meet asks TS to take all concerned on board||An all-party meeting organised on the Krishna water issue here on Tuesday suggested that the State government take along all political parties and organisations to exert pressure on the Centre for an early resolution to the water sharing row between the two Telugu-speaking States. The meeting also proposed to form a committee with democratic voices from the two States to prevent further escalation of the dispute and work for an amicable resolution to the issue based on international and national water sharing treaties, which advocate meeting the needs of backward areas within the basin before focusing on meeting the needs outside the basin. Representatives of the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Telangana Jana Samithi, Telugu Desam Party, Telangana Inti Party, Retired Engineers Association, Telangana Vidyavanthula Vedika, Arunodaya Samskruthika Samakhya, Engineers Forum and several others organisations and parties participated and spoke at the round-table meeting organised by Telangana Journalists Forum (TJF) president Palle Ravi Kumar. The meeting felt that giving Krishna water to fluoride-affected areas of combined Nalgonda, Rangareddy and drought-prone areas would prevent the fluoride impact on human and animal health before planning its diversion to other areas. The speakers suggested designing of projects without keeping the interests of contracts in mind and complete all pending projects at the earliest. Demanding that the State government publish a white paper on the expenditure made as part of utilising the share of river water, the all-party meeting also wanted to know the amount spent on Krishna Basin projects in Telangana. The speakers also underscored the need to allay apprehensions over collusion of State and Central Governments and contractors in the matter of irrigation projects. They felt that natural law in river water sharing was that preference should be given to the basin areas by apportioning it based on the proportion of catchment area. They also criticised the State government’s lopsided and attitude in the matter of water, funds and jobs on which the movement for statehood was run. Former MPs G. Vivekanand, A.P. Jitender Reddy and Mallu Ravi, Prof. M. Kodandaram, former MLAs Nandyala Narsimha Reddy and S. A. Sampath Kumar, Ujjini Ratnakar Rao, Cheruku Sudhakar, Dasoju Sravan, Vimalakka, B.

Chandrasekharan, to appear before it on Wednesday in connection with the agency’s probe in the Karipur gold smuggling case. Shafi is on parole. Arjun Ayanki of Kannur, an accused in the gold smuggling case, had told investigators that he had the backing of Shafi and ‘Kodi’ Suni, who had also been convicted in the murder of Chandrasekharan.

07 July 2021||Shivapura,ANDHRA PRADESH||Across Karnataka on foot, without a penny in pocket||Vivekananda H.K., 53, is walking across Karnataka with the aim of “reviving human values”. What is unique about his journey is that he is travelling without a rupee in his pocket and has vowed not to touch currency, literally. In the last 247 days, he has covered nearly 7,500 km on foot. He has been carrying just a backpack and a bottle for water. He has interacted with thousands of people along the way. At night, he sleeps wherever he feels comfortable. He eats whatever is offered by the people.  The Hindu met him while he was at Shivapura, near Tarikere, earlier this week. A native of Hoskote in Bengaluru Rural district, Mr. Vivekananda pursued a postgraduate degree in history, and followed it up with a diploma in journalism and film production. Then, he began making ad films. Meeting people For almost 25 years, he hardly got down from his car. “I was always travelling by car as part of my work. Now, this journey by foot has helped me visit innumerable villages and meet lakhs of people. I have met many interesting people who have been working for the betterment of society in their own way,” he said. His mother, wife and son reside in Bengaluru. “I gave whatever I had saved to my family, and my mother gets a pension,” said Mr. Vivekananda. He no longer touches currency. “I don’t touch money. If you wish to get me a water bottle, you have to come to a shop and get it for me. Except on few occasions, I have not missed lunch or dinner, thanks to the generosity of people,” he added. Mr. Vivekananda speaks of truth, honesty and non-violence with the people he meets. If politicians, senior officers, journalists, doctors, lawyers and teachers remain true to their conscience, this could be a better world, he said. On an average, he covers 30 km in a day. The long walk, which began at Nagamarapalli in Aurad taluk of Bidar district on November 1, 2020, is expected to end in December this year at Chamarajanagar. He has weathered the cold winter and the hot summer. Now, he is bracing for the heavy rains in Chikkamagaluru and Udupi districts. Social media posts Amidst the lockdown forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, he did not stop walking. He was able to meet friends and well-wishers along the route because of his social media posts. “I have been active on Facebook and other social media platforms. People who are on my friends’ list are aware of my route. They welcome me and offer food and water,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/across-karnataka-on-foot-without-a-penny-in-pocket/article35182167.ece

07 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Herpes claims life of another elephant calf in Kottoor camp||Elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus (EEHV) has claimed a second life at the Kottoor elephant rehabilitation centre. Arjun, a four-and-a-half-year-old elephant calf, was found dead in its enclosure on Monday midnight. It was only a week ago that another calf, Sreekutty, had succumbed to infection caused by the herpes virus. Arjun had been rescued by the Forest Department from Mannarkkad in Palakkad at a young age. Symptoms While two other calves had then been diagnosed with the disease, one more has begun to display symptoms. The symptomatic female calf Podichi, aged six, has been quarantined at the facility. Two-and-a-half-year-old Kannan, whose health had deteriorated during the last few days shortly after testing positive for herpes virus, has shown slight improvement. However, he is not yet out of danger. The health condition of the other infected calf, Amena, aged one-and-a-half years, has remained stable thus far, Thiruvananthapuram Wildlife Warden J.R. Ani said. T. Rajeev, assistant director of the Kudappanakunnu Multidisciplinary Veterinary Hospital, who is part of a four-member team constituted to monitor the outbreak and treat the infected animals, said Arjun’s health worsened rapidly within a few hours after showing no symptoms during the last few days. Some of the infected animals have shown lesions and cyanosis on their tongues, which was an indicator of the low levels of oxygen in the Central arterial blood. All of the surviving nine elephant calves aged less than 10 years have been kept on medication, which essentially involved administering the anti-viral drug acyclovir along with anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief. Chief Wildlife Warden Bennichen Thomas, who visited the centre, issued directions to keep these elephants in isolation and minimise their contact with others in the facility. Mahouts who had handled the deceased elephants have been asked to manage the infected animals for the time being. The Kerala Fire and Rescue Services has been called to sanitise their enclosures. Forest Chief Veterinary Officer Arun Zachariah is expected to reach the centre on Wednesday. Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran said all possible efforts will be made to protect the elephants at the rehabilitation centre. Efforts will also be made to prevent such outbreaks at the centre after the completion of the ongoing expansion project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/herpes-claims-life-of-another-elephant-calf-in-kottoor-camp/article35182174.ece

Addressing the media, Mr. Keshav said that he, in the capacity of PAC Chairman, differed with the reported move to bring the hill temple under the committee’s fold, and said that he would speak to the members of the TTD Trust Board and, if required, share his opinion with the Governor. In a terse comment, he said the government’s interference in the functioning of religious bodies was totally unwanted. “Further, how far is it fair to gain control or authority over the functioning of religious institutions on the pretext of rectifying the anomalies in the system?” he questioned. If the government really desired to supervise the religious bodies, it should bring guidelines for their better functioning, he said. “Over 100 crore devotees attach great reverence to the Tirumala temple,” he added. Mr. Keshav said there were reports that the TTD board had resolved to bring the temple under the purview of the PAC. “For this, the resolution should first be sent to the Governor who, in turn, shall give his approval to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Only then the proposal will become a reality,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-interference-in-religious-bodies-unwanted-pac-chief/article35182708.ece

The statues of ‘Telugu Thalli’, legendary classical singer M.S. Subbulakshmi, and the idol of ‘Poornakumbham’, situated in close proximity at the heart of the city, were installed over a period of time. The busy traffic junction that connects the APSRTC bus station with the railway over bridge used to be called by any of the above names. However, the statues removed recently to facilitate erection of the road sections over the pillars were kept at a corner of the project work site. “In view of its proximity to the central bus station, the same spot is used by the public for purposes other than intended, such as urinating, drinking alcohol etc.”, charged Congress leader P. Naveen Reddy. Responding to a call by linguists and Telugu activists, who bemoaned the situation, he rushed to the spot and found the statues in a state of disarray. “The onus of preserving the statues lies on the TTD, the civic body and the project executing agency,” he said, recalling that M.S. Subbulakshmi had served the TTD as its court poetess (Asthana Vidushi).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/call-to-preserve-statues-removed-due-to-construction-of-garuda-varadhi/article35182696.ece

07 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Zoonoses Day sees low-key celebrations||Owning a pet dog or a cat is no more a status symbol and hence is no yardstick to one’s economic well-being. And, it was evident at World Zoonoses Day celebrations organised on Tuesday. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, pet lovers brought their dogs and cats to the ‘Pasuvala aasupatri’, Super Speciality Veterinary Hospital (SSVH), here for getting their dogs and cats vaccinated. The hospital premises was filled with dog lovers and their pets by 9 a.m. The environs were reverberating with barks and growls, while the dog owners exchanged their experiences with fellow dog lovers. While the Pomeranian breed dogs were seen in large numbers, Border Collie, Bull Mastiff, Dacshhund, Indian Spitz, Labrador and, of course, Chinese Pugs were some of the other breeds that were brought for vaccination. Of all the dogs that were lined up for vaccination, Great Dane or German Mastiff, is stated to be the tallest dog. Shih Tzu, Chihuahua are some of the new Chinese breeds that were seen at the hospital. As everyone was looking at these tiny dogs, a pride owner said that there were very few Chihuahua breed in the city. The cost of the dog was a little bit higher compared to other breeds. But, Chihuahuas were very friendly, he said. SSVH Joint Director GVN Tagore says that more than 1,000 registrations were witnessed. The government supplied about 5,000 doses of vaccine, Mr. Tagore said. The vaccination programme would continue throughout the year. In view of the pandemic, the celebrations were a low key affair. Initially, it was planned to organise awareness camps and programmes, but for the pandemic. The pet owners could bring their pets through the year, he says. Significance of occasion Explaining the importance of Zoonoses Day, he said it was celebrated on July 6 every year to bring the problem into people’s consciousness, and remind them to take action. It was observed to commemorate the administration of the first anti-rabies vaccination by Louis Pasteur in 1885. Zoonoses are diseases and infections, which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man. Rabies was most deadliest disease that transmitted from animals to man, he said, adding that vaccination of dogs was must to prevent rabies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/zoonoses-day-sees-low-key-celebrations/article35182801.ece

07 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Further hearing against APSDC tomorrow||The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday adjourned to July 8 the hearing on a PIL plea that challenged the creation of the A.P. State Development Corporation (APSDC), for which an enabling legislation had been passed in the Assembly last year. Appearing for the State, senior advocate Dushyant Dave and Advocate- General S. Sriram argued that the PIL filed by Visakhapatnam East MLA V. Ramakrishna Babu was a ploy to stop the banks from funding. Claiming that the APSDC Act, 2020, was one of the most welcome legislations by any State as part of its welfare measures, Mr. Dave insisted that the petition deserved to be dismissed at the admission stage. He further said that all the monies provided to the corporation were through the Consolidated Fund (CF) and by Appropriation Bills. Therefore, the petitioner’s apprehensions had no basis, he said. Mr. Ramakrishna Babu’s main contention was that the power given by the APSDC Act to the government to directly assign its revenues to the corporation without crediting the same to the CF was in violation of Article 266 of the Constitution. He also challenged the proposed transfer of lands and buildings in Visakhapatnam district to the APSDC free of cost to provide security for a Rs. 25,000-crore loan availed by it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/further-hearing-against-apsdc-tomorrow/article35182713.ece

07 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Keep corruption at bay, transport officials told||Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah on Tuesday urged officials of the department to maintain transparency and keep corruption at bay in their day-to-day work. Addressing a State-level meeting of the Deputy Transport Commissioners (DTCs) and Regional Transport Officers (RTOs), the Minister said the department was a very important wing of the government. He said reports surfacing at regular intervals of staff in the office resorting to corruption in issuing LLR, driving licence and fitment certificates upset him, and signing their suspension orders or punishment orders was painful for him. Principal Secretary, Department of Transport, M.T. Krishna Babu, raised concern over the increasing number of deaths in road accidents. On an average, he said, at least 25 deaths were being registered in the State every day. To minimise deaths in road accidents, the Centre had created an Integrated Road Accident Data Base (IRAD), a central accident database management system, that would help in analysing causes of road accidents and devising safety interventions, he said. Developed by the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-Madras), the app would be implemented by the National Informatics Centre and the World Bank-supported project’s cost was Rs. 258 crore, he informed, adding that the purpose of the project was on-site collection of accident data. He said the State was allocated Central funds of Rs. 50 crore to identify and remove the black spots causing accidents. Mr. Krishna Babu said despite impediments like COVID-19 pandemic, the transport sector had been working effectively, serving people of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/keep-corruption-at-bay-transport-officials-told/article35182802.ece

Ramakrishna said that as per Section 85 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) had been formed. “But it is a temporary arrangement. The Central government has not fixed the responsibilities and powers of the board,” he said. Though the water levels were below the minimum drawing level, Telangana was unilaterally drawing waters for power generation, he said. It was a blatant violation of the agreements regarding water sharing, he said. Telangana was drawing 2 tmcft every day to generate power ignoring the instructions of the KRMB. “It is necessary to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. Also, it is necessary to lead an all-party delegation to the Centre for a solution,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-demands-all-party-meeting-on-water-row/article35182710.ece
07 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||It is a ‘jobless’ job calendar, says TDP||The TDP has found fault with the State government for including the ward / village volunteers in the list of jobs created. “The government has not issued a single employment notification in the last two years, but is making tall claims,” TDP State president K. Atchannaidu alleged in a statement on Tuesday. When the volunteers had demanded an increase in their honorarium, the government washed its off saying that theirs was a voluntary service, he said. “But they have been mentioned in the job calendar as full time government jobs,” Mr. Atchannaidu said. What Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had released was a “jobless job calendar,” which had given a rude shock to the unemployed youth, he said. “By announcing 10,000 vacancies against the promise of creating 2.30 lakh jobs, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy will be remembered as a betrayer of the unemployed youth,” the TDP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/it-is-a-jobless-job-calendar-says-tdp/article35182711.ece

07 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Was city’s COVID toll under-reported?||All along the second wave of COVID-19, which had reached its peak during the months of April and May this year, there were unconfirmed reports that the death toll was much higher than the figures given in the bulletin issued by the State, or the district administration. While the official figures give a picture of moderate death count, the death certificates issued by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) tell a different story. The GVMC records indicate that the death count may be about four times higher than the official count, especially in the month of May, when the average death count of the previous years are taken into consideration. Increase in fatalities In 2019, a year before the pandemic, the total number of deaths recorded under the 98 wards of the GVMC limits was 12,535 (January to December). In 2020, when the city was hit by the first wave of the pandemic, the total number of deaths recorded was 15,454. The increase in the number fatalities was 2,919. This can be considered a bit abnormal, considering the first wave of the pandemic prevalent in 2020. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 recorded till December 31, 2020, was 522. The city, therefore, saw 2,400 more deaths by the end of 2020, which were probably categorised as natural, or under other heads. Huge disparity The margin of abnormality increased in 2021. Till May 31, the GVMC had recorded 8,825 deaths, including 4,306 in the May alone and 1,352 in April. And these were categorised as natural, unnatural, and COVID-19. The second wave of the COVID pandemic had swept the city during both these months. The abnormality in the count stands out if we compare it with the number of deaths recorded during the corresponding months in 2019 and 2020. But, as per the figures released by the government, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the district in the month of April was about 57 and 299 in May. The number of infections recorded was close to 16,400 in April and 58,000 in May. On an average, even if 800 to 900 is taken as the number of deaths under the GVMC limits per month, the figures in April and May are on the higher side, indicating that the toll is at least four times more than that stated. But there is no scientific data to prove that the excess deaths are due to COVID-19. Doctors’ version Doctors who had treated the COVID-19 patients say that the toll was higher than stated, and that the highest number of deaths recorded in the CSR block of KGH on a particular day in the month of May was 35, when the official count in the district never crossed 12 or 13, even during the peak of the second wave. However, officials say that the discrepancy in the figures is due to the methodology adopted in recording the COVID-19 deaths. A death was considered as due to COVID-19 only if the patient was certified positive through the Rt-PCR test and the result was uploaded in the ICMR website. The death of patients who had tested positive through CT scans or rapid antigen test, and whose reports were not included in the ICMR data, was not recorded under COVID-19. ‘False negatives’ The other reason attributed to the discrepancy is that about 30% of the Rt- PCR and 40% of the rapid antigen tests are ‘false negative’. A senior doctor from the KGH also said that many patients who had succumbed to COVID-19 had reached the hospitals very late without getting tested. These also did not reflect as COVID-19 deaths, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/was-vizags-covid-toll-under-reported/article35182230.ece

While the scenic tourist spots and waterfalls located in the Agency areas under the purview of Integrated Tribal Development Agency(ITDA) reopened on Tuesday, those under Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) have resumed their activities a few days ago and have now extended working hours till 5 p.m. “All the APTDC hotels and restaurants are being run normally. But the tourist spots were opened a few days ago. Borra Caves, all the beaches and the boating activities were also resumed. We have arranged sanitisers and are ensuring physical distancing is followed,” said Divisional Manager, APTDC, Visakhapatnam Region, T.G. Prasad Reddy. Day packages According to Mr. Prasad Reddy, following the partial curfew and relaxation hours decided by the State government, they have come up with day packages for the tourists also. The ITDA has permitted reopening of Girigrama darshini at Peda Labudu in Araku mandal, tribal museum at the mandal headquarters, Padmapuram gardens, Chaparai waterfalls in Dumbriguda, Kothapalli waterfalls in G.Madugula, Tajangi and Lambasingi from Tuesday. However, tourist spots which are run by Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA), including Kailasagiri, Tenneti Park, Ropeway, Kursura submarine museum and TU-142 aircraft museums, are yet to reopen. Similarly, Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP) is also yet to reopen. “We are yet to take a decision on reopening of the tourist places,” said VMRDA Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao. Though the tourism activity was hit due to the COVID-19 second wave since March mid week, officials from the APTDC have generated good revenue during the pandemic by supplying food to COVID-19 patients. In May, the APTDC had generated a revenue of about Rs. 2 crore. Nutritious food “The APTDC is supplying nutritious food to all the patients undergoing treatment for the infection in all the COVID-19 hospitals run by the State government. The corporation was able to generate some revenue, so that salaries of the employees were paid during the second wave,” said Mr. Prasad Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/several-tourist-places-reopen-in-visakhapatnam-district/article35182733.ece

Welcoming the huge response from the public, they alleged that the GVMC has tried to discourage people from responding to the proposal. “The corporation did not arrange any desk or at least a counter to receive responses at sachivalayams and zonal offices in the city. They also did not accept ‘tapalas’ and moreover no email ID was provided to receive responses. Apart from all these, the corporation released the draft notification right in the midst of the COVID-19 second wave and asked people to submit responses within a month. Under these difficult circumstances, people submitted their responses in a huge number and this should be appreciated. People understood that levying property tax on the basis of capital value will be a burden,” said VARWA General Secretary B.B. Ganesh. The members also demanded that the corporation organise a debate in the council and reject the hike and amendments to the property tax system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/huge-response-from-people-against-property-tax-hike/article35182813.ece

The meeting was attended by Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao and several other ruling party leaders. The woman sarpanch’s criticism of the scheme of left ruling party leaders perplexed.

07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No COVID jab at govt. centres on Wednesdays and Sundays||COVID-19 vaccination will not be conducted at Government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (GCVCs) on Wednesdays and Sundays. However, routine vaccination for children and women would be held on Wednesdays, said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao. An order to this effect was issued to District Medical and Health Officers (DMHO) too. However, the slots for COVID-19 jab would be available at Private COVID Vaccination Centres (PCVC) on Wednesdays. As part of routine immunisation, children are administered BCG vaccine and vaccine against hepatitis. Pregnant women too are administered some vaccines. “The routine immunisation programme was bare minimum in the past few months since a large number of people were turning up at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) for COVID vaccination. Now, the routine immunisation will pick up. Out reach camps too would be conducted on fourth Saturdays of every month,” said an official from the Health department. Demand for the jabs at GCVCs spiked after the government opened first dose vaccination for everyone aged above 18 years. While slots have to be booked on CoWIN portal for one to get the jab at GCVCs in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and Urban Local Bodies (ULB), potential beneficiaries can walk in for the vaccination at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in rural areas. Meanwhile, private hospitals in the State are witnessing a slowdown in the rush for vaccines. Vaccination for people in the 18-44 group was initially restricted to Private COVID Vaccination Centres (PCVCs). Since there was heavy demand for vaccination from this age group, slots on CoWIN were booked in span of a few minutes. In fact, people formed groups on social media platforms to pass on information about slot availability at various centres. Wide availability Employees of corporate hospitals said that the demand has come down now. “The main reason is wide availability of the vaccine doses. The government, too, is offering it free of cost. Besides, lakhs of people received the vaccine in May and June. So the demand for jabs at PCVCs now has dropped,” said an employee of a corporate hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-covid-jab-at-govt-centres-on-wednesdays-and-sundays/article35182486.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Balanagar flyover inaugurated||Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao has broached the rankling issue of Defence lands yet again and said the Central government has not been giving any clarity for the last four years on alienation of the lands for construction of skyways. Speaking at a meeting after inauguration of the Balanagar flyover on Tuesday, Mr. Rama Rao said the State government is ready for construction of skyways between Patny and Suchitra Junction and between Jubilee Bus Station and Turkapally through HMDA, but the works could not be initiated due to the Centre’s non-cooperation. For the last four years, there is no word from the Central government about the land allocation due to which the structures are being delayed, the minister lamented. The State government could take up the works at Suchitra Junction even if the Centre does not come forward, he announced. Road widening works too will be taken up at Bachupally and Qutbullahpur, he added. Mr. Rama Rao has announced that the Balanagar flyover will be named after the Dalit icon Babu Jagjivan Ram on whose birth anniversary the structure was inaugurated. Official orders will be issued soon. To mark the occasion, the minister made a labourer Shivamma from Wanaparthi district, who had been working in the construction of the flyover, cut the ribbon and launch the flyover. During the first phase of the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP), close to Rs. 1,000 crore worth works including road widening and underpasses have been completed in Kukatpally constituency alone, while more works are under progress, he said. The flyover cost has come down to Rs. 275 crore from the estimated Rs. 385 crore owing to cut down in road widening extent based on the request by local people. The remaining funds will be used for road widening and developmental works in the surroundings, the minister shared. The flyover allows the vehicle riders to avoid Narsapur Crossroads and Fathenagar Junction which have been experiencing severe traffic congestion for the past several years, a note from HMDA informed. The six-lane flyover is 24 metres wide with central median and 1.13 kilometres long. The 30-metre road has been widened to 45 metres, after acquisition of 357 properties, the note said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/balanagar-flyover-inaugurated/article35182501.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Use of Krishna water: HC serious over senior counsel, AG||Senior counsel Vedula Venkataramana and Telangana Advocate General B.S. Prasad invited the wrath of High Court on Tuesday over the contentions they made in a writ petition challenging State government’s order on use of Krishna water for hydel power generation. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy found fault with senior counsel appearing for the petitioners and the AG representing Telangana government before declaring that it would hear the petition and fix the date. Two farmers from Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh moved the House Motion two days ago by filing a writ petition which questioned the GO 34 issued by State government for withdrawal of Krishna water for irrigation or hydel power generation needs. The HC did not permit the House Motion. Mr. Vedula Venkataramana made a mention of the plea before a division bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar on Monday. This second division bench of the HC took up hearing of the matter brushing aside objections raised by the AG who said it should be taken up by the First Court (a bench headed by the CJ) as per the roster. The bench posted the matter to Tuesday, instructing counsel to study the Supreme Court verdict on inter-State water disputes to take a call on the petition’s maintainability. Before the second bench began hearing the petition (which was listed as second item for Tuesday), the AG made a mention about the plea before the First Court headed by the CJ and requested that it should hear the matter. He contended that as per the roster, the content of the petition comes under First Court. The Chief Justice told the AG to inform Mr. Vedula Venkataramana of the mention he had made. Immediately, the AG appeared before the second bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar and requested for deferment of the hearing explaining that he raised the issue before the First Bench. Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao said the bench had already heard the petition partly the previous day and there was no communication from First Court that it would hear the plea. At this juncture, Mr. Vedula Venkataramana informed the bench that the AG filed an interlocutory application stating that there was a possibility of Telangana’s interests being affected since Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao hailed from AP. “This is highly unbecoming of the AG office to file such application,” the judge observed. He repeated his previous day’s remark that such action amounted to “bench hunting”. Later, both senior counsel and the AG appeared before the First Court in the matter when the bench headed by the CJ took exception to their contentions over the petition. The bench expressed serious concern over the interlocutory application filed by State government stating that its interests would be affected since Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao hailed from AP. It instructed the AG to immediately withdraw the application. The AG immediately agreed. The bench made it clear that such contention was not correct. The bench expressed serious dissatisfaction over the manner in which senior lawyer Vedula Venkataramana approached the HC with regard to the writ petition. The lawyer moved House Motion on Sunday. When the HC Registry raised some technical errors in the plea, counsel took a day to rectify the same. Even before the Registry, which was not given adequate time to carry out the corrections, the lawyer made a mention of the petition before second bench on Monday, the bench said. “Is this not bench hunting?” the CJ said noting that while inter-State water disputes-related matters were allocated to the First Court, some matters relating to AP Reorganisation Act were assigned to the second bench. There was some overlapping of subjects to be dealt by the two benches. The petition filed by the farmers comprised matters relating to both subjects. The Registry required sufficient time to ascertain before which bench the petition was to be placed. Without providing such time to the Registry, senior counsel sought an urgent hearing before second bench, the CJ said noting that it was not in good taste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-serious-over-senior-counsel-ag/article35182515.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS to continue struggle for rights in Krishna water||The State government has decided to continue its uncompromising struggle for protection of the interests of Telangana on all the available platforms for securing its rights on sharing Krishna river water. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has made it clear that the government will not compromise on its resolve to secure Telangana’s share in Krishna water and is committed to protect the interests of farmers of the State.

Accordingly, it was decided to raise the issue in the forthcoming Parliament session for protection of the State’s interests. The State has been highlighting the need to protect its interests in securing the share in Krishna waters to the Central government. It had left no stone unturned in raising its concerns with the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal and the Krishna River Management Board till date. Tuesday’s meeting discussed threadbare the injustice that had been meted out to Telangana over the past few decades and the methodology that should be adopted to secure the State’s rights in Krishna waters. The more than six-hour meeting had resolved to ensure that there should not be any more deprival to the State, especially when Telangana was under “self-rule”. The Chief Minister was particular that the State should secure its rights on the water front and had asked the officials concerned to plan strategies in accordance with the State’s requirements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-to-continue-struggle-for-rights-in-krishna-water/article35182525.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||MSME Prerana unveiled||Telangana Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao on Tuesday appealed to banks not to invoke provisions of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, against micro, small and medium enterprises defaulting on loan repayments without assessing viability of the businesses. Seeking to highlight the significance of banks differentiating between large industrial and MSME borrowers, he said use of the Act even in case of one or two defaults by the latter led to closure of the enterprises and industrial sickness. Viability study Ahead of initiating action, under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, the banks should undertake a techno-economic viability study of the units, he said. Public sector banks can stand out by adopting such an approach and instil confidence among micro and small entrepreneurs, Mr. Rama Rao said, referring to the Telangana Industrial Health Clinic initiative of the State government to address incipient sickness in MSMEs. The Minister was speaking at the launch of MSME Prerana, a unique and innovative business mentoring programme of Indian Bank. The programme in Telugu is to develop managerial and financial capabilities of MSME entrepreneurs besides creating awareness of various initiatives taken by the Centre and State governments and other agencies. Collaboration proposed Hailing the bank, the Minister proposed a collaboration between Telangana State Finance Corporation and Indian Bank to develop innovative mechanisms to support MSMEs, especially to address their issue of collateral by way of creating a revolving fund. Noting that Indian Bank was associated with some of the biggest programmes of the State government such Kaleshwaram and Mission Bhagiratha projects, Mr. Rama Rao said there were many more areas for collaboration, including for development of women entrepreneurship through the WE Hub. WE Hub partnership Indian Bank MD and CEO Padmaja Chunduru said the bank was keen to associate with T-Hub, by way of an MoU, to extend support to startups. It would also explore the possibility of working with WE Hub. On MSME Prerana, she said the bank wanted to equip the entrepreneurs with relevant knowledge and enhance their confidence as well as decision making abilities. The bank has launched the programme in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, besides in Telangana, and intends to roll out in all major languages pan India in a phased manner. Indian Bank’s Credit Deposit ratio in Telangana is around 179% as against the commercial bank average of 110%, she said. On the need for credit discipline among borrowers, Ms. Chunduru said the bank was restructuring loans under certain government schemes. Senior officials of the bank and Telangana Industries and IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan addressed the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/indian-bank-unveils-msme-prerana/article35182491.ece

07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Outsourced nurses seek extension of job contract||The usually serene Telangana Health Campus, Koti, witnessed heavy activity on Tuesday as a large number of nurses recruited on outsourcing basis gathered there demanding that their services be extended. The nurses said that they have performed duties at government hospitals right from the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic and wanted their job contract to be extended for a few more years. When there were delays in recruiting regular staff nurses, a government order (GO) was issued on March 21 last year permitting Director of Medical Education (DME) to recruit 1,640 staff nurses on outsourcing basis for various tertiary care hospitals for a period of one year — from April 1, 2020, to March 30 of this year. However, the nurses claimed that the recruitment advertisement was for contract nurses but they were given outsourced job. With the demand to extend their services, the nurses reached in large numbers to stage protest and sought to meet DME K. Ramesh Reddy. The immediate perimeter of the DME building on the Health Campus was filled with police personnel who sent away the nurses. Around five of them were permitted to meet the superintendent. The police personnel stayed put even two hours after the nurses left. “When our term ended in March, an extension till end of June was provided. However, on Tuesday, we were asked not to report for duty at Gandhi Hospital and Government ENT Hospital from Wednesday. This is abrupt notice. Where are we supposed to go and work now,” asked a staff nurse who was present at the health campus in Koti. The nurses said they quit jobs in private hospitals which were paying Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 70,000 a month during the first wave and joined the job at government hospitals for Rs. 25,000 salary since they hoped the job at government would be regularised in future. “Many of us and our family members got COVID. My father died. We gave a lot to our jobs at government hospitals. We want our contract to be extended,” demanded another nurse who broke down . Senior Health officials said as per the GO, the job tenure ended this March. “But it was extended owing to the COVID situation. Regular staff nurses have been recruited now,” said an official.  When our term ended, an extension till end of June was provided. However, on Tuesday, we were asked not to report for duty from Wednesday. This is abrupt notice.

The UDISE+ report explains that the percentage of enrolment is expressed as a percentage of the total enrolments. In case of Telangana, the total enrolment across schools of all types of management for that year from pre-primary to class 12 stands at 69,37,640. Boys vs girls Data shows that the percentage of enrolment for Muslims for classes 1 to 8 in the State is 16.13, and for classes 9 and 10, it is 14.96. The percentage of enrolment from primary to higher secondary (classes 11 and 12) is 15.34. This is higher than the pan-India enrolment of Muslim students of 13.95%, and also higher than that of many other states including Uttar Pradesh, which has a significant Muslim population, Bihar, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. The percentage of enrolment of Muslim girls remained marginally higher than that of boys. For instance, the enrolment of boys in classes 1 to 8 was 15.89% and that of girls was 16.40%.

The total food grains allotted/ distributed in Telangana under PMGKAY till date is as follows: PMGKAY-I 2.87 Rs. 1,071 crore; PMGKAY-II 4.79 Rs. 1,785 crore; PMGKAY-III 1.92 Rs. 714 crore; PMGKAY-IV 4.79 Rs. 1,785 crore,” he said. “Further to the above scheme, keeping in mind the hardships faced by people not having NFSA cards but holding valid State PDS cards, the government of India announced a scheme for the non-NFSA card holders by providing the State government of Telangana rice at subsidised rates of Rs. 22 per kg so that it can be distributed to the State PDS card holders on par with NFSA card holders,” the top FCI official said. “This scheme will benefit the approximately 87.81 lakh beneficiaries having valid State PDS cards. Under this scheme the government of India has allotted 44,298 MTs of rice per month initially for 3 (three) months i.e., April 2020 to June 2020 and again this scheme has further been extended for a period of 11 (eleven) months i.e., May 2021 to March 2022,” he said. “The allocation was over and above NFSA foodgrains. Considering the economic cost of 1 (one) MT of rice to be Rs. 37,261 the financial burden on account of this scheme will be borne by the government of India as the foodgrains are supplied free of cost to all NFSA beneficiaries by FCI.” “Keeping in view the need for support to the poor, government of India announced the fourth instalment of PMGKAY,” Mr. Gupta said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pmgkay-to-benefit-192-crore-in-ts/article35182509.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Uttam, Komatireddy find fault with TRS government||Outgoing president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has alleged that it is due to the attitude of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that injustice is being done to the State in the matter of Krishna waters. The injustice to Telangana in Krishna waters is higher now, after formation of the State than in the combined State, Mr. Reddy, who represents Nalgonda in Lok Sabha, said talking to reporters here on Tuesday. The expansion of Pothireddypadu Head Regulator planned by the Andhra Pradesh government would increase its water drawal capacity from the existing 44,000 cusecs to 80,000, denying water to the Nagarjunasagar ayacut and the areas in combined Mahabubnagar and Nalgonda district would turn into desert. The Nalgonda MP stated that he would raise the issue in the monsoon session of Parliament starting from July19. He alleged the ruling party leaders were taking commission from irrigation projects contracts. Meanwhile, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy alleged that many irrigation projects in the combined Nalgonda district such as Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC), Brahmana Vellamla and others were remaining incomplete due to non-allocation of sufficient funds. The SLBC was taken up over two decades back and only 10% works of Brahmana Vellamla were pending. In a meeting with Special Chief Secretary (Irrigation) Rajat Kumar and Engineer-in-Chief (General) C. Muralidhar he discussed the issue of Krishna waters and pending projects. He brought to the officials notice that allocation of mere Rs. 100 crore would help complete Brahmana Vellamla project and irrigation one-lakh acres of ayacut and he blamed non-allocation of funds to keep the project incomplete for the last seven years. Similarly, 70% work on SLBC was also completed but the delay in completion of tunnels was delaying the project. It would have been come into use four years back itself had the government allocated sufficient funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uttam-komatireddy-fault-govt/article35182510.ece
07 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Govt faulted for not honouring promise to kin of martyred officer||It was shame that State government failed to provide the promised plot to the family of a martyred IFS officer even nearly 12 years after his death, Telangana High Court Chief Justice Hima Kohli said on Tuesday. Observing that not finalising the allotment of plot to the officer’s family amounted to disrespecting his martyrdom, the CJ instructed the government to ensure the officer’s family secured the plot immediately. A division bench comprising the CJ and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy was hearing contentions of government over a letter written by the martyred officer V. Venkateshwar Rao’s wife Malathi Rao. The letter was taken up as PIL petition by the HC. Mr. Rao, an IFS officer of 1990 batch working as diplomat in Afghanistan, was killed in a terror attack outside his office in Kabul in 2008. On May 23, 2014, the then undivided Andhra Pradesh State government issued a GO allotting a plot of 475 square yards in Jubilee Hills to Mr. Rao’s family. Subsequently, Hyderabad District Collector informed the martyr’s family that the said plot could not be allocated to her since the extent of land mentioned in the GO was 475 square yards but actual area of the plot was less. Revenue officials requested the late officer’s wife to visit the site and select another plot there. The officer’s family identified plot no. 53 in Bharani layout. However, handing over of the plot to the officer’s family did not materialise. When the matter came up for hearing, the government counsel said that a plot admeasuring 411 square yards was available for allotment. Government Pleader C.V. Bhaskar Reddy said the government was ready to allot the plot of 411 square yards if the martyred officer’s wife places a request. “She will not make a request... You will make a request... Ask your Revenue department officials to find her and approach her with that request,...” the CJ said. The CJ also made it clear that government should file an affidavit stating that no plot of 475 square yards was available at that site since the GO relating to plot allotment to the officer’s family was issued. Citizenship case In a separate matter, Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili on Tuesday instructed the HC Registry to place before the court all records pertaining to a writ petition filed by TRS MLA from Vemulawada Chennamaneni Ramesh challenging order of Union Ministry of Home Affairs cancelling his Indian citizenship. The documents were required for final hearing of the matter, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-faulted-for-not-honouring-promise-to-kin-of-martyred-officer/article35182508.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao should resign from his post or apologise to the people for his “failure to safeguard the interests of Telangana in the Krishna water allocation by accepting 299 tmcft of water as against 512 tmcft for AP following “secret understandings” with successive Chief Ministers of the neighbouring state, demanded Bharatiya Janata Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday. “KCR has unveiled a new political drama to provoke people of both Telugu States by sending police forces to Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar projects only because of the forthcoming Huzurabad byelection. The fact is that more than once he had accepted less water allocation, refused to attend the Apex Council meeting twice last year and did not withdraw the case in Supreme Court which could have entailed formation of a tribunal,” he said, at a press conference. Mr. Sanjay Kumar challenged KCR to an open debate at the Srisailam project site on these issues. “He had mortgaged the interests of TS by forging agreements with N. Chandrababu Naidu earlier and Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy now. Is he not responsible for less water allocation to TS and turning the south part into a desert? Did he even try to halt the construction of a single project despite official orders issued by AP?,” questioned the BJP leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-should-quit-for-low-allocation/article35182519.ece

About 38 acres in survey No. 52 of the area was occupied and pattas were subsequently issued on bogus ex-servicemen certificates. The balance 35 acres was encroached and the occupants secured pattas in the freedom fighter category producing bogus certificates, it said. In a memorandum submitted to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, Forum secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy recalled that the government had constituted a committee headed by S.K. Sinha to verify the appropriateness of the allotment of lands made in combined AP. The committee made detailed reports for taking necessary action, but the response from the government had been lukewarm even after six years.

07 July 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||3,825 hectares of degraded forest lands to be rejuvenated this year||The Forest Department has rolled out an action plan to rejuvenate a little over 3,825 hectares of degraded forest land spread in as many as 20 reserve forest blocks in both Khammam and Sattupalli forest divisions in the district to conserve and improve forest quality in the current fiscal 2021-22. The department has identified nearly 15,392 hectares of forest land with 0.1 to 0.4 canopy density under the forest rejuvenation plan. So far 9,936 hectares of forest land under this category has been treated through Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and other techniques. Plans are afoot to rejuvenate 3825.64 hectares of degraded forest land in the current fiscal and the remaining 1,630 hectares of degraded land subsequently, Forest Department sources said. Nearly 354 km of fire lines were constructed to prevent forest fires, trenches were dug along the periphery of the reserve forest blocks, intensive plantation of native species of saplings, soil and moisture conservation works were taken up in the earlier phases of the ambitious programme. A multi-pronged strategy for effective implementation of the forest and wildlife conservation efforts with a special focus on Haritha Haram, the State government’s flagship afforestation programme, was finalised at the District Forest and Wildlife Protection Committee (DFWLPC) meeting chaired by Collector R V Karnan here last week. The Forest Department has taken up intensive planting of an array of native varieties of plants in the 20 identified reserve forest blocks as part of the action plan to rejuvenate 3825.64 hectares of degraded forest land this year -- 2021-22, District Forest Officer Praveena told The Hindu . Weed control, soil and moisture conservation efforts and other cultural practices will form the crux of the action plan to rejuvenate the degraded forest lands and improve quality of forests through natural regeneration and various other cultural practices. A wide variety of fruit bearing saplings such as berry and amla are being planted as part of the afforestation drive to create “monkey food courts,” the DFO added. As part of measures to protect forests and wildlife, as many as 797 Offence Report (OR) cases and nine Undetected Offence Report (UDOR) cases, 108 vehicle cases and 46 encroachment cases were booked against the offenders in the past one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/3825-hectares-of-degraded-forest-lands-to-be-rejuvenated-this-year/article35182745.ece

Harish Rao said the opposition Congress and BJP are blind to the development taking place in villages and towns and have confined themselves to Hyderabad. Participating in Palle Pragathi and Pattana Pragathi programmes at Sadashivapet, Kohir and Zaheerabad on Monday along with Council Pro-tem Speaker V.

07 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||Save us from demolition: Khori Basti residents||A large number of residents of Faridabad’s Khori Basti marched towards the Prime Minister’s office in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum with an appeal to save the colony from the Supreme Court-ordered demolition. Led by former Lok Sabha MP and Congress national spokesperson Udit Raj, the residents, including women, carried out a march towards the Prime Minister’s Office under the aegis of All India Confederation of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes organisations. Carrying placards that read, “Save Khori, Save Migrants” and “Please Save Khori”, the demonstrators started the march from Atul Grover Road. However, they were stopped by the police at Jantar Mantar. The protesters appealed to the government to get the Supreme Court order repealed so that millions of lives can be saved during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Raj attacked the Haryana government saying that the State government should have made rehabilitation arrangements before displacement, but unfortunately it did not happen. The people have built their homes with blood and sweat, which were being demolished in front of their own eyes, said Dr. Raj, adding that this would not be tolerated at any cost. The Supreme Court had last month directed Faridabad municipal corporation to demolish the houses in 170-acre Khori Basti on the forest land within six weeks. The residents have been demanding that the government should rehabilitate them or revoke the SC order to provide them relief. Forcing to vacate Sanjay Raj, national treasurer of the confederation, said that power and water supply to the houses in the colony was snapped to force them to vacate their houses. Social activist Meenu Verma, also part of the demonstration, said: “The third wave of COVID-19 has arrived and in this situation it was inhumane to make thousands of children homeless. If electricity and water supply is not restored in the colony, thousands of lives will be put to danger during the pandemic”. The State Secretariat of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Haryana has strongly condemned the illegal and inhumane actions of the State government for en masse eviction of thousands of Khori Basti residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/save-us-from-demolition-khori-basti-residents/article35182395.ece

State Congress president and MLA Nana Patole raised the issue in the Assembly, claiming his name was on the list of persons whose phones were tapped, and that he was renamed as one Amjad Khan said to be part of a drug cartel. “Who allowed this? Who was the mastermind? Forget me, even the staff members of some BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leaders were under similar surveillance.

Rs. 50,000 to each family Mr. Kejriwal said this while launching the ‘Mukhyamantri COVID-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna’, a social security scheme for COVID-19-affected families here on Tuesday. Under the scheme, Delhi government will disburse an ex gratia payment of Rs. 50,000 for each death to the family of the deceased and Rs. 2,500 monthly to those families who have lost breadwinners. “The entire country may have seen two waves, but as for Delhi, this was the fourth wave. It was very severe, it was very lethal; we lost a lot of lives, a lot of children became orphans, a lot of families lost their breadwinners. There’s no one to look after them now,” he said. “As a responsible and sensitive government, it is our duty to stand with these grieving families and provide them all the assistance we can. After a lot of discussions with our officers and the people of Delhi, we are launching the ‘Mukhyamantri COVID-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna’,” the CM said, while launching the scheme. No questions would be asked, Mr. Kejriwal assured, if the person died because of COVID-19 and the affected family would receive Rs. 50,000. Additionally, he said, Rs. 2,500 would be disbursed monthly to those families who had lost their breadwinners to the pandemic; children who were orphaned would be provided Rs. 2,500 monthly till they turn 25, Mr. Kejriwal said. Two options to register “There are two options. First, families can register on the portal themselves. Second, a Delhi government representative will visit their homes. As a responsible and sensitive government, we will not wait for people to apply, we will approach them on our own as well,” he said. There would not be any scrutiny. “The representatives are not going to these homes to scrutinise the documents of these grieving families. If any documents are missing, it is the responsibility of the representatives and the government to make them available without putting pressure on the grieving families,” he said. Referring to government representatives who will be collecting applications, the Chief Minister asked them to be empathetic and understanding towards these families. He also requested them not to put them under stress because of any missing papers as they were already going through a lot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/relief-scheme-for-covid-victims-kin-launched/article35182406.ece

Justice Mukta Gupta ordered the Delhi police to submit its report on the inquiry before the next date of hearing on August 5. The High Court’s direction came on Jamia Millia Islamia University student and riots accused Asif Iqbal Tanha’s plea alleging misconduct by police officers in leaking his alleged disclosure statement in the main chargesheet to the media. The Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) said that although notice was issued to parties concerned for the purposes of the inquiry, the same could not be concluded on account of COVID-19-induced lockdown. Vigilance report The court also reminded the SPP that the police’s earlier vigilancereport on the issue “had nothing in it” and that the court was not satisfied with the report. Mr. Tanha, in his plea, had said he was aggrieved by various news reports appearing in electronic media that alleged he had confessed to organising and inciting communal riots that occurred in north-east Delhi. He had contended that the action of the media houses in placing such documents in the public violated the programme code. Mr. Tanha had alleged that he was coerced by police officers to sign certain papers and make statements while in their custody. He had contended that the alleged disclosure statements, which have become a subject matter of news reports, were not given voluntarily and are inadmissible as evidence in court.

07 July 2021||Bagram,||‘U.S. left Afghan airbase without notice’||The U.S. left Afghanistan’s Bagram Airfield after nearly 20 years by shutting off the electricity and slipping away in the night without notifying the base’s new Afghan commander, who discovered the Americans’ departure more than two hours after they left, said Afghan military officials. Afghanistan’s army showed off the sprawling air base on Monday, providing a first glimpse of what had been the epicentre of America’s war to unseat the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaeda perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks on America. The U.S. announced on Friday it had vacated its biggest airfield in the country in advance of a final withdrawal the Pentagon says will be completed by the end of August. “We [heard] some rumour that the Americans had left Bagram ... and finally by seven o’clock in the morning, we understood that it was confirmed that they had already left Bagram,” said Gen. Mir Asadullah Kohistani, Bagram’s new commander. U.S. military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett did not address the complaints of many Afghan soldiers who inherited the abandoned airfield, instead referring to a statement last week. Col. Leggett said in the statement that they had coordinated their departures with Afghanistan’s leaders. Before the Afghan army could take control of the airfield, it was invaded by a small army of looters, who ransacked barracks and rummaged through storage tents before being evicted, according to Afghan military officials. “At first, we thought maybe they were the Taliban,” said Abdul Raouf, a soldier. He said the the U.S. called from the Kabul airport and said “we are here at the airport in Kabul”. The last U.S. soldiers are likely to remain until an agreement to protect the Kabul Hamid Karzai International Airport, which is expected to be done by Turkey, is completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-left-afghan-airbase-without-notice/article35181969.ece
07 July 2021||Moscow,||Wreckage of Russian plane found||Wreckage from a plane that went missing on Tuesday in Russia’s Far East region of Kamchatka was found around 5 km (three miles) away from a runway at an airport on the coast where it was supposed to land, officials said. An Antonov An-26 plane with 22 passengers and six crew members, flying from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to the town of Palana on the Okhotsk Sea coast, missed a scheduled communication and disappeared from radar as it was on approach for landing. The governor of Kamchatka, Vladimir Solodov, told the Interfax news agency that the aircraft’s fuselage was found on land near the coast, while other wreckage was found nearby in the Okhotsk Sea. According to media reports, none of the 28 people on board have survived the crash. The plane belonged to a company called Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise and had been in operation since 1982, Russian state news agency Tass reported. ‘Technically sound’ The company’s director, Alexei Khabarov, told Interfax that the plane was technically sound before taking off in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. A criminal investigation into the incident has been launched. Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise’s deputy director, Sergei Gorb, said that the plane “practically crashed into a sea cliff”, which wasn’t supposed to be in its landing trajectory. The plane was on approach for landing when contact was lost about 10 kilometers (six miles) away from Palana’s airport. The head of the local government in Palana, Olga Mokhireva, was aboard the flight, spokespeople of the Kamchatka government said. In 2012, an Antonov An-28 plane belonging to Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise crashed into a mountain while flying from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsk and coming in for a landing in Palana. A total of 14 people were on board and 10 of them were killed. Both pilots, who were among the dead, were found to have alcohol in their blood, Tass reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/wreckage-of-russian-plane-found/article35181971.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Xi reshuffles PLA border command leadership||China’s President Xi Jinping has replaced the head of the military’s Western Theatre Command, which borders India, appointing a new General to lead the military’s biggest command. Mr. Xi on Monday promoted four senior military officers, including one who has been at the centre of the border tensions with India as the head of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Ground Forces or Army in the border Western Theatre Command, to the highest rank of General. Mr. Xi, who also heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), presented the certificates of the orders to them at a ceremony held by the CMC on Monday, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The promoted officers were named as Xu Qiling, Commander of the PLA’s Western Theatre Command, Wang Xiubin, Commander of the Southern Theatre Command, Liu Zhenli, Commander of the PLA Army, and Ju Qiansheng, Commander of the PLA Strategic Support Force.  General Xu becomes one of the PLA’s youngest Generals, the highest rank for active officers. The announcement suggests General Xu has replaced General Zhang Xudong as the Commander of the Western Theatre. General Zhang was appointed as Commander only in December 2020, and observers said his tenure ending within seven months would be highly unusual as per past practice. Former commander As of Tuesday, there was no official statement on why General Zhang has been replaced and where he has been posted, although his biography on Baidu, China’s Google equivalent, was on Tuesday updated to describe him as the ‘former’ Commander of the Western Theatre. The current thinking among Indian military planners is that the April mass mobilisation by the PLA and subsequent multiple LAC transgressions, coming after annual summer exercises, was likely planned at the level of the Western Theatre Command, and that the higher levels, such as the Central Military Commission headed by Mr. Xi, were most likely only involved after the June 15 clash in Galwan Valley.  In December 2020, seven months into the tensions, General Zhang took over as Commander of the entire Western Theater Command overseeing all its forces, replacing General Zhao Zongqi, the long-standing Commander, who retired at 65. In March, General Zhao was rewarded with a post-retirement appointment as the Vice-Chairman of the National People’s Congress (NPC) or parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, a top advisory body. General Xu, 59, now becomes the third head of the Command since tensions began. He was appointed under General Zhang, as Commander of the Western Theatre’s Ground Forces or Army, on June 1, 2020, around a month into the tensions and before the June 15, 2020 Galwan Valley clash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-reshuffles-pla-border-command-leadership/article35181975.ece
07 July 2021||Jerusalem,||Israel PM suffers defeat over Arab family unification ban||Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett accused his opponents on Tuesday of harming national security as his coalition failed to extend a ban on citizenship for Palestinian spouses from the West Bank and Gaza. Earlier, the coalition had sought a deal for nearly all of its members to back the ban’s extension. The PM had also called for Opposition right-wingers to support the measure, urging unity on national security grounds. But that failed when a member of the Yamina party, Amichai Chikli, voted with the Opposition, tweeting later that the debate over the Bill was “proof” that a government without a “clear Zionist majority” would be “problematic”. His defection left Parliament tied at 59 to 59 votes, meaning the measure would lapse later Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-pm-suffers-defeat-over-arab-family-unification-ban/article35181966.ece
07 July 2021||Cairo,||Ethiopia resumes filling disputed dam||Ethiopia has started the second phase of filling a mega-dam’s reservoir on the upper Blue Nile, said Egypt and Sudan, raising tensions Tuesday ahead of an upcoming UN Security Council meeting on the issue. Both Cairo and Khartoum said they had been notified by Addis Ababa that the second phase of filling had begun at the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry late Monday expressed its “firm rejection of this unilateral measure” and Sudan’s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday followed suit, labelling the move a “risk and imminent threat”. In Addis Ababa, the offices of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Irrigation Minister Seleshi Bekele did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comment. The huge dam, set to be Africa’s largest hydroelectric project when completed, has sparked an almost decade-long diplomatic stand-off between Addis Ababa and downstream nations Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia says the project is essential to its development, but Cairo and Khartoum fear it could restrict their citizens’ water access. Both governments have been pushing Addis Ababa to ink a binding deal over the filling and operation of the dam, and have urged the UN Security Council to take up the matter.   Addis Ababa had previously announced it would proceed to the second stage of filling in July, with or without a deal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ethiopia-resumes-filling-disputed-dam/article35181965.ece
07 July 2021||London,||U.K. court quashes 1972 convictions of 3 black men||Appeal court judges in London on Tuesday overturned the convictions of three black men for attempting to rob a corrupt police officer nearly half a century ago. The Court of Appeal cleared the trio following a referral by a criminal cases review commission, and comes just over a year after the acquittals of four men in a similar case. The latest ruling is the third time convictions have been overturned based on the tarnished evidence of discredited British Transport Police officer Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell. The three men — all aged between 17 and 20 at the time — and three friends were accused of trying to rob Ridgewell in 1972 on the London Underground while travelling from Stockwell station, south London. All bar one of “The Stockwell Six” were convicted, largely on the word of the corrupt officer, who himself was jailed for seven years and died of a heart attack in prison in 1982. At their trial, the accused told jurors that officers, including Ridgewell, who had previously served in the South Rhodesian, now Zimbabwean, police force, had lied and subjected them to violence and threats. “It is most unfortunate that it has taken nearly 50 years to rectify the injustice,” Julian Flaux, one of the three judges to hear the case, said on Tuesday. The two remaining members of the Stockwell Six who were convicted have not yet been traced. Lawyers for the men said it was “deeply troubling” that it had taken so long for the convictions to be overturned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-court-quashes-1972-convictions-of-3-black-men/article35181967.ece

07 July 2021||Kabul,||Amid rising Taliban wins, consulates shut down||A surge of Taliban wins in northern Afghanistan has caused some countries to close their consulates in the region, while across the border in Tajikistan, reservists are being called up to reinforce the southern border, according to officials and reports on Tuesday. Nearly 1,000 Afghan soldiers have fled the Taliban advances by crossing the border into Tajikistan, according to reports from Tajikistan. A statement on Monday from the Tajik government said President Emomali Rakhmon ordered the mobilisation of 20,000 military reservists to strengthen its border with Afghanistan. The Afghan military exodus comes as the Taliban have overrun most districts in northeastern Badakhshan province. Many fell without a fight but along the province’s northern border with Tajikistan, hundreds of Afghan forces crossed over, seeking safety in Tajikistan. The consulates of Turkey and Russia have reportedly closed in Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh province, and Afghanistan’s fourth-largest city. Iran said it has restricted activities at its consulate in the city. There has been fighting in Balkh province, but the provincial capital has been relatively peaceful. The consulates of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, India and Pakistan have reduced their services, said Balkh Provincial Governor's spokesman Munir Farhad. He said Turkey and Russia had closed their consulates and their diplomats had left the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-rising-taliban-wins-consulates-shut-down/article35181972.ece

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Fresh stirrings on federalism as a new politics||Between vaccine wars, heated debates over the Goods and Services Tax (GST), personnel battles like the fracas over West Bengal’s Chief Secretary, and the pushback against controversial regulations in Lakshadweep, is India ready for a new federal bargain? Emboldened by victories in the recent State Assembly elections, the idea of a third ‘federal’ front is once again gaining political cache as was evident in the Sharad Pawar organised Opposition meet. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, since taking office, has begun to craft an ideological narrative on State rights, by re-introducing the term Union into the public discourse and pushing back against increased fiscal centralisation. Is this renewed emphasis on federalism, a genuine opportunity for forging a new politics? Federalism in India has always had political relevance, but except for the States Reorganisation Act, federalism has rarely been an axis of political mobilisation. This was true even in the days of coalition politics when State politics mattered to national electoral outcomes. Fiscal and administrative centralisation persisted despite nearly two decades of coalition governments. Ironically, rather than deepen federalism, the contingencies of electoral politics have created significant impediments to creating a political consensus for genuine federalism. When confronted with entrenched centralisation of the present regime, the challenge is, ironically, even greater. Nationalism on strong wicket First, the rhetoric of nationalism has greater political purchase. Ideologically, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has had relatively little patience with federalism as a device to accommodate India’s multiple linguistic, religious, and ethnic identities. Post-2014, the BJP has couched its discomfiture with federalism in the grammar of development and nationalism, which has mass electoral appeal. To accelerate progress, India must become ‘one nation, one market’, ‘one nation, one ration card’, ‘one nation, one grid’. In this framing, federalism as a principle necessary for negotiating diverse political contexts and identity claims risks being equated with regionalism and a narrow parochialism that is anti-development and anti-national. Thus, a politics for deepening federalism will need to overcome a nationalist rhetoric that pits federalism against nationalism and development. This is a hard ask, especially because most regional parties have failed to uphold principles of decentralisation in their own backyard. Second, and relatedly, despite a rhetorical commitment to federalism, the politics of federalism has remained contingent rather than principled. As Pratap Bhanu Mehta has pointed out over the decades, federal principles have been bent in all kinds of ways to co-produce a political culture of flexible federalism — “federalism for me, but not for thee”. Federalism in this rendition is reduced to a game of political upmanship and remains restricted to a partisan tussle rather than a regions’ genuine demand for accommodation. Especially, when claimants of greater federalism often maintain silence on unilateral decisions that affect other States. Take for instance, the downgrading of a full-fledged State in Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory in 2019, or more recently, the notification of the NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021. This blatant undermining of State’s rights hardly witnessed protest by parties that were not directly affected by these. Upholding federalism requires political maturity and a commitment to the federal principle. This is lacking in our politics. Divide among States Third, the increased economic and governance divergence between States. Economic growth trajectories since liberalisation have been characterised by growing spatial divergence. Across all key indicators, southern (and western) States have outperformed much of northern and eastern India resulting in a greater divergence rather than expected convergence with growth. This has created a context where collective action amongst States becomes difficult as poorer regions of India contribute far less to the economy but require greater fiscal resources to overcome their economic fragilities. Glimpses of these emerging tensions were visible in the debates around the 15th Finance Commission (FC) when the Government of India mandated the commission to use the 2011 Census rather than the established practice of using the 1971 Census to determine revenue share across States. This, Southern states feared, risked penalising States that had successfully controlled population growth by reducing their share in the overall resource pool. The 15th Finance Commission, through its recommendations, deftly avoided a political crisis but the growing divergence between richer and poorer States, remains an important source of tension in inter-State relations that can become a real impediment to collective action amongst States. With the impending delimitation exercise due in 2026, these tensions will only increase. These challenges notwithstanding, the BJP’s impatience with federalism affords an opportunity for regional parties to craft a new federal bargain. At one level, the BJP’s homogenising ideological project risks creating new forms of cultural alienation and associated regional tensions as occurred during the Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in Assam. There is a very real possibility of the emergence of new forms of regional sub-nationalism, glimpses of which were visible during the recent Assembly elections particularly in West Bengal. Fiscal management Moreover, the realities of India’s macro-fiscal position risk increasing the fragility of State finances. Weak fiscal management has brought the Union government on the brink of what economist Rathin Roy has called a silent fiscal crisis. The Union’s response has been to squeeze revenue from States by increasing cesses. Its  insistence on giving GST compensation to States as loans (after long delays) and increasing State shares in central schemes. The pandemic-induced economic crisis has only exaggerated this. Against this backdrop, if harnessed well, both sub-nationalist sentiments and the need to reclaim fiscal federalism create a political moment for a principled politics of federalism. However, there are risks along the way. As Suhas Palshikar has argued, the politics of regional identity is isolationist by its very nature. An effort at collective political action for federalism based on identity concerns will have to overcome this risk. On the fiscal side, richer States must find a way of sharing the burden with the poorer States. States will have to show political maturity to make necessary compromises if they are to negotiate existing tensions and win the collective battle with the Union. An inter-State platform that brings States together in a routine dialogue on matters of fiscal federalism could be the starting point for building trust and a common agenda. The seeds of this were planted in the debates over the 15th Finance Commission and the GST. Finally, beyond principles, a renewed politics of federalism is also an electoral necessity. No coalition has succeeded, in the long term, without a glue that binds it. Forging a political consensus on federalism can be that glue. But this would require immense patience and maturity from regional parties. Are they up to the task? Yamini Aiyar and Rahul Verma are with the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi.

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Venezuela’s reflections on the Carabobo||On June 24, 1821, Simón Bolívar, the great Liberator, led his forces against the Spanish Army at the Battle of Carabobo. Five days later, Bolívar entered Caracas in triumph. The Spanish had not yet been defeated across South America, but the Spanish monarchy no longer had the will to fight back. The rest of the battles — including the Battle of Pinchincha on May 24, 1822 — merely finished up what Carabobo had established, namely that South America’s many republics wanted to be sovereign. Bolívar’s comrades assembled in Cúcuta to write a new constitution and to elect him as the president. But Bolívar would not rest. He mounted his horse, went southwards to ensure that the sovereignty of South America would be permanent. The story of Bolívar and Carabobo is deeply felt among Venezuelans of all classes. When I asked Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza about the meaning of this battle, he dug deep into the history books to explain that the Carabobo “was more than a battle. It was a geopolitical campaign”. After Bolívar’s armies defeated the Spanish on those battlefields west of Caracas, the new States that emerged from Gran Colombia (Colombia and Venezuela) down to Bolivia (1825) produced a dynamic sense of their own sovereignty. Carabobo was “an important step towards the whole independence of South America”. A decade ago, I remember hearing Hugo Chávez on Carabobo, his voice emotional, his sense of the possibilities opened up by Bolívar total. No wonder that Chávez named the process opened up by his election in 1998 as the Bolivarian Revolution and that he named the regional process, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). Venezuela has also celebrated the battle with a Bicentennial Congress of the Peoples of the World. The theme is not the independence of South America alone. It is sovereignty for the world. The woes of States Two hundred years after Carabobo, the South American States struggle to be independent. Venezuela itself remains locked in a dangerous conflict with the United States, whose government continues to tighten the sanctions regime that inflicts harm against the Venezuelan people. Recently, the U.S. government’s secondary sanctions pushed UBS to refuse to complete transactions by the Venezuelan government to the COVAX alliance so as to ensure delivery of vaccines for COVID-19. Increasingly, U.S. sanctions block the ability of Venezuela to conduct normal commercial relations with other countries. The U.S. has been able to exercise this overwhelming power over Venezuela — and several other countries under unilateral U.S. sanctions — because of U.S. dominance over trade and investment, international financial systems, and global information flows. Monroe Doctrine Just when Bolívar’s armies defeated the Spanish, the U.S. President James Monroe on December 2, 1823, crafted the Monroe Doctrine. This policy suggested that now that European powers had lost their grip on the Americas, the United States of America will be the guarantor of continental stability. At that time, the U.S. did not have the technological or military means to subordinate all of the hemisphere. In 1898, when the U.S. intervened to remove the last vestiges of Spanish colonialism in Cuba and Puerto Rico, it took over both islands. Subsequently, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in his corollary to Monroe’s doctrine in 1904 said that the U.S. would exercise its influence over the Americas. Military invasions from Nicaragua to Panama (1989) and coups from Guatemala (1954) to Bolivia (2019) brought Monroe’s speech into the world. The U.S. stand It meant little that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in 2013, “The era of the Monroe Doctrine is over.” This statement came four years after the U.S.-backed coup in Honduras, and also before the U.S. coup in Bolivia. Mr. Kerry made that remark while he served under President Barack Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden, now U.S. President, has no intention of renouncing the Monroe Doctrine. His Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has interfered in the legal processes in Bolivia, put in place a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent, Lisa Kenna, as Ambassador to Peru, and deepened U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. For these men, there is no evidence of a policy shift. In February 2021, UN Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures, Alena Douhan, wrote that due to the U.S. unilateral sanctions, the Venezuelan government revenue shrank by 99% and the country is living on 1% of its pre-sanctions income. Venezuela, she wrote, “faces a lack of necessary machinery, spare parts, electricity, water, fuel, gas, food, and medicine”. Over the past six years, 2.5 million Venezuelans have slipped into food insecurity, while electricity generation levels have fallen to 20%. Venezuelan assets frozen in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Portuguese banks amount to U.S.$6 billion. But Venezuelans remain defiant. “We stand firm,” says Mr. Arreaza, who has just returned to Caracas from Moscow. Monroe is another name for unipolarity. Despite the residual power of the U.S., Monroe is of the past. Carabobo, for the Venezuelans, signals multipolarity. It is, they believe, the way forward.

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Seeking a paradigm shift in mental health care||Recently, a High Court suggested that homeless persons with health conditions be branded with a permanent tattoo, when vaccinated against COVID-19, since tracking a ‘floating population’ may be cumbersome. Earlier judgments have also suggested ‘round ups’ of such persons to facilitate pathways into care. These are possibly well-intentioned directives, but what follows is that bewildered persons are huddled in a vehicle and admitted into shelters or mental hospitals that are usually crowded, yet lonely. What does this tell us about the way homelessness and mental illness are regarded in ‘polite’ society? A responsive care system Persons with mental health conditions need a responsive care system that inspires hope and participation without which their lives are empty. In many countries, persons with severe mental health conditions live in shackles in their homes, in overcrowded hospitals, and even in prison. On the other hand, many persons with mental health issues live and even die alone on the streets. Three losses dominate the mental health systems narrative: dignity, agency and personhood. Far-sighted changes in policy and laws have often not taken root and many laws fail to meet international human rights standards. Many also do not account for cultural, social and political contexts resulting in moral rhetoric that doesn’t change the scenario of inadequate care. Society’s responses are often based on conditioning and perceptions, often verging on visceral forms of prejudice. This results in an “othering” of persons who seem different from dominant groups. Hence, even well-intentioned judgments could set off unintended negative, even grave, consequences. There is also the social legacy of the asylum, and of psychiatry and mental illness itself, that guides our imagination in how care is organised. Historian Sarah Ann Pinto, in her account of the lunatic asylums in colonial Bombay, wrote that “doctors interpreted a patient’s refusal to wear clothing as a sign of morbidity, and clothing became a way of civilising the savage — the violent Indian man and the promiscuous Indian woman”. Individual preference and indigenous culture were substituted with what the coloniser thought was appropriate. Similarly, medieval London boasted of a hospital for the care of persons with mental illness, St. Mary of Bethlehem, which soon turned into a ‘bedlam’, a poorhouse and a site of shocking atrocities. We must understand mental health conditions for what they are and for how they are associated with disadvantage. These situations are linked, but not always so. Therefore, not all distress can be medicalised. It is against this complex background of distress arising out of medical conditions and from inequitable social systems, of good intentions and calamitous consequences, that we welcome the Guidance on Community Mental Health Services recently launched by the World Health Organization. The Guidance, which includes three models from India, addresses the issue from ‘the same side’ as the mental health service user and focuses on the co-production of knowledge and on good practices built around the key themes of crisis services, peer support, supported living, community outreach, hospital-based services and comprehensive mental health service networks. Drawn from 22 countries, these models balance care and support with rights and participation. Afiya House in the U.S. is driven by peers and offers respite to persons who have significant emotional or mental distress. People can stay for up to seven nights when they are connected to networks that support recovery. Services are non-coercive and persons can opt to stay or leave based on discussions with peer supporters. Tupu Ake, a New Zealand-based recovery house service, welcomes ‘guests’ from various ethnicities. Atmiyata in Gujarat employs a stepped-care approach using community-based volunteers who identify persons in distress, offer counselling support and enable access to social care benefits. Evaluation of the service indicates better general health, better quality of life and social functioning. Naya Daur in West Bengal works with local networks and volunteers who support homeless persons through their outreach programme and enable access to food, clothing, counselling, shelter and housing. Home Again, a programme of The Banyan in Tamil Nadu, facilitates residence options in regular neighbourhoods while also offering graded levels of supportive services for persons with severe disabilities. It emphasises socio-cultural participation, ‘neurodiversity’ and normalisation of mental health conditions. Peer leaders provide wisdom from their lived experience to support others in distress. The practice of open dialogue, a therapeutic practice that originated in Finland, runs through many programmes in the Guidance. This practice, conducted in homes or in service settings, combines individual and systemic family therapy with a focus on the centrality of relationships and promotion of connectedness through family and support networks. This approach trains the therapist in de-escalation of distress and breaks power differentials that allow for free expression. Aimed at providing newer perspectives to governments and policymakers, approaches in the new WHO Guidance are designed to make community inclusion and dialogic practice a way of life. With emphasis on social care components such as work force participation, pensions and housing, increased investments in health and social care seem imperative. A network of services Recently, the Supreme Court and the Madras High Court have advised vaccinations for those in mental health care homes and for those homeless and living with a mental illness. While those in institutions should access this support at the earliest, for those homeless and who opt not to enter mental health establishments en masse from where exit pathways may be laborious, there are two paths. In the first, drives will be conducted and persons with mental illness will be housed in overcrowded institutions, with scant regard for agency or for social determinants of ill health. The other would aim to provide a network of services ranging from soup kitchens at vantage points to mobile mental health and social care clinics, non-intimidating guest homes at village panchayats with access to toilets and the comfort of a welcoming team, and well-being kiosks that offer a basic income and/or facilitate livelihoods. Small emergency care and recovery centres for those who need crisis support instead of larger hospitals, and long-term inclusive living options in an environment that values diversity and celebrates social mixing, will reframe the archaic narrative of how mental health care is to be provided. With a strong health system, Tamil Nadu is well placed to demonstrate through pilots, and an exclusive policy for homeless persons with mental illness, that political intent, good governance and creative thinking can solve complex problems and cater to the needs of the ultra-vulnerable. Meanwhile, a mental health service user whom we met interpreted her tattoo as ‘we are all one’. If we can learn to ‘be on the same side’ as the mental health service user, it seems possible that we can learn to respect human diversity.

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Unpacking China’s game plan||Aviation websites are abuzz with reports of a rapid upgradation of aviation infrastructure in Tibet. While the expansion of the road and railway network there has been subject to much debate, it is the speed of upgradation of airfields, construction of hardened aircraft shelters, new runways, aprons, underground storage and tunnelling into mountainsides, all visible in high-resolution satellite photos, that should have alarm bells ringing in New Delhi. This needs an analysis for two reasons. First, is there any link between these constructions and the procrastination by China in the talks for reducing tensions in Eastern Ladakh? What is the tactical aim of the Chinese with these upgradations? Second, how would these changes affect the balance of air power between the Indian Air Force (IAF) and People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) in the medium to long term? On a weak wicket in the air While the larger strategic aim of the Chinese in upping the ante by violating decades-old understandings in 2020 is still a matter of debate, what Beijing discovered to its discomfiture was that India did not yield any ground, and actually occupied vantage points in the south Pangong Tso area to balance out some sectoral disadvantages. This firmness was backed by deterrent IAF firepower and it was clear to the Chinese that they were on a weak wicket in the air due to three reasons. First, the IAF’s high strike potential, with its aircraft having the advantage of a string of airfields all along the foothills of the Himalayas; that they are at low altitudes permit a full armament load to be carried. Second, Chinese airfields in Tibet were few, widely spaced out and hence not mutually supportive; there were gaps in the air defence structure too that the IAF would utilise to interdict targets in the rear. Third, most Tibetan airfields are at altitudes above 10,000 ft, severely restricting the payload of PLAAF aircraft. Additional infrastructure was required to make up these deficiencies since the positive asymmetry of IAF would be detrimental to China’s plans to gain any territorial advantage; ‘time’ had to be made an ally in this endeavour. The balancing out of IAF’s asymmetry was only possible through a rapid upgradation of airfield and air defence infrastructure — this would need two years at least. The Chinese plan has been cleverly implemented through what can only be called a tactical pause, obtained via talks that were commenced but have meandered since. A ‘breakthrough’ in the eyeball-to-eyeball posture came in February when a simultaneous withdrawal in certain areas was agreed on, including a pulling back of Indian troops from their vantage points in areas south of Pangong Tso. With the threat to the PLA Moldo garrison removed, the Chinese re-adopted their procrastination position in subsequent talks regarding restoring status quo ante in Depsang/Daulat Beg Oldi and Hot Springs, which are of vital interest to India. This is the classic buying-time-through-talks technique and is still ongoing. In the tactical pause won surreptitiously, the Chinese have gone on the upgradation drive to nullify the disadvantages that Chinese airpower has vis-à-vis India; gaps in their air defence scheme are being plugged through the new infrastructure and positioning of new air defence radars and missile systems that would afford them a layered air defence setting and affect the balance of power in the medium to long term. Trying to turn the tables The IAF is equipped and trained for offensive action. In all the previous conflicts the IAF conducted aggressive strikes, besides providing active close support to ground forces. The odd exception was the 1962 India-China conflict where the IAF’s substantial strike potential was nullified by a political decision to not use it. The equipment accretion profile is a pointer to the offensive role as seen by the acquisition of Jaguars, Mirage-2000, Sukhois and now the Rafale. Seen from the prism of air power doctrine, this points to India’s strategy of deterrence by punishment: ‘don’t mess with us as we have the means and power to hurt you’. By strengthening their air defence architecture, the Chinese are trying to turn the tables and deter India through a strategy of denial, i.e., to dissuade the IAF by signalling that it would be costly in terms of aircraft and aircrew losses. For this turnaround to take effect would take China about two years. If China succeeds in its endeavour, India may lose the trump card of positive air power asymmetry that it now holds. What should India do? The air defence upgradation drive is surely being monitored, but that is not enough. If status quo ante on ground is not obtained soon, it may be too late a year or two from now. The façade of talks should be acknowledged for its devious aim. India’s posture and demands at the talks (which one supposes has an IAF representative too) must reflect its understanding of China’s game plan. There is no other way out.

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Vacancies send a wrong signal||The vacancies in the Central government and the States in recent years have had a deleterious effect on governance. For months on end, top slots in important government agencies remain vacant. Delays in promotions and appointments not only affect the organisations but also tend to demoralise the officials who await promotions after vacancies arise. Posts waiting to be filled The post of the Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission was kept vacant until June this year even though the previous Chairman, H. L. Dattu, retired in December 2020. The post of the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) too was kept vacant until the recent appointment of Subodh Kumar Jaiswal. The post had been vacant since February after Rishi Kumar Shukla retired. The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), Sunil Arora, retired on April 12 amidst an aggressive election campaign and polling in West Bengal and four other States this year leaving just two members in the Commission. One of them became CEC by virtue of his seniority in the Election Commission. In case of a disagreement on any issue between the two of them, a solution would have become difficult. The Centre appointed Anup Chandra Pandey as the new Election Commissioner in June. Meanwhile, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court demanding the appointment of Election Commissioners by a committee, as is done in the case of appointment of the Director of the CBI, and not by the Centre as is the case now. ADR has referred to the 255th Report of Law Commission that had recommended that Election Commissioners be appointed by a high-powered committee. Though the high-powered committee headed by the Prime Minister has two members – the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha – the Opposition leader has little say in the selection process. If the Prime Minister decides on a candidate and the CJI consents, the Opposition leader’s dissenting note carries no weight. There is a need, therefore, to expand the high-powered committee to include at least two more members of eminence with proven integrity for the selection process – preferably a retired police officer and a Chief Minister of a State governed by a party other than that of the party of the Prime Minister. After Hrushikesh Senapaty’s retirement in November last, the National Council of Educational Research and Training, which is largely responsible for chalking out the education policy of the country, is headless. Of the 40 Central universities across the country, nearly half are without regular Vice-Chancellors. Rakesh Asthana assumed additional charge of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) from December 2019. After his appointment as Director-General (DG) of the Border Security Force in August last, he continues to hold charge of the NCB as DG. Kuldiep Singh, DG of the Central Reserve Police Force, now also heads the National Investigation Agency after the previous incumbent, Y.C. Modi, retired on May 31 last. Impact of vacancies Similar vacancies or examples of officers holding additional charge exist in other ministries, commissions and departments, but the government appears to turn a blind eye to the malefic effect it has on governance. Vacancies for such long periods tend to paralyse the backbone of these organisations. Appointments to higher echelons can be announced well in time. Delays in important appointments send a wrong signal to the nation. If the government can announce its chiefs and vice chiefs months in advance, there is no reason why this cannot be done in all other ministries and departments. A time frame needs to be worked out to announce top appointments at least a month in advance. Political considerations need to be pushed to the back seat for a clean and honest administration. M.P. Nathanael is Inspector General of Police (Retd), CRPF||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/vacancies-send-a-wrong-signal/article35181958.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A death foretold||It was a death his well-wishers feared would happen and one he had anticipated. Father Stan Swamy, an 84-year-old Jesuit priest, known for his service and activism in the cause of Adivasis, died nine months into his unjust imprisonment on tenuous charges. A death that was simply allowed to happen despite being foretold by his deteriorating health in prison will weigh on the country’s collective conscience for long. His age and frailty drew no sympathy from either the prosecuting agency or the trial court, which clung to the state narrative of there being grounds to believe that he was part of a Maoist plot to overthrow the government. Despite being a fit case for bail, he was denied bail, mainly due to the statutory bar on bail under the anti-terrorism law invoked against him. The best the diffident judiciary could do for him was a spell of hospitalisation, even as the octogenarian pleaded that he be given interim bail to be with his friends or allowed to die in prison. The Bombay High Court did issue notice on his bail petition, observing that he was entitled to bail, but his end came in a hospital even before the matter could be taken up for final disposal. Much of the blame and accountability for his death should be on the NIA, which perversely opposed his release, and the court which could have granted interim bail weeks earlier. It was fairly obvious that his prison stay, especially during the pandemic, was detrimental to his well-being. A good two months elapsed between the High Court seeking the NIA’s response to his bail plea on medical grounds and his death. The same court had intervened to grant interim bail to Varavara Rao, another elderly co-accused, holding that bail can be granted “purely on the grounds of sickness, advanced age, infirmity and health conditions”, especially if incarceration amounted to endangering life. It is systemic and institutional failure that another undertrial placed in similar circumstances did not get the benefit of this humane approach. A pattern of institutional oppression can be seen in the events, from the denial of a sipper in jail to his death while in custody. Two larger issues here are the questionable legality of the bail-denying feature of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the validity of the Bhima-Koregaon case itself. It is time the higher judiciary examined these; especially the attempt to link a simple case arising out of violence a day after the Elgar Parishad, a commemorative event held in Pune, and an alleged Maoist plot involving lawyers, activists and human rights defenders. To make matters worse, credible reports that some of the electronic evidence gathered in this case could have been planted remotely by malware were never investigated. The call for accountability for Fr. Swamy’s death rings painfully true.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-death-foretold/article35181945.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Cultural genocide||The recent discovery of hundreds of graves in Canada has put the spotlight back on its dark past, when indigenous people faced systemic discrimination and violence. In June, the Cowessess First Nation, an indigenous organisation, found 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan. This came a month after another indigenous organisation discovered the remains of 215 children at a closed residential school in British Columbia. Canada’s residential school system was a telling example of how indigenous people were treated. Between 1882 and 1996, an estimated 150,000 children were sent to residential schools, that were funded by the federal government and run mostly by the Catholic Church. Most of these students were forcefully taken away from their families. And thousands never returned. In 1883, Canada’s first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, defended in Parliament the system of residential schools, saying indigenous students should be kept away from their parents, “who are savages”. The children were not allowed to speak their languages or practise their culture. Many were abused. An estimated 4,000 children died, mainly due to TB, malnutrition and other illnesses resulting from the squalid conditions in the schools. Despite these horrors, the residential school system continued for over a century. In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology. The Government also set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to document the history and the lasting impact of the school system on the indigenous communities. In 2015, the commission called the violence against the indigenous students a “cultural genocide”. It has made 94 “calls to action” to different levels of the government and communities that included independent investigations and steps to protect Aboriginal rights and culture. It also asked the Catholic Church to apologise and take steps toward reconciliation. The Vatican is yet to formally apologise for the schools. Justin Trudeau, who came to power in 2015, had promised that addressing the grievances of the indigenous communities was a core agenda. But six years later, indigenous organisations say the authorities are half-hearted. The back-to-back discoveries of unmarked graves strengthen indigenous organisations’ claims that the actual number of the dead is way above the estimates of the commission. Mr. Trudeau has expressed “guilt” over the abuses. But that is not enough. His government should assist indigenous organisations to find unmarked graves. He should order investigations into the residential schools with graves to get to the bottom of the matter. Mr. Trudeau should also accelerate steps to implement all the recommendations of the Reconciliation Commission to ensure reparations are done to the country’s indigenous community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cultural-genocide/article35181946.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The future for English in Mysore||Hubli, July 6: English is not likely to continue as a compulsory subject for degree courses in universities in Mysore State. This change in the present pattern is likely to be brought about consequent on the introduction of the two-year pre-university course throughout the State. According to the P.U.C. syllabus, students are required to take any two languages not necessarily English. The possibility of universities making suitable modifications in the pattern of education for degree courses was indicated here yesterday by Prof. D. Javare Gowda, Vice-Chancellor of Mysore University and Chairman of the specially-constituted Pre-University Board which manages Pre-University classes throughout the State from this year. The one-year P.U.C. hitherto run by the Universities in the State is now being run by the Board. When his attention was drawn to the confusion created by the anomaly in Pre-University syllabus where English was not compulsory, and that of the syllabus for degree courses of the Universities where English was compulsory, Prof. Javare Gowda stated that as all the Vice-Chancellors were members of the Pre-University Board and hence party to the decision regarding the syllabus, they had now got to suitably change the syllabus for the degree course to provide for admissions of students who pass the P.U.C. without offering English.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-future-for-english-in-mysore/article35181955.ece

On a sequential basis, the number of departures in June 2021 was higher by 14-15% at 31,700 departure flights as COVID-19 infections witnessed a downward trajectory, ICRA said. “For June 2021, the average daily departures were at nearly 1,100, significantly higher than average daily departures of nearly 700 in June 2020, and higher than nearly 900 in May 2021, though it remained significantly lower than nearly 2,000 in April 2021,” according to Kinjal Shah, V-P & co-group head, ICRA. “The average number of passengers per flight during June 2021 was 94, against an average of 77 passengers per flight in May 2021,” Ms. Shah added. ICRA, however, warned that the rise in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices remained a near-term challenge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/domestic-air-passenger-trips-grew-42-from-may/article35182238.ece

The growth will be aided by a sharp recovery in original equipment manufacturer (OEM) tyre demand, lower base effect of FY21, improving pace of vaccination, continued preference for personal mobility and healthy rural cash flows, ICRA said in a note. “Tyre demand has been relatively more resilient as the replacement demand insulates it from cyclicality to a large extent,” said Srikumar Krishnamurthy, VP and co-group head, ICRA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tyre-industry-to-see-13-15-growth-in-fy22/article35182239.ece

07 July 2021||Hyderabad,||Physio to accompany Sindhu||For B. Evangeline, it will be a different Olympics debut. She will be accompanying world champion and Rio Olympics silver medallist P.V. Sindhu as her physio for next month’s Tokyo Games. Evangeline’s services were sought by Sindhu, given the qualified physio’s significant contribution on her winning the 2019 World championship gold in Basel. “Yes, I am grateful to Sindhu and to M/s. Praveen Raju and Pradeep Raju of Suchitra Academy for the tremendous trust they have shown me for such an event like the Olympics,” she told The Hindu . Asked what exactly was her role, she said: “Frankly, the physio’s response has to be very quick in any given situation, understand the body language of the athlete.” “Fortunately, Sindhu told me the history of her body. So we gelled really well,” the physio said. “Well, every minute aspect including the diet Sindhu takes, number of calories she burns during fitness and practice sessions, are crucial. Recovery sessions are the most important aspect of any athlete’s training,” she said. “I know the demands of Sindhu’s body and what exactly she needs at the end of the day to be back in action the next day,” Evangeline said. Big change “A lot of work has been done on Sindhu in the last few years on the fitness front with Srikanth sir (fitness trainer M. Srikanth Verma) playing a lead role. There is a big change in her fitness levels now,” Evangeline said. “The emphasis in Tokyo will be to check her body daily, whether she needs any trigger points to be released, ensure there is no muscular tightness, no lactic acid formations and whether she needs a massage or not. “And, luckily the Game Recovery equipment sanctioned by the Union Sports Ministry should be a big plus in our preparations,” she said. The physio will also take care of the other Indian athletes in the Olympics. “Definitely, since it will be my first Olympics. I am really excited and take pride in being the first female physio with Indian badminton team for an Olympics. Like all Indians, I would like to see Sindhu win the gold,” she concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/physio-to-accompany-sindhu/article35182240.ece
07 July 2021||LONDON,||Sabalenka and Pliskova power through, set up a semifinal date||Aryna Sabalenka ended Ons Jabeur’s historic run at Wimbledon on Tuesday, the second-seeded Belarus player’s power getting the better of the guile of the Tunisian. Sabalenka won 6-4, 6-3 in 74 minutes as Jabeur lost for the second time in a Grand Slam quarterfinal.. The 23-year-old Sabalenka, who had only won one match in her three previous visits to SW19, will play former World No. 1 Karolina Pliskova who eased into the last four with a straight sets win over Viktorija Golubic. Sabalenka may sport a tiger tattoo — it prompted her parents not to speak to her for a week in 1998 — but the broadest of smiles spread across her face as she soaked up the reality of her achievement. She will try and go one better than compatriot Victoria Azarenka who twice reached the last four in 2011 and 2012. “I mean I am really happy with this win,” she said. “It’s always tough against Ons, she's an amazing player and person. I’m happy it looks like everything is working for me.” Tough battle Sabalenka said she was anticipating a tough battle on Thursday against Pliskova. “It doesn’t matter what happens in the past in tennis (playing Pliskova),” she said. “Pliskova’s a great player and she's serving well. Her game fits really well on grass." Pliskova’s success revolves around her big serve, which rewards her with plenty of easy points and gets her out of trouble when needed. She claimed 24 of 26 points on her serve in one stretch, hit eight aces and saved all three break points on her serve as she coasted to a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Golubic. “I feel like I’m improving with every match,” said Pliskova, the 2016 US Open runner-up. “My game has been good the last two weeks, even during training.” Pliskova averaged 106.5 mph on her first serves, 20.5 mph faster than Golubic, with the retractable roof at No. 1 Court shut because of rain. Capacity crowd The crowd on the No. 1 Court — and Centre Court — was at full capacity on Tuesday for the first time during the tournament after COVID-19 restrictions placed a 50% cap on attendance when the fortnight began. Former champion Angelique Kerber reached the Wimbledon semifinals for the fourth time with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Karolina Muchova of the Czech Republic. Ashleigh Barty outclassed unseeded compatriot Ajla Tomljanovic 6-1, 6-3 to set up a meeting with Kerber. Earlier in the day, No. 14 seed Hubert Hurkacz came back to beat No. 2 Daniil Medvedev 2-6, 7-6(2), 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a fourth-round match that was suspended on Monday while in the fourth set. Hurkacz's first Grand Slam quarterfinal will come against 20-time Major champion Roger Federer. “Roger, what he does, the way he plays, the titles he has won — he has inspired so many people," said Hurkacz, a 24-year-old from Poland. “It’s going to be fun. I’ll be hoping to get a little bit of support.” On Monday, Federer eased past Italy's Lorenzo Sonego 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 to make the last eight for the 18th time. “I felt after the first set I was able to control things. I couldn't be more excited to be in the quarters,” said Federer. Match suspended Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna were trailing by a set (3-6) against 14th seeds Andreja Klepac (Slovenia) and Jean-Julien Rojer (Netherlands) when the contest was suspended due to rain.

07 July 2021||Bengaluru,||IBBC pips Customs in thriller||IBBC edged out Customs & GST 70-68 in the opening match of the State ‘A’ division basketball league at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium outdoor courts here on Tuesday. The league counts among the first official sports events to be conducted after the relaxation of the second COVID-19 lockdown. Matches were held in accordance with the COVID-19 guidelines of the government. Only players and officials involved in matches were allowed into the arena, with all others barred entry. Negative RT-PCR test Players submitted a negative RT-PCR test report to the organising committee, valid for 48 hours, before the start of the matches. Players on the bench, and coaching staff, wore masks and maintained social distancing. On the court, Suresh (20 points) powered IBBC to a close win. With nine seconds left, Karan Joshua finished strong under the basket to give IBBC a slender 69-68 lead. Joshua, who was fouled, then converted the free-throw to make the three-point play. On the final play, Customs’ Dheeraj — he thoroughly impressed with 28 points — failed to make a tough, long three-pointer.  The results: IBBC 70 (Shivaraj Kumar 15, Karan Joshua 15, Suresh 20) bt Customs & GST 68 (Dheeraj 28, Prem 14).   JSC 82 (Kaif 21, Kati 14) bt BSNL 69 (Naresh 23, Ajmal 13).

07 July 2021||KOCHI,||‘The 400m could change my life’||When S. Dhanalakshmi made her 400m debut at the Olympics trials in Patiala on Sunday, she felt good in the first 200m and thought the next half would go well too. But in the last 100m, she realised how difficult the quarter-mile was. “After 300m, everything sort of switched off. I felt like I didn’t have any energy left. I’ve never run more than 300m before,” said the 23-year-old National 100m champion, who made the Indian 4x400m mixed relay team to the Tokyo Olympics after that run, in a chat with The Hindu from Patiala on Tuesday. Coach’s encouragement When Russian Galina Bukharina, the quarter-milers and relay teams’ national coach, asked her to do the 400m trials, Dhanalakshmi felt that she should make the most of it. “Since my chances in the 100m and (4x100m) relay were over, I thought I’d have to wait another four years for the Olympics. Then our coach said, ‘I will give you another chance, you try to finish at least third in the trials, I will surely take you to the Olympics’,” said the sprinter from Tiruchi who had shocked National record-holder Dutee Chand and Hima Das for the National 100m gold. “In the last 50m, my mind was just saying, ‘Olympics, Olympics’. It was close and I pushed my head forward and finished third. Running the 400m and going to the Olympics...this is something unimaginable. How can I even dream such a thing.” Bukharina was thrilled too. “After the trials, she told me I should concentrate on the 400m. That I would surely run in 52s if I train hard,” said Dhanalakshmi who had an impressive varsities debut three years ago. The quarter-mile now appears sweeter to the youngster who entered the national camp in March. Better chance “In 100, you will go places only if you clock 11s. In 400m, you have the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games and a better chance of winning medals in relays so I’m wondering whether to shift to the 400m. It could change my life in a big way.” At school (Abbot Marcel RC HSS), Dhanalakshmi used to do well at the zonal and district-level there. “But I used to finish last or close to that in State meets,” she said. It was only when she reached college (SRC, Tiruchi) that she felt the need for systematic training. “So I joined Manikandan Arumugam’s group a few years ago.” That has transformed her life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-400m-could-change-my-life/article35182362.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||An elephant walks into the Oval and attaches itself to history||Many years I was asked at a quiz: What is the name of the elephant who came to the Oval as India were winning a Test and series in England for the first time? This was not an animal who wandered into a cricket ground to see how his countrymen were doing, but one that had been borrowed from the nearby Chessington Zoo by Indian fans celebrating the Ganesha festival. “Bella,” I said, and earned points for my team. Fifty years ago — for that is when this happened — you could bring an elephant into a ground where an international match was taking place. Bella, who had been originally bought from a pet store in Birmingham, died in 1990, but did not rate a mention in the obituary section of Wisden , unlike Peter the cat at Lord’s (“whose ninth life ended in November 1964…”). But she will be remembered as the most unexpected spectator at India’s triumph. And somehow will be connected to the event through history. The late Ajit Wadekar, India’s captain then, has spoken about how manager Hemu Adhikari saw the appearance of the elephant as a good omen on an auspicious day. Wadekar was fond of recalling how he went out to bat on his overnight score of 45 and was run out first ball. So much for luck and omens. But he did believe that Lord Ganesha had appeared that morning. “It is no secret,” wrote Wadekar in his autobiography, “that I was fast asleep during India’s finest hour… it was Ken Barrington who was the first to congratulate me (‘It’s all over. The match is yours.’). There could not have been a better bearer of good news than the bluff and hearty former England batsman.”  The Observer reports...  The Observer wrote of the moment when Abid Ali cut Brian Luckhurst for the match-winning boundary thus: “Every Indian tourist, businessman, waiter and schoolboy in London seemed to be at the Oval. What follows is like one of Eisenstein’s crowd scenes. While the ball is still 50 yards from the boundary, massed Indians leap the barrier and charge. The England team sprint for the pavilion. The umpires gather up the stumps before they are lost to the marauders. Hot on the heels of the shock troops, a little Indian girl of not more than five years old lifts her even smaller brother over the fence, takes his hand and drags him to where the action is. In no time the Indian batsmen are being swept towards the pavilion on the shoulders of the crowd.” Back in Mumbai, “there was dancing in the streets,” reported Wisden , “Revellers stopped and boarded buses to convey the news to commuters. In the homes, children garlanded the wireless sets…” Breakthrough series India had won the previous series in the West Indies for the first time, yet this win in England, against an outfit that could call themselves World champions (now that South Africa were banned for their policy of apartheid), was even more significant. England had been unbeaten for 27 Tests before Oval. England saw the establishing of the great quartet of spinners, Erapalli Prasanna (who did not play a Test), Bishan Bedi, Srinivas Venkatraghavan and Bhagwath Chandrasekhar, who among them claimed 197 of the 244 wickets to fall on the tour. Speaking to the hero of that India win, Chandrasekhar, has always been a pleasure and an education. “I can’t believe that 50 years have passed,” he said, the smile never too far from his tone. His figures are stamped on Indian fans of a certain vintage: 18.1-3-38-6. In fact, he had his hand in another dismissal too. “Yes, John Jameson,” he recalled, “I deflected a straight drive from Luckhurst onto the stumps. It was a superb decision, a close one. The umpire was in the ideal position to judge.” Till that Oval win India had lost just over thrice as many Tests as they had won (16-49); after that, they won more Tests than they lost. So much has been written so often about that win and everything it meant to Indian cricket that it is in danger of having its excitement sucked out through repetition and becoming a stuffed version of a once thrilling animal in some sporting museum. But, amazingly, it endures. There have been other wins, but the first is always special. “I remember that elephant, a baby elephant I think it was,” recalled Chandrasekhar. Whether the current Indian team in England know of the elephant or not, they will have at least one member of that 1971 team to celebrate with on August 24 on the eve of the third Test in Leeds. Sunil Gavaskar. Possibly Farokh Engineer too. They too might agree it happened just the other day, and you don’t need to have the memory of an elephant to recall the details.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/an-elephant-walks-into-the-oval-and-attaches-itself-to-history/article35182244.ece

07 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Alex Antony breaks a tradition||Pulluvilla, a coastal village in Thiruvananthapuram, is known for its football and footballers. Alex Antony, who has now been selected for Tokyo Olympics in the mixed relay event, has broken this stereotype of his village. He has also become the first sportsman from Pulluvilla to represent the country in Olympics. Football was his first love and Alex was good enough to represent Thiruvananthapuram schools in the State School Games. Though Alex used to take part in athletic competitions during the annual school sports meet, a full-time career in athletics was not even remotely on his mind. Pradeep, a physical education teacher attached to Kanjirankulam PKS school, realised that Alex had talent and advised him to take up athletics seriously. At his insistence, Alex took part in the SAI trails held at Thalassery. Though he was not selected Alex caught the eye of Nishad Kumar, who was the national jumps coach.  Nishad asked him to attend the summer camp at LNCPE, Kariyavattom, where he was selected to the SAI hostel the next year. “I saw a spark in that boy and asked him to join the camp. He was very sincere and a hard worker. But I still think he has not done justice to his potential. I am happy he has been selected for the Olympics. His best is yet to come,” said Nishad Kumar. Under Nishad’s coaching Alex started winning medals at junior level in 400m. Alex gradually started making his mark at the senior level, winning the Inter-State athletics meet in 2019 with a timing of 46.1s. The effort won him a place in the Indian mixed relay teams for the Asian and World championships. “I never imagined I would become an athlete. Everything I have achieved so far is like a dream to me. To represent India in Olympics is a great achievement for me. I am thankful to all may coaches especially Nishad sir, without him I wouldn’t have become an athlete. I am indebted to him. We have a good team and can spring a surprise in the Olympics,’’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/alex-antony-breaks-a-tradition/article35182602.ece
07 July 2021||Manchester,||Defensively solid England takes on a resilient Denmark||England has the chance to reach a first major final since its 1966 World Cup triumph when it takes on Denmark in Wednesday’s Euro 2020 semifinal, but it will need to banish a history of stumbling at this stage. Coach Gareth Southgate has been keen to keep the burden of history out of his team’s thinking, though he does not have to look back far for a warning against complacency. An England side containing 10 of the current squad faced Denmark in October in a Nations League match and lost 1-0 to a Christian Eriksen penalty. Eriksen, who is recovering from the shocking cardiac episode he suffered as he collapsed in Denmark’s opening Euro game, will not feature at Wembley of course. But Kasper Hjulmand’s side will be largely the same as the one which left London with three points eight months ago. The lessons from that game are limited by the fact that England played almost an hour with 10 men after Harry Maguire was sent off in the 31st minute. Yet to concede Maguire looks rock solid at the moment as part of an England defence which has yet to concede a goal in the tournament. And with Harry Kane back to scoring form with three goals in the two knockout stage games, England looks to be peaking at the right moment. Denmark’s performances, where it has responded to the Eriksen trauma in such inspiring fashion, should also keep England focused. Hjulmand’s team, meanwhile, has a clear structure and method to its play which has earned them its place in the last four. In attack, Martin Braithwaite creates the spaces which Mikkel Damsgaard and Kasper Dolberg have exploited well and there is a threat from attacking wing backs Jens Stryger Larsen and the excellent Joakim Maehle. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Thomas Delaney are a firm presence in the centre of midfield while the back line in front of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel has been solid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/defensively-solid-england-takes-on-a-resilient-denmark/article35182197.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nobel laureate champions a cause||Nobel laureate Prof. Muhammad Yunus, who works for the betterment of society with his revolutionary idea of Grameen Bank, may not visit the Tokyo Olympics owing to the pandemic, but has been relentlessly working for the social success of the Paris Games scheduled for 2024. In a lively webinar on ‘how sport can change the world’, initiated by Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra on Monday, Prof. Yunus shared his experience and views on tapping the power of sports. Prof. Yunus revealed that he had given the 2024 organisers a simple formula that every single penny of their €7 billion budget should have a “social purpose”. “The beautiful Games Village which they build for the athletes should serve the poor people in that area, with school, market area etc. I asked them to design it in a way that it serves the homeless people of the local community. I keep asking them tough questions, and they try to find solutions. One Olympics can transform the society,” said Prof. Yunus. When queried by the Madhya Pradesh Sports Minister, Yashodara Raje Scindia, Prof. Yunus said that it was equally important to support those who don’t succeed in sports. “Put the money on the table. The thinking starts, once the money is there,” said Prof. Yunus, as he suggested supporting sports persons after their sporting career, by encouraging them to be entrepreneurs rather than ‘job seekers’. Collective good Explaining the difference between business, charity and social business, Prof. Yunus emphasised that the thought of “collective good” was as much part of human beings, as “self interest”. Prof. Yunus stressed that the pandemic, despite serving a huge blow to humanity, had given an opportunity for the world to start in a new direction, and avoid a suicidal path.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nobel-laureate-champions-a-cause/article35182364.ece

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Hardik bowling is a very good sign: Suryakumar||Innovative batsman Suryakumar Yadav has said that Hardik Pandya resuming bowling is a “very good sign” ahead of India’s limited-overs series in Sri Lanka. “He did bowl in the England series [at home earlier this year]. I was part of it — in all the T20 games, he bowled. In the deciding ODI also he bowled when the team was in a crunch situation, so it was good,” Suryakumar told on Tuesday in a virtual interaction from Colombo. “I think the team management and Hardik knew their responsibilities really well, so they were taking a call. Here, in the intra-squad game, he did bowl in the nets. “He is bowling. It is his and the team management’s call [as to] how they want to go about it. But yes, he is bowling and it is a very good sign.” Ever since Hardik broke down with a serious back injury during the 2018 Asia Cup, the all-rounder has hardly contributed consistently with the ball in India’s blues. While his workload with the ball during the limited-overs series against England gave a glimmer of hope, a niggle that he developed as a result meant he didn’t bowl a single ball during the Indian Premier League. With an eye on the T20 World Cup starting on October 17, Hardik’s bowling fitness will be under the scanner during India’s three ODIs and as many T20Is in the island nation, to be played from July 13. Mood upbeat Suryakumar stressed that the mood in the camp was quite upbeat and he was looking forward to learning from Rahul Dravid who is in charge of the team. “In the few practice sessions, the intra-squad game and team meetings, the atmosphere is very calm and composed with his presence,” Suryakumar said. “We are relaxed, at the same time very excited about this tournament.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hardik-bowling-is-a-very-good-sign-suryakumar/article35182184.ece
07 July 2021||KOLKATA,||Sakshi upbeat about Indian wrestlers’ chances at Tokyo||Rio Olympics bronze medal winner Sakshi Malik feels that the Indian wrestlers will experience a lot of success in the upcoming Olympic Games. Sakshi, the first woman wrestler from the country to land an Olympic medal, is optimistic about the Indian sportspersons’ overall showing in Tokyo in about a month’s time. “I feel, and the whole country feels, this time we are going to get the maximum number of medals. Last time we had managed only two medals in the Olympics,” Sakshi told The Hindu . Two to three medals According to Sakshi, the wrestlers will contribute handsomely to the country’s medal haul. “This time, I think, we will win two to three medals only in wrestling. I am 100% sure of that,” said Sakshi. Altogether seven Indian freestyle wrestlers, including four women (Seema Bisla (50kg), Vinesh Phogat (53kg), Anshu Malik (57kg) and Sonam Malik (62kg)) and three men (Ravi Kumar Dahiya (57kg), Bajrang Punia (65kg) and Deepak Punia (86kg)) have qualified for the Tokyo Games. Sakshi, who could not make it to the 2020 Olympics, said she would try to do well in the mega events next year. “I lost in the trials (for Olympic qualifiers) due to some of my mistakes. Maybe that was how God wanted it to be, or perhaps I was destined for that, or maybe there was a lack of effort. But I will continue with my career and I want to win medals for the country in the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games in 2022,” said Sakshi, backed by JSW.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sakshi-upbeat-about-indian-wrestlers-chances-at-tokyo/article35182195.ece
07 July 2021||BENGALURU,||Costa joins BFC on two-year loan||Bengaluru FC, on Tuesday, announced the signing of Brazilian defender Alan Henrique Costa on a two-year loan deal from Avai Futebol Clube, a side in the Brazilian first division. The 30-year-old is BFC's second foreign acquisition under new head coach Marco Pezzaiuoli, after Gabonese defender Yrondu Musavu-King. Costa has spent all his career in Brazil and has had stints at Palmeiras, Internacional and Coritiba, and loan spells at Sao Bento and Vitoria, before joining Avaí in 2020. “I'm really happy to have signed for Bengaluru FC and I have good expectations about Indian football. I didn’t know too much about the Indian Super League, but I have friends who have played here, who have only great things to say,” a press release quoted Costa as saying.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/costa-joins-bfc-on-two-year-loan/article35182246.ece

Mehta, who has had stints with ATK in ISL and Mohun Bagan in the I-League, returns to Kolkata after spending a season with the NorthEast United FC. Mehta, who won I-League titles each with Aizawl FC (2016-17) and Mohun Bagan (2019-20), will be looking to bolster the defence of last season’s ISL runner-up. With the number of foreign players reduced to four in each side from the ensuing season, Mehta’s performance as a side-back with NorthEast United in the previous season may have inspired ATK MB coach Antonio Lopez Habas to get him back in the side. “I like the football philosophy and the unyielding attitude of Habas Sir. The team has great unity. The team fights until the last minute. I am so proud to be able to sign for the best team in the country,” Mehta said in a statement issued by the club. “He (Mehta) is a complete player. He has great physical capacity, is good in the air, and is technically remarkable. He can play in different positions in defensive formations. We have a lot of expectations from him for the next season,” Habas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ashutosh-mehta-joins-atk-mohun-bagan/article35182678.ece

07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Ahead of the game||How does a 137-year-old Swiss watch house that has positioned itself as a pilots’ brand future-proof itself? It strengthens its digital presence, takes a shot at gamification, aligns itself with surfers and drone racers, and makes itself attractive to women. That’s right, CEO Georges Kern has made no secret of the fact that he wishes to position Breitling as an inclusive alternative to traditional luxury brands, and getting women customers on board is a big part of that plan. Earlier this week, Breitling partnered with Drest, an immersive fashion and styling gaming app, to introduce a new batch of Superoceans. While the Breitling Superocean Heritage ’57 Pastel Paradise Capsule Collection can be a mouthful, this ‘post-pandemic summer’ edition of the brand’s retro dive watch is a refreshing departure from most women’s watches. Take the size for instance - the 38mm stainless steel case is just right for women who say no to ‘dainty’. Plus, men won’t be shy about wearing them too. As the Watches & Wonders Geneva fair earlier this year proved, there is an infusion of pastels on both suits (I’m looking at your cotton candy experiment, Oris) and sports watches for men. Breitling’s Pastel Paradise doesn’t disappoint, with white, aquamarine, mint green and iced latte tone-on-tone dials, bezels and straps. These beauties, including a rainbow edition, are great for Drest’s ‘dressing up avatars’ and mood board challenges. Surf’s up “We needed some colours and fun after this Covid situation, and the design team redesigned the 1957 dive watch in a very modern way, with the colours and ceramic,” begins Kern at a virtual roundtable that includes Drest’s founder and CEO, Lucy Yeomans, and Australian professional surfer Sally Fitzgibbons. Kern has been championing the ‘retro modern’ concept since he took over as Breitling chief back in 2017. He has ensured their advertising, their loft-style boutiques and the sports they support echo the current casualisation of the luxury industry. There is surfing, a motorcycle championship celebrating vintage motorbikes, the Drone Champions League, and a triathlon-style race with cycling app, Strava. As for fashion, their debut challenge with Drest back in January - the Chronomat for women range - saw the winner walk away with a Chronomat Automatic 36 in stainless steel (approx 4,700 USD). “Drest is the next level for us, as we have not been in fashion. Neo luxury is about having consumers participate in the creative process,” says Kern. It doesn’t matter if some players can’t be bothered that the watches run on COSC-certified Breitling Caliber 10. “Through platforms like Drest, we see how participants interpret the brand. It’s super helpful for us in making products and campaigns,” he concludes. Pastel Paradise is $4,630 USD approx. on www.breitling.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ahead-of-the-game/article35182586.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Yes, Cannes do||After more than a year away from its traditional May slot, the venerable Festival de Cannes returns in early July in a physical edition. Even for those of us double vaccinated people, there are Covid tests to be passed and forms to be filled to enter France. For those who are not, there are even more tests and forms, plus a quarantine period. And at the festival, understandably, there are a host of safety protocols in place. At the end of the day, what awaits us is a feast of cinema. The festival opens with French auteur Leos Carax’s keenly anticipated first English-language feature Annette , a musical starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard. It will close with Nicolas Bedos’ French film OSS 117: From Africa With Love , starring Jean Dujardin, the third instalment of the modern cinematic revival of the beloved 1960s series of films. The first two, set in Cairo and Rio respectively, were delightfully politically incorrect. However, they were made in 2006 and 2009, and since then the world has gone woke with a vengeance, though not France so much, so I retain hopes of some irreverent humour. It is a vast programme packed with riches. From the competition section alone Hungarian filmmaker Ildikó Enyedi, who made the terrific On Body and Soul (2017), returns with The Story of My Wife , headlined by Léa Seydoux and Louis Garrel; veteran Paul Verhoeven with Benedetta , with Charlotte Rampling and Virginie Efira; Nanni Moretti with Three Floors , with Anna Bonaiuto, Riccardo Scamarcio and Alba Rohrwacher; Asghar Farhadi with A Hero , starring Amir Jadidi, Mohsen Tanabandeh and Fereshteh Sadre Orafaiy; and François Ozon with Everything Went Fine , starring Sophie Marceau, Charlotte Rampling and Hanna Schygulla. Fans of Thai maven Apichatpong Weerasethakul will be queuing up for his first English feature Memoria , starring Tilda Swinton. If you ask me to go out on a limb and name just one film that I’d kill to get into, that would be Jacques Audiard’s Paris, 13th District , co-written by Céline Sciamma and starring the redoubtable Noémie Merlant, whose first film as director, Mi Iubita Mon Amour , is also playing in Cannes as a special screening. I’ve watched Audiard’s films, including Dheepan (2015), an unhealthy number of times, and he also directed the last two episodes of season five of The Bureau , elevating it from a very good series to a masterpiece. India is represented by Rahul Jain, who gave us the searing Sundance winner Machines (2016), and now he tackles the long-standing problem that is Delhi pollution with Invisible Demons . And here I was thinking that the demons in Delhi are very much visible… There is also Payal Kapadia’s epistolary fable A Night of Knowing Nothing , which promises to be dreamy. I also have great hopes for Singapore-Bangladesh film Rehana Maryam Noor , directed by Abdullah Mohammad Saad of Live From Dhaka fame, and the portmanteau film The Year of the Everlasting Storm , with segments from Singapore’s Anthony Chen ( Wet Season ) and Iranian master Jafar Panahi. I’ll be back with a post-festival report in a couple of weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/yes-cannes-do/article35182591.ece
07 July 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan Cabinet expansion a ‘work in progress’, says Maken||The Cabinet expansion and political appointments in Rajasthan were a “work in progress” and a decision on these subjects would be taken soon, AICC general secretary Ajay Maken said here on Tuesday during his two-day visit to the State Capital. Mr. Maken said talks were being held with all Congress leaders on these issues. He told reporters at the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters here that there were vacancies in the State Cabinet, while the political appointments, along with the appointment of district and block presidents, were also to be made. “We will take everyone along in this exercise,” the Congress leader said. Infighting between MLAs Mr. Maken’s visit assumed significance amid the infighting between the Congress MLAs from the rival camps of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot. The Pilot loyalists have expressed resentment over being ignored even a year after the political crisis caused by their rebellion. The AICC general secretary in charge of Rajasthan, who met the party leaders from the rival factions, was likely to meet Mr. Gehlot as well. While the legislators were staking their claims to key posts, Mr. Maken said the difference of opinion among the members is found in every political party, Congress being no exception. PCC meeting He also attended a meeting with the PCC office-bearers to deliberate on the ruling party’s outreach programme to provide succour to the covid-affected families and an 11-day-long agitation, beginning on Wednesday, against price rise and the constant increase in the prices of petroleum products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-cabinet-expansion-a-work-in-progress-says-maken/article35182377.ece
07 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Crimes against women saw over 63% rise in 2021 so far||Crime against women in the Capital increased by 63.3% in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020, data shared by Delhi Police showed. The data states that rape cases saw an increase of 43% from 580 till June 15 last to 833 this year, molestation jumped by 39% from 733 to 1,022, kidnapping of women from 1,026 to 1,580, abduction of women from 46 to 159, and dowry deaths from 47 to 56. Henious crimes Heinous crime figure, till June 15, has come down marginally from 2,436 to 2,315. In the first six months this year, the city recorded seven cases of dacoity, 196 of murder, 295 of attempt to murder, 942 of robbery, 35 of riot, and seven of kidnapping for ransom. In the corresponding period last year, Delhi witnessed four cases of dacoity, 226 of murder, 236 of attempt to murder, 701 of robbery, 681 of riot and eight of kidnapping for ransom, the data stated. It’s pertinent to note that the number of riot cases came down significantly this year as communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi in February last year following anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. According to the data, the number of non-heinous crimes has increased by 8.5%. Till June 15 this year, a total of 1,20,980 cases of non-heinous crime have been reported while the number stood at 1,11,419 last year. The data showed there were 1,217 more cases of snatching reported in 2021 as compared to 2021 with 3,829 cases of snatching this time and 2,612 in last year. The total number cases of hurt, burglary, motor vehicle theft and house theft stood at 493, 1,173, 15,667 and 938 respectively as compared to 421, 839, 13130, and 875 last year. The data showed that fatal and non-fatal accidents rose from 392 and 1,260 cases in 2020 to 449 and 1,497 cases this year, respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/crimes-against-women-saw-over-63-rise-in-2021-so-far/article35182385.ece
07 July 2021||July 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Barbara Sturm: growing her empire||At the mere mention of retinoids, Dr Barbara Sturm is aghast, her crystal blue eyes wide with disappointment. During a virtual event ahead of the June 8 launch of Dr Barbara Sturm products on the Global Store on Nykaa’s mobile app, the internationally-acclaimed inflammatory doctor and skin specialist tells a virtual room of influencers and journalists that retinol is inflammatory and can do more harm than help. The 49-year-old disruptor shot to fame as the doctor who helped save late NBA champion Kobe Bryant’s injured knee in a treatment that was known as the ‘Kobe Procedure’. A deep appreciator of Ayurveda, she tells The Hindu Weekend in an email interview that her love for skincare and holistic beauty comes from — like most people — her mother, a chemist, and her grandmother, a pharmacist. “They both loved milk baths and dry brushing, and would mix creams for us as children. We would often go into the forest during my childhood and pick medicinal herbs and roots,” she recalls. “I was taught early on to use ingredients found in nature for their healing properties and to treat the skin gently. This is something that is deeply rooted in my skincare philosophy and skincare line.” She shares that she merges science and spirituality, and it shows in quotidian routines, such as drinking warm water upon waking up and tongue scraping. It also reflects in some of her products which have purslane in them. Science of ingredients But the framework of Dr Sturm’s Germany-made line sits in that sweet spot between nature and science. To this day, she does not understand why marketing-based skincare even exists, adding, “Advanced ingredient science is what I build my skincare solutions around — potent, key ingredients that have been widely, clinically studied for their properties and efficacy. Skin has both overlapping and unique needs, and requires science and results-driven skincare to be healthy, functioning, but also look good.” That is why she has created so many ‘white T-shirt’ products such as the Hyaluronic Serum (Rs. 10,660), Sun Drops SPF 30 (Rs. 5,050), Brightening Face Cream (Rs. 17,950), and Face Cream Rich (Rs. 17,950) — all in her trademark sand-blasted glass bottles and tubs. One of her more novel and pandemic-ready inventions is her reusable Nano Silver Mask that both protects and cares for the skin (price TBC). She is also known for her Darker Skin Tones products that aim to even out and brighten rather than lighten the skin of melanin-active Indian consumers. Dr Sturm’s products are also geared towards women’s needs, such as her V Collection specifically for intimate skin care, and her pregnancy-safe line which has been lauded by American actor-dancer Jenna Dewan and model Ashley Graham. Yes, the products are pricey. But she says such price tags on skincare are attributed to their development and ingredient concentrations, and she knows the Indian market is aware of this. She explains, “It is inevitably going to be ‘luxury’ because it is so expensive to make it that way. I do think people are beginning to appreciate and understand that process. But, at the same time, I think about how to democratise and bring great skincare to more people. I will do something about it soon.” The great equaliser The skincare luminary has worked with some famous faces such as Jennifer Lopez, Venus Williams and Kim Kardashian, people who are under the gun to constantly look perfect. But she says skin health is an equaliser for her. “Skin is skin,” she insists, “there is no difference between a celebrity’s skin and yours. My fundamental advise never changes: protect and boost your skin barrier function, provide it with essential nutrition and hydration, and combat inflammation with skincare ingredient science. Avoid make-up, irritating and aggressive ingredients, acid peels and lasers. Heal and protect your skin and it will glow.” When the coronavirus pandemic hit the beauty and skincare industry hard, Dr Sturm found she and her teams had to pivot hard to a new normal. “For me, it caused an emergency acceleration [product development, expansion, etc] of the things that I intended to carry out anyway at my company to improve the customer experience.” One of the more popular ventures is Skin School, a series of free-to-attend, monthly live digital classes via Eventbrite focussing on the needs of young adult and teen skin; the series (on YouTube) features celebrities such as model Hailey Baldwin and actor Colton Haynes, among others.  Dr Barbara Sturm’s products is available on the Global Store on Nykaa’s mobile app.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/barbara-sturm-growing-her-empire/article35182585.ece
07 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha fears vaccine stock-out||The Odisha government on Tuesday urged the Centre to make COVID-19 doses available immediately to the State as it would have no stock of vaccine left for a week after its current stock runs out. Pradipta Mohapatra, Additional Chief Secretary (Health) wrote to Union Health Secretary: “Since late June, the State is vaccinating over three lakh citizens daily subject to availability of vaccines. On Monday, we had administered 4.02 lakh doses successfully — highest ever single day vaccination for the State.” “However, as on today [Tuesday], we have 6.14 lakh doses of Covishield available, which will be consumed within the two days. The next tranche of Covishield is scheduled for July 15. Hence the State will have stock-out of vaccines from July 9 to 15,” Mr. Mohapatra stated. He urged the Union Health Secretary to supply the required vaccines within the next two days. “The Covishield allocation for July is 25.31 lakh doses, which is lower than the 28.31 lakh second dose due requirement for the month of July,” Mr. Mohapatra said, requesting additional allocation of 15 lakh doses of Covishield to Odisha to manage COVID-19 vaccination smoothly. Odisha has been witnessing queues in front of all vaccination centresfrom the early hours. Tension runs high and physical distancing is not maintained.

07 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Rising agri demand forces power curbs on industrial units in Punjab||As Punjab continues to struggle with severe power shortage, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has yet again imposed curbs on industrial consumers, directing the general industry to observe three days off till July 10. The PSPCL in its latest order said that in view of the prolonged dry spell and increase in demand of power from agriculture sector, it has been decided to impose power regulatory measures on industrial consumers, except essential industries and services of west, north and central zones. The power regulatory measure includes three weekly-off days for general industry (large scale), rolling mills, arc and induction furnaces consumers from July 7 till July 10. Responding to the announcement, Badish Jindal, president of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association said that the industry — be it the large, medium or the small scale — already had been facing financial stress due to COVID-19 pandemic, and now the unscheduled cuts and shutdowns have only aggravated the problem. “The industry is shut but yet we have to pay salaries to the workers. We are paying the interest on loans etc. to banks, exports orders are being cancelled... Due to the shutdown several industry sectors are not in a position to deliver the orders within the stipulated time to buyers, hence the buyers are not just cancelling the order but also imposing penalties,” he told The Hindu . ‘Unfortunate situation’ “Every year the demand for power rises during the paddy sowing season, which is not something new. Even credible weather forecast mechanism is available, yet we are facing such situation, which is unfortunate,” said Mr. Jindal. Punjab’s average electricity demand during the ongoing paddy season has been more than 14,500 MW, against average supply of 13,500 MW. The PSPCL on July 5 in a statement stated that on an average 10.3 hours of electricity across the State was supplied for paddy operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rising-agri-demand-forces-power-curbs-on-industrial-units-in-punjab/article35182373.ece

07 July 2021||LUCKNOW,||‘Spurt in chain-snatching a matter of grave concern’||A spurt in incidents of chain-snatching is a matter of grave concern and has created a fear psychosis, rendering many women reluctant to step out of their homes, the Allahabad High Court has noted. The court made the observation while rejecting the bail application of a person accused of chain-snatching and later firing at the police team which had gone to apprehend him last October in Kanpur. “Even as the chain-snatchers continue to prowl the city with repeated incidents of them targeting women, a sense of fear has been instilled in women who have now stopped wearing gold ornaments or at the most wear a very thin one that is not even visible,” the court said. ‘Take them seriously’ Such incidents needed to be taken seriously and the offenders must be instilled with a sense of fear so that women felt safe and free as such incidents not only caused terror but also restricted their mobility, Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/spurt-in-chain-snatching-a-matter-of-grave-concern/article35182372.ece
