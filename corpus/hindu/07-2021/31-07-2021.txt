31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to hear plea against snooping next week||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear next week a petition filed by senior journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar for an independent investigation, headed by a former or a sitting judge, of mass surveillance of more than 142 potential “targets”, including journalists, lawyers, Ministers, Opposition politicians, constitutional functionaries and civil society activists, using the military-grade Israeli spyware Pegasus. The petition was mentioned by senior advocate Kapil Sibal before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana. He submitted that the petition ought to be heard urgently as it concerned issues affecting the fundamental rights and civil liberties of citizens and even national security. The issue was making waves not only in India but also globally. “Such mass surveillance using a military-grade spyware abridges several fundamental rights and appears to represent an attempt to infiltrate, attack and destabilise independent institutions that act as critical pillars of our democratic set-up,” the petition said. It sought a full disclosure from the government of whether it had authorised the snooping which, the petition said, seemed to be an attempt to muzzle free speech and chill dissent. The government had still not given a straight answer to whether the hacking was done with its blessings, it pointed out. “Respondents [Ministries of Home, Information Technology and Communications] have not categorically ruled out obtaining Pegasus licences to conduct surveillance in their response, and have taken no steps to ensure a credible and independent investigation into these extremely serious allegations,” it noted. The spying had caused serious dents on the rights to free speech and privacy. It had no legal basis. In fact, the legal regime for surveillance under Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act had been completely bypassed. Civilians had become targets, it said. ‘A criminal offence’ “Surveillance/interception is justified only in cases of public emergency or in the interests of public safety, and the existence of such conditions must be inferred reasonably and cannot be determined solely on the assessment of the government… The hack/interception/decryption occasioned by the Pegasus spyware constitutes a criminal offence,” it highlighted. The Pegasus software, built by the NSO Group, is “extremely advanced and capable of infecting a mobile phone/device without any interaction with the owner”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-to-hear-plea-against-snooping-next-week/article35643469.ece

While the State and national highways have been restored for traffic, as many as 20 interior roads connecting various villages remained closed for traffic in Belagavi district. However, these villages are connected through alternative routes. As per official data, Belagavi district has received 257.3 mm of rainfall from July 1 to 30, which is 34% more than the average rainfall of 192.5 mm. On Friday, outflow from the Doodhganga Barrage was 42,240 cusecs and from Rajapur Barrage, it was 2,62,000, which meant that the Krishna recorded a total inflow of 3.04 lakh cusecs. According to Belagavi district administration, because of the heavy downpour from July 22 to 30, 192 villages of Belagavi, Khanapur, Chikkodi, Nippani, Athani, Kagwad, Raibag, Ramadurg, Gokak and Mudalagi taluks have been affected. And, already 1,23,364 people and 55,485 head of cattle have been evacuated and shifted to safer places.

31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Oxygen generation plants at all private hospitals||The Telangana government has asked all registered private hospitals in the State to install Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants as per their bed capacity by August 31. The Director of Public Health and Family Welfare in a communication to managements warned that failure to install the plants may be viewed seriously and lead to cancellation of recognition of their respective hospitals. Bed capacity The plants must have capacity to generate 500 litres per minute of oxygen for hospitals with a bed capacity up to 200, 1,000 litres per minute from 200 to 500 beds and 2,000 litres per minute where the bed capacity was more than 500. In May, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had informed State governments that oxygen generation plants provide the hospitals with an assured medical oxygen supply that was of critical need during health emergencies. Ministry’s suggestion Hence, the Central government wanted all States to establish PSA oxygen generation plants in both public health facilities as well as private hospitals.

Moodbidri MLA Umanath Kotian opened the bridge for vehicular movement after the district administration issued a notification. The Public Works Department successfully conducted load test on the bridge up to 70 tonnes on Thursday. The bridge, a crucial link between the city and the airport as well as pilgrim centre Kateel, was closed for vehicular traffic on June 15 when one of its slabs sank by about 2.5 ft. The supporting pillar also sank into the foundation. The department, with help from experts, undertook restoration of the affected pillar and slab by strengthening the foundation and lifting the slab to its original position. It availed the services of Mugrodi Construction, which is building a new parallel bridge at the location as part of four-lane work on Airport Road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maravoor-bridge-thrown-open-to-vehicular-traffic/article35643925.ece
31 July 2021||Mangaluru,||Rising COVID-19 cases in twin districts causing concern||Increasing COVID-19 cases in the coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada, overtaking Bengaluru Urban over the last few days, has been a matter of concern. Health professionals say that it cannot be attributed entirely to the high positivity rate prevailing in the neighbouring Kerala. People failing to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, after relaxation in the lockdown guidelines, and the increasing movement of people are also contributing to the spread of the infection, they say. Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada K.V. Rajendra, also a doctor, said that the positivity rate in some of the areas in Kerala was between 13% and 14%. “It may be one of the reasons for the infection spreading again in Dakshina Kannada. Opening up of various activities following the lockdown relaxations and people not serious enough in following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour have also contributed to the increase in the cases,” he said. Dr. Rajendra said that the swab samples being tested in the district continues to be at 7,500 to 8,000 samples daily. The average positivity rate stood at 3.76% to 4%. However, it was at 5.76% on Thursday. “We want to increase the sample tests to 10,000 daily from next month,” the Deputy Commissioner said. The District Disaster Management Authority will meet on Saturday to discuss imposing additional restrictions to contain the spread of infection, the Deputy Commissioner said. Dakshina Kannada District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishor Kumar said that swab samples of those who enter from Kerala and other States are being randomly collected on the spot at 13 places in Dakshina Kannada. Chief COVID Nodal Officer, Government Wenlock Hospital, Annayya Kulal said that as the two coastal districts are both education and medical hubs, there is high movement of people now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-two-coastal-districts-make-up-more-cases-than-bengaluru-urban/article35643505.ece
31 July 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi Assembly bats for repeal of farm laws||The Delhi Legislative Assembly, during the concluding day of the monsoon session on Friday, “noted with concern” that the Central government had not “heeded the demands by the farmers” for withdrawal of the farm laws in spite of their peaceful protests. “Keeping in view the genuine demand of the farmers and also the fact that many farmers have lost their lives in this long struggle, this House strongly recommends that the Union Government should immediately repeal the three Farm Laws and call the farmers’ association for talks to understand their grievances,” stated the motion, which was later adopted by the Assembly. GNCTD Act The House also discussed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which gives more teeth to the Lieutenant Governor in the city’s administration. Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain and Aam Aadmi Party MLAs protested against the Act with Mr. Jain alleging that it was “a violation of the Constitution.” MLA Raghav Chadha alleged that the BJP wanted to “indirectly capture Delhi government” since it “cannot run it directly”. Senior AAP leader and MLA Atishi said that the BJP had not only taken away the strength of the Delhi government but also that of the Assembly. “It is clear that the BJP knows it is not going to come to power in Delhi. Because of this, it is trying to grab power in Delhi by entering from the side doors,” alleged AAP MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj. The Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution recommending that only doctors and paramedics who have served people in the Capital during the pandemic be nominated by the Delhi government for the Padma awards. It recommended honouring the entire Indian medical fraternity by conferring the Bharat Ratna on the ‘Bharatiya Doctor’. “We have all seen how not just our country but the entire world has been suffering because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, our doctors and paramedics put their lives at stake to serve the nation. In such a time, it is the duty of the whole society to thank and give the utmost respect to the medical community,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told the House. On his part, Leader of the Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri requested the CM to “fulfil his widely advertised promise of giving Delhi’s farmers 50% more than the minimum support price (MSP) and alternative plots to those farmers whose land has been acquired by the government, and implement Central government policies for their benefit.” He demanded that the Delhi government fulfil its promise of compensating the families of ‘Corona Warriors’ belonging to the civic bodies as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-assembly-bats-for-repeal-of-farm-laws/article35643603.ece
31 July 2021||Chennai,||Lovlina assures India of a second medal||India’s quest for a second medal at the Tokyo Olympics gained a fillip as Lovlina Borgohain punched her way into the women’s welterweight (69kg) boxing semifinal, which guaranteed her a bronze. During Friday’s quarterfinal, Lovlina defeated Nein-Chin Chen of Chinese Taipei through a 4-1 split decision. The 23-year-old from Assam emerged as the third Indian boxer to secure an Olympics medal, with Mary Kom and Vijender Singh being her successful predecessors. Having had the measure of Nein-Chin, Lovlina is now all set to take on the top-seeded Busenaz Surmeneli of Turkey in the semifinal on Wednesday. After opening its account through Mirabai Chanu’s weightlifting silver last Saturday, India’s search for another medal had largely run into rough weather through this week before Lovlina lent hope with her feisty performance in the ring. Lovlina’s rousing stint was a perfect start to a relatively fine day for the Indian contingent even as the shooters and archers fell adrift. If Lovlina delivered the knock-out base, badminton ace P.V. Sindhu built upon it later in the day as she went past Akane Yamaguchi of Japan 21-13, 22-20 in the quarterfinal. Sindhu toyed with Yamaguchi and even when the latter staged a brief comeback in the second game, the former held firm and sealed the contest. The Hyderbadi had won silver in the previous Olympics at Rio de Janeiro. The Indian men’s hockey team then humbled Japan with a 5-3 triumph in a pool A game and is now all set for a quarterfinal face-off against Great Britain. After Mary Kom’s exit on Thursday, the exploits of Lovlina, Sindhu and the men’s hockey squad offered much cheer to the Indian outfit in an Olympics being held in the shadow of a pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lovlina-assures-india-of-a-second-medal/article35643467.ece
31 July 2021||Chandigarh/Chennai,||Punjab ‘excess deaths’ 3 times official toll||The number of “excess deaths” registered by the Civil Registration System (CRS) in Punjab ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit (from April 2020 to May 2021) was an estimated 47,571, which is 3.3 times the official reported figure of 14,450 COVID-19 deaths for the same period. The figures were arrived at from the data on deaths registered month-wise in the CRS from January 2015 to June 2021 in Punjab and accessed by The Hindu . If data for June 2021 were added to the analysis, the excess deaths multiple increased to 3.6. The excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the month-wise total number of registered deaths during the pandemic period and average of deaths registered for the same months during the pre-pandemic period (2018 and 2019). The excess deaths multiple remained close to 3 during 2020 and the early months of 2021, only increasing due to a surge in mortality during the second wave between April and June in 2021. There were 9,184 recorded COVID-19 deaths in this three-month period, which also registered an estimate of 40,910 excess deaths compared with the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019. If a longer period was used for the comparison (2015-2019), the excess deaths went up slightly to 51,316, which is 3.6 times the official COVID-19 toll for the period April 2020 to May 2021. A third method, estimating the registered deaths for 2020 and 2021 based on linear increases in the previous years and calculating the difference from the actual number of deaths, yielded an excess deaths multiple of 2.8, close to the estimates from the other two methods. As with the other States, not all excess deaths could be related to COVID-19, but a bulk of them could be during the pandemic. As a World Health Organization report suggests: “COVID-19 excess mortality accounts for both the total number of deaths directly attributed to the virus as well as the indirect impact, such as disruption to essential health services or travel disruptions.” Low multiple The estimated excess deaths multiple of 3.3 for the State is lower than that of neighbouring Haryana (7.3), Tamil Nadu (6.4 adjusted to 4.4 if CRS COVID-19 tally is considered), Karnataka (4.3) and much lower than that of Madhya Pradesh (23.8) and Andhra Pradesh (17.9) if the same baseline is considered (deaths registered in 2018 and 2019). The multiple was higher than that of Himachal Pradesh (1.9) and Kerala (<1 based on reconciled COVID-19 death figures) for the same period. The total number of excess deaths for these States (using the same baseline) for the period April 2020 to May 2021 was 9,10,322 which is 7.7 times the official COVID-19 toll for the same period (1,18,941). The CRS annual report for Punjab notes that death registration in the State has been near 100% from 2012 onwards. An estimated 98.9% of all deaths were also registered within 21 days of the occurrence, which is the highest compared with the other States, according to the CRS annual report for 2019. Raj Bahadur, a professional adviser to the COVID-19 response and procurement committee in Punjab, told The Hindu that the data on the number of deaths in the State were absolutely truthful, and there was not an iota of doubt surrounding them.

31 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Rs. 5,650-cr. package for traders, industries||The State government has come out with a Rs. 5,650 crore package to help small traders, industries and farmers hit hard by the COVID-19-induced economic crisis. Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal announced the supplementary package in the Assembly on Friday. A Rs. 2,000-crore interest subsidy scheme for loans taken from Central and State financial institutions, cooperative sector institutions and commercial banks forms the major component of the package. Under the scheme, the government will bear up to 4% of the interest on loans of Rs. 2 lakh or below. This benefit will be applicable to loans taken from August 1 for a period of six months. Rent, fixed charge waived Mr. Balagopal said the scheme would benefit around one lakh people. Further, the rent on government space let out to shops would be waived till December 31. For providing a breather to MSMEs, the government also waived building tax, rent and fixed charge on electricity connection for the period from July to December. Other components of the special package include schemes implemented by the Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC) and the Kerala State Financial Enterprises Ltd (KSFE), Mr. Balagopal said. KSFE waiver The KSFE will waive the penal interest on all defaulted loans dating from January 20, 2021, till September 30. Further, 50% to 100% of the interest and the penal interest on chit fund dues will be waived till September 30. The term of the loan scheme for families affected by COVID-19 — up to Rs. 1 lakh at 5% interest — also has been extended till September 30. KFC schemes As part of the package, the KFC has announced three schemes for giving a leg-up to industries. These are in addition to various schemes announced in July, Mr. Balagopal said. First is the ‘Startup Kerala’ scheme which offers loans up to Rs. 1 crore without collateral security. The KFC will earmark Rs. 50 crore for this initiative. The second is a Rs. 500-crore special loan scheme for units in the different industrial estates. Up to Rs. 20 crore will be sanctioned for a unit under it. The third scheme is the restructured Chief Minister’s Entrepreneurship Development Programme. Loans up to Rs. 1 crore at 5% interest will be sanctioned under this scheme. The aim is to provide loans to 2,500 industrial units during the next five years at 500 units a year. In June, the KFC had announced a one-year moratorium on loan repayment to help MSMEs and healthcare and tourism ventures. Loans would be restructured as per RBI guidelines. The KFC had designed a scheme for units manufacturing equipment for combating the pandemic where 90% of the project cost would be provided as loan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-5650-cr-package-for-traders-industries-to-tide-over-covid-crisis/article35643804.ece

Mr. Rajender after resigning his membership of Assembly and Telangana Rasthra Samiti (TRS) embarked on a padayatra in his home constituency since July 19 to cover all villages before the notification was issued for byelection to elect the new legislator of the constituency. Eatala Rajender was at Kondapaka village on Friday when he fell ill. Doctors who checked his condition found that he was suffering with fever and his blood pressure levels too varied apart from his sugar levels shooting up. They advised him to move to Huzurabad for better treatment. Develops blisters BJP supporters said he was feeling unwell since morning but he continued his padayatra despite developing blisters in both the feet. He was unable to walk and quite weak for the last couple of days. The BJP leader has so far covered 222 kms during the twelve days since he started the walkathon criticising Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his government policies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/eatala-rajender-suspends-padayatra/article35643742.ece
31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Waqf Board to seek legal opinion on divorce certificates||The Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) will seek legal opinion on the question of issuing divorce certificates, a service which sources say is not covered by waqf laws. The qazath , which issues siyahjaat (marriage forms), marriage booklets, marriage certificates, and divorce certificates, functions under the purview of the TSWB. To streamline and bring about uniformity, a rationalisation of qazath system was brought about in the undivided State of Andhra Pradesh in 2002. According to sources, in the recent past, the TSWB has cut back on issuing divorce certificates. This, officials say, is on account of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act coming into effect. The legislation enables imprisonment of Muslim men, and a fine, if they pronounce instant triple talaq . “The Waqf Act does not mention anything about the issuing of divorce certificates. There is no such provision. We are not entitled to do this. The issue is that in case somebody does pronounce triple talaq in one sitting, and tries to pass it off as something else, and the staff issues a divorce certificate based on it, how will the staff be protected from this wrong-doing by the applicant. This becomes the area of criminal jurisprudence,” a source from the TSWB who did not wish to be identified said. The source added that when the Khazi Act of 1880 exists, the need for the TSWB entering into this domain should be deliberated upon. “We are asking for legal opinion on the subject,” the source said, adding that issuing marriage certificates will continue. Another board staff member said that while on the one hand issuing of divorce certificates has has come to a halt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/waqf-board-to-seek-legal-aid-on-divorce-certificates/article35643743.ece
31 July 2021||MANGALURU,||Srinivas Poojary seeks probe into charge against him on social media||The former Endowment Minister and in-charge of Dakshina Kannada and MLC Kota Srinivas Poojary on Friday wrote to Lokayukta P. Vishwanath Shetty to hold an inquiry into the allegations being made against him in the social media on the construction of his house at Giliyar village in Brahmavar taluk of Udupi district. He said that some social media posts have shown him in poor light by mocking at him stating that a simple man [Mr. Poojary] is building a house at a cost of Rs. 6 crore on 13 cents of land. But, Mr. Poojary said that he is constructing the house at an estimated cost of Rs. 60 lakh. The source of funding is Rs. 35 lakh which he had availed himself of as loan from the apex bank and Rs. 40 lakh loan which he has sought from State Bank of India, Varamballi-Brahmavar branch. The loan from the SBI is in the stage of being sanctioned and the first instalment is likely to be released shortly. The Minister said that he has repaid the loan that he availed of from the apex bank two years ago through his salary and honorarium. His son, Shashidhar, has completed MBA and is managing his own enterprise. The income earned by his son is also being used to build the house. Mr. Poojary stated that being a Cabinet Minister twice and MLC three times, he had submitted his affidavit to the Lokayukta every year revealing the details of property owned by him. “A baseless allegation is being made against me and that has naturally hurt me,’’ he said in the letter. The MLC said that those who are opposed to his public life have made the allegations at a time when the new Cabinet expansion is on the cards. Mr. Poojary appealed to the Lokayutka that he is free to take action against him in case if the expenditure on the house exceeded the income earned by him and his son. If the construction is within the limits of the income earned by them, action should be taken against those who have made baseless allegations against him, he said. The letter said that the MLC is of the firm view that he has not spent even Rs. 1 in excess of his income.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/srinivas-poojary-seeks-probe-into-charge-against-him-on-social-media/article35643926.ece

The baby that had been under the care of the hospital was handed over to Social Welfare Department officials on Wednesday. The father from Madurai district had complained that the hospital authorities had deliberately changed two babies born there on the morning of July 8. He said that initially the family members were told that his wife had delivered a baby boy, but later informed that it was a baby girl. Dean J. Sangumani, who had ruled out the possibility of such a mess, said that the hospital was ready to conduct a DNA paternity test on the baby and the parents. After a formal complaint was lodged by the father with Virudhunagar East police station, the DNA test was done. The DNA report proved the stand of the father wrong and stated that he was the biological father of the female infant. “We opened the report in front of the father, his lawyer and police officials and informed them of the outcome. However, the father was not convinced and was not ready to take the baby home,” Dr. Sangumani said. The officials said that the female infant had physical deformities like cleft palate and conjoined fingers. “The father left the hospital saying that he would consult the family members on the issue and come back. He was given counselling that the baby could be handed over to the Social Welfare Department officials if he had no intention of looking after it,” Inspector of Police S. Nirmala said. The officials were yet to hear from the man who left the hospital two days back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mix-up-of-babies-in-hospital-dna-test-proves-fathers-stand-wrong/article35643673.ece

After a visit on Friday to Kolhapur to asses the damage from the recent rain and floods, Mr. Thackeray said he would not announce a package for rain-ravaged Konkan and western Maharashtra merely “for the sake of popularity”. Given the regularity with which floods hit western Maharashtra, construction would no longer be allowed in areas designated as “blue line” (maximum flood level in 25 years) and “red line” (maximum flood level in 100 years) in the afflicted districts, he said.. Mr. Thackeray said relief would be announced after the survey of the damage caused by floods and rain- was completed. “In several parts of Sangli and Kolhapur, the floodwaters are yet to recede…so, despite the Opposition putting pressure, we to need to think with a cool head on how to resolve this problem long term,” Mr. Thackeray said. In Kolhapur, Mr. Thackeray ran into Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and they had a brief chat. “Our meeting was not pre-planned……we both agreed that we need to find a permanent solution to the floods,” Mr. Thackeray said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/i-am-not-a-package-cm-seeking-popularity-uddhav-thackeray/article35643944.ece

The Chennai police have identified 38 persons allegedly involved in these thefts reported in Chennai, Puducherry, Bengaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, New Delhi and Mumbai. A senior police officer said, “We have unearthed the entire network of criminals who came down from Mewat and an adjoining area in Haryana, thanks to the efforts of special teams and the assistance of the Haryana police.” “We first detected and arrested the accused in the cases although similar thefts were reported in other States. We have frozen all bank accounts that were known to us. The money trail is yet to be probed thoroughly. The bank has been advised to write to the CBI for a probe into it since it has inter-State ramifications,” the officer said. The gang came from Haryana in cars, trains and by air to the city. Between June 15 and 18, they struck at SBI ATMs with cash deposit facility at 16 places in Chennai beginning with Velachery, Taramani and Valasaravakkam. Over Rs. 5 crore was lost by the bank in the novel thefts. Between June 15 and 18, they struck at SBI ATMs with cash deposit facility at 16 places in Chennai beginning from Velachery, Taramani and Valasaravakkam. Over Rs. 5 crore was lost to the bank in the novel thefts. Immediately after bank authorities lodged complaints, the police on scrutiny of CCTV footage traced one of the accused used a rental bike and after collecting phone number left from the rental shop, the police caught Amir Arsh, 25, with the help of Haryana police. After combing two premises in Mewat, the city police arrested three others — Virender Rawat, Najim Hussain and Shaukath Ali. The suspects knew the technical flaw in the machines and targeted those vulnerable machines. They used genuine debit and credit cards to steal the money from those ATMs. After inserting a card in the ATM, the machine dispensed cash and it was taken away by fraudsters after blocking the sensor signal for a few seconds. But the ATM’s software registered it as a failed transaction. As a result, the cash was drained from the ATM but the relevant account was not debited. The same technique was repeated in all ATMs which had cash deposit facilities, said the police. They used similar modus operandi and had withdrawn nearly more than Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2 lakh in one hour late in the night. The accused had used same ATM deposit machines to deposit looted money. They would then transfer the amount through digital wallet to different accounts. The gang had struck at Tiruvannamalai, Hosur, and Vellore in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sbi-atm-theft-case-to-be-handed-over-to-cbi/article35643529.ece

Muraleedharan. Replying to a question by MDMK’s general secretary Vaiko in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, the Union Minister referred to the position taken by India at the 46th session of the UN Human Rights Council in March this year. India had then stressed its abiding commitment to the aspirations of the Tamils of Sri Lanka for “equality, justice, peace and dignity”. It reiterated its stand that “respecting the rights of the Tamil community, including through meaningful devolution, contributes to the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka”. Besides, the country had urged its neighbour to “carry forward the process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of the Tamil community and continue to engage constructively” with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens were fully protected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-wants-sri-lanka-to-deliver-on-legitimate-aspirations-of-tamils/article35643552.ece

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters in New Delhi on Friday that Karnataka was closely monitoring developments in Kerala and Deputy Commissioners of the border districts, and also the districts close to them, have been told to tighten the implementation of various precautionary measures. “The norms had been relaxed earlier. They need to be tightened now in the wake of a surge in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Kerala,” he said. He plans to hold a videoconference meeting on Saturday with the Deputy Commissioners, Superintendents of Police, and health officials of Dakshina Kannada, Chamarajanagar, Mysuru, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, and Udupi districts on the measures to be implemented. “Testing, certification, and vaccination should be made mandatory in these areas. We need to track and trace infected persons. In addition to subjecting those travelling by road to such a tracking and tracing process, we need to monitor rail travellers,” the CM said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-high-alert-in-six-districts/article35643492.ece

31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. introduces Bill on insurance firms||Amid continuing protests by Opposition members on various issues, Lok Sabha proceedings were disrupted again on Friday. The Union government introduced the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill and the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, amid the din. However, a scheduled discussion on the COVID-19 situation could not be held. The proceedings had just begun at 11 a.m. when Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party had been demanding a discussion on the Pegasus snooping case since the first day of the monsoon session, and that there were also other issues linked to farmers, COVID-19 and price rise. “We want a discussion in the House... But the government should change its approach,” he said. The Speaker said Mr. Chowdhury could raise the matter after the Question Hour, during which several Opposition members kept shouting slogans. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi later intervened to make an appeal to the protesting members. Stating that IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnav had already given a detailed statement on the Pegasus matter in both the Houses, he said they were raising a non-issue, over which Parliament had not been functioning properly for the past seven or eight days. He said the government did not want to pass any Bills without a discussion. “The government is ready for a discussion, but most unfortunately, they [Opposition members] are not allowing Parliament to run. The Question Hour is the right of the members. More than 350 members want the Question Hour to run. In spite of that, it is unfortunate if they behave like this...,” he said. However, as the sloganeering continued, the House was adjourned till noon. Thereafter, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman sought the leave of the House to introduce the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill and the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill. Revolutionary Socialist Party MP N.K. Premachandran strongly opposed the insurance Bill, stating that it would lead to a total privatisation of the general insurance companies. He said the Bill was vague, indefinite, ambiguous and not in consonance with the original Act. He urged the government to withdraw the Bill and defer it as the House was not in order. Congress MPs Kodikunnil Suresh and Santokh Singh Chaudhary also opposed the introduction of the insurance Bill. In her reply, Ms. Sitharaman said: “Yes, I also wish that the House discusses this Bill. I also wish that the members, understanding the importance of a Bill of this nature, also participate in the debate... However, I still like to say that the apprehensions mentioned by the members are not well founded at all.” She said through the Bill, the government was bringing in some provisions to enable the common citizens’ participation in the general insurance companies. “Our markets can raise money from the retail participants who are Indian citizens. Through that, we can have greater supply of money, bring in greater inclusion of technology and also enable faster growth of such general insurance companies in India,” she said. Following an approval from the House, both the Bills were introduced by the Ministers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-introduces-bill-on-insurance-firms/article35643176.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||College cut-offs likely to soar this year||The number of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students scoring above 95% in Class 12 has almost quadrupled over the past two years, meaning that cut-offs for college admissions are likely to hit levels never seen before. In a year when schools were closed and board examinations cancelled, 99.37% of the CBSE’s 2021 cohort passed their final year, a huge leap from the 88.78% pass of the previous year. However, a sharper spike in the number of high-scoring students means that the marks needed to get into top colleges will shoot up significantly as well. Two years ago, before COVID-19 disrupted the education system, an elite 1.5% of the 2019 class — just 17,693 students — scored above 95%, giving most of them a reasonably good chance of admission into a college of their choice. This year, that group has grown to a whopping 70,000 students. They make up 5.4% of their class. Overall, 2.2 lakh students, 17% of their class, scored above 90% this year. This is more than double the 94,299 students who crossed that mark in 2019. The overall results are not really comparable with past years given that the 2021board exams were completely cancelled due to the pandemic, which had also partially affected the 2020 exams. This year, final results were calculated by schools in accordance with a Supreme Court-approved formula using Class 10 board exam scores, Class 11 final exam marks and the marks obtained in Class 12 practical exams and internal assessments such as mid-terms, unit tests and pre-board exams. Past performance Schools were also asked to moderate marks as needed to ensure that the overall performance of their students aligned with the average past performance over the last three years. Given this unusual marking system, the Board decided not to publish any merit list of the top 0.1% of students this year. Nor will it issue merit certificates. Results are still under process for 1,060 new schools that did not have any past performances to use as reference, as well as a few other schools that had not completed the moderation process. This means that the results have been delayed for 65,184 candidates whose marks will be declared by August 5. For 60,443 private candidates, as well as regular students who are unhappy with their marks assigned per the tabulation formula, the CBSE will hold offline examinations between August 16 and September 15. The 6,149 students who were placed under compartment this year will also be allowed to write this exam. Of the 13.04 lakh candidates for whom results were declared, 12.96 lakh passed Class 12. Girls performed marginally better, with a 99.67% pass percentage, in comparison to 99.13% for boys.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/college-cut-offs-likely-to-soar-this-year/article35643413.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||India and China to hold 12th round of talks today||India and China are scheduled to hold the 12th round of Corps Commander talks on Saturday with the focus on working out an agreement for the second phase of disengagement from Gogra and Hot Springs in Eastern Ladakh. The talks are scheduled to be held at Moldo on the Chinese side opposite Chushul at 10.30 a.m., a defence official said. Based on an agreement reached in February, the two sides completed disengagement from both the banks of Pangong Tso (lake). However, there has been no progress on further disengagement and de-escalation since despite talks at various levels. Progress is expected on disengagement from Gogra and Hot Springs during this round of talks, according to defence officials. A round of Major General level talk is also scheduled to be held once the 12th round of talks is over. Friction areas Further friction areas remain at Demchok and Depsang Plains, which will be taken up once disengagement is complete at Patrolling Points 15 and 17A in Gogra and Hot Springs. Once the disengagement from all friction areas is complete, the de-escalation of the massive troop build- up along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh would be discussed, after which both sides will work out new guidelines for patrolling in these areas. As reported by The Hindu last week, since the stand-off began last May, the two sides, in addition to 11 rounds of Corps Commander talks, have also held 10 Major General level talks, 55 Brigadier level talks and around 1450 calls over the established hotlines. There are two hotlines for communication at Chushul and Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-and-china-to-hold-12th-round-of-talks-today/article35643170.ece
31 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘No attempt by Centre to reach out to Opposition’||Opposition parties on Friday denied that the Union government had made any attempt to reach out to them. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said the Opposition had already laid down its demands and it was up to the government now to show willingness to run the House. Government sources on Thursday said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh might hold talks with senior Opposition leaders on Friday, on his return from Tajikistan. But so far, the Opposition parties said, nothing had come of the proposal. Asked if Mr. Singh had offered any deal, Mr. Kharge told The Hindu , “Nothing. Mr. Singh himself telephoned me earlier. I told him as soon as you come, if you request all the floor leaders, we will come there.” But there was no response to this, Mr. Kharge said. He said he had had a meeting with Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal and Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi. “They came to my chamber to say that the House should run. Then I said the simple way is to agree for a discussion on Pegasus.” Mr. Kharge added that at a meeting of Opposition leaders, it was agreed that a discussion on the Pegasus cyberattack took precedence over everything else. “Yes, we know that fuel price hikes is an issue, corruption in Rafale is an issue and there are many other issues, but all parties agree that since we have raised the Pegasus matter, it needs to be first debated,” he said. Samajwadi Party leader Ramgopal Yadav said there had been no efforts from the government to consult the Opposition. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) floor leader in the Rajya Sabha, Tiruchi Siva, said the log jam would continue till there was a difference in what the Opposition is asking for and what the government wanted to concede.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-attempt-by-centre-to-reach-out-to-opposition/article35643184.ece
31 July 2021||Mumbai,||Gag order will have chilling effect on press freedom: HC||The Bombay High Court on Friday noted that passing a blanket gag order on the media against reporting anything against Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, wife of arrested businessman Raj Kundra, shall have a “chilling effect on the freedom of press” and said there is a judicial limit on what can be construed as good or bad journalism. Justice Gautam Patel, however, directed that three videos uploaded on YouTube channels of three private persons be deleted and not uploaded again as they were “malicious and with not even a slightest attempt to investigate into the truth of the matter”. The court noted that the freedom of press has to be balanced with the right to privacy of an individual. The court was hearing a suit filed by Ms. Shetty against alleged defamatory articles published against her and family after the arrest of her husband on July 19. Mr. Kundra (45) is currently in judicial custody. Ms. Shetty, in an interim application, had sought that media be restrained from publishing any “incorrect, false, malicious and defamatory” content. Justice Patel, however, noted that plaintiff’s prayer seeking media be restrained will have a “chilling effect on the freedom of press”. “There is a judicial limit on what is good or bad journalism as this comes very close to freedom of press,” Justice Patel said. The court noted that the articles referred to by Ms.Shetty in her suit do not seem to be defamatory. “It cannot be like if you (media) are not going to write or say anything nice about me (Shetty) then do not say anything at all. How can this be?” he asked. The court noted that most of the articles referred to in the suit, including one that claimed that “Shetty cried and fought with her husband Kundra” when he was brought to their house by the police for joint interrogation was based on what police sources said. “Reportage of something based on what police sources have said is not defamatory. If this had happened in the four walls of your house with no one around then the issue is different. But this has happened in the presence of outsiders. How is this defamation?” he said. “You chose a life in the public eye then all this will come as part of the territory. Your life is under a microscope,” Justice Patel said. The actor’s application also sought damages of Rs. 25 crore, stating that the respondents (several media publications and social media sites like Google, Facebook and YouTube) are causing irreparable loss and damage to her reputation. In her plea, Ms. Shetty sought directions against social media platforms like Google, YouTube and Facebook to remove all defamatory content related to her and family. To this, Justice Patel said, “Your prayer seeking for social media platforms like Google, YouTube and Facebook to exercise control over editorial content is dangerous.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gag-order-will-have-chilling-effect-on-press-freedom-hc/article35643872.ece
31 July 2021||Hyderabad,||Farming ideas sprout on social media, and it’s a rich harvest||It’s been a month since B.N. Fand Patil got on Clubhouse, the social audio app. He sits by a window at 7 p.m. for a live conversation on the Indian Farmer’s Club voice chat room, catching up with fellow farmers Shivaji Awate, Samadhan Bagul, Vijay Jaibhave and Balasaheb Gavli Barshi on agricultural practices, weather, marketing and crop management. Social media is not new to Mr. Patil, who also uses Facebook and Instagram to network. “Social media se bahut benefit hua hai (social media has been of great benefit),” he says, adding that his Facebook post on “beans farming” 10 years ago received many comments, opening a window of opportunities. Pune-based agro analyst Deepak Chavan, who started the Indian Farmer’s Club on Clubhouse in June, believes social media is a powerful means of expression for farmers. “These platforms are self-help support systems that help us help each other,” he says. In the 30 sessions held so far — in Marathi and occasionally Hindi — around 100 farmers, mostly from Maharashtra, discuss horticulture, vegetable harvesting, crop management, sowing time, marketing, and innovations. “Unlike a YouTube channel with one speaker, Clubhouse discussions are vibrant with farmers choosing the topic of discussion and presenting view points,” adds Mr. Chavan. These meet-ups are followed by sessions on weather monitoring in farm production by retired Indian meteorological officer Manikrao Trimbakrao Khule, and farmer and weather enthusiast Vijay Pandurang Jaybhave from Sinner in Nasik, Maharashtra. Varied content Social networking and knowledge sharing on online platforms have opened up new avenues of opportunity for farmers while providing tech-based solutions. “From knowing about different PVC pipes to discovering innovative farming methods, it is all easy through social media,” says Dasarath Rao of Paidipally village of Khammam district in Telangana. The 56-year-old farmer’s video on Karshaka Mitra YouTube channel in September 2020, on direct sowing of paddy by broadcast method got 3 lakh views. “Our videos on the mulching paper used in horticulture to control weeds, and how to make a soil bed, is like a DIY (do it yourself) video where farmers learn to do these things themselves instead of calling experts,” say friends-turned-business partners Akash Jadhav and Santosh Jadhav of the Indian Farmer YouTube channel. Social media is also used to lend emotional support to farmers under stress. Ganesh Fartade’s videos in Marathi on YouTube (Royal Shetkari) and Instagram (@ganesh fartade) motivates and celebrates farmers. He says, “Earlier youngsters were hesitant to reveal they belong to a farming family but now they feel proud to say it on social media.” Though not all farmers are educated or have access to devices, the digital divide is not colossal, says Mr. Jadhav. “The younger generation knows how to use technology and help their family members. We hope the challenges of the digital divide disappear in a decade. The divide is a minor challenge compared to the centuries-old challenges in agriculture that need attention now,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farming-ideas-sprout-on-social-media-and-its-a-rich-harvest/article35643187.ece
31 July 2021||Chandigarh/Chennai,||Punjab has a lower ‘excess deaths’ multiple||The number of “excess deaths” registered by the Civil Registration System (CRS) in Punjab ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit (from April 2020 to May 2021) was an estimated 47,571, which is 3.3 times the official reported figure of 14,450 COVID-19 deaths for the same period. The excess deaths multiple remained close to 3 during 2020 and the early months of 2021, only increasing due to a surge in mortality during the second wave between April and June in 2021. There were 9,184 recorded COVID-19 deaths in this three-month period, which also registered an estimate of 40,910 excess deaths compared with the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019. If a longer period was used for the comparison (2015-2019), the excess deaths went up slightly to 51,316, which is 3.6 times the official COVID-19 toll for the period April 2020 to May 2021. A third method, estimating the registered deaths for 2020 and 2021 based on linear increases in the previous years and calculating the difference from the actual number of deaths, yielded an excess deaths multiple of 2.8, close to the estimates from the other two methods.  As with the other States, not all excess deaths could be related to COVID-19, but a bulk of them could be during the pandemic. As a World Health Organization report suggests: “COVID-19 excess mortality accounts for both the total number of deaths directly attributed to the virus as well as the indirect impact, such as disruption to essential health services or travel disruptions.” The estimated excess deaths multiple of 3.3 for the State is lower than that of neighbouring Haryana (7.3), Tamil Nadu (6.4 adjusted to 4.4 if CRS COVID-19 tally is considered), Karnataka (4.3) and much lower than that of Madhya Pradesh (23.8) and Andhra Pradesh (17.9) if the same baseline is considered (deaths registered in 2018 and 2019). The multiple was higher than that of Himachal Pradesh (1.9) and Kerala (<1 based on reconciled COVID-19 death figures) for the same period. The total number of excess deaths for these States (using the same baseline) for the period April 2020 to May 2021 was 9,10,322 which is 7.7 times the official COVID-19 toll for the same period (1,18,941). The CRS annual report for Punjab notes that death registration in the State has been near 100% from 2012 onwards. An estimated 98.9% of all deaths were also registered within 21 days of the occurrence, which is the highest compared with the other States, according to the CRS annual report for 2019. Raj Bahadur, a professional adviser to the COVID-19 response and procurement committee in Punjab, told The Hindu that the data on the number of deaths in the State were absolutely truthful, and there was not an iota of doubt surrounding them. Close tracking “From day one we had been tracking each and every patient and his/her movement every day. Death of any patient, which came to the attention of our team, is on the record, but if anyone was at home and it was not even diagnosed that he/she died of COVID-19, in that case it’s difficult to say anything about such people,” Dr. Bahadur said. “On the presumption of excess deaths, I would like to say with utmost conviction that the death data, which we have collected from medical colleges, district hospitals or private hospitals, should be considered as the actual death data. It is not possible for me to tell that people who are lying in the home died because of COVID or not ... If they have not come to hospitals for any reason — be it fear or any other reason — I am not confident that such numbers should be added to COVID-19 deaths,” Dr. Bahadur said. “The data on deaths from Punjab are absolutely correct,” he added. Dr. Bahadur said in Punjab audits of all the deaths had started when the pandemic began. “An expert group has been conducting an audit of all deaths, it’s an ongoing process,” he stated. He added that even during the lockdowns, the registration system was not affected in any way.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Assam village erupts in joy at boxer’s Olympic feat||The moment boxer Lovlina Borgohain on Friday ensured India will win a second medal at the Tokyo Olympics, the sleepy little village of Baromukhia at Borpothar, 350 km from Guwahati, in Golaghat district of Assam wore a festive look. The sound of firecrackers broke the silence in this quaint village, with a population of nearly 1,000, in a forest reserve. Ms. Lovlina out-punched Chinese Taipei’s Nien-Chin Chen in the women’s welter (69 kg) boxing quarterfinal. With her win, she is now assured of at least a bronze medal. Ms. Lovlina, youngest of three sisters, belongs to a family of farmers. Her father, Tiken Borgohain, is elated and confident she will bag an Olympic gold. Over the phone from Borpothar, Mr. Borgohain says, “She is the first sportsperson in our family. We are more than happy and have been busy answering calls and greeting well wishers. I still haven’t got a chance to speak to Lovlina, but I am sure she spoke to Mamoni Borgohain (her mother).” The family is overwhelmed by the flow of visitors. So the village headmen made arrangements for them to greet and congratulate them at the local high school. A fit childhood Ms. Lovlina, 23, did not start boxing as a child. She had enrolled for Muay Thai boxing classes when a team from Guwahati came for a demo. After that, Ms. Lovlina has been practising at a local sports club. “When she showed her interest in getting into Muay Thai boxing, we didn’t stop her. We first thought it will be a good sport to stay fit and healthy. Once she enrolled in the club, she has been actively taking part in Muay Thai boxing matches locally. In 2012, when the Sports Authority of India came for selection, Lovlina participated and got in immediately. Once with SAI, she shifted her focus to boxing and participated in many regional and State-level championships initially. After a few years, she was selected in the national and international category and won medals continuously.” Ms. Lovlina prefers simple home-cooked meals but for a celebration, she likes pork fry cooked on firewood. Is the family planning a grand reception? “Whenever she is home, we feel happy. As a family, we will only shower her with love and thank her for winning a medal for the country. As regards to a grand welcome to her, it is up to the government,” her father says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-village-erupts-in-joy-at-boxers-olympic-feat/article35643172.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CMC Vellore to hold mixed-vaccine trial||The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved a clinical trial to evaluate if a mixed-vaccine combination can work as opposed to the current policy of both doses being the same vaccine. The Christian Medical College, Vellore, will conduct the trial. India has administered 45.6 crore vaccine doses so far of which nearly 88% are of Covishield. With limited supplies of Covaxin, a mixed dose regime may help cover a supply shortfall. “After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended for grant of permission for conduct of the Phase 4 clinical trial,” said the minutes of the meeting that were made public on Friday, though details of the trial were not. A Phase 4 trial is intended to study the effects of treatment or medical product once it has been licensed for public use. In this case, because both Covaxin and Covishield have been approved under emergency use authorisation, the trial is expected to investigate a range of questions, including whether combining vaccines elicits a different level of antibodies to the virus, whether a combination may be more effective against variants and if such a regime would be safe. “Safety, immunogenicity and reactivity are among the main questions that we will be investigating,” said Jacob John, of the Christian Medical College, Vellore and one of the investigators of the trial. He said that those participating in the trial would be a mix of health workers and people in the community and said that 500-600 volunteers would be potentially available. Many other countries have experimented with having different vaccines in trial mode, most prominently the Com-Cov clinical trial in the United Kingdom, which mixed Pfizer with AstraZeneca, and the Spanish CombivacS trial which again tested the same vaccine combination. Provinces in Canada have allowed vaccines to be mixed and matched. While the effectiveness of these combinations is not proven, experts said safety was unlikely to be a major concern, though it would take a very large pool of volunteers to establish it either way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cmc-vellore-to-hold-mixed-vaccine-trial/article35643411.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Judge death case has wider ramifications’||Spurred by the murder of a judge in Jharkhand, the Supreme Court on Friday took suo motu cognisance of the mounting concerns about the dangers faced by the subordinate judiciary, especially trial judges, in the line of duty. A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, noted that the death of judge Uttam Anand, who was fatally knocked down by a vehicle while he was out for a morning jog in Dhanbad on Wednesday, had “wider ramifications” on the independence of the judiciary. The suo motu case has been titled ‘In Re: Safeguarding courts and protecting judges (death of Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad). The Supreme Court said it would be focussing on the larger aspects of the case, including the threats and appalling working conditions in which trial judges’ function. The Bench said its suo motu case would not interfere in any manner with the inquiry opened by the Jharkhand High Court on Thursday specifically into the judge’s death. “The Dhanbad case has wider ramifications. We are getting reports that judicial officers are under attack across the country. We want to examine this issue and may seek reports from the States,” the CJI observed. The court, to start with, asked the Jharkhand government and the Director-General of Police to file their affidavits in a week. “It has been brought to the notice of this court that similar incidents are happening across the country. Taking into consideration the duty and obligation of the State to create an environment and accord full protection to judicial officers as well as the legal fraternity so that they can perform their duties fearlessly, we deem it appropriate to take up this matter suo motu ,” the Supreme Court order said. The court said the issue required “wider consideration”, and said it would consider the desirability of issuing notice to other States and Union Territories on August 6, the next date of hearing. A video footage of the incident showed Mr. Anand being knocked down from behind by a vehicle. The incident was initially considered a hit-and-run until the video surfaced, leading to a murder investigation. The ripples of the judge’s death were felt in the court when the Supreme Court Bar Association president, senior advocate Vikas Singh, mentioned the incident in open court before the CJI, who said he had taken up the issue with the Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court. Within hours, Jharkhand Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan suo motu initiated an investigation into the crime and decided to monitor the probe by a special investigation team. Two peoplehave been arrested. Mr. Anand’s death comes close on the heels of a July 22 judgment authored by Justice Chandrachud that highlighted how judges are targeted simply for standing up for what is right. The Supreme Court had said the “independence of the judiciary is the independence of each and every judge”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/judge-death-case-has-wider-ramifications-sc/article35643493.ece

31 July 2021||Chennai,||Study calls for sensitive reporting of rape cases||A study on “Sexual violence and the news media: issues, challenges and guidelines for journalists in India” has recommended that nationally, a charter for news reporting of rape and sexual violence can be established by news industry leaders, which would ensure accountability and commitment to sensitive reporting of the same. The UNESCO study, authored by Chindu Sreedharan, Associate Professor of Journalism, Bournemouth University, and Einar Thorsen, Executive Dean, Faculty of Media and Communication, Bournemouth University, was based on content analysis of 10 newspapers over six languages, and semi-structured interviews with 257 journalists across 14 languages. Through this, the study provided insights into routines journalists follow and the challenges they face on the field. The study stated that there was a conspicuous lack of formal editorial guidelines in use across newsrooms in the country, and said that only 13% of the respondents had access to written guidelines while 14% had no guidelines at all. The recommendation to have a charter nationally suggested that it be based on a public pledge that newsrooms can adopt, which included a commitment to best practices. As many as 20% of the respondents, more women than men, said that they had experienced distress, and 55% of women journalists said that they had directly experienced or witnessed workplace sexual harassment. The study also highlighted patterns in daily news about sexual violence, and said that news outlets often tended to disproportionately publish unusual cases which led to a misleading picture of how sexual violence manifests in the country. While 78% of journalists said they felt responsible for effecting change in relation to sexual violence, below 7% of stories focused on solutions. Sources, and news gathering challenges too, while covering sexual violence, were examined. The recommendations offered based on the study, called for the establishment of peer support networks for journalists experiencing trauma, training in law enforcement procedures through a national initiative which covers both rural and urban journalists and more material on responsible reporting for media and journalism students in their curriculum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/study-calls-for-sensitive-reporting-of-rape-cases/article35643153.ece

31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt.’s denial of manual scavenging deaths flayed||Condemning the Centre for its “inhuman and cruel” statement that no deaths due to manual scavenging have been reported in the past five years, Safai Karamchari Andolan convener Bezwada Wilson said on Tuesday that at least 472 people died while cleaning human waste during the period. He demanded an apology and a statement from the Prime Minister addressing the issue. Mr. Wilson was responding to Social Justice Minister Ramdas Athawale’s written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Congress MPs Mallikarjun Kharge and L. Hanumanthaiah had asked for the number of people engaged in manual scavenging who had died in the five years. “No such deaths have been reported due to manual scavenging,” the Minister said. “The statement itself is a very inhuman statement. The practice is inhuman of course, but the statement is very inhuman and cruel. They know that people died, and they reported it in the last Parliament, and now in this Parliament, they are saying that nobody died,” said Mr. Wilson. The human rights activist accused the Centre of “manipulating the definition” of the word, noting that the question did not refer to those who clean dry latrines alone, but also included those who are forced to clean septic tanks and sewers without protective equipment. Employment of both is prohibited under the 2013 law against manual scavenging. Responding to a similar question in the Lok Sabha last year, the government had acknowledged that deaths had been reported among those cleaning septic tanks and sewers. ‘Misleading’ remarks “It is completely misleading the whole Parliament. They are not just talking of any numbers, they are talking of the life of the citizens. So you are unable to protect the life of the citizens,” Mr. Wilson said. “They claimed in the last Parliament session, 340 deaths, but according to our records, it is 472 in last five years. In this year (2021), 26 people have died so far. And they have not even made one statement about it. This is a gross violation and the Prime Minister must answer for it,” he added, demanding an immediate repeal and apology for the statement made in Parliament. Mr. Wilson pointed out that if the problem was not acknowledged, it would not be dealt with. “How are you going to prevent the deaths? There is no action. Instead of preventive mechanisms to stop the deaths and the killings in the sewer lines and septic tanks, you are coming contra to that and stating nobody died. Which means you want to kill more and more people, you are welcoming that,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govts-denial-of-manual-scavenging-deaths-flayed/article35643189.ece

Officials in Assam’s Barak Valley said organised blockade on Assam’s roads leading to Mizoram had been lifted and no group was now out on the streets trying to stop truckers or other vehicles. After a clash on Monday between Assam and Mizoram police forces on a disputed border forest tract, various groups in the Barak Valley had announced a blockade of Mizoram, drawing protests from the neighbouring State. However, “palpable fear of entering an area, which was like a war zone is holding back trucks … Most truckers have stopped their vehicles in Dholai village near the border with Mizoram,” said officials. A line of trucks on the highway now marks the entry point to Dholai’s bazaar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/organised-blockade-on-border-ends/article35643161.ece

31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Single-use plastics back in use||Despite a ban being in force, single use plastics, particularly polythene carry bags, are back in use widely in the city again. The State government banned the use of single-use plastics in 2019. While the enforcement was stringent initially, the monitoring seemed to have waned particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to their re-emergence. The banned plastics are commonly spotted mostly in small stores, eateries and among hawkers selling vegetables. G. Meena, who sells vegetables on Eldams Road, said they were forced to have carry bags as a majority of the customers do not bring bags. “It is relatively better how. A lot of people do bring bags. However, many still do not. We will be happy if everyone brings their own bags as we do not have to spend on carry bags,” she said. A grocer in Teynampet said that while many supermarkets and big outlets had switched to cloth bags, those running small shops like him could not make that switch completely. “In big outlets, customers are charged Rs. 10 or Rs. 20 for a bag. Those who come to our shops do not want to pay extra for a bag,” he said. Many eateries have switched to using plastics for packaging. N. Prakash, a delivery partner with one of the major online food delivery platforms, said that while they had switched to paper bags soon after the ban, plastics had gradually returned.  ‘Brought from outside’ S. Rakkappan, president, Tamil Nadu Plastic Manufacturers’ Association (TAPMA), said that although the usage of plastics had gradually resumed, the manufacturing units remained severely affected. “As far as I know, more than 75% to 80% of MSME units have shut shop. Whatever plastics we see in Tamil Nadu are predominantly coming from places like Puducherry and Daman and Diu,” he said. He alleged that the support the previous government promised to provide to MSME units for producing alternatives to plastic never materialised. “I personally tried to help 10 to 15 units. It did not help. Many people who were running and working in small units are struggling now,” he said. An official from the Greater Chennai Corporation said that periodic checks were being conducted although the focus may have reduced after the outbreak of COVID-19. The official said that monitoring would be intensified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/single-use-plastics-back-in-use/article35643536.ece
31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Officials told to identify cause of rise in cases||Officials in districts, where there has been a rise in fresh coronavirus infections, have been instructed to immediately identify the cause for the increase, look for areas where they have surfaced, monitor contacts of patients with COVID-19 and bring those testing positive to hospitals, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said on Friday. “From 1,756 cases on Wednesday, there was a sudden rise to 1,859 on Thursday. This rise is a cause for worry because cases were continuously on a decline for over a month in the State, and had increased for the first time on Thursday,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Hepatitis Day programme at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (IOG) and Government Hospital for Women and Children. He said necessary instructions had been given to the Collectors and health officers in districts where cases had increased. “The cases have increased slightly in districts such as Chennai, Coimbatore, Erode, Cuddalore and Kanniyakumari,” he said. He added that officials were advised to bring patients who have tested positive to hospitals rather than placing them under home isolation. “It is said that the cases were high in Kerala as many patients were managed in home isolation,” he added. He said they were confident of bringing the cases under control. Border surveillance He added that the surveillance at inter-State borders was a continuous process. “We conduct checks along areas bordering Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The temperature of persons is screened on entry at the borders,” he said. Insisting that the public should follow masking, frequent handwashing, maintain physical distancing and avoid crowding, he said the level of compliance was still not good enough. Though there was a certain percentage of compliance in Chennai, the public in a majority of other districts did not wear masks properly and were careless. “The Chief Minister will be launching an awareness initiative on Saturday. The campaign will be conducted in all 38 districts for a week,” Mr. Subramanian said. At IOG, screening of all pregnant women for hepatitis B as well as vaccination of healthcare workers was conducted, K. Vijaya, director of the hospital, said. Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister P.K. Sekar Babu and Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan were present.

Cases spiked in both Chennai and Coimbatore, with the daily tally crossing 200 in both cities.

Cases continued to increase in Coimbatore and Chennai for the fourth day in a row. Coimbatore recorded the biggest jump, from 188 cases on Thursday to 230 on Friday. In Chennai, 215 people tested positive, as against 181 on the previous day.

Another 27 people succumbed to the infection, taking the toll to 34,050. This included a 15-year-old boy from Salem who died at the Government Hospital in Attur last month. Coimbatore and Tiruppur reported four deaths each, while there were three deaths each in Dindigul and Salem. Chennai recorded two deaths. A total of 1,56,843 samples were tested in the last 24 hours in the State. Till date, 3,72,85,251 samples have been tested. A total of 3,66,584 people were vaccinated across the State.

31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Access to Metro station from Choolaimedu cut off||For many residents of Choolaimedu living behind Arumbakkam Metro Rail station, walking to the bus stop on Outer Ring Road or to the station has been arduous. P. Kaliyamoorthy, who has been living in Dayaluammal Street in Choolaimedu for five decades, said that 15 years ago, access was easier as there were not many buildings. “With time, many houses have come up. Now, it takes us about 10 minutes to reach the Arumbakkam bus stop or the Metro station,” he says. Residents like him demand a pedestrian pathway over the Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam canal. Sudha Ramalingam, an advocate and a resident of Padmanabha Nagar, said it would be helpful for commuters if there were feeder services connecting areas like Kamala Nehru Nagar, Dayaluammal Street, Loganathan Nagar, Tamizhar Street and Padmanabha Nagar with the nearest bus stop or the station. “From the terrace, I can see the train passing by so close to my residence but it is difficult to walk all the way to the station. It will greatly improve access for them if a pathway is built,” Ms. Ramalingam said. Officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation said they would try to build a pedestrian embankment along the canal soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/access-to-metro-station-from-choolaimedu-cut-off/article35643550.ece

Stalin in Chennai on Friday. Credai365.comis a direct Whatsapp-based portal for home buyers. “This is similar to booking a flight ticket. Customers can choose any type of property. There is a drop down menu that would show the status of the project (pre-launch or under construction or ready to move in),” Padam Dugar, president, Credai Chennai, told The Hindu . Customers can schedule a call back from the property developers and there is a facility to connect with property experts. CREDAIBuild Mart365.com will help source a wide range of services from manufacturers, dealers, lawyers, auditors, design architects and will serve as a one-stop solution for every real estate requirement. “This will help us get quality products too,” Mr. Dugar said. Credai officials mentioned that both the web portals were Whatsapp encrypted, which makes it efficient for customers to connect and get their queries answered immediately. According to Mr. Dugar, the real estate market is looking up and more serious buyers are coming forward, and there are quick closures of deals. At present, 7.5 crore sq ft of construction projects are happening among Credai developers and out of every 100 homes constructed in Chennai, 88 are by Credai developers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-opens-two-credai-portals/article35643540.ece
31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIU forms panel on National Education Policy||The Association of Indian Universities is expected to provide suggestions on implementing the National Education Policy 2020. It has constituted a committee to examine, and recommend changes, modifications and suggestions on NEP. The committee chairman will meet Vice-Chancellors, who have been urged to send their comments on the draft policy. AIU has constituted another committee to study issues related to ranking, rating and accreditation by NAAC, NIRF and NBA. Col. G. Thiruvasagam, who recently took over as president of the AIU, said universities faced practical difficulties in implementing the NEP. “A Vice-Chancellor cannot take decisions unilaterally. The statutory bodies are going to come back with many issues. The Board of Studies, the Syndicate and the State governments must be involved. We have to prepare the universities as the student is the end user. For this, we need clear cut notification, direction and planning. Instead, we get only circulars from UGC. We have our own practical difficulties,” he said. Though the NEP was launched a year ago, not much has happened. The association has 844 universities, including State and deemed universities, institutions of national importance and 27 international institutions as associate members. The government announced recently that public universities were exempted from paying fee to file for patent. Though the government had given an assurance that funding for private and government institutions would be on a par, there was no indication of that from DST, UGC or AICTE, Col. Thiruvasagam pointed out. The national assessment agencies should continue with the ranking/grading provided previously as in the last 18 months institutions had been shut. The NIRF should rank institutions based on their discipline, their age and sector, instead of clubbing them. The committee on implementation of NEP, headed by S.P. Thyagarajan, former V-C of University of Madras, would submit its report within three months, Col. Thiruvasagam added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiu-forms-panel-on-national-education-policy/article35643576.ece
31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||As schools gear up to reopen, focus shifts to vaccinating staff||With the State government exploring the possibility of reopening schools for higher classes, the focus has turned to vaccinating teaching and non-teaching staff. Though several teachers had been vaccinated while on poll duty, the Health Department is now taking measures to reach out to those left out. While the School Education Minister had recently said the State was mulling reopening schools for Classes IX to XII, the School Education Department on Thursday also announced that teachers from government and aided schools would be required to come to school from August 2 onwards. Health officials said a significant number of teachers were already vaccinated while on poll duty. “Most of the teachers were covered during polling. Any teacher who has been left out will be requested to come to a nearby primary health centre to get vaccinated. This will be taken care of by the respective Deputy Directors of Health Services,” said T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. About 40%-50% of teachers were vaccinated while on polling duty, and this percentage could vary from district to district. “The understanding of the importance of vaccination has improved. All want to get vaccinated, and we are reaching out to them,” M. Sangeetha, Deputy Director of Health Services, Cheyyar District Health Unit, said. Through the District Education Office, measures to get a list of schools — elementary, high and higher secondary — at the block-level have been taken up. “We have the contact details of headmasters of these schools. We will ask them for a list of teachers and non-teaching staff, such as office and housekeeping employees. We will check if they have been vaccinated. We will compile details of those with comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, and vaccinate them on a priority basis,” she said. The Deputy Director said children are likely to spend six to eight hours a day in a school. “We need to vaccinate everyone around children. This should be augmented with masking and maintaining physical distancing, which would make the school environment safe for children,” she added. K.P.O. Suresh, president, Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Federation, said while many teachers on polling duty were vaccinated earlier this year, the School Education Department had not conducted vaccination camps for teachers following that in many areas. Vaccination camps “There will be more teachers willing to take the jab now since there is more awareness. Along with the COVID-19 prevention norms that are to be implemented on school campuses when they reopen, vaccination camps too can be conducted for teachers,” he said. While some private schools were able to get their teachers vaccinated by organising camps on campuses or at hospitals nearby, many others have individually gone and taken the jab while schools remained shut. “If schools are to be reopened, it is best to ensure that all teachers are vaccinated. For private schools, vaccination camps can be organised for clusters of around five to six schools jointly to ensure that all teaching and non-teaching staff get vaccinated,” said R. Visalakshi, president, Tamil Nadu Private Schools Association. P.K. Ilamaran, president of the Tamil Nadu Teachers Association, said while reopening schools for senior classes should be the first priority, the government should also begin to formulate a plan for reopening primary and middle school sections. Mr. Ilamaran, who is a teacher in a Corporation school, said that the Greater Chennai Corporation had organised vaccination camps for teachers, and nearly all of them had been vaccinated in the same.  We need to vaccinate everyone around children. This should be augmented with masking and maintaining physical distancing, which would make the school environment safe M.

According to the report, 14 sites were camera trapped in Tamil Nadu that yielded 2,017 pictures of 629 leopards. The 2014 report pegged its population at 815 with a range of 587-1,043. An additional number of 100 km2 grids sampled in 2018 was 29, out of which four had leopard presence. The density of leopards in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve was 12.11. In parts of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, the number stood at 7.05. Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve supported high density of leopards with 10.18, the report said. Surprisingly, Srivilliputhur Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary had the highest leopard density of 20.43 in the entire Western Ghats landscape. The squirrel sanctuary, combined with Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, is now a tiger reserve. The report noted that the growing human population and increasing fragmentation of the landscape had increased human-wildlife interactions. The coffee-tea estates, and other commercial plantations surrounded by forests, were frequently occupied by leopards, and were the major hubs for human-leopard conflicts in Tamil Nadu, it pointed out. “It is a surprise to us,” said T.S. Subramaniya Raja of Wildlife Association of Rajapalayam. “We have often heard the villagers in the foothills of the sanctuary saying they spotted leopards now and then,” he recalled. A section of watchers and guards in the sanctuary also confirm that they regularly spot the leopards. “The leopards keep to the boundaries and stroll inside the forests. So there have not been any major conflicts with the human population outside the forests,” said Mr. Raja. “A focused tiger management will help in co-predator balancing. Leopards remain prone to poaching. Protection has to be strategic and strong to sustain the populations,” said Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Chief Wildlife Warden, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srivilliputhur-sanctuary-has-the-highest-leopard-density-in-western-ghats-report/article35643581.ece

31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Speaker’s chair set to turn 100||The historic chair of the Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Assembly is set to turn 100 in the next few months. The Assembly Secretariat has been painstakingly maintaining the seat of historical importance for over 99 years now. The artistic chair, presented by His Excellency Lord Willingdon, the then Governor of Madras Presidency, and his wife Lady Willingdon to the then President of the Madras Legislative Council on March 6, 1922, as a personal gift, has been witness to the democratic traditions of the erstwhile Madras Presidency, the Legislative Assembly of the Madras State since Independence and eventually that of Tamil Nadu. “It is made of teak wood. It is sturdy and has not needed any major repair,” says an official. The chair has been taken out of the Fort St. George campus in Chennai multiple times when the Assembly held its sessions elsewhere. It has been taken to Senate Hall in the University of Madras in Chepauk, Rajaji Hall in Omandurar Government Estate, old Kalaivanar Arangam on Wallajah Road and a palace in Udhagamandalam. Since 2020, it has been housed in the new Kalaivanar Arangam. “Before an Assembly session, the chair is given a fresh coat of varnish. The cushion is regularly replaced. The ‘secret chambers’ are cleaned,” a senior official says. Besides the Speaker, constitutional authorities above the Speaker have occupied the chair. The Governor is offered the chair every time he visits the House to deliver his address during the first session in a year. The highest dignitary to have occupied the chair is the President of India. There have also been some controversial incidents — once, a Chief Minister sat on it with the consent of the Speaker during a function. Opposition MLAs, too, have unauthorisedly occupied it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speakers-chair-set-to-turn-100/article35643561.ece
31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stipends for medical students, PGs enhanced||After three years, the State government has increased the stipends for medical interns, non-service postgraduates (PG) and higher-speciality students in government medical colleges in the State. It was in 2018 that the government last revised the stipends paid to CRRIs (compulsory rotatory residential internees), non-service PGs of degree and diploma courses and higher-speciality (DM/M.Ch) students studying in government medical colleges. The government had ordered for an annual increase of Rs. 600 for CRRIs and Rs. 1,000 for non-service PGs/diploma/higher-speciality students. The Resident Doctors’ Association had submitted representations to the Health Department, stating that the stipend paid to non-service PGs was lower than some State government/Central government medical colleges, and had requested its revision. Non-service PGs too had requested the government for an increase in stipend. Following this, the government decided to enhance their stipends and issued a government order dated July 29. From a monthly stipend of Rs. 21,800, CRRIs will now get Rs. 25,000. Non-service PGs pursuing degrees were earlier paid Rs. 38,000 in the first year, Rs. 40,500 in the second year and Rs. 43,000 in the third year. They will now get Rs. 48,000, Rs. 49,000 and Rs. 50,000 for the first, second and third years respectively. Those pursuing PG diploma courses were receiving monthly stipends of Rs. 38,000 and Rs. 40,500 for the first and second years respectively. The stipends have been increased to Rs. 45,000 and Rs. 47,500. The stipend has been increased from Rs. 43,000 to Rs. 50,000 for first-year higher-speciality students, from Rs. 46,500 to Rs. 52,500 for second-year students and from Rs. 48,000 to Rs. 55,000 for those in the third year. The government has said that an automatic annual increase of 3% would be allowed to previous year’s stipends. The Tamil Nadu Medical Students’ Association thanked the Chief Minister, the Health Minister and the Health Secretary for considering their long-standing demand. “The G.O. has given us a hope that our reasonable demands will be considered in the future too,” M. Keerthy Varman, president of the association, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stipend-for-medical-students-pgs-enhanced/article35643562.ece

The planned facility is projected to have a capacity of 3.3 gigawatts and commence operations in the second half of 2023. This is contingent upon pending approval of the Indian government incentives that are satisfactory to First Solar, the company said in a statement. In December 2020, First Solar signed an MOU with the then AIADMK government for investing Rs. 4,185 crore in a manufacturing facility with a potential for 1,076 jobs. “India is an attractive market for First Solar, and not simply because our module technology is advantaged in its hot, humid climate. It is an inherently sustainable market, underpinned by a growing economy and appetite for energy, with a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “India stands apart in the decisiveness of its response to China’s strategy of state-subsidised global dominance of the crystalline silicon solar supply chain. The country’s comprehensive approach provides precisely the kind of level-playing field needed for non-Chinese solar manufacturers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/us-based-first-solar-to-invest-684-million-in-tamil-nadu/article35643565.ece
31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai region records pass percentage of 99.77||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the results of Class XII students on Friday. The Chennai region, which includes Tamil Nadu, recorded a pass percentage of 99.77%.  A total of 42,469 students had registered to appear for the exams in the State. Board exams this year were cancelled owing to the pandemic, and the final results were calculated giving 30% weightage to Class X board exam marks, 30% weightage to Class XI annual exam marks and 40% to marks scored in practical exams and internal assessments through the academic year for Class XII. Schools remained shut in Tamil Nadu for a large part of the academic year and reopened briefly only for two months . For many Chennai schools, the results were along expected lines and students were satisfied. Revathy Parameswaran, principal, P.S. Senior Secondary School, said several students had scored over 490 marks. “Students generally do better in Class XII board exams, when compared with their Class XII internal assessments and Class XI final exams, which were both considered. The fair assessment scheme, however, ensured that results were along expected lines,” she said. “Many students have scored above 90%, and the results are as we expected, despite the pandemic disrupting the academic schedule,” said P.G. Subramanian, principal, Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram. At SBOA School and Junior College, some students scored centums in mathematics, biology, computer science, economics and accountancy, said principal K. Manoharan. Of the over 70,000 students in the country, 5.37% have scored above 95%. “With a large number of State Board Class XII students having scored above 550 marks, indicating the probability of college admissions becoming hard for CBSE students, it is good that the results for them have been largely encouraging,” said C. Satish, director-general, ABS Group of Schools. Newer schools that have had just a few batches take up boards said the marks of students poised to be toppers were not high since as part of the tabulation policy, marks of all students were moderated, taking into consideration the past performances of the school.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-region-records-pass-percentage-of-9977/article35643564.ece

The party condemned the Prime Minister, and said nearly 4 lakh citizens had died over the past 15 months. “India was unable to manufacture even one vaccine, and has had to rely on two private companies with their own conditions imposed on the country. Such is the sad vaccination policy of the Central government,” the party said in a resolution. The TNCC also condemned Mr. Modi for not discussing the Pegasus snooping issue and for the disruption caused to Parliament, even as the Opposition parties have been demanding a discussion on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-modi-responsible-for-covid-19-crisis-tncc/article35643545.ece

31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC stays Madras Bar Association election||The Madras High Court on Friday stayed the Madras Bar Association (MBA) election, scheduled to be held on August 21. The interim order was passed on the ground that the association failed to verify the certificates of practice of its individual members with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP) before finalising the voters’ list. Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Pongiappan pointed out that every Bar association was required to get the certificates of its members verified with the Bar Council before publishing the voters’ list. However, in the case of the MBA election, a list of 787 eligible voters had been finalised even before their certificates of practice could be verified, the judges said. Advocate L. Chandrakumar filed a writ petition challenging the MBA’s decision to conduct the election despite the threat of a third wave of COVID-19 looming large. His counsel told the court that there was no tearing hurry to conduct the election at such a juncture when an ad-hoc committee had been managing the affairs of the association very well. The counsel also claimed that the names of many members of the MBA had been removed from the voters’ list just because they could not pay the subscription charges due to the pandemic. He urged the court to quash the election notification issued by the association on July 14 and issue a consequential direction to hold the election after return of normalcy. On the other hand, senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan, representing the election officer, stated that the voters’ list had been prepared only on the basis of those who had paid subscription up to the year ending in March 2020 and not 2021. He also stated that the poll was being conducted only as per a decision taken by the general body of the association. He added that the association would immediately send the list of voters to the Bar Council for verification of their certificates of practice. However, the judges said that the verification ought to have been done before publishing the election notification and ordered that the ad-hoc committee should continue to administer the association until further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-stays-madras-bar-association-election/article35643577.ece
31 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC issues directions on fee collection by private schools||The Madras High Court on Friday issued a slew of directions with respect to collection of school fees in the State for the academic year 2021-22. It ordered that private schools must collect only 85% of the annual school fees, which was fixed last with respect to the academic year 2019-20, in six instalments from parents who had not suffered loss of income due to the pandemic. Justice D. Krishnakumar clarified that those serving in State and Central government services, public sector undertakings, well established businessmen and other professionals should be considered as people who had not suffered loss of income due to successive lockdowns imposed by the government to fight COVID-19 and could afford to pay 85% of fees. If the first instalment had already been paid, the balance shall be paid in five instalments and the last instalment could be collected by the schools by February 1, 2022. “If any student has already paid the entire fees including arrears with respect to last academic year, the same shall not be a ground to claim for refund of the fees,” the judge ordered. However, with respect to parents who had suffered loss of income, they could take out appropriate applications so that the schools could consider their request and collect only 75% of the fees in six instalments. The judge further ordered that even the arrears due for the past academic years must be demanded only in instalments and not in lumpsum. It was made clear that no unaided school should debar a student from attending either online classes or physical classes on account of non-payment of fees or arrears. Examination results should also not be withheld for non-payment of fees and “if any such action is brought to the notice of the educational authorities, it shall be viewed seriously and suitable action shall be taken against the institutions concerned,” the judgement, passed on a batch of cases filed by private schools and their associations, read.  “The students shall not be removed/dropped out from the institutions under any circumstances during 2021-22 and it is the responsibility of the jurisdictional educational authorities to monitor the same,” Justice Krishnakumar ordered. The judge said the government could also consider providing financial assistance to the deserving students for continuing in private schools if there were any unfilled seats available under the 25% quota under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. He directed CBSE schools to publish details of fees on their websites within four weeks. Finally, the court directed the government to fill up all vacancies in Tamil Nadu Private Schools Fee Determination Committee within eight weeks so that the panel could start fixing the fees for individual schools for the next academic year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-issues-slew-of-directions-on-fee-collection-by-pvt-schools/article35643579.ece

Nirmal Kumar rejected the plea for interim orders and instead ordered notice to the police on the former Minister’s plea to quash the rape case.

It offered three schemes — investment of Rs. 700 a year, Rs. 1,400 a year and Rs. 2,800 a year, promising to supply six eggs, 12 eggs and 24 eggs each week respectively. The advertisement looked suspicious and the EOW, Chennai, summoned the management of the company on July 20. Accordingly, Sivam Narendran, founder of the firm, appeared before officials. During enquiry, it came to light that the company did not have licence to accept deposits from the public and had no documents or other evidence to support its claims.

31 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Collector’s gesture towards differently abled boy wins hearts||A family of four from Podanur, who visited the Collectorate on Friday to receive welfare assistance, were pleasantly surprised as the District Collector G.S. Sameeran knelt down to help the three-year-old differently abled boy wear his new shoes. About two weeks ago, R. Velmurugan, a differently abled man from Podanur who runs a petty shop, had petitioned the Collector seeking assistance for his family, an official from the Department of Welfare of Differently Abled Persons said. Both he and his son V. Alagumalai were suffering from club foot, a birth defect where the feet are rotated inward and downward. The petition was reviewed and the family was invited to the Collectorate on Friday, the official said. As Mr. Sameeran examined the boy’s feet, he kneeled down in front of him and help him wear the specially modified footwear provided by the district administration. “You have got new shoes, so you should keep running now,” the Collector remarked as he tied the boy’s shoelaces. Video clips of the incident went viral on social media platforms, with the Collector receiving appreciations from many for his act. “I never expected that the Collector would do this,” Mr. Velmurugan, 35, told The Hindu . With his livelihood being impacted by the 9 pandemic, he said that he did not receive any assistance from the district administration. His wife is a homemaker who looks after him and the son. His 13-year-old daughter was studying in a government school, Mr. Velmurugan said. He urged the authorities to provide proper accommodation to him and his family at the earliest as he was unable to pay the rent for his residence. The administration provided a bicycle and school bag to the daughter and a solar powered lamp to Mr. Velmurugan, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collectors-gesture-towards-differently-abled-boy-wins-hearts/article35643593.ece
31 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore girl selected for United Nations scholarship||Inspiration at all times, particularly these heavy times, comes not only from the experienced, but also from those who are energised, motivated, and think out of the box. A physical school where children learn life’s lessons in an experiential way and stay happy — this proposal by Sneha Murali, has earned her the International Sustainable Academy (ISA) fellowship, a nine-month education training programme in Germany, sponsored by the United Nations. “It is reverse learning. For example, while learning mechanical or electrical subjects, students can be given a final finished product. They go backwards, in a reverse engineering process to understand what every single part is meant for. A hands-on experience model that is not driven by textbooks or online lessons,” explains Ms. Murali, who will take off on July 31 from Coimbatore. She is the second youngest on a team of 12 people selected from other developing countries including Kenya, Sudan, Cambodia, Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, Siberia, and Uzbekistan. “The United Nations categorised the world’s problems in 17 buckets as Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). At number four is quality education. Last year, when the pandemic struck, I thought about ways where one can optimise education during such times and submitted a proposal for SDG 4 on bringing experiential education to India. The U.N. had opened applications globally for participants who have solutions to sustainable goals,” she says. Ms. Murali is the only participant from India who got selected from 15,000 applicants. The 12-member global team has scholars researching topics related to environment and global warming like hydroponics, water pollution, urban planning, flood reduction, and post COVID-19 infrastructure, to name a few. The programme, funded by the German government and the U.N., is a collaborative fellowship where people from developing countries can look for solutions in Germany and implement the model in their respective countries. “My work will start after I return, sometime in March next year. I have to start a physical school that is futuristic but deeply rooted in Indian values and culture. There are already many schools in the world that have made a positive change. We just need more of those,” she says. The 26-year-old who is also an entrepreneur runs an e-commerce start-up called The Positive Store that designs gratitude journals and planners. She was also a pupil pilot as a part of NCC’s Air Wing. Her father K. Murali, who is hearing impaired, is known for his award-winning work through Deaf Leaders, an NGO that empowers people with such disabilities. It was her four years in the corporate world that served as a wake-up call. “I realised that my career path should be based on my strengths and not on a rat race. I don’t want the upcoming generation to go through the same mistakes,” says Ms. Murali. Once she lands in Germany, she will start research from a workspace along with a mentor. “It’s a self-driven platform where no one monitors you. I will also be travelling across schools in Germany, Finland and Denmark to understand their education system and interact with educators,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-woman-selected-for-united-nations-scholarship/article35643559.ece

31 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Jewellery stocks pile up due to delay in hallmarking||With the Union government making it mandatory for jewellers to stamp the six-digit alpha-numeric ‘Hallmarking Unique Identity’ (HUID) on the jewellery sold, jewellery manufacturers and retailers here say the delay in HUID stamping has brought business to a standstill. B. Muthuvenkatraman, president of Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers Association, said if a jewellery manufacturer gave his products to the hallmarking centre, it took four or five days to get it back. So every manufacturer had jewellery stocks and was unable to give orders to the goldsmiths now. The government should not bring the entire business to a standstill in the name of ensuring quality. The manufacturers were working to just 50 % capacity though they had orders, he said. Coimbatore Jewellers Association president B. Sabarinath said gold smiths and jewellery units in Coimbatore produced nearly 200 kg of gold jewellery a day. These need to be hallmarked before they were shipped to dealers and retailers. Only 256 of the 743 districts in the country had hallmarking centres. Coimbatore was one of the 256 districts. “Why introduce a system when the infrastructure is not ready and when it is not mandatory across the country,” he asked. The hallmarking centres in Coimbatore need to stamp the HUID mark for the jewellery made every day here and also the stock with the retailers. This took time and resulted in several errors too. For instance, if a jewellery weighed 3.09 gm and it was entered as 3.90 gm, the retailer would question about the additional weight hallmarked. Jewellery was available and so was the market. However, goldsmiths were not getting jobs as the stocks were piling up. The government should focus on increasing the number of jewellers getting BIS licence, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jewellery-stocks-pile-up-due-to-delay-in-hallmarking/article35643700.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran made the oral remarks while hearing a contempt of court petition filed against the Excise Commissioner for not complying with a court directive to shift a liquor shop on Kuruppam road in Thrissur. The court orally pointed out that people were scared of coming near or walking past Bevco retail shops as they had been set up in a shabby manner. The whole areas near liquor shops were vitiated because all kinds of people were made to stand in queues for hours on end for buying liquor. People residing near the shops found it difficult to come out of their homes and children and women were not able to walk past such shops. The commodity sold through these shops should not be treated as a contraband and should be sold just like any other commodity, the court added. Meanwhile, the Excise Commissioner submitted before the court that he had proposed to the government to open the special counters of the bar and bear and wine hotels from 9 a.m. to avoid overcrowding in front of the Bevco outlets. During the quality audit, it was found that 96 liquor shops lacked basic requirements and he had ordered shifting them from the present places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/set-up-liquor-outlets-in-a-civilised-manner-court/article35643429.ece

Happy Schooling 2.0 is aimed at building the mental strength of children, teach them to face fear and failure and shed inhibitions to share their problems in order to find workable solutions. For this, like in the first round, M.S. Chellamuthu Trust & Research Foundation has collaborated to train teachers to promptly identify any attention-related problem due to emotional trauma. Mr. Karthikeyan said 64 headmasters of Corporation schools have been groomed as master trainers during the past months. They, in turn, will train and prepare schoolteachers on how to engage students who have got addicted to technology during the stay at home and also extensively help those who lagged behind in curriculum due to their inability to attend online classes. Till the government announces reopening of schools, the Corporation is using the time to train all the teachers and also take refresher courses, if necessary. When the schools open, teachers will be in a state of preparedness to identify and handle emotional disturbances, if any, among children and take guidance from MSCT&RF counsellors. Happy Schooling phase Iwas launched in 2018 in two dozen higher secondary schools. The teachers were trained to push the confidence levels of the children in general. The programme ran successfully till COVID-19 struck. The trust continued to hold Zoom meetings to keep the teachers’ training sessions going. “Post-COVID, there are more people suffering from depression, which is impacting the quality of their family lives. That is why we thought of implementing Happy Schooling in a new version to help the children be more resilient to any adversity,” said Mr. Karthikeyan.  “Post-COVID, there are more people suffering from depression, which is impacting the quality of their family lives”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/happy-schooling-20-in-corpn-schools/article35643905.ece
31 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC seeks report from civic body on installation of gasifier||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed Madurai Corporation to submit a report on the proposal to install the gasifier in the Karpaganagar crematorium after the local residents complained that it was coming up on a waterbody. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam directed the Corporation to submit the report in four weeks. The court was hearing the petition filed by the President of Madurai Karpaganagar Nagarathar Sangam K.N. Subramanian. The court said that the petitioner referred to a court decree passed in 1991 and complained of the gasifier being put up on a water body. Revenue records showed that some part of the area was a water body. The Regional Transport Office and other government departments have set up offices here for over 30 years. A crematorium is also there in the area. Pursuant to the appeal made by the residents, a less polluting variant of the gasifier was proposed to be installed. Even if it was accepted that the waterbody area that existed is no longer there in view of the various offices set up, every attempt should be made to avoid the remaining part of the waterbody and the installation must be made beyond the boundaries of the waterbody. It was open to the Corporation to consider the location of the crematorium beyond residential areas and earmark such places since residential areas have grown around places that were once earmarked as crematorium. It was best to set up new crematoriums away from the residential places subject to distance not being far, making it inconvenient to people to reach as there was no denial that however much the pollution emitted was controlled the foul stench cannot be gotten rid of, the court observed. The case was adjourned till August 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-report-from-civic-body-on-installation-of-gasifier/article35643906.ece
31 July 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Drunk men abuse pregnant woman and husband||A 30-year-old pregnant woman and her husband were verbally abused by a group of four inebriated men in Pudukottai district two days ago. Two of the accused allegedly kicked the two-wheeler on which the couple were seated and the woman fell from the vehicle. Alleging that the accused turned aggressive only after learning that they were residents of a Scheduled Caste hamlet, Evidence, a Madurai-based civil rights organisation, has demanded a proper investigation by the Deputy Superintendent of Police as per the provisions the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Supreme Court directions. The woman, Abirami, filed a complaint with the police saying that she and her husband Vijaykumar were returning home from a hospital on a two-wheeler, when two men standing in front a Tasmac liquor shop spit and the saliva fell on them. When the couple confronted them for publicly spitting, the men behaved harshly and questioned them about their place of residence. Upon learning that they hailed from a Dalit hamlet, the men, joined in by two other drunk persons, began abusing them. She alleged that they also used casteist slurs. On learning about the incident, a team from Evidence visited the couple’s house at Illakadi Viduthi near Karambaikudi and inquired with them. According to them, four persons verbally abused and spit on them. Also, they hit the two-wheeler of Mr. Vijaykumar. Evidence executive director A. Kathir said the Collector and the Superintendent of Police should have taken action against the accused and ensured that the victim was given medical attention. “The inquiries with the villagers indicated that the officials had not been to the hamlet,” he told reporters on Friday. The Collector and the SP had, however, assured of stern action as per law, Mr. Kathir said, adding that the team submitted its findings to officials for further action. The Inspector General of Police (Central Zone) also assured the team members of action. It was unfortunate revenue and police had not complied with the apex court directive on dealing with such cases, the organisation said. “Only when they visit, the Dalits and the downtrodden will have a secure feeling and it will deter such behaviour by members of the dominant community,” a team member said. Doctors at Pudukottai Government Hospital said Ms. Abirami delivered a baby boy in the early hours of Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drunk-men-abuse-pregnant-woman-husband/article35643660.ece
31 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Contract workers demand payment of salary arrears||A section of contract engineering staff affiliated to Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) working in the drainage, pumping stations,and street light departments of Madurai Corporation staged a sit-in protest on the premises of Arignar Anna Maligai here on Friday demanding payment of salary arrears to them. CITU district secretary M. Balasubramaniam said that the contract workers of pumping stations had still not received salary for April and June. "These workers were earlier entitled to receive payment for their four weekly offs during a month. But, this has been cancelled now, causing financial constraints to the workers," he said. In addition, these workers do not get benefits like the Employees Provident Fund. The other contract workers receive delayed salary payment every month. "Since most of the workers have to pay rent every month, this causes severe financial stress to their families. Hence, the Corporation must take steps to ensure that the contract workers receive their salaries within the first 10 days of every month,” said Mr. Balasubramaniam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/contract-workers-demand-payment-of-salary-arrears/article35643899.ece
31 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||More students from government schools in Madurai apply for NEET this year||There is an increase in the number of government school students from Madurai who have applied for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for this year. This rise in more number of students applying for the examinations is attributed to the introduction of 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for NEET-qualified government school students. S. Vennila Devi, district coordinator of government-sponsored NEET programme, said that more than 470 government and aided school students from Madurai district have applied for NEET, which is scheduled for September 12. Last year, only 286 government and aided school students from Madurai district applied for NEET. "Last year, 14 students from Madurai district were able to get into government medical and dental colleges through the reservation. This has encouraged more government school students to apply for the examinations this year," said Ms. Vennila Devi. A large section of questions from last year's NEET exams were from the State board syllabus. This has also motivated many government school students to apply for the examinations. Also, the State Education department has provided higher quality reading material this year, said Ms. Vennila Devi. She said that apart from the E-box programme,the teachers of Madurai district have started WhatsApp groups to conduct additional number of tests and special lectures for the students. "We are hopeful that more number of government school students from Madurai will get seats in government colleges through merit this year," said Ms. Vennila Devi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-students-from-government-schools-in-madurai-apply-for-neet-this-year/article35643901.ece
31 July 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Centre appeals against order to consider citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils||The Central Government has preferred an appeal before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court against a Single Bench order that directed the Centre to consider the plea of 65 Tamils from Sri Lanka, the descendants of indentured labourers, seeking Indian citizenship. The Centre said that the Single Judge had failed to consider the fact that the 65 Tamils were not willing to get the benefit of the Sirimavo-Shastri Pact, ( The pact signed in 1964 between the governments allowed for repatriation of persons of Indian origin). The 65 Tamils had not applied for getting repatriation till October 30, 1981. There were about 60,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in 107 camps in Tamil Nadu on the same footing. It is said that additionally 35,000 non-camp Tamil refugees are living in Tamil Nadu. The Centre said issuance of citizenship to these Tamils would most likely open the floodgates for illegal migrants from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Myanmar (Rohingyas), Africa and the Central Asian Countries. In the case on hand, these 65 Tamils being illegal migrants have no legal right to seek Indian citizenship and the relief claimed is specifically barred by the Citizenship Act, the Centre said and sought the order of the Single Bench to be set aside. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam admitted the appeal and adjourned the hearing till August 23. The judges said the appeal has to be heard in the light of the observations made by the Single Bench. Taking note of the fact these 65 Tamils filed a contempt petition before the Single Bench, the judges said that the Single Bench should be slow in allowing the contempt proceedings to be pursued before the conclusion of the appeal. In 2019, the Single Bench allowed these 65 Tamil people to submit a fresh application to the District Collector concerned seeking Indian citizenship. Most of these 65 Tamils were lodged at the Transit camp in Kottapattu in Tiruchi district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-appeals-against-order-to-consider-citizenship-to-sri-lankan-tamils/article35643900.ece

Vice-Chancellor Gurmeet Singh inaugurated the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), provided under the DST-Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (DST-PURSE) programme. Bala Manimaran, head of CIF; V.V. Ravi Kanth Kumar, professor and head, Department of Physics and the DST-PURSE phase-II coordinator; K. Suresh Babu, faculty in charge of XPS and assistant professor of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and staff members of the CIF participated in the function to commission the equipment. A press note from the university described the XPS as a versatile instrument to analyse the surface chemistry of a material with nanometre accuracy. In many instances where surface properties differ from that of the inside, the XPS provides elemental chemical information and concentration from the surface. Its ability to differentiate oxidation states of elements and their distribution is highly valuable for advanced research in material sciences, physics, chemistry, nanotechnology, engineering and biology. The surface mapping of elements gives pictorial information on the location and distribution of elements. With the depth profiling mode, the material surface can be sliced by nanometre progressively, and the corresponding chemistry can be analysed in great detail, the press release from the university said. The Rs. 2.87 crore XPS was funded by the DST on the basis of research contributions from the research scholars and faculty members of Pondicherry University. The equipment at the CIF will be available to students, scholars, researchers and industries for research work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pondicherry-varsity-gets-new-research-equipment/article35644010.ece

Presiding over a demonstration in which a large number of fishermen affiliated to the CITU and other associations participated, she said that the BJP government at the Centre had no respect for the fishermen community. The Bill, she said, if passed, would ruin the livelihood of all the fishermen. The BJP, she accused, was bringing the Bill to please some of their friends in the corporate sector. The Bill proposed the fishermen to indulge in fishing only for 12 nautical miles from the shore. At a time when the catch was poor and that the fishermen did not get the right price for the catch, such measures to curtail the fishermen would only affect their livelihood, she said. The former MLA said that like toll plazas, wherein the vehicle users had to shell out money for using the highways, the fishermen too have to cough up money for fishing. This is unacceptable and the Left would gather fishermen across the 16 coastal districts in the State and intensify the stir, Ms Balabharathi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/marine-bill-will-affect-fishermens-future/article35643678.ece

31 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Kerala Assembly boycott continues||The Assembly session on Friday got off to a stormy start with the Opposition remaining firm on their demand for the resignation of General Education Minister V. Sivankutty. With the government rejecting the demand, the Opposition boycotted the proceedings for the day. Mr. Sivankutty has come in the cross hairs of the Opposition after the Supreme Court turned down the government’s plea to withdraw the criminal case registered against him and other Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators for allegedly vandalising the Assembly six years ago. Slogans raised Soon after the Question Hour began, United Democratic Front (UDF) members began to raise slogans against the government’s refusal to heed their demand. Speaker M.B. Rajesh’s appeal for calm went in vain. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, who demanded that the government clarify its position on the issue, accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of disrespecting the Supreme Court’s judgement that is considered the law of the land. Lashing out at the government’s stance that the Minister need not resign merely because a case has been registered against him, Mr. Satheesan said the LDF had created ruckus and destroyed public property in the Assembly while demanding the then Finance Minister K.M. Mani’s resignation after an FIR had been registered against him. No quitting: CM Mr. Vijayan said the then UDF government should have ideally resolved the issue within the House instead of assigning the case to the police. Pointing out that former Ministers E.P. Jayarajan and K.T. Jaleel, who were also named accused in the case, could complete their terms during the rule of the previous government, he demanded that Mr. Sivankutty be permitted to continue until the Supreme Court completed its trial. ‘A wrong precedent’ Claiming that the case against the LDF legislators had set a wrong precedent, the Chief Minister said the government would pursue legal means against the case, even while remaining firm to its commitment in abiding by the Supreme Court directives. Earlier, Congress legislators P.T. Thomas and Roji M. John forwent their opportunity to pose supplementary questions to Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran on the Muttil tree-felling case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-assembly-boycott-continues/article35643431.ece
31 July 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Winding up operations on at Sterlite’s oxygen plant||The Sterlite Copper has started winding up operations’in its oxygen plant on Friday as July 31 is the last day for the generation of medical-grade oxygen as permitted by the Supreme Court. An official statement said the Supreme Court, following an appeal from Sterlite Copper, had given three months for generating medical-grade oxygen from its oxygen plant on the sealed copper smelter plant in SIPCOT Industrial Complex in Thoothukudi to produce the life-saving gas to save COVID-19 patients. As the duration was about to end on Saturday the winding up operations commenced on Friday to give sufficient time for the defrosting process. The oxygen plant that had supplied 2,132 tonnes of high purity medical-grade oxygen to 32 districts of Tamil Nadu had a stock of 134 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen on the plant premises. Since the Sterlite Copper’s petition seeking six months extension for operation of oxygen plant was pending before the Supreme Court, the copper major was optimistic that it would get favourable orders from the apex court, the statement said. Besides sending the 134 tonnes of medical oxygen to the districts in need of the life-saving gas, the fresh orders would further enable Sterlite Copper to serve the people, especially the patients in need of oxygen. “We have also requested the State government to allow us 2MW of power supply, which will be used to keep the oxygen plant in standby condition and will also be essential in dispatching the stock of oxygen remaining at our plant,” the statement added. Sterlite Copper assured that the plant would be ready to resume oxygen generation as and when it was directed to do so by the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/winding-up-operations-begin-at-sterlites-oxygen-plant/article35643894.ece

31 July 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Digital mapping of waterbodies over||For the first time in Tamil Nadu, Tirunelveli district administration has launched an initiative to restore and rejuvenate waterbodies with the help of government agencies, residents, volunteers and corporate bodies after completing digital mapping. The prime objective of this initiative, called ‘Nellai Neervalam’ (Tirunelveli Water Resources), is preparing the Digital Water Atlas of Tirunelveli district, which has 1,237 waterbodies, administered by Public Works Department and urban and rural local bodies. The second objective is restoration and rejuvenation of these waterbodies. The initiative has been set in motion by Collector V. Vishnu since Tirunelveli being an agrarian district with the Tamirabharani being the backbone of farming operations and drinking water needs. With encroachments and dumping of waste posing serious threat to the waterbodies, the district administration has started the initiative. First leg over The first leg of this programme – preparing GIS-based ‘Digital Water Atlas’ showing all the waterbodies – has been completed and is available onhttps://nellaineervalam.in. Now the next task of restoration and rejuvenation has begun. Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu, who set in motion the initiative at Venthankulam near new bus stand on Friday in the presence of Mr. Vishnu, said Venthankulam, which was deepened with public contribution two years ago, would get a makeover with the Corporate Social Responsibility fund of Rs. 80 lakh to be released by a private firm. Restoration work started simultaneously in 21 other waterbodies on Friday. Besides rejuvenating the waterbodies – both systemised and non-systemised – Tamirabharani, the source of water for four southern districts, would also be taken care of. The river, from Papanasam to Tirunelveli, has been divided into 59 segments to be assigned to volunteers and students for cleaning the banks and preventing influx of sewage. Over 4,000 trees are to be planted along the river after cleaning the banks. “Moreover, the granite mandapams along the river will also be restored as we are planning to attract tourists to the river with new features such as boat rides at select points,” Mr. Thennarasu said.

31 July 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||New facility for treating the mentally ill||The Government Hospital at Kandigaiperi in Tirunelveli Town, which is all set to get new buildings to accommodate new departments and more facilities to serve people from the western parts of the district, has added a new facility - an Emergency Care and Rescue Centre (ECRC). With the guidance of Banyan, a Chennai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) which has been rescuing and rehabilitating mentally ill patients since 1993, the ECRC here can serve 20 rescued mentally ill persons at a time. R-Soya, a Tirunelveli-based NGO, has joined hands with Banyan in this venture. Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu inaugurated the facility in the presence of Collector V. Vishnu, Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital Dean M. Ravichandran and Banyan representatives. While training the volunteers of R-Soya in rescuing, rehabilitating and counselling of mentally ill patients for four months, the Banyan experts have also taught them the norms to be followed while handling them. Four social workers, two healthcare workers and a nurse will be deployed in the ECRC with the Banyan people evaluating their performance every Friday. Since persons rescued from the streets suffer from ailments such as fractures due to accidents, vision defects, skin ailments, tuberculosis and hypothyroidism, they would get treatment in the ECRC. “While half the number of patients, on getting rehabilitated, opt for reunion with their families, the rest like to remain in the rehabilitation centre itself. These people will be accommodated under ‘home again’ model where they will be given vocational training and some of them become volunteers to serve in the wards of the ECRC,” says Dr. Archana Padmakan, Deputy Director, ECRC, Banyan. In other districts When this initiative was introduced in five districts - Vellore, Tiruppur, Tiruvannamalai, Theni and Villupuram - it received good reception from the district administrations as the Banyan, after holding detailed discussion with the stakeholders – right from the Collector to government hospital authorities – has executed the initiative well. Now, the initiative has been taken to Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Sivaganga, Thanjavur, Erode, The Niligirs, Madurai, Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari and Cuddalore, wherein local NGOs have been identified for ensuring the best possible results in rescue and rehabilitation of the mentally ill.

After participating in some events here on Friday, Mr. Thennarasu, while speaking to reporters, said Minister for Public Health Ma. Subramanian had submitted a memorandum with the then Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare expressing the State government’s willingness to take on lease the vaccine complex. The demand was raised again when Chief Minister M. K. Stalin met the Prime Minister recently. But the Union government had not taken any decision, he said.

31 July 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||HPF factory in Udhagamandalam now hosts wildlife||In almost a decade since operations ceased at the Hindustan Photo Films (HPF) factory in Udhagamandalam town, the surrounding forests have slowly made inroads into the factory premises and brought in a variety of endangered wildlife that have made the factory their home. Local residents say Asiatic wild dogs (commonly known as dhole), leopards, sloth bears, Indian gaur, sambar deer and barking deer, and rare species of birds are sighted regularly on the 200-acre premises. Nilgiris-based conservationist N. Mohanraj says the land on which the factory was built was an extension of the Wenlock Downs grassland-Shola forest mosaic, and is contiguous with the Sandynallah reserve forest and Thalakundah. “Tigers and even elephants have used this corridor in the past to reach the outskirts of Udhagamandalam town. So it is important that studies are done to understand the species that are using this area, and bring it under the control of the forest department. We need to look at how this benefits wildlife, and to also safeguard the people living in the area,” he says. Restoration ecologist Godwin Vasanth Bosco says invasive species such as Gorse ( Ulex ) is spreading quickly in the area, but this may be a precursor to native flora establishing itself. “Native species like Justicia simplex , Fragaria nilgerrensis and sedge are establishing themselves in small numbers in areas where the exotic species are not able to flourish. It is only in the specialised habitats that the native species are starting to grow,” he says. Though it is primarily invasive flora that is spreading, these, however, helped build soil layers and fix nitrogen. “They also provide habitat and fodder for wildlife. Promoting the growth of native species of flora can be accelerated, which, in turn, will benefit the wildlife,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hpf-factory-in-udhagamandalam-now-hosts-wildlife/article35643703.ece

The 134-km long Tiruchi-Chidambaram National Highway is being widened at a total investment of about Rs. 4,000 crore. The NHAI is executing the project in three packages -- while package-I covers the Tiruchi-Kallagam stretch, package-II runs from Kallagam to Meensuritti and package-III will cover the stretch between Meensuritti in Ariyalur district and Chidambaram in Cuddalore district. Work on the first two packages is already under way and has made substantial progress. The NHAI had earlier called for fresh bids for the third package after the initial contract was terminated due to land acquisition issues. The contract has since been awarded and the work is set to begin shortly, NHAI sources said. “The contractor is on the ground and the work will begin in the first or second week of August. Land acquisition for widening the stretch has been completed,” the sources told The Hindu . According to sources, nearly 75% of the work on the first package has been completed so far and 55-65% of the works have been completed on the second package. Work on both the stretches is expected to be completed by January 2022. Package III will cover 31 km of the highway stretch, of which about 26 km will be bypass road stretches, making it almost a greenfield highway. The third and final package is set to be completed within two years from the date of commencement of works. The first 50 km of the highway, from Tiruchi to nearly Keezha Pazhur, is being converted into a four-lane highway with carriage ways of 8.7 metres on each side. Beyond this point, it will be a two-lane highway with paved shoulders. The two-lane highway would have a width of 10 metres. The project is expected to come as a boon to residents of Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Cuddalore and the industries located along the highway. A massive flyover is being constructed near Samayapuram providing a link between the Tiruchi-Chennai and Tiruchi-Chidambaram National Highways. Bypass roads will come up at various places including Lalgudi-Poovalur, Keezha Pazhur, Mela Pazhur, Jayamkondam and Kattumannarkovil. The Tiruchi-Kallagam section is a busy stretch of the highway with high traffic volume of goods vehicles as several cement factories are located along the highway. Road accidents involving vehicles carrying raw materials to the cement units often leads to protests in and around Ariyalur, triggering demands for construction of underpasses at various places. Though the non availability of migrant labourers had impacted the work during the lockdown last year, the NHAI had subsequently resumed work on the first two packages of the project after obtaining permission from the authorities in the districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-chidambaram-nh-widening-work-on-fast-lane/article35643670.ece

Over Rs. 5 crore was lost by the bank in the novel thefts. Immediately after bank authorities lodged complaints, the police, on scrutiny of CCTV footage, traced one of the accused, who used a rental bike. After collecting his phone number from the rental shop, the police caught Amir Arsh, 25, with the help of the Haryana police. After combing two premises in Mewat, the city police arrested three others — Virender Rawat, Najim Hussain and Shaukath Ali. The suspects knew the technical flaw in the machines and targeted vulnerable ones. They used genuine debit and credit cards to steal money. After inserting a card in the ATM, the machine dispensed cash and it was taken away by the fraudsters after blocking the sensor signal for a few seconds. But the ATM’s software registered it as a failed transaction. As a result, the cash was drained from the ATM but the relevant account was not debited. They used similar modus operandi and withdrew nearly over Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2 lakh in an hour. The accused used the same ATM deposit machines to deposit looted money. They would then transfer the amount through digital wallets to different accounts. The gang had struck at Tiruvannamalai, Hosur, and Vellore in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sbi-atm-theft-case-to-be-handed-over-to-cbi/article35643555.ece

The Transport Department, which is in the process of making High Security Registration Plates (HSRP) mandatory, has floated a tender to select an agency to execute this. Around 1.76 crore vehicles in Karnataka were registered before April 1, 2019, majority of which are from Bengaluru. The agency will set up a manufacturing unit for the embossing and affixation of HSRPs within three months after reaching an agreement with the department. Affixing stations will be made available in each RTO jurisdiction. As per the tender, the agency should also give vehicle owners the option of making online bookings and affixing HSRPs at their doorstep. The agreement with the agency will expire either in three years or when all 1.76 crore vehicles have upgraded to the new plates, whichever is earlier. Fees will be collected from motorists as per the notification issued by the department. The department will get a royalty of 2% of the HSRP fee. A senior official of the department said: “All new vehicles registered after April 1, 2019 have been fitted with HSRPs. We estimate there are around 1.76 crore vehicles were registered prior to that date. The bidder who quotes the lowest price for installation of the HSRP will be selected.” The system to affix HSRPs, which are touted to be tamper proof, is already in place in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. The State government had initiated the implementation of HSRP in 2010-11. However, the tender process was embroiled in various controversies and the matter also reached the courts. Following this, the government cancelled the tender it had floated in 2013.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/176-crore-vehicles-have-to-install-high-security-registration-plates/article35643503.ece
31 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||99.83% of students in Bengaluru region clear Class XII CBSE examination||Over 99% of Class XII Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students in Bengaluru region cleared the board examination, the results of which were announced on Friday. Last year, the pass percentage was 98.23, compared to this year’s 99.83%. With this, Bengaluru region stood fourth among all the regions with the highest pass percentage. Pass percentage A press release issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education stated that the overall pass percentage across the country as well as international students was 99.37%. A majority of the schools and students said they were satisfied with their marks. This year, board examinations were cancelled due to the pandemic, and students were evaluated based on a policy that was approved by the Supreme Court where 40% of the marks were allotted for unit tests, mid terms and pre-board examinations conducted in Class XII. Thirty per cent of the marks was from Class XI, (theory component) and another 30% allotted for the Class X average scores which is considered by taking the best of three scores out of the five main subjects.  A section of students and principals felt that the assessment criteria helped a large number of students get high scores. They pointed out that toppers were at a disadvantage as the board appears to have moderated the scores. “The CBSE had carved out a meticulous assessment pattern and the students’ scores were moderated. Last year, 35% of our students scored above 90%, but this year high performers have risen to 45%,” said Swati Soni, head of school, CMR National Public School. At a disadvantage She added that it was a disadvantage for some students who toiled hard as they could not get centums. Students who are unhappy with their scores can opt to write offline examinations, dates for which have yet to be announced. Manila Carvalho, principal of Delhi Public School, Bengaluru East, also felt that the board has moderated the marks of many of the toppers. Jyothi Menon, head of school, Ekya School ITPL, held a similar view. “The pandemic has made us change the exam patterns, and the evaluation system this year has led to an increase in the number of students scoring above 95%. However, overall, the system has been fair,” M. Menon said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/9983-of-students-in-bengaluru-region-clear-class-xii-cbse-examination/article35643497.ece
31 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Austerity measures likely to halt recruitment in depts., varsities||ChiefMinister Basavaraj Bommai’s directions to the heads of various departments to cut down at least 5% of avoidable expenditure in the current financial year is likely to further postpone recruitment drive in various departments and State-run universities and institutes. The government’s tax revenues have plummeted because of COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns, while expenses have shot up. To manage the cash-strapped State’s economy, the Chief Minister instructed senior officials to cut down avoidable expenditure by at least 5%. This is expected to further delay, at least by one more year, filling of thousands of vacancies. The Finance Department has already issued an order directing all administrative departments to seek its permission to undertake recruitment in the current financial year. The government had suspended all recruitments in 2020–21. Staff crunch About a month ago, a delegation of vice-chancellors had called on then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and urged him to take steps for recruitment. In agricultural universities alone, 45% of teaching and 55% of non-teaching posts remain vacant, they had pointed out. Moreover, funding has been reduced to university education/research. The government has not filled hundreds of teaching and non-teaching vacancies in several State-run universities, institutes, and colleges, said sources in universities and institutes. The Opposition Congress had earlier said the government should reduce wasteful expenditure by scrapping unnecessary posts in different departments. It also maintained that the government could cut down expenses by not allowing department secretaries to use vehicles of both their departments as well as boards/corporations and for private purposes. DA hike The State’s committed expenditure has increased from 77% in 2017–18 to 90% in 2020–21. The recent hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) by 10.25% would further increase the committed expenditure this year. Committed expenditure, which was around Rs. 90,000 crore in 2020–21, is likely to touch Rs. 1 lakh crore in this financial year. With this, the government is expected to use borrowings to pay increased salaries and pensions, leaving little money for development works/projects in 2021–22. It was proposed to borrow Rs. 71,332 crore (4% of GSDP). In the last financial year (2020–21), the government froze DA at existing levels and banned purchase of new vehicles, furniture, major repairs of buildings/construction, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/austerity-measures-likely-to-halt-recruitment-in-depts-varsities/article35643519.ece

The arrested have been identified as Arjun Kumar, 33 and Rakesh, 40, who hail from Shamli district, Uttar Pradesh but are residents of Ludhiana in Punjab. The police have recovered 465 gm of gold chains, most of them pledged in Ludhiana, and two stolen bikes that they used to commit the crimes. This is not the first time members of the Shamli gang have been arrested in the city. In 2020, two members - Subhash and Sanjay - were arrested by the Yelahanka police in connection with nine chain snatching cases.  The Bengaluru Rural pPolice identified the gang while probing 10 chain snatching cases in Surya Nagar, Hebbagodi, Hoskote, Sulibele, Sarjapur, and Channarayapatna among other places. They were arrested on July 21 when the duo returned to the city to carry out more crimes. The police later travelled to Ludhiana with them and recovered the gold chains from 10 cases. As is the modus operandi of the Shamli gang, the duo used to come to Bengaluru by flight, steal bikes to commit the crimes, and return to Punjab via trains to avoid customs. They would leave the stolen bikes in railway stations. “They targeted women walking alone and senior citizens and would divert their attention by asking them for directions or sometimes even for water,” said the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-of-inter-state-gang-of-chain-snatchers-held/article35643498.ece

The election to the post of union president was necessitated after the board of directors passed a no-confidence motion against the earlier union president Basavaraj Arabgonda and voted him out. This is the for the second time that Mr. Mugad is being elected to the post. On Friday, the election process began at 11 a.m. and the candidates had time till 1 p.m to file their nomination papers. As Mr. Mugad, backed by the BJP, was the only candidate to file his nomination papers within the stipulated time, he was declared as elected unopposed for a term of three years. The decision to unseat Mr. Arabgonda was taken on June 12 after he failed to honour the earlier agreement of stepping down after the completion of him being two years in office. During the no-confidence motion, out of the 12 directors, 10 backed Mr. Mugad’s candidature, while two supported Mr. Arabgonda.

31 July 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||‘Fear of court forced reluctant PM to give 27% reservation for OBCs’||Had it not been for the contempt of court case filed by the Congress and the DMK, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would not have bothered to implement the 27% reservation for OBCs in the national quota of medical seats, AICC general secretary in charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala said on Friday. Addressing a media conference in Hubballi, along with KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and Opposition leaders Siddaramaiah and S.R. Patil, Mr. Surjewala said that although the Congress government had passed the Bill making provision for 27% reservation, PM Modi had not bothered to give effect to it despite being in power for 7 years. “The credit that Mr. Modi is trying to seek on Twitter is actually deliberate falsehood,” he said. Mr. Surjewala said reservation for OBCs was 2% in 1952 and increased to 10% in 1980–81. Then, the Congress government implemented the Mandal Commission Report. In 1995–96, the reservation for BCs and OBCs went up. “In 2007, [then PM] Manmohan Singh and [AICC president] Sonia Gandhi ensured that the Congress government passed a law in Parliament for compulsory reservation for backward classes in all Central government institutions, and it was implemented,” he explained. Though Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, for seven years he did not implement the reservation in State institutions. Displaying a copy of the letter written by Ms. Gandhi to Mr. Modi on July 3, 2020, Mr. Surjewala said she had requested implementation of the constitutional mandate of reservation in national quota for OBC students, to which the Prime Minister never replied. Subsequently, one student approached the Madras High Court, which, on July 27, 2020, said that “you should not deny students their right”. “The court said we are issuing certain directions as we find that the entire constitutional obligation to take a decision by the Central government is evidently a necessity. However, when despite the court’s direction, Mr. Modi did not implement the reservation, the Congress and the DMK filed a contempt petition. In its order on July 21, the Madras HC gave the Centre 7 days to implement the reservation and also that admissions could be done only after implementing the reservation,” argued Mr. Surjewala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fear-of-court-forced-reluctant-pm-to-give-27-reservation-for-obcs/article35643512.ece

31 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Wall inside Bhujanga Park surprises Udupi residents||A wall, about 10 ft tall and 120 ft long built inside the children’s play area of Bhujanga Park in Ajjarkad, Udupi, has become a cause for concern for visitors. “I fail to appreciate the rationale behind such a wall that not only prevents air circulation but also blocks rays of the setting Sun when the children are playing in the evening,” said Gopalakrishna Prabhu, a resident of nearby Kinnimulky. Moreover, such a huge structure was built without the support of pillars or intermittent gaps because of which there is every possibility of the wall collapsing thereby endangering children’s life, he said. Stating that one side of the wall facing the play area was plastered, Mr. Prabhu said that the other side has been left being plastered. He noted that the area once had a good open-air gymnasium with wooden equipment. The equipment decayed following non-maintenance. The wall, he said, also obstructs the view of the Brahmagiri area to those sitting inside the park on benches. It was only 3 ft tall earlier, he said. Social activist Raghavendra Prabhu Karval said that instead of building such a wall inside the park, the City Municipal Council could well have strengthened the compound wall around the park, located on about 6 acres of land. The compound wall has given way at many places facilitating intruders to sneak in. Mr. Karval said that the wall could also offer shelter to anti-social elements who indulge in drinking alcohol and creating other nuisance in the area after it becomes dark. During the weekly cleanliness programme under Swatch Bharath Friends in the vicinity, hundreds of empty liquor bottles were found. It is an irony that these bottles are found right next to the Mahatma Gandhi statue, he said and added that the CMC should first have addressed the security and safety of the area. K.

Mr. Jagadeesha said that quality education is being offered in these residential schools even as the government provides free boarding and lodging, uniform, shoes, textbooks and notebooks. Students from Udupi district are not taking the maximum advantage of these schools, while those from outside are getting admissions. Hence, locally, there should be a maximum campaign to encourage parents to get their wards admitted in these schools. The residential schools are situated in Miyar of Karkala taluk, Kalathur of Kaup taluk, Hirebettu in Udupi taluk, Arur in Brahmavar taluk, Shankaranarayana, Siddapura and Yadadi-Matyadi in Kundapur taluk and Heranjalu in Byndoor taluk.

31 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||KCCI urges Indian Banks Assn. to facilitate ease of banking||The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) on Friday told the Indian Banks Association that banks have gone beyond Reserve Bank of India restrictions on opening multiple accounts by business entities causing hardship to entrepreneurs. In a letter to association CEO Sunil Mehta, KCCI president Isaac Vas said that the RBI had, on August 6, 2020, imposed certain restrictions on having bank accounts with multiple banks to prevent diversion of funds. While the business community had welcomed the move despite severe inconveniences, several banks were going beyond these guidelines thereby affecting business. He urged the association to advise its members to permit opening of multiple current accounts with the same bank and permit opening of collection accounts with other banks as per the RBI notification. The chamber has been receiving several complaints that such a hurriedly imposed directive from the RBI was causing difficulties. Some banks have closed current accounts abruptly without giving any notice. Mr. Vas said that some banks do not allow businesses to have current accounts and overdraft accounts in the same branch, while current accounts are used for collection of funds from customers. Banks are, however, mandating retaining only one account. Some businesses have branches in multiple locations, while banks do not permit them to have multiple current accounts in different cities. Banks are also not allowing businesses to open collection accounts in other banks where they do not have branches. MSMEs ought to maintain current accounts to safeguard their transactions. Denying them the facility adversely affects their business, he said. MSMEs should, therefore, be permitted to operate different current accounts, Mr. Vas added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kcci-urges-indian-banks-assn-to-facilitate-ease-of-banking/article35643939.ece

Addressing the protesting members, KPCC panellist Veronica Cornelio said that the previous government got the hospital constructed under the PPP model for the benefit of poor women in the region. The present government should ensure that the hospital continues to deliver services. She said that people were complaining that the hospital was turning away patients for want of infrastructure. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who was district in-charge earlier, should ensure that the problems, salary payment to the staff, are addressed at the earliest, she said. People have the fundamental right to avail of health services from the government and denial of services, particularly during the pandemic, has made it difficult for poor women to go to private hospitals. Municipal Council member Ramesh Kanchan, district Congress president Ashok Kumar Kodavoor, leaders Amruth Shenoy, Prakhyat Shetty and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-in-udupi/article35643938.ece

Addressing presspersons, Ganesh Karnik, chief spokesperson of the State unit of BJP, said Mr. Siddaramaiah had been kept out of the discussions at the regional-level meeting of the Congress led by State in-charge for party affairs Randeep Singh Surjewala in Tumakuru recently, and this indicated that he had become irrelevant and there was insecurity in him. “Mr. Siddaramaiah is depressed. Hence, the Leader of the Opposition is making some silly statements now,” Mr. Karnik said. He also said that Mr. Siddaramaiah had detached himself from the AHINDA movement as he could not achieve his “selfish politics” by being there. Asked about former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa saying that he would tour the State after August 15, Mr. Karnik said that it should be to build the party and prepare it to face the coming elections to the taluk and zilla panchayats and the Assembly in 2023. To another question on whether Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai would accommodate the “migrants” in his State Cabinet, the BJP spokesperson said that he hoped he would do it. “There is no question of calling anyone a migrant. All have won elections from the party and on the party symbol,” Mr. Karnik said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-has-become-irrelevant-in-congress-says-ganesh-karnik/article35643943.ece

Replying to a question by A.M. Ariff, MP, in Lok Sabha, the Minister said an additional amount of Rs. 510.2 crore had been allotted for the project in June 2021. Railways have taken up the doubling works between Ambalappuzha and Ernakulam in three parts — Ernakulam-Kumbalam (7.71 km); Kumbalam-Thuravoor (15.59 km); and Thuravoor-Ambalappuzha (45.90 km). Earlier outlay Earlier this year, a budget outlay of Rs. 10 crore each was provided for the doubling of three stretches in the financial year 2021-22. Of the Rs. 510.20 crore sanctioned, Rs. 262 crore was allotted for the Ernakulam-Kumbalam stretch and Rs. 248.20 crore for the Kumbalam-Thuravoor stretch. “On account of considerable increase in the cost of the project due to abnormal rise in the cost of the land, the State government was requested to provide land free of cost and to share 50% cost of the project.

The civic administrators are yet again planning to develop a vision document, which will serve as a guideline for future urban development projects. A preliminary meeting of the Chief Town Planner, Town Planning Standing Committee of the Kochi Corporation, and the corporation engineer, convened by Mayor M. Anilkumar, decided to prepare the master plan. It was in 2002 that the civic body made an attempt to develop a master plan for Kochi, the urban body which grew by leaps and bounds. Then civic administration led by C.M. Dinesh Mani had initiated the project with an eye on urban development till 2020. Though the Town Planning Department had drawn up a plan for the Greater Kochi area in 2010, it could not be finalised, said a communication issued by the Mayor. Following a discussion with the Mayor the other day, Additional Chief Secretary Sarada Muralidharan had entrusted the State Chief Town Planner with the task of coordinating with the civic body with regard to the project, it added. Besides the Greater Kochi area, the master plan will cover nearby panchayats too. The proposal will be discussed with the civic heads of the neighbouring municipalities. It will also be taken up with the MP, MLAs, and civic representatives. The project will be executed with the support of P. Rajeeve, the Minister in charge of Ernakulam district, said the communication. The town planning standing committee of the corporation will take the project forward. The corporation council will give priority to the development of the Kochi master plan and the town planning scheme for the Fort Kochi area in the coming year. The view of all stakeholders will be sought for preparing the document, the communication said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/civic-authorities-to-come-up-with-a-master-plan-for-kochi/article35643827.ece

The Special Judge had on Wednesday issued a non-bailable warrant against him after he failed to turn up for examination. The court had earlier set apart four days for his examination. The schedule went haywire as he failed to appear. On Friday, the police submitted a report to the court that he was arrested from his house at Kalamassery. The accused submitted that he had sought medical treatment at a city hospital after being injured in a vehicle accident. Warrant He also produced a medical record to this effect. However, there were reports that the accused was seen on the court premises on Thursday and the police did not arrest him though a warrant was pending against him. Some police personnel reportedly helped him get out of the court complex without being noticed. The court ordered medical aid to Vishnu as he complained of chest pain and uneasiness during the trial on Friday. The court, which suspended the proceedings, also directed the police to provide him medical aid. He was also asked to be present in the court on Monday. Prosecution case The prosecution case was that Vishnu knew about Pulser Suni, the first accused in the case, writing a letter to extort money from actor Dileep, the eighth accused. He has been charged with hatching the conspiracy with the other accused to rape the actor and video-record the commission of the crime. Vishnu, after securing a bail, had allegedly procured a copy of the letter seeking money from Dileep and shared it with Appunni, the driver of Dileep, through WhatsApp. Vishnu, who was arraigned as the 10th accused, was later made an approver in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-produce-approver-in-actor-rape-case-in-court/article35643840.ece

Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar issued the order on Friday while allowing a writ petition filed by Vincy Dinakaran of Aluva challenging the refusal by the Choornikkara village officer to give her a nativity certificate on the ground that she was born outside the State. For higher studies The parents of the petitioner belonged to Tamil Nadu. They had settled in Kerala long before the birth of the petitioner. The mother gave birth to her at Tamil Nadu. After her birth, she was brought to Kerala and she completed her school and college education here. She wanted a nativity certificate to pursue higher studies. Quashing the order of the village officer, the court observed that if a person was socially adapted to the prevailing system of norms and values in the State, he/she should be considered as a person belonging to the State. The criterion for issuing a nativity certificate should be the place where the person had been brought up and educated. Govt. stance The government took the stand that as per the Kerala Land Revenue Manual, nativity certificate could be issued only to persons who were born in the State and to the children of those who were born in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-expands-scope-of-nativity-certificate/article35643845.ece

Sixteen months later, she returned home on July 9, bruised and all her dreams shattered. Since then, she has petitioned the Njarakkal police against the two agents who arranged her sojourn in West Asia, accusing them of having sold her for Rs. 1 lakh to the Arab family that employed her. “I was promised a job that required me to do household work and take care of children for four hours a day. But in reality, I had to break my back non-stop from early morning hours till midnight and had to endure physical abuse. When I questioned the land lady one day, she showed me a video of handing over Rs. 1 lakh to one of the agents,” alleged Ms. Selvaraj. She also complained that though she was promised Rs. 23,000 a month, she was paid only Rs. 19,000, and even dues for four months remains unpaid. She alleged that she had called both the agents, one reportedly in Qatar, but did not receive any help. She eventually made it back home thanks to the intervention of some activists and organisations there. Her police petition, among other things, demanded action against both the agents, compensation for the physical abuse she had to endure and her four months’ pending salary. The Njarakkal police have registered a case under IPC Section 370 (Trafficking) against the two agents, Salim and Sakkeer. “We couldn’t trace neither. Salim is originally from Chavakkad [in Thrissur] and lived in the petitioner’s neighbourhood for a while but had since then left the place. We have little information about the other guy who seems to be out of the country,” said police sources. Ms. Selvaraj, meanwhile, is undergoing treatment for what she claims to be injuries inflicted by her Arab employer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-alleges-torture-by-employer-in-qatar/article35643823.ece

It is in keeping with experiential tourism that is gaining popularity globally in the post-pandemic situation. “Our plan is to help open at least one farm tourism avenue in each local body, while people will be encouraged to set up farmsteads around houses. This will help in cultivation of vegetables, fruits, dairy, poultry, eggs, and fish, among others,” said K. Rupesh Kumar, state coordinator, RT Mission. Such ventures bring about a participatory and win-win situation for all stakeholders, including farmers, members of the local community, and tourists, he added. Food security Explaining how farm and farmstead tourism can be linked to the Subhiksha Keralam project, which aims at bringing about food security by encouraging self-sufficiency in farming, Mr. Rupesh Kumar said, “Tourists and others who visit the farms will also be able to directly source the produce, thus laying the groundwork for the formation of a supply chain. The RT Mission will ready farm tourism packages in tandem with local bodies and also help market them. Other support systems too are under the government’s consideration. We have been enthused by the farmstead tourism success story of Kumarakom [where substantial number of hotels bank on members of the local community to supply home-grown vegetables and eggs].” Collectives comprising groups of people too can go for farm tourism initiatives. Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas has issued directives in this regard, it is learnt. Accommodation units A host of allied tourism ventures like mud houses, tent camping, butterfly gardens, and Miyawaki-model fruit forests too have been envisaged within the farms. A model destination has been envisaged at Ettumanur. It will attract both domestic and foreign tourists, since it is in keeping with the yearning to “return to one’s roots”, Mr. Rupesh Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rt-mission-plans-5500-farm-homestead-tourism-ventures/article35643824.ece
31 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Judicial officers mourn death of Jharkhand judge||Judicial officers across the State changed their digital profile photos mourning the death of Uttam Anand, the judicial officer of Jharkhand, who was fatally hit by a vehicle a day ago. The officers changed their profile picture of social media accounts, including Facebook and WhatApp, to that of a lit black candle with a black ribbon wrapped around it. ‘A deliberate act’ Condemning the incident, the All India Judges Association said the incident, as seen from CCTV footage and media reports, primarily seemed a “deliberate act of causing death, probably to keep him away from discharging his duty to deliver justice independently.” Uttam Anand, an Additional District and Sessions Judge of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, died after being hit by a vehicle on the early hours of July 28. Assault The judge was hearing two murder cases and another case on illegal transportation of coal. The association expressed “concern over the security of judges of the trial court judiciary as many incidents are reported of assault on judges with an attempt to deviate them from performing the judicial functions independently,” some times by criminals and litigants. ‘Step up security’ In its resolution, the Kerala Judicial Officers’ Association resolved to request the Kerala High Court and the State government to step up the security of judges of the district judiciary. Fear psychosis The incident, according to V.P.M. Suresh Babu, the president-in-charge of the organisation, was an “attempt to create fear psychosis among judicial officers so as to make inroads into the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/judicial-officers-mourn-death-of-jharkhand-judge/article35643839.ece

The department-level evaluation of answer scripts was adopted in the wake of the COVID-19-related restrictions. But the disappearance of the answer scripts and the suspension of a senior faculty member under the interim arrangement meant that the representatives of the teachers insisted on returning to the centralised system. Sangamesan K.M., who was suspended by the university on the charge of being responsible for the loss of the answer scripts, was reinstated immediately after the papers were recovered from the exam wing on Monday. The university had found his explanation that he had handed over the answer scripts and grade sheet to the head of the department unsatisfactory. The Kalady police had since then registered a case of theft. “It was pointed out that even SSLC and Plus Two exams taken by lakhs of students followed the centralised evaluation system in compliance with the COVID protocol. The university has all the infrastructure for holding such camps,” said Bichu S. Malayil, a Syndicate member and general secretary of the Association of Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University Teachers. The three-member internal inquiry commission appointed by Syndicate to probe the missing answer scripts chose not to submit an interim report in the meeting considering that the answer scripts were recovered and the suspension was revoked. “However, we insisted on continuing the probe to expose the conspiracy behind the incident. We also found the high-level police inquiry into the incident satisfactory,” said Ms. Malayil. The meeting also decided to give guideship to the newly recruited 20-odd teachers with PhD and published works, without considering their teaching experience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sanskrit-varsity-to-revert-to-centralised-evaluation-system/article35643836.ece

The Corporation decided to appeal to the district administration to consider the opinion of the ward-level rapid response teams while determining the zones. Opening of shops Deputy Mayor C.P. Musafir Ahamed supported the motion while councillor S.K. Aboobakker pointed out that even wards that recorded less than 10 positive cases a week were placed under the ‘C’ category, along with the rest of the Corporation. “Shops should be able to open at least three days a week. Otherwise, people rush into the shops on the single working day. This will only lead to a rise in the number of positive cases,” he said. Opposition leader K.C. Shobhita introduced an amendment to the motion to request the State government to reconsider the categorisation based on TPR. The non-availability of vaccines and the uneven distribution among wards were also discussed. The Mayor requested the councillors to cooperate with the health wing to enable the smooth vaccination of maximum number of people in their respective wards. Councillor T. Muralidharan presented a submission on problems related to pensions as mustering has not been carried out in the Corporation for two years. Welfare standing committee chairman P. Divakaran said the Corporation was introducing doorstep services for several welfare schemes and mustering was one of them. He said the facility would be operational by September. Mr. Aboobakker’s demand to cancel the lease agreement for the KSRTC bus terminal complex at a rent of Rs. 10 per square feet drew flak from councillors of the ruling front, who were irked by his remark that the Chief Minister had vested interest in the matter. Later, the Corporation passed two motions, one on the move to form a Union Ministry for cooperatives and another on the phone tapping row using Pegasus spyware, despite opposition from BJP councillors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-to-demand-change-in-covid-zone-division-method/article35643808.ece
31 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Technical errors on CoWIN site giving headache to many||The difficulty in scheduling COVID-19 vaccination and the errors in certificates are giving a headache for many residents in the rural areas of Kozhikode district. An elderly couple from Karassery panchayat was shocked when they noticed that their vaccination certificates on the CoWIN portal mentioned the same date for both doses. Another person who is yet to receive the vaccine found his vaccination certificate on the portal when he logged in. The man remains clueless about how his identity details and phone number were used by someone else to book a slot and get vaccinated. In some wards near Thottumukkam in Kodiyathur panchayat, the PIN code-based slot booking continues to pose difficulties for many. Though residents in Thottumukkam who use the PIN code 673639 come under Kozhikode district, their postal division is actually Manjeri, which is in Malappuram district. The issue has remained unaddressed despite complaints raised by many elected representatives and organisations. Residents in Wards 5, 6 and 7 in Kodiyathur panchayat who face the issue are now conducting an email campaign to bring the issue to the notice of ministers and State IT Mission authorities. Former Thiruvambady MLA George M. Thomas who launched the campaign on Friday said follow-up actions would be taken in the days to come to provide a quick solution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/technical-errors-on-cowin-site-giving-headache-to-many/article35643815.ece

31 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) asks divided INL to get its act together||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] has reportedly cautioned the Indian National League (INL) that its position in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) could become potentially untenable if the coalition partner continued with its “internecine bloodletting” in public. By one account, the CPI(M) told the INL bluntly that it could not exist in the LDF as two opposing factions. The sole ministerial berth held by the INL was no assurance of its permanence in the LDF. CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was closeted with INL former State secretary A.P. Abdul Wahab at the AKG centre here. The CPI(M) leader reportedly conveyed the party’s “hard line” on factionalism to the INL leadership and asked the party to get its act together quickly. The details of the closed-door meeting remained largely a secret. However, CPI(M) insiders claimed that Mr. Balakrishnan had taken strong exception to the INL’s State committee meeting in Kochi on July 25. The CPI(M) felt that it had degenerated into a public spectacle, with opposing INL factions battling it out on the street. The brawl had cast doubts about the almost cult-like internal discipline in the LDF. INL leaders had disparaged each other publicly. Such open feuding usually followed an electoral defeat and was rare among LDF constituents. The CPI(M) felt the feuding in the INL had not hurt the LDF politically. However, it would not underestimate the destructive potential of such feuds if allowed to fester. The INL issue had also reportedly figured prominently in the CPI(M) State secretariat meeting. The CPI(M) feared that other non-communist LDF constituents could take a cue from the INL and slide into factionalism. Hence, it had accorded time to the INL to sort its issues out. Rapprochement attempt CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan had reportedly conveyed a similar message to INL general secretary Kasim Irikkur.

Sivankutty on Friday declared Nedumangad as a ‘total digitilisation constituency’. The declaration marked a culmination of efforts made to ensure all students possessed digital devices that enabled them to access online classes. Lauding the initiative, Mr. Sivankutty called the model an emulative one and highlighted the potential held by societies in coming together to resolve problems faced by various sections at times of need. Agriculture Minister P. Prasad, who was chief guest at the function held at the Kanyakulangara Government Girls Higher Secondary School, proposed creating a constituency-level team to prevent misuse of digital devices. Food and Civil Supplies Minister and local MLA G.R. Anil, who spearheaded the initiative, said as many as 1980 students were provided mobile phones, laptops and televisions under the programme. He said cooperative banks in the constituency became part of the initiative by sanctioning interest-free loans to purchase 277 mobile phones. In addition, 103 locations that lacked internet connectivity came under BSNL’s service coverage area, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nedumangad-declared-total-digitalisation-constituency/article35644043.ece

In a statement here on Friday, the association said that more than half of their three-year postgraduate training had been spent on COVID care, to the exclusion of other clinical exposure, training and academics. Now, with an acute shortage of hands in hospital wards, all residents were overworked and exhausted. Though the situation had been brought to the notice of medical college Principals, hospital superintendents, Director of Medical Education, and the Health Minister as early as six months ago, nothing was done to resolve the situation, the KMPGA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medicos-plan-token-strike-on-august-2/article35643858.ece

31 July 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Loan scam: coop. bank admin removed||The Registrar of Cooperatives on Friday removed administrator of the Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank M.C. Ajith from the post. A three-member administrative panel, comprising senior assistant registrar T.K. Raveendran and senior inspectors A.M. Vinod and K.K. Pramod, was given charge of the bank at Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district. The Registrar of Cooperatives had disbanded the board of directors of the bank, led by K.K. Divakaran as president, following a loan scam amounting to more than Rs. 100 crore. Later Mr. Ajith, Assistant Registrar, Mukundapuram, was appointed as administrator of the bank. However, objections were raised to Mr. Ajith’s appointment as he had been auditing the bank accounts for the past four years. It was alleged that he had failed to detect the fraud and take action. The BJP and the Congress alleged that Mr. Ajith, who knew about the fraud, had kept mum. They also questioned the delay in recording the arrest of four persons allegedly in the custody of the Crime Branch. The Crime Branch had reportedly taken into custody from Ayyanthole the four accused in the case six days ago. However, the agency has denied it. The BJP and the Congress alleged that there was an effort to sabotage the investigation. Plea for CBI, ED probe Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Kerala High Court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a loan scam in the cooperative bank. In his petition, Suresh M.V. from Thrissur alleged that around Rs. 300 crore had been siphoned off from various accounts maintained at the bank at the behest of the managing committee. The money deposited by the common man had been diverted to many sources. This amount had been utilised for illegal trade and other anti-national activities. The petitioner said the money siphoned-off had been utilised for purchasing land near Perinjanam in Thrissur where conventions of banned outfits were held. It was suspected that money was also used for terror activities. Therefore, the matter required an in-depth probe. In fact, as per an RBI circular issued in 2009, if crores of rupees were siphoned off from a bank, the CBI should be entrusted with the investigation. The petitioner added that the bank was managed by a committee owing allegiance to the CPI(M). The police investigation was being sabotaged by pressure from the ruling front. An investigation by the police or the Crime Branch would not be fair.

The new Chief Minister ruled out any possibilityof the expansion getting delayed for a long time like it did after his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa took over in 2019. “I have tried to convince party national president J.P. Nadda about the need to give early clearance for the expansion as the State is reeling under floods and COVID-19. They have responded positively and assured me of informing at the earliest,” Mr. Bommai told reporters in New Delhi. “I am yet to discuss the composition of the Ministry. The national president will send a message whether it is required for me to come to Delhi again to discuss this issue. I feel I may have to come again,” Mr. Bommai said. When asked how his Ministry would look, he only said, “It will be a combination of people having experience, innovative mindset, and creative thinking.” To a particular question on whether he would give preference to youth, he said, “You can wait and see.” Meanwhile, the new Chief Minister was giventhe mandate of providing “clean and efficient” government by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Prime Minister told me during the 40-minute meeting that the party expects me to deliver clean and efficient administration,” he said.  Floods, COVID-19 Mr. Modi, who held a detailed discussion on various issues related to Karnataka, including floods and COVID-19, also promised to provide Central assistance for any project to be taken up for rehabilitation in flood-hit areas, he said. The Prime Minister particularly referred to the increasing COVID-19 cases in neighbouring Kerala and asked Mr. Bommai to take precautionary measures. Mr. Bommai said in his meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the latter said it was “testing time” for him and that he would have to raise to the occasion. “I assured him that I am ready to work 24 hours a day to meet their expectation,” Mr. Bommai said. Another senior leader, Rajnath Singh advised the new Chief Minister to focus on strengthening the BJP too through a proper coordination between the party and the government.

31 July 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chittoor sees steady rise in COVID cases||There is no respite in the COVID-19 graph of daily cases in the district with over 300 cases being recorded on any given day in the last couple of weeks. Vididhipalle, a village in Penumuru mandal, recorded 25 positive cases on a single day on Friday. Since a week, the pandemic graph is on a 30% rise. While some officials perceive the steady spike in the cases as a harbinger of the third wave, the scenario is also attributed to growing violation of COVID-appropriate behaviour in public places, added with increase in the number of social and family functions with unlimited presence of guests. There is a clear trend among the public to attend celebrations such as birthdays, wedding anniversaries and betrothals. The officials also decry the steady return of political gatherings elsewhere in the district, though they are reluctant to criticise it openly. “Having missed the gala in 2020, now a majority of the people are in no mood to wait any further to rejoice. The reckless mood is more among those who took two doses of vaccination, as they take it for granted that they are totally protected from the virus. Even if they are infected, it would be just like a small fever — this is the general mood now,” observed a medical officer on COVID duty in Srikalahasti mandal, which turned a hotspot during the first wave. District on top After a lull of a few days, COVID cases reached close to 400 on Thursday, followed by 315 cases on Friday. Chittoor district, which bore the impact of Chennai’s Koyambedu market links in the first wave, had turned even more virulent in the second wave, with alarming number of casualties, topping the districts in the State with over 1,730 deaths so far, with the total cases crossing the 2.35-lakh mark. Private transport activity has returned to near normal, with hectic operation on inter-State routes towards Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where the face mask protocol is grossly neglected. A police officer in Madanapalle division deplored that though slapping a fine or booking a case for violation of COVID appropriate behaviour would take a few minutes, later the procedure involved other legal hassles. In order to avoid being caught in a tight spot, the strict enforcement of the rule was largely set aside, it is observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-sees-steady-spike-in-covid-19-infections/article35643478.ece

Though fear continues to persist at the fringe villages of Puttur range, particularly at the foothills in Narayanavanam mandal headquarters, there is a sigh of relief that the “stray visitor” could have left the range. The couple was attacked in the forest between Narayananam and Singirikona waterfalls, 10 km from Puttur, on July 26. Forest Range Officer (Puttur) K. Subramanyam said a thorough search was launched to trace the leopard, but in vain.“Going by the situation, we are sure that the leopard does not have its habitat in Puttur range, but must be a visitor by chance from somewhere else. In view of the hilly terrain, which is also spread over a vast area into neighbouring ranges, we can’t immediately arrive at a final conclusion. As no further attacks have been reported from anywhere since five days, the chances of the leopard making a habitat for itself over here are very remote,” he said. Officials said it was the first time that a leopard was sighted in the range.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-trace-of-leopard-that-attacked-couple/article35643984.ece

Muralidhar to the Krishna River Management Board Chairman asking it to direct Andhra Pradesh to stop the drawal of water from Pothyreddypadu Head Regulator, as according to them it was outside the basin. Samiti president Bojja Dasaratharami Reddy told The Hindu that outside basin use was “our right” and it was specified in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act that the allocations made by the river water tribunals with regard to various projects on Godavari and Krishna Rivers or for the regions of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh, in respect of assured water would remain the same. “The Srisailam project is predominantly for power generation and we are fine with the utilisation of 265 tmcft, but that cannot be done in one season, but it is for both kharif and rabi with primary thumb rule of not wasting water into the sea,” Mr. Reddy said. Telangana government should also remember that Section 85 (7) XI Schedule (10) of the Act guarantees water for ongoing projects, he said. By trying to generate power for running the north Telangana lift projects, Telangana was doing injustice to Rayalaseema and Southern Telangana districts, he opined. Nagarjunasagar will be full in 7 to 8 days at the rate inflows are seen today and projections given by the CWC depending on the rains in the catchment area, hence stopping water to Rayalaseema and allowing it to follow into the sea was not a wise idea, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/samiti-criticises-ts-letter-to-krmb/article35643473.ece

31 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Leafy greens do a vanishing act at city markets||Rythu bazaars across the city are reporting a shortage of leafy greens, with most varieties except sorrel (gongura) unavailable for the past few days. Officials said that crops sown in vast areas were damaged in heavy rains that lashed most of Krishna and Guntur districts in the recent past. Amaranthus, also known as thotakoora , is nowhere to be found, sending shoppers into a tizzy. Spinach (palakoora), Malabar spinach (bachali), fenugreek (menthi koora), spring onion, etc. are also not seen in the markets. Till a week ago, sorrel was also in short supply. Now, mostly mint, coriander, curry leaves and sorrel leaves are available at the markets. The availability of amaranthus, a fast selling leafy vegetable, has dropped significantly. There is a mismatch between supply and demand of amaranthus, spinach or sessile joyweed (ponnaganti). Health-conscious people who look for red spiderling (punarnava) are disappointed as it has vanished from the markets. However, the shortage in supplies did not push up the prices except for coriander. A bundle of coriander, which used to be available for about Rs. 10, now commands a price of Rs. 22 at the rythu bazaars. The prices of other leafy vegetables, however, are largely unchanged at Rs. 2.50 per bundle in the vegetable markets. “The arrival of leafy vegetables have come down by 20%,” said S. Karunakar, Estate Officer at Patamata Rythu Bazaar. According to information, there are six rythu bazaars in the city, one each at Swaraj Maidan, Payakapuram, Kedareswarapeta, Bhavanipuram, Ajijth Singh Nagar and Patamata. More than 450 quintals of vegetables arrive at the Patamata Rythu Bazaar alone, according to officials. Of this, 80 to 100 quintals would be leafy vegetables. The total arrivals in all six rythu bazaars would be more than 2,000 quintals per day. Crops sown in Yanamalakuduru in Krishna district and Kunchanapalli in Guntur district were damaged in heavy rains. Due to waterlogging, harvesting of some vegetables was delayed. This impacted the arrivals of leafy greens in the city. The crops were not damaged due to scanty rain. Farmers bear the brunt The farmers who are cultivating vegetables, particularly leafy greens, in Krishna and Guntur have bore the brunt. Availability of vegetables and prices are expected to be under pressure for the next few days due to tight supplies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/leafy-greens-do-a-vanishing-act-at-city-markets/article35644084.ece

31 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telugu Desam leaders placed under house arrest||A day ahead of their plan to visit the Kondapalli reserve forest area to ascertain facts on the alleged illegal mining there, the police on Friday placed the TDP leaders under house arrest at their respective places. TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu had constituted a fact-finding committee comprising Varla Ramaiah, V. Anita, K. Ravindra, B. Umamaheswara Rao, K. Narayana, N. Raghuram, N. Ramakrishna Reddy, T. Sowmya, and N. Meera. The committee members are supposed to visit Kondapalli on Saturday. In his reaction, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy wondered why should the State government create hurdles when no illegal mining activity was taking place in the reserve forest area in Mylavaram constituency in Krishna district. The government was misusing the police to place the TDP leaders under illegal house arrest with the ulterior motive of suppressing their voice against the ruling party leaders’ corrupt activities, he alleged. “The false cases and arrests cannot prevent the TDP leaders from visiting the area on Saturday,” he said. The fact-finding committee was constituted in the backdrop of the arrest of TDP leader Devineni Umamheswara Rao and his followers on Wednesday. The former Minister was accused of rioting and criminal conspiracy, after his surprise visit to the reserve forest area on Tuesday led to clashes between the TDP and YSRCP activists at Gaddamanugu village. Mr. Umamaheswara Rao had alleged that the YSRCP leaders, with the support of Mylavaram MLA Vasantha Krishna Prasad, were indulging in illegal gravel mining.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-place-tdp-leaders-under-house-arrest/article35643463.ece

Vimukti and Help organised a meeting with various stakeholders in connection with World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, here on Friday. On the occasion, the speakers expressed the view that there were no effective laws to deal with the menace of private moneylenders. “Women are being subjected to trafficking by private moneylenders in the absence of stringent laws. Women in combined Andhra Pradesh got some protection from micro financiers as the then government had enacted the Andhra Pradesh Micro Finance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending) Act 2011. Similar steps should be taken to protect the people from private moneylenders,” they said. The government should provide bank loans to the survivors of trafficking. The government can form self-help groups of the survivors to provide bank loans so that they can look for alternative income sources. Also, the victims should not be kept at shelter homes for a long time in the guise of rehabilitation, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/curbs-on-moneylenders-will-check-trafficking/article35644085.ece

Madhav supporting the decision of the Union government on the strategic sale of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). JAC chairman M. Jaggu Naidu alleged that Mr. Madhav, who was elected by the graduates of North Andhra, was cheating the people with such statements and demanded his immediate resignation as an MLC. His statements were making a mockery of the agitation being organised by steel workers, trade unions and people’s organisation for the last six months, Mr. Jaggu Naidu said. He demanded that the MLC take back his statements and seek an apology from people. Mr. Jaggu Naidu said that the privatisation of the VSP would deprive the youth of their employment chances, hinder the progress of the city and also betray social justice. Mr. Madhav should be the voice of the people in the council as an elected representative, but his remarks were an insult to people, Mr. Jaggu Naidu said. JAC vice chairman P. Ramana said that if Mr. Madhav wanted to toe the line of the BJP, he should resign as MLC and seek re-election. He would be taught a lesson by the voters, Mr. Ramana said.

31 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Joint panel to probe ‘illegal’ laterite mining in Sarugudu||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the constitution of a joint committee to inquire into the alleged illegal mining of laterite at Bhamidikaloddi village in Sarugudu panchayat of Nathavaram mandal in Visakhapatnam district. The order was issued on July 26, after an application by the tribal people seeking it was reviewed and admitted by Justice Ramakrishnan and K. Satyagopal, an expert member. As per the order, the panel will comprise a senior officer from the MoEF&CC, the District Collector, the District Forest Officer, a senior officer from the Mines and Geology Department of A.P., and a senior officer from the A.P. Pollution Control Board. The panel will examine the nature of land where the mining activity is taking place as per the original revenue records (prior to Independence), whether the respondent has obtained all permissionsunder the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, the manner in which the mining has been done, and whether it has affected the environment, whether excess mining has been done and, if so, the quantity of excess, whether the road has been expanded without obtaining permissions , and whether pollution norms have been complied with or not. The panel has been asked to submit a report, including the action taken report, before August 31, and has directed the Department of Mines and Geology to provide the required logistic support. The NGT has asked the Principal Conservator of Forests to file an independent report regarding the nature of land and whether any permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act is required for carrying out mining, and whether violations have been committed under the laws and under the provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act. The PCF has been asked to submit the report along with the action taken report. Tribals’ complaint The tribal people, who have been on the warpath over the issue, had moved the NGT. The applicants had alleged that unauthorised laterite mining was being done in the forest area without obtaining the required clearances from the Forest Department. The permission was granted in 2012 for 20 years over an extent of 121 hectares of forest land, they said. It was alleged that a road, which was intended for the tribal people’s use, was expanded without getting the necessary clearances from the authorities concerned, including the Forest Department. It was alleged that the gram sabhas were fabricated to obtain the permission from the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/joint-panel-to-probe-illegal-laterite-mining/article35643732.ece
31 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Changing the lives of underprivileged children||The pandemic may have changed the face of education to the virtual mode, but not all children have the good fortune of having access to online classes, particularly the underprivileged. Additionally, several Child Care Institutions that provide support to children from economically backward families are battling a steep financial crisis with donation funds drying out. With an objective to bridge this divide, city-based NGO HUManity – led by a team of young volunteers – initiated three projects and a campaign called ‘Donate a Device.’ Founded by Chanakya Karra and Abhishek Paluri in 2019, HUManity is currently associated with five Child Care Institutions (CCI) in Visakhapatnam, connecting 150 children through the efforts of the organisation’s 50 volunteers. “Owing to the pandemic, there has been a dip of 80% in the donations resulting in a severe crisis among the CCIs,” says Mr. Chanakya, who completed his masters in technology from Andhra University before joining the social sector. As part of the efforts of the organisation, HUManity has initiated a ‘Donate a Device’ campaign to distribute donated mobile phones that can serve the purpose of online education for the kids at the CCIs. Three projects The organisation also initiated three projects to engage with the kids at the CCIs at the education level by providing free teaching classes in English and mathematics on weekends; start a life skill programme to improve cognitive and inter-personal skills of the children and build a library in each of these five Child Care Institutions through a collaboration with Harper Collins. “One of the main challenges that we have observed at these CCIs is that most children after they step out of the institution do not have the skill sets to sustain themselves. We plan to start systematic skill enhancement programmes at the five CCIs to address this issue,” says Mr. Chanakya. Free sanitary pads To improve the lifestyles of girls at 27 CCIs across Visakhapatnam, HUManity has recently partnered with Pee Safe for providing free sanitary pads to 100 children. “We will be starting with providing 400 sanitary napkins to girls every month to beginning from July,” says Chanakya.

In a letter to the Metropolitan Commissioner on Friday, party State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy and Greater Visakha city committee secretary M. Pydiraju said that it was the duty of the authorities to tell the citizens as to how far the existing Master Plan was implemented. They should also be told as to what was the reason for the non-implementation of some of the works proposed in the earlier plan and the difficulties in their implementation, the party leaders said. The CPI leaders said that preparation of a new Master Plan without giving these details was creating suspicions among the people. The residents of areas, where the development projects are planned, do not know of these plans. No discussions seem to have been held with those who would be affected by the projects and no gram sabhas have been held to take the opinions of the people. There is no mention of how the 793 slums in the city would be developed, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-seeks-withdrawal-of-draft-plan/article35644097.ece

Adinarayana has said that the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) was established following widespread protests by people against the decision of the then Central government to set up the steel plant elsewhere in the country. Mr. Adinarayana was addressing steel workers, who participated in the 169th day of the relay hunger strike at the steel plant arch at Kurmannapalem here on Friday. The Centre had, however, delayed the construction of the plant, which resulted in the VSP accumulating losses over the years, he said. The government had made plans to refer it to the BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) in the past and hand it over to some corporate groups, he added. In the subsequent years, attempts were made to divest the stakes in the plant in the name of going for an Initial Public Offering(IPO). Several attempts were made by the government over the years to sell the plant but they could not materialise due to united struggles by the workers and employees, Mr. Adinarayana said. Committee leader B. Mahesh and member Parandamayya called upon the workers not to get disheartened by the moves of the Union government but to continue the struggles unitedly to stop the government from going ahead with the privatisation of the steel plant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/continue-struggle-vsp-workers-told/article35644095.ece

Velishala Ravi, 42, a resident of Shilpinagar, is among several private photographers of the temple town hit hard by the low turnout of devotees at the Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple ever since the portals of the temple reopened for darshan last month. Ravi has been working as a private photographer clicking pictures of devotees against the backdrop of the picturesque Godavari and the historic shrine to eke out a living for the last 18 years. Undeterred by the COVID-triggered fall in business, he deployed a horse to catch the attention of visitors at the flood bank abutting the Godavari. With selfie-culture reigning supreme and the growing trend of taking pictures of themselves by many visitors using smartphones, our occupation has taken a severe hit, rues Ravi. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our livelihoods, he deplored, adding that he purchased a horse from Hyderabad a couple of months ago to give his occupation a much-needed fillip. “I am eagerly waiting for life to get back to normal and the footfall of devotees to the temple town to increase,” he told The Hindu while taking an instant picture of a visitor sitting on the horse against the backdrop of the flood bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/unstoppable-lensman-does-not-let-covid-snatch-his-passion/article35643795.ece
31 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Peddi Reddy, Cong. leader from Huzurabad join TRS||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said on Friday that Telangana State has a great future as an economic power and leader in social empowerment in the country and the launch of the numerous schemes to benefit all segments was laying a development path worth emulating by all. Welcoming former Minister and BJP leader E. Peddi Reddy and Congress leader from Huzurabad Swargam Ravi into the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) here, he attributed the birth of several schemes to the deep study of the lives of sections that could not benefit from development in the past. “You need a heart to understand their plight and how they missed out,” the CM argued. Telangana has taken long strides in development in every sector and that was because of the social security assured to majority of people in the State. “No other State is implementing such schemes. The flow of investments and top-notch industries setting up their businesses here tell Telangana’s growth story,” he said. Reiterating that Dalit Bandhu would be implemented irrespective of the financial burden in a phased manner, he said that it would however, take sometime before the benefit is extended to all. He called upon other sections of people to whole-heartedly support the scheme given the suppression Dalits faced. He added that on the lines of Rythu Bima, the government has decided to implement Chenetha Bima for the welfare of weavers. The modalities are being finalised and it will start soon, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/peddi-reddy-cong-leader-from-huzurabad-join-trs/article35643789.ece
31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Trees chopped despite HC order||The Roads & Buildings department is going ahead with chopping of trees lining the Gandipet main road despite orders from the High Court to the contrary. On Wednesday, at least two trees of Peltophorum variety have been axed from the road margins, as per eyewitnesses. Already, about 50 trees have been felled, sources say. This is despite a voluntary organisation’s proactive offer to translocate all the trees scheduled for felling to facilitate road widening. Vata Foundation, an NGO, had approached the court seeking permission to relocate the trees marked for felling, and got a favourable order. But it is unable to proceed any further due to lack of approval from the department. As per details available, R&B department had sought permission in August 2020 to fell a total of 286 trees on both sides of the road, for carrying out a project to widen the road from double lane to eight lanes. Translocation ordered The matter was referred to the district-level tree protection committee under the provisions of WALTA Act, and after inspection of the site, the committee permitted felling of 244 trees, and ordered translocation of 42. Vata Foundation, engaged in voluntary translocation of trees, came forward to shift most of the trees marked for felling free of cost. With no response from the Roads and Buildings department, they approached the High Court. The court, while seeking a counter from the government, passed interim orders asking the R&B officials to consider the representation made by Vata Foundation and pass necessary orders within a week. Till such time, no trees are to be felled, the order said. Close to eight months have passed since the order, but the trees are yet to be translocated. “We conducted a joint inspection of the trees marked for felling on June 15, and I noticed that only 153 trees remained of the 244. About 30 to 40 trees were of Eucalyptus and Subabul species which we did not intend to save. Close to 50 trees which were to be saved had not been found on the ground. We submitted our requirements for translocating the remaining 153,” said Vata Foundation founder P. Uday Krishna. The Roads and Buildings department responded to Mr. Uday Krishna’s letter, giving permission to translocate the 42 trees which were to be translocated anyway as per the orders by the tree protection committee. “Our aim was to save the trees marked for felling by the committee. Instead, the department is looking to save funds on trees marked for translocation, which they are mandated to save. I have written pointing out the same, but there has not been any reply so far. Instead, they are going ahead with their chopping project, because they don’t want to displease the contractor,” Mr.Uday Krishna alleged. Attempts to reach the R&B officials concerned for their version had not yielded results till the time of going to press.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trees-chopped-despite-hc-order/article35643778.ece
31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||VP calls for stepping up COVID-19 vaccine supply||Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Friday has underscored the need for stepping up COVID vaccine supply rapidly and administering them to all citizens as quickly as possible to deal with the unforeseen challenges posed by the constantly mutating coronavirus. Since the Centre intended to vaccinate all the eligible adults by the year end, he was confident of the immunisation drive picking up pace in the months ahead and also urged the scientific fraternity to focus on expediting development of COVID vaccine for children. “Protecting children from the virus should be accorded priority,” he affirmed in his address to scientists and staff of Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) after a plant visit at Genome Valley here. Vaccination drive against COVID-19 should become a pan-India people’s movement and he appealed to the people to immunise themselves by taking the required vaccine doses. “There is no room for vaccine hesitancy. Everyone should get vaccinated as there is no other powerful way to protect ourselves and the people around us,” he said. Development of a nasal vaccine was an important initiative to reduce vaccine hesitancy and improve the ease of administering. Mr. Naidu said vaccination helps in preventing hospitalisation and severity even when infected so it was also up to the media and medical fraternity to educate people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and shed vaccine hesitancy. People should continue to adhere to masking, physical distancing and personal hygiene and not become complacent due to “temporary decline in cases”. Ramping up health infrastructure and ecosystem support should be expedited. Political parties, leaders and their followers should follow COVID-appropriate behaviour and “act responsibly as we cannot afford to invite the third wave”, he warned. The VP lauded scientists at BBIL for developing an effective indigenous Covaxin in record time by collaborating with Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology while specifically complimenting ‘optimism and dynamism’ of chairman and managing director Krishna Ella and joint managing director Suchitra Ella. The firm has delivered more than four billion doses of vaccines worldwide and has a product portfolio of more than 16 vaccines and four bio-therapeutics, including vaccines for Hepatitis-B, Influenza H1N1, Polio and Rotavirus, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/v-p-calls-for-stepping-up-covid-19-vaccine-supply/article35643749.ece
31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Park encroachment becomes communal hotspot||City Commissioner of Police received a rather strange request on Thursday. A colony welfare association from city has urged him to grant permission to construct B. R. Ambedkar’s statue, prayer hall, dargah, and other structures inside an island park, to satisfy all communities and faiths in the colony! The police may not act on this appeal from Bhagyanagar Colony Welfare Association of Nampally, as the authority to grant building permission lies with GHMC. But the letter points to years of apathy and neglect of duty by GHMC and the police under whose nose the park was encroached upon by a religious structure. Repeated complaints by the association could not remove the flagrant encroachment, which has now become the hotspot of political and communal tensions. The temple kept growing in size, gobbling up more and more of the open space earmarked in the colony constructed by the State Housing Board way back in 1974. With entry of the Goshamahal MLA Raja Singh, publicly challenging the residents as well as the police against touching the temple, the situation has assumed a political colour. Of late, preparations to install an idol inside the temple rekindled the tensions, prompting the association to write the said letter to the Police Commissioner. The idol was installed anyway amid police protection, while a few right wing political cadre were detained in a show of balance. “It all started in 2014, when a small structure was built overnight around a picture of goddess left at the base of the neem tree by some worshippers. We immediately alerted the police and district authorities about it, and a three-year bind-over order was given against a few persons responsible for the act,” recalled K. Srikanth Kumar, general secretary of the association. Trouble started brewing again in 2017 when a prefabricated marble temple was brought and installed overnight replacing the brick structure. Tiles were laid around the temple, and a temporary shed with metal barricades was created in similar fashion. Soon enough, a temple society was also registered in the name of ‘Sri Sri Bangaru Maisamma Devalayam’, and it also reportedly received grant from the Endowments department for festivals such as Bonalu and Bathukamma. “With backing from right wing political parties, people objecting to the temple are being silenced through fabricated cases and threatening gestures. Despite knowing the issue, police too are entertaining such cases,” said Avinash, an advocate and colony resident who approached High Court in 2018 about the issue. Court issued notices to the government, and posted the hearing to 2022. “Meanwhile, we are being questioned by other communities in the colony if they too can go ahead and construct their own structures. When we cannot stop one illegal act, we would be hand-tied against others too,” said Mr.Srikanth. Mr.Raja Singh, through a video clip, justified the encroachment saying that most colony residents belonged to the majority religion, and the temple had been there for a long time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/park-encroachment-becomes-communal-hotspot/article35643774.ece
31 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Thimmarusu’ movie review: Satya Dev sparkles in this legal thriller||Remakes are tricky in a digital age where many movie enthusiasts are likely to have watched the original film. Unless a writer-director recreates the story to appeal to the sensibilities of viewers in a different region, the remake can end up being a pale shadow of the original. Thimmarusu is a remake of the Kannada film Birbal (2019). Director Sharan Koppisetty stays true to the original story by M G Srinivas and cuts the flab to present an engaging film. The film’s draw, apart from a reasonably cerebral story, is the presence of actor Satya Dev who plays a smart lawyer named Ramachandra with swag. The swag is an essential component of Thimmarusu . It could have easily become an overtly emotional narrative where a wrongly accused character looks up to the hero to be his saviour. The wronged youngster, Vasu (Ankith Koyya), isn’t a weepy pushover. He has the angst of someone who has been framed and punished and Ramachandra has to work to gain his trust. The opening act details the happenings on a rainy night in 2011 when a cab driver, who is also a police informer, is brutally murdered. Vasu who is passing by and informs the police, is framed and sentenced. Eight years later, Ramachandra re-opens this case when the cash-rich legal firm he works for decides to take up a few cases free of cost for those who cannot afford legal services. Helping Ramachandra crack the investigation are Anu (Priyanka Jawalkar) and Sudhakar (Brahmaji). The final reveal doesn’t come as a big surprise. But the situations leading to it keep us invested. Satya Dev does a fine balancing act in portraying a cerebral hero who can also handle the masala segments without looking out of place.

31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||MIDHANI’s new plants to make bulletproof vests||Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited (MIDHANI), the specialised metals and metal alloys manufacturing public sector undertaking under Ministry of Defence, is getting ready to fully commission two new production facilities, including the Rs. 550-crore special steel, titanium and nickel alloy sheet and plate-making plant at Kanchanbagh here. In the second Rs. 60-crore plant at Rohtak (Haryana), it will be making a maiden foray into making bullet-proof vests and armoured personal vehicles for the armed forces, disclosed Chairman and Managing Director S.K. Jha on Friday. “Both facilities will be commissioned in the next few months. In fact, even as the Rohtak plant is under construction, we have delivered about 20 armoured vehicles for BSF on an urgent request in view of the face-off at the China border,” he said, in an exclusive interaction. The PSU is assuring armour bullet-proof plating or even making it mine-proof without affecting the overall vehicle performance for any chassis sourced by the end user with capacity to make up to 25-30 vehicles a year. After scouting for a technology partner in vain, it has taken the support of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) for bullet-proof vests to make 30,000 units annually, to be scaled to 50,000 units. “Demand is for one lakh bullet-proof vests in the country. Though in defence area, this is a complete diversification. We are going to harp on good quality and reliability to the end user,” said Dr. Jha, who took charge last May. Unique projects It was able to meet COVID pandemic challenges ensuring there was no slack in production, in commissioning ‘unique’ projects to meet the needs of strategic sectors like defence, aerospace and nuclear power even while strengthening indigenous efforts as part of ‘Atmanirbhar’ policy. Last year’s lockdown did cause some loss and decline in sales in the first quarter but the period also enabled the personnel to come up with innovative solutions towards production of high grade alloys and composite material. Vaccination for entire staff and safety protocols are in place, he said. Space project MIDHANI has supplied steel and cobalt alloy material to ISRO human flight ‘Gaganyan’ mission, titanium alloy metal for HAL-AMCA (Advanced Multi-Combat Aircraft) and light weight nickel-titanium engine for the unmanned aerial vehicles engine in collaboration with DRDO. Other ‘novel’ works were in production of indigenous RHA steel used for missiles development replacing expensive imported special impeller blades for uranium mining replacing German-made with the first assembly set to be tried out at Kadapa mines and steam generators, earlier imported from Europe, for new nuclear plants in association with NFC for BHEL. New defence procurement policy with mandatory clause of sourcing for special metals from within the country augers well for the firm. MIDHANI is aiming to double turnover of current Rs. 800 crore within the next five years with 15-20% growth, even as the third greenfield project of developing composite material with HAL (Tumkur near Bengaluru), could take off with detailed project report under preparation, added the CMD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/midhanis-new-plants-to-make-bulletproof-vests/article35643764.ece

(SCCL) to commence mining of coal this financial year in the Naini project allotted to it in Odisha have gone a step ahead with the 783.275 hectares of forest land getting Stage-1 clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). Based on the proposal sent by the Odisha government, the MoEF has given the first-stage forest approval to the project. The land allotted to SCCL in the Naini block includes 643.095 hectares of reserved forest land and 140.18 hectares of village forest land in Chendipada and Kunkurupa villages of the Angul forest division. The first-stage forest clearance orders were received by the Forest Department of Odisha. The land would be transferred to SCCL once the second-stage forest clearance is accorded. The total land allotted to SCCL in the Naini block is 912.799 hectares but 738.275 hectares of it is forest land. Management of SCCL has taken up Naini as a prestigious project and has been pursuing with the Central agencies concerned on a regular basis for speedy clearances. According to SCCL officials, all documents, which were sought by the expert appraisal committee of MoEF on environmental clearance at its May 25 meeting, were submitted after it was deferred seeking additional information. The project area has 378.64 million tonnes of mineable coal reserves including 340.78 million tonnes extractable in the opencast method and rest in the underground mining method. The company plans to extract 10 million tonnes of coal per annum from the Naini project that costs Rs. 494.3 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sccl-plan-in-odisha-gets-first-forest-nod/article35643781.ece
31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||PIL plea challenges Dalit Bandhu||A PIL petition challenging implementation of State government’s flagship programme Dalit Bandhu in Huzurabad Assembly constituency, where by-election is to be held anytime soon, was filed in the Telangana High Court. The plea filed by social activist Akkala Suresh Kumar with the State government, Election Commission of India, Telangana Chief Electoral Officer and ruling TRS is likely to come up for hearing on Monday. The petitioner sought a direction to the government to enforce the scheme in any of the 16 Assembly constituencies reserved for SCs in the State, instead of Huzurabad which is an open Assembly seat. Though specific dates were not announced, by-election in Huzurabad was required as MLA Eatala Rajender, who got elected on TRS ticket in 2018, resigned from the post after being dropped from the State Cabinet. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced the Dalit Bandhu scheme to be enforced in this constituency as a pilot project. The petitioner mentioned that the CM, during a recent speech, had stated that TRS was not a monastery of monks, suggesting that there was nothing wrong in proposing such a scheme in the backdrop of elections. “We are living among people and will definitely look for political gains in whatever we do…,” the CM was quoted as saying by the petitioner. This showed that TRS wanted to use government schemes to derive political mileage in Huzurabad by-election, the petitioner said. He contended that the ECI had to fix a minimum time, preferably six months, for implementation of such schemes to ensure free and fair election. He referred to the case of S. Subramaniam Balaji vs State of TN and others in which the Supreme Court ordered that guidelines should be framed for political parties to announce freebies before elections. In another case too, the apex court wanted the government to declare guidelines on the matter. Taking advantage of the government not fixing any guidelines, the TRS had planned Dalit Bandhu envisaging financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakh to each eligible Dalit family to influence voters, the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pil-plea-challenges-dalit-bandhu-in-huzurabad/article35643786.ece
31 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Of civil petitions and unauthorised constructions||Unscrupulous individuals, in connivance with the officers of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), were misusing the process of the court to erect illegal structures in the State capital, said Justice Challa Kodandaram of Telangana High Court. Passing orders in a contempt of court petition involving allegations about unauthorised constructions by two private persons and inaction by the authorities, the judge placed the matter before the First Court led by Chief Justice Hima Kohli for further action. When the civic body officials issue demolition notices to builders or individuals over illegally constructed buildings, the latter were filing suits against the GHMC before courts of junior or senior civil judges. Interim orders The builders or individuals were obtaining ex parte interim orders. In some cases, they were getting notices issued in the suits. Citing the notices issued by the court and the pendency of civil suits, they get the demolition stopped, the judge explained in the order. After filing written statements in such suits at a belated stage, these persons were withdrawing the suits or ensuring they were dismissed for default. “During this period, when suits are pending, construction is being completed in connivance with the field officers,” Justice Challa Kodandaram said in his order. Ultimately, the suit gets closed either for default or due to withdrawal by the petitioner. But the “constructions remain intact...serving the purpose of which the suit was filed”, he stated. Circle 16 In circle No. 16 of Amberpet alone, 189 such suits were filed in five years. There are 30 such circles in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation . If the number of such suits was multiplied by 30, the massiveness of the problem can be understood, the judge remarked. “The fact that in a single circle 189 suits were filed in five years, discloses the malady,” he said, adding that this “required to be addressed in a serious manner”. He recalled that the High Court’s division bench had already cautioned the civil courts against passing any orders in civil suits relating to illegal constructions. Yet “the system continues to be misused throwing a challenge to the judicial system,” he noted in the order. This was resulting in “creation of a feeling among general public that the courts permit illegal constructions”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/of-civil-petitions-and-unauthorised-constructions/article35643766.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao will soon launch Nethanna Bima, the insurance scheme for weavers, Industries and IT Minister K. T. Rama Rao said in Sircilla on Friday.

31 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Telugu classic ‘Saptapadi’ turns 40||As a demure young girl who lets her eyes speak but is a livewire while dancing, Sabitha Bhamidipati captured the imagination of the audience in the role of a classical dancer Hema in K Vishwanath’s Saptapadi . That she’s called a one-film-wonder does not bother her; Sabitha actually considers it a badge of honour. “If I am remembered 40 years after the film, it is a privilege and I cherish the recognition I received for that one film.” Close on the heels of the Telugu magnum opus Sankarabharanam in 1980, director K Viswanath came up with Saptapadi in 1981; a film that yet again dealt with classical dance, traditions and customs, but went a step ahead to depict a climax that generated a debate among traditionalists. Set in picturesque Amaravati on the banks of Krishna river in AP, Saptapadi had director K Viswanath’s hallmark traits in every scene, characterisation, music and a message. Sabitha plays a dancer, who despite her love for a Dalit flautist from their troupe, accepts her grandfather Yajulu’s (J V Somayajulu) decision and marries her cousin. Yajulu, a revered high priest of the temple, realises his mistake after the groom refuses to conjugate his marriage because he sees the Goddess in his wife. Braving protests from villagers, Yajulu lets Hema leave with her lover. For the convent-educated, city-bred Sabitha, playing the role of a submissive girl posed no challenge; she says she is one of those girls “who always obeyed parents and believed they knew best”. To a certain extent, Sabitha relates to Hema’ character: “My world was the school, dance classes and a few friends. I had my dance teacher for a mentor and parents for guidance. Hema is also like that, she doesn’t even consider the option of saying no to elders.” Recalling how she landed the role, Sabitha says it was her dance teacher the late Uma Ramarao who sent her photos to K Viswanath. Thereafter, she was called for a photo shoot along with hero Girish and got selected. “It came as a surprise. My only aim was to be a good dancer and have a few pictures taken in a dance costume. So out of the blue, my teacher asked me to give my photos. Soon after Sankarabharanam , a renewed interest in classical arts saw a rise in filmmakers and actors wanting to be part of that genre. “I was told that many classical dancers and leading heroines wanted to work in Saptapadi . I am happy that I was chosen to play the main role eventually.” Seshu master choreographed her dances played Sabitha’s father in the film. The song ‘Nemaliki nerpina nadakalivi...’ was such a rage that dancers would perform that number on various platforms. The success of Saptapadi brought more film offers to Sabitha who did not accept any of them. “My parents were apprehensive about letting me continue in the industry; they were not sure if I would succeed. No regrets now.” Post Saptapadi , Sabitha enrolled in Vempati Chinna Satyam’s Kuchipudi school in Chennai and went on to give several performances. She fiinished graduation in Computer Science. However, her performances were put on hold after marriage and the birth of her son and twin daughters. “Till 15 years ago I was performing but wanted to devote more time to my children, so I put my dancing on hold and shifted to a software job.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telugu-classic-saptapadi-turns-40/article35643776.ece

31 July 2021||Palampet,TELANGANA||Village hopes UNESCO tag for temple brings tailwind||A mini-bus with an Andhra Pradesh number plate is stopped by the police just outside the Ramappa Temple for a check while a dusty car with a Karnataka number plate zips to the parking lot. A day earlier, about a dozen young girls and women from Kakinada arrived on a hired bus to see the newly-anointed World Heritage Site. Inside the Ramappa temple, men and women gawk around in astonishment, touch the smooth stone sculptures, pray intently and speak in dozen different languages. Outside the disused eastern entrance, a family has brought in a tractor and the priest struggles to crack open the ash gourd to complete the puja . On the surface, nothing has changed. But the small village of Palampet is abuzz with the conversation of UNESCO World Heritage Tag. Crews of journalists have stationed themselves in the village and have spoken to the farmer, the priest, the grizzly-old peanut seller at the western entrance, and any other person willing to talk. “We used to have pucca shops here. To get the UNESCO tag, they demolished our 20-year-old shops two years ago. Then COVID-19 struck, shutting down our livelihood. Hopefully now, our business will improve and we can get back to normal life,” says Raghu Raju, a shopkeeper who stocks everything from bangles to toys. “Tourists used to come only occasionally, and children from schools and colleges were our biggest business. But the pandemic has closed that avenue. Sadly, people who come to pray don’t buy anything,” says Mr. Raju, who lives in Palampet and comes in the morning to open his shop. Earlier, families used to live and sell goods outside the western entrance, but demolitions to clean up the area and create parking spaces mean that the village life has been disrupted. “Don’t photograph God. It is prohibited,” says an Archaeological Survey of India official at the site as a woman nods and proceeds to video-call her family from inside the main temple. The temple is usually not crowded on Wednesdays; people mainly come during the weekends and on festivals. The main festivals include Maha Sivaratri, Girija Kalyanam and Ekadasi. “On an average, we used to get 300 to 500 people daily. The number goes up to a few thousands on weekends. The biggest rush is on Sivaratri when more than 30,000 people turn up to pray during abhishekham,” says the ASI official. Outside the temple, while people admire the sculptures and the skill of craftsmen, newer stories are being created. “The Kakatiyas had contact with Egyptians. You can see the sculpture of a Pharaoh here,” says a TV announcer pointing to a soldier holding a square battle shield. It doesn’t matter that the Kakatiyas ruled in the 12th and 13th century.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/village-hopes-unesco-tag-for-temple-brings-tailwind/article35643754.ece
31 July 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Labour charge worries farmers||K. Sangameswar is a farmer from Muslapur in Alladurg mandal of Medak district. He has about two acres of land. To remove the weed in his farm, Mr Sangameswar was forced to pay Rs. 800 per day, whereas for the same they used to pay Rs. 400 per day in the past season. In areas like Kishtareddypet and Sultanpur in Sangareddy, farmers are paying Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,000 per day, depending on the day’s demand. This situation prevailed at many places in the erstwhile Medak district last week. Scarcity of farm hands was stated to be the reason for hike in charges. This was observed more where transplantation of paddy is taking place. Farmers say that they need at least 10 labourers to transplant on an acre of land which comes to an expenditure Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 10,000. Labourers are being hired from places wherever they are available. This is adding to the cost as the farmers were forced to pay the transport expenditure as well. Even hiring tractors for farm work has become costlier as petrol price has increased. It was stated that tractor owners were charging about Rs. 1,800 per acre whereas in the past it was around Rs. 1,200 per acre. “Labour charges are normal at places like Atmakur where farm hands are sufficiently available,” said Mallikarjun, a farmer from Atmakur. “In the last summer, we offered Rs. 5,000 for transplantation of paddy per acre. Now they are asking for Rs. 6,000 per acre stating that in the neighbouring village same amount is being offered. The demand is changing from village to to village. Paddy was sown on about five acres and the payment was still pending. I told the labour I will give what others in the village pay,” said Malla Reddy, another farmer from Shivampet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/labour-charge-worries-farmers/article35644039.ece

31 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC notice to Delhi govt. on delay in registering Muslim marriages||The Delhi High Court on Friday issued notice to the Delhi government on a petition alleging that Muslim marriages were being registered under the Special Marriage Act (SMA) and not under the Compulsory Marriage Order where marriages are registered immediately. Justice Rekha Palli gave three weeks’ time to the Delhi government to respond to the petition collectively moved by an NGO, Dhanak for Humanity, and a man from Uttar Pradesh. Parents’ opposition The man said both he and his girl friend practice Islam, but had left their home town to solemnise their marriage in Delhi as their parents were opposed to their relationship. He said despite their marriage under the Muslim marriage rites and ceremonies, they were not given the option by the Delhi government to register the same under the Compulsory Marriage Order. The man submitted that the practice of registering Muslim marriage under the Special Marriage Act requires 30 days’ notice period which is a very cumbersome process for the applicant who came from another State. The plea said the couple were in hiding and had sought refuge in the NGO’s office in Delhi. It said several of their family members are residing in Delhi and hence they feared getting caught during the process of registering their marriage. All marriages done under the Special Marriage Act require publication of the names of the couple for inviting objections from the public for 30 days. Within this period, anyone can object to the marriage on the ground that it would contravene one or more of the conditions specified under the Act. “Under the Compulsory Registration Marriage Order, the marriages are registered immediately and without any delay or notice. It is submitted that for the registration of marriages solemnised under the Muslim marriage rites and ceremonies, the respondent no.1 (Delhi Govt.) has not given the option to register the marriage under the Compulsory Marriage Order,” the petition said. The plea also argued that the exclusion violated the fundamental rights of the parties. ‘Right to live’ “Petitioner 2 has right to live which has been threatened and curtailed and respondents should protect the same by registering the marriage immediately,” the petition said. The High Court will hear the case next on October 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-notice-to-delhi-govt-on-delay-in-registering-muslim-marriages/article35643650.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Five people arrested for running fake call centre||Five people, including a woman, were arrested for allegedly running an illegal call centre and duping citizens of foreign countries by impersonating themselves as representatives of a tech support company in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, the police said on Friday. The owner of the call centre, Pritpal Singh (35), and his associates Mayank (26), Chandan Gupta (24), Subham Kumar (22), and HR head Kinkini Das (35) were operating from the third floor of a building in Panchsheel Vihar, they said. Based on a tip off, the police conducted a raid at the illegal call centre on Thursday and arrested the accused. They were allegedly targeting foreign citizens, mainly from the USA, on the pretext of giving them tech support saying their systems were under a cyber threat, the police said. High-end software Subham and Chandan were junior callers while Mayank was a senior caller. They had been working here for the last seven months and had been calling up customers using high-end technical software “X-lite/ Eye Beam” through cloud servers. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “The accused approached USA-based customers using “X-lite/ Eye Beam” and duped them on the pretext of providing them tech support if they paid a fee of US $100 to US $400. They asked the customer to provide the amount through various payments methods or payment wallets.” “They were taking wrongful gain as they would first send a pop-up message or bug to the customer after obtaining their data from cloud servers, then say that their system has been attacked by a cyber threat and later ask them to obtain support from them to technically eradicate the pop-up bug or cyber threat from their systems,” he said. The police claimed to have recovered 13 computer systems with two pen drives and two note books from the call centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/five-people-arrested-for-running-fake-call-centre/article35643648.ece

31 July 2021||Islamabad,||Pak, U.S. NSAs discuss Afghan settlement||Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf met with his American counterpart Jake Sullivan in Washington, during which the two leaders discussed the urgent need for reduction in violence and a “negotiated” political settlement in Afghanistan. The talks also covered other issues of mutual interest, the Dawn News reported on Friday. This was the second meeting between the two leaders who first met in Geneva in March. “Had a positive follow-up meeting with NSA Jake Sullivan today in Washington,” Mr. Yusuf tweeted in an early morning tweet. “Took stock of progress made since our Geneva meeting and discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest,” he said, adding that the two sides “agreed to sustain the momentum in Pak-U.S. bilateral cooperation”. Though Mr. Yusuf did not mention Afghanistan among the issues discussed in the meeting, Mr. Sullivan devoted half of his tweet to the Afghan issue. “I met with Pakistan’s NSA today to consult on regional connectivity and security, and other areas of mutual cooperation. We discussed the urgent need for a reduction in violence in Afghanistan and a negotiated political settlement to the conflict,” Mr. Sullivan said. Since the announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. forces by August 31, violence has been rising in Afghanistan and efforts to broker a peace settlement between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban have slowed. Mr. Blinken, who returned to Washington on Thursday evening after a visit to India and Kuwait, had said during the tour that Pakistan has “a vital role to play in using its influence with the Taliban to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by force”. Diplomatic influence Committed to withdrawing all U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) troops from Afghanistan by September 15, the Biden administration is now using its diplomatic influence to prevent a Taliban takeover and that’s where it sees a role for Pakistan, according to the Dawn report. While Pakistan also wants to prevent a military takeover in Kabul, Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview to an American channel this week said that the U.S. decision to set a timetable for withdrawing troops had narrowed Islamabad’s options. Mr. Khan, on PBS NewsHour, indicated that the Taliban see the withdrawal as their victory and are less receptive to reconciliation efforts than they would have been had the timetable not been announced. Mr. Khan also criticised the U.S. for trying to “look for a military solution in Afghanistan, when there never was one”. The Pakistani delegation, which arrived in Washington three days ago, is also busy explaining its position in meetings with senior U.S. officials, lawmakers, experts and media representatives. It is not clear if Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt. Gen Faiz Hameed, who is also in Washington for the talks, attended the meeting between the two NSAs, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-us-nsas-discuss-afghan-settlement/article35643143.ece
31 July 2021||Washington,||200 Afghan interpreters arrive in U.S.||The first flight carrying Afghans who worked as interpreters for American troops and diplomats has arrived in the U.S., President Joe Biden said on Friday, the start of an operation to evacuate thousands from possible Taliban retaliation. Around 20,000 Afghans worked for the U.S. following the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and have applied for evacuation under the State Department’s Special Immigrant Visas program. Some estimates suggest the total number of prospective evacuees under what has been dubbed “Operation Allies Refuge” could be as high as 1,00,000 once relatives are included. Many of them fear retaliation from the Taliban, which has secured a vast swath of the country since foreign troops began the last stage of a withdrawal due to be complete by late August. “Today is an important milestone as we continue to fulfill our promise to the thousands of Afghan nationals who served shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops and diplomats over the last 20 years in Afghanistan,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. He added that the administration was working to quickly relocate visa-eligible Afghans “out of harm’s way.” Mr. Biden said these first arrivals had already completed extensive background checks and security screenings and would undergo medical checks and other processing in Fort Lee, Virginia before being resettled across the country. This first flight of around 200 Afghans is part of a broader group of about 2,500 who are furthest along in the visa process and who are being prioritised for relocation to the U.S. in the coming weeks, according to Russ Travers, an official on the White House National Security Council. “They now join the over 70,000 Afghans who have received (Special Immigrant Visas) and started new lives in the US since 2008,” Mr. Travers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/200-afghan-interpreters-arrive-in-us/article35643146.ece
31 July 2021||Washington,||Delta variant as contagious as chicken pox: CDC document||The Delta variant of the coronavirus is as contagious as chickenpox, probably causes more severe disease than past strains, and breakthrough cases in vaccinated individuals may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases, according to a leaked U.S. government document. The slide presentation produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stresses that “the war has changed” as a result of Delta. It was first reported by The Washington Post . CDC director Rochelle Walenksy cited data from the presentation this week to justify a return to masks for vaccinated people in high-risk areas. One of the biggest takeaways is the finding that breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are highly contagious, with the data coming from previous studies and a new analysis of an outbreak in Provincetown. Experts rely on a number called the cycle threshold (Ct) value to indicate how much virus an infected person harbours, with lower numbers indicating higher viral load. In Provincetown, there was “no difference in mean Ct values in vaccinated and unvaccinated cases,” the slides said. A review of findings from other countries shows that each person with Delta infects on average eight others, making it as transmissible as chickenpox but still less than measles. Vaccine efficacy estimates vary across countries, but in its concluding slide, the CDC estimates the risk of severe disease or death is reduced 10-fold or greater in the vaccinated, while risk of infection is reduced three-fold or greater.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/delta-variant-as-contagious-as-chicken-pox-cdc-document/article35643454.ece
31 July 2021||Ramat Gan,||Israel launches booster dose for those above 60||Israel launched a campaign on Friday to give people aged over 60 coronavirus booster shots, at a time when the rest of the world is still struggling to complete the standard course. Kicking off the campaign, President Isaac Herzog, 60, received a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a hospital in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. “We are beginning the booster vaccination” so that life in Israel can return to “normal” as soon as possible, Mr. Herzog said after getting the injection. “With this new step of the Israeli government... I believe that it’s also a lesson to the entire humankind that we have to protect each other and take the necessary steps.” An Israeli epidemiologist of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, Hagai Levine, acknowledged his country was going it alone with third shots, which have yet to be approved in the U.S. or EU. “This decision is based on experts’ opinion, on logic but not on solid scientific evidence, but that is okay,” Mr. Levine said. “In public health and in medicine, you sometime make a decision based on your experience and reason.” Israel was quick to roll out its vaccination campaign and had dropped many restrictions on public gatherings in June, as new COVID-19 cases shrank from 10,000 a day to less than 100. About 55% of its nine million population has been double vaccinated, most with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. About one million Israelis eligible for the shot, however, still refuse to be vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-launches-booster-dose-for-those-above-60/article35643141.ece

The flotilla has entered the disputed South China Sea after exercises with Asian allies. It is led by the new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , and comprises other Royal Navy vessels plus U.S. and Dutch warships. In an editorial, the nationalist state-run newspaper Global Times warned U.S. allies China might feel compelled to send a message to defend “its sovereignty and territorial integrity”. “Just as a popular Chinese phrase indicates: To execute one as a warning to a hundred,” it said. Addressing the U.K. and allied strike force specifically, it said: “We seriously warn this group: They are obliged to remain restrained and obey the rules. “Please follow the current international shipping lanes and stay at least 12 nautical miles away from the Chinese islands and reefs.” “The carrier strike group is lawfully navigating the South China Sea, just as one-third of global shipping does on an annual basis,” a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said. “It is taking the most direct route through international waters...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/navy-carrier-on-course-in-south-china-sea-uk/article35643144.ece

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Lights dim for roving troupes||Many men in Manikpur spend seven-nine months of an Assamese year on the road. A large village in Assam’s Bongaigaon district, about 185 km west of Guwahati, Manikpur has for decades been the ‘setting’ source of several Bhramyoman groups. The Assamese year of 365 days starts mid-April of a Gregorian calendar. Bhramyoman translates into mobile theatre and ‘setting’ entails a range of activities from putting up tents to decorating the stage. A travelling theatre group of an average of 150 persons has 55-60 stage workers engaged in settings. About five months ago, more than 30 stage workers boarded a bus in Manikpur. “This would have been routine had the bus not been sent by a Kerala-based firm that offered them jobs,” says Abhijit Bhattacharya, a playwright associated with mobile theatres for 22 years. About one-fourth of some 4,000 stage workers and technicians employed directly by at least 30 Bhramyomans have left Assam for jobs or in search of greener pastures after the first COVID-19 wave eased by October 2020. Most of those who stayed back, primarily because of age and because they had not picked up any other skill, have been struggling to sustain their families. Gunajit Das, who played multiple musical instruments for 30 years, has switched to vending fish on a bicycle after selling vegetables that did not earn him enough for his family of five. Fellow musician Prabhat Roy, who spent 35 years with mobile theatre groups, has become a ‘ jogali ’ (helper) to a mason. Pratap Boro, who played the violin, mandolin and flute for 32 years, has opened a small pan shop. Stage craftsman Lohit Pathak earns whenever people need his service for cutting or filling up earth. The situation is similar for theatre troupe cooks Dharma Roy and Dilip Das. Setting specialist Remsing Teron wields an axe to sell firewood. All of them are from districts across Assam: Bajali, Baksa, Barpeta and Nalbari. The more resourceful have managed to stay afloat. Music director Jatin Pathak of Manikpur turned his attention to his agricultural land to become an organic farmer. He commands a good price for his produce. “Many of us never thought beyond theatre. The lockdown taught me to have a backup plan,” he says. Popular actor and playwright Champak Sarma opened a restaurant in Guwahati’s Gorchuk. “The new business has not been profitable with the restrictions in place but I hope to see better days for the restaurant as well as for mobile theatre,” he says. Two of his plays – Danab (Demon) for the Itihash Theatre group and Draupadir Bastraharan (Draupadi’s Disrobing) for the Kohinoor Theatre group – were among the last to be staged before the 2019-2020 mobile theatre season ended prematurely in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Struck by a virus Pathsala, about 80 km east of Bongaigaon, is perhaps the only town that “prospered” post-lockdown in 2020. In August that year, it became the headquarters of Bajali, Assam’s 34th district carved out of Barpeta. Prior to the administrative upgrade, Pathsala was known primarily as the hub of Assam’s mobile theatre. It was here that Achyut Lahkar, a pioneering dramatist, actor, director and producer, founded the Nataraj Theatre, the first of the Bhramyomans in 1963. He was inspired by the Jatra, a popular folk theatre form of Bengal, but tailored his theatrical presentations to local specifications and tastes besides adopting a unique business model. He let a local committee in Pathsala publicise his plays, organise the shows and take a share of the profit in return. All the 132 mobile theatre groups – at least 32 of them remain – born after Nataraj have followed this cooperative business model based on informal agreements. Nataraj Theatre folded up after the death of Achyut Lahkar, revered as the father of the Bhramyoman, in 2016. A stone’s throw from Achyut Lahkar’s house is the complex that his relative Ratan Lahkar constructed in Jyotinagar, a locality in Pathsala near the landmark Bhattadev University. Ratan Lahkar, who died in 2017, founded the Kohinoor Theatre in 1976 after several groups tried to do a Nataraj only to fade away. Kohinoor’s co-founder Krishna Roy broke away to form the Abahan Theatre in 1978 but sold it to popular Assamese cinema and theatre actor Prastuti Parashar a few years ago. Kohinoor brought in the element of special effects with Mahabharat , a costume drama that took the audience by storm in 1984 with cinematic fight sequences. It shot to international fame by adapting Titanic in 1998, using indigenous special effects to turn and sink the ill-fated luxury ship on stage. In 2010, Kohinoor became the first Assamese mobile theatre group to stage three plays at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts at the invitation of the National School of Drama in New Delhi. Apart from plays, the troupe presented special effects scenes in the Titanic and Dinosaur , a play based on Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. Kohinoor soared as the Titanic sank in more than 200 shows during the 1998-99 season. The Bhramyoman season starts mid-July. Two months go into readying three plays and rehearsing with the actors, dancers and musicians. The shows start around Vishwakarma Puja (mostly September 17) and end on the eve of Bohag or Rongali Bihu (usually April 13). Each troupe sets up its temporary stage and hall for three nights each at 75-80 places, ending a season without breaks even if there are natural calamities or political disturbances, with 210-235 shows. “Mobile theatres have withstood many a challenge. Often, our theatrical adaptations became more popular than the films they were adapted from. The travelling theatres thrived as the Assamese film industry suffered. We held our own against all other forms of entertainment – cinema, television and even digital. But an invisible virus has deflated us,” says Tapan Lahkar who took over charge of Kohinoor from his father. Kohinoor lost about Rs. 15 lakh when shows were cancelled for 12 days during the violence that erupted against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019. Most Bhramyomans thought it was a temporary setback like the two-month hiatus in 1983 at the peak of the anti-foreigner Assam Agitation. The mobile theatres overcame the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom’s threat in 2007 to stop them from destroying Assamese culture with “Bollywood-inspired stories” and the counter-insurgency operations in the 1990s when security forces discouraged people from venturing out at night. The mobile theatres have traditionally been staged at night with the last show at 5 a.m. Mapping the route Representatives of the All-Assam Mobile Theatre Producers’ Association headed by Bordoisila Theatre owner Nazrul Islam met Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over a fortnight ago for restarting the show to bail out of poverty hundreds of people associated with the industry. The association has so far recognised 22 theatre groups, the criteria for membership being at least two consecutive years of sustainable operation. There are about 10 non-member groups that have a small budget and operate mostly in villages within a district or two unlike the big-budget groups that perform across Assam and beyond. “If we can start the 2021-22 season in October even with 500-600 viewers compared to the normal 1,500-2,000, we may be able to stay afloat. The government said it will ramp up the vaccination drive. This will facilitate a sizeable audience for the mobile theatres. If the situation does not improve, it could be very tough for theatre groups to be revived later,” Tapan Lahkar says. The glimmer of hope has made the likes of Lankeswar Barman, the manager of Kohinoor Theatre, fish out the seasonal travel map. “Our travel route is planned around where our group will perform on Shasthi (sixth day of the 10-day Durga Puja, usually in October). Our performance calendar is fixed as and when we ink an agreement with a local organising committee. Experience is needed to juggle with the dates of more than 70 organising committees every season and plan the routes so that we don’t end up travelling 100-150 km in different directions,” he says. Each travel theatre has two sets of “skeletons” — bamboos, wooden planks, iron frames, etc. — of a 130x90 ft temporary hall inclusive of a two-in-one stage. The route is planned in such a way that the stage workers travel the least on the night of the third and final day of the shows from place A to set up the theatre in place B in time for the first show there. The last stop of a group is invariably a place 15-20 km from its base. Important for the rural economy The survival of the mobile theatres is crucial not only for the groups but also the rural economy, says Suresh Ranjan Goduka, a mass communication design researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati. He had done a project on the Bhramyoman-driven economy more than a decade ago. “Mobile theatres work on two payment systems – a nine-month contract and lump sum. In the first category are the star actors mostly from cinema and TV and the general character actors, dancers, members of the orchestra, sound arrangers, background voice artists, make-up artists, costume designers, tent and stage workers, lighting technicians, set designers, transporters, managers and up to eight cooks for the entire travelling team. On lump sum pay are the directors, choreographers, music directors, art directors, playwrights and lyricists,” he says. There are also graphic designers and printers, who have been deprived of their “assured” seasonal income from the theatre groups since the 2020 lockdown. “Before the pandemic, the annual turnover of the Bhramyomans averaged Rs. 25 crore with the major groups investing about Rs. 2 crore. Some attracted corporate sponsorship. More importantly, Bhramyomans stimulate various indirect economic activities by contributing to the local economy with seasonal employment and community contribution. Numerous namghars (Vaishnav prayer halls), libraries, voluntary associations and schools have been built all across Assam and mostly in rural and semi-urban areas as a result of the profit-sharing between the theatre troupes and the host committees,” Goduka says. A local committee negotiates the deal with a theatre group ahead of the season and pays an advance ranging from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1.5 lakh. The advance is adjusted with a fixed amount per first show per night to be paid to a theatre group. The organising committee takes 30%-40% of the money collected from the second show and gives the rest to a group. The collection from the third show – in the case of smash-hit plays – is shared 50:50. “Whether or not a committee profits from the first show, it has to pay us the fixed amount according to that agreement. Besides, a committee takes care of the accommodation of the troupe members, provides a kitchen and firewood. We spend on transportation and food,” says Subodh Majumdar, producer of Theatre Bhagyadevi based in Nalbari district’s Morowa. Founded by his father Sarat Majumdar in 1976, this group had made a passenger aircraft take off in the play Hijack , based on the 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The way forward Kalpajit Hazarika, producer of the Jorhat-based Hengul Theatre believes staging a comeback would be an uphill task. One reason is the damage of acoustic and other equipment and tent and stage materials because of non-use over a long period of time. “Starting afresh needs an investment of Rs. 40-45 lakh, and we are not sure of recovering the cost because of the prevailing uncertainty. More importantly, the issue is to get experienced technicians, many of whom have gone out for jobs,” he says. Synchronising a play on a double stage is a special skill set not many can handle. The scenes move from one stage to the other like a fast change of frame in a film. Some groups have taken strength from Gitashree Theatre, a small budget group based in Morigaon. Gitashree was the only group to stage some plays adhering to guidelines such as physical distancing and providing hand sanitisers to the viewers for a few months before the second COVID-19 wave struck. “The emotional attachment with and popularity of Bhramyoman should see us through a difficult phase. But it will be easier for smaller groups with a minimal budget to rebound compared to the major groups which have more to lose because of the volume of investment,” Abahan’s Parashar says. Bhagyadevi’s Majumdar is apprehensive of how the audience will react after the gap. “We are not sure how the country’s economy has impacted them, whether they can afford spending on a non-essential mode of entertainment and whether the younger generations will get over their addiction to their smartphones,” he says. He has already begun thinking in terms of leaving the theatre business if the “age of social distancing” does not give way to “social gathering” that the Bhramyomans depend on. “I sold off three trucks and have started undertaking local contractual assignments to fall back upon,” he says. Jiten Das, a dancer-choreographer for 18 years, has joined him as an employee for contractual jobs. “This is better than going out with a spade and shovel in search of work back home in Poritopa Thutikata village (Nalbari district),” he says. According to Tapan Lahkar, the mobile theatres began feeling the pinch with producers competing to add glamour to their plays. It began with Assamese film star Jatin Bora in 2005-06, who ended up earning six-seven times more from the theatre than from movies. The budgets subsequently became bigger as producers broke a tradition by bringing film effects specialists from elsewhere to execute plays that turned Bora into a dwarf or a fat blob on stage. The oneupmanship saw another actor, Mridul Chutia, playing triple roles – a dwarf, a person of normal height and an abnormally tall man – for another group. “Quality suffered as producers relied more on gimmicks, masala, glamour and double entendre,” he says. Bhattacharya says there are very few playwrights who can maintain both quality and quantity, who can race against time, and gauge the capabilities of the actors. “We go from historical and mythological to contemporary and social issues after interacting with the actors a producer ropes in. I have ended up writing 20-25 scripts in a season,” he says. The last of his plays were the historical Joymoti for Abahan Theatre, the mythological Sakuntala for Surjya Theatre, social dramas Madhubala for Abahan and Sonar Kharu Nalage Mok for Itihash Theatre. Bhattacharya says nobody could have envisaged the pandemic. But the Bhramyomans became complacent about their popularity, never bothering to set up institutes to train people in a range of theatrical skills. “I have been insisting on a mobile theatre policy like we have a film policy, although the government did try to come up with one in 2013. We also need an archive to preserve everything about this cultural tradition for generations to come,” he says. “Mobile theatres do not have the industrial tag and are hence not included in government support schemes. They want to avoid complications in taxation, but a formal structure could have made them eligible for insurance. Their economy is solely based on the number of people in the audience, which is why the COVID-19 restrictions have damaged them like never before,” Goduka says. Theatre producers are not sure how a new experiment by Guwahati-based Nexster Studios to stream their plays on digital platforms would pan out. “We are paying the artists for recreating plays to be released online via an app. Our fingers are crossed,” the studio’s Ashim Nath says. But there cannot be any replacement of the real thing, says Nagen Deka, secretary of Nalbari’s Hari Mandir Committee. One of the largest theatre organisers, this committee hosts as many groups on its nine fields, especially during the October-November Raas festival and Durga Puja. “Mobile theatre is an inseparable part of our cultural heritage. Many livelihoods are associated with it and organising committees benefit from them. The public facilities we have, including schools, have come up from the money from mobile theatres. Yes, we lose some when the shows do not click. But the profits for the society at large far outweigh the losses to not want them back as soon as possible,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/lights-dim-for-roving-troupes/article35643139.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Visualising the Himalaya with other coordinates||A conceptual audit of questions related to geopolitics and security concerns while talking or thinking about the Himalaya is perhaps long overdue. There is no gainsaying the truth that we have been examining the Himalaya mainly through the coordinates of geopolitics and security while relegating others as either irrelevant or incompatible. In a certain sense, our intellectual concerns over the Himalaya have been largely shaped by the assumption of fear, suspicion, rivalry, invasion, encroachment and pugnacity. If during colonial times it was Russophobia, then now it is Sinophobia or Pakistan phobia that in fact determines our concerns over the Himalaya. Within the domain of geopolitics and security, conceived by that which lies outside the Himalaya, a process that decolonial scholars such as Pauline Hountondji refers to as extroversion. Ironically it is the Delhi-Beijing-Islamabad triad, and not the mountain per se , that defines our concerns about the Himalaya. Are we not really leading Himalayan studies towards the dead end of violent intellectual pursuits? A national Himalaya If extroversion in the field of knowledge production has resulted in academic dependency, in the case of Himalayan studies it has given birth to the political compulsion of territorialising the Himalaya on a par with the imperatives of nationalism. Thus the attempt to create a national Himalaya by each of the five nations (Nepal, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, and Tibet/China)that fall within this transnational landmass called the Himalaya. The National Mission on Himalayan Studies, for example, under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, is a classic case in point that provides funds for research and technological innovations, but creating policies only for the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). The Mission document avowedly claims: “The Government of India has come-up with this Mission in recognition of the fact that the Himalayan Ecosystem is important for ecological security of India (https://bit.ly/3x8dOMB)”. Thus, comes the Indian Himalaya. It reminds us of that ancient parable where a few blind men were trying to fathom how huge an elephant was by touching only the different parts of its body. By considering cartographic fixations as the natural limit of scholarship, we have overburdened Himalayan studies with the concerns of States in place of people, culture, market or ecology. India’s understanding of the Himalaya is informed by a certain kind of realism, as the Himalaya continues to remain as a space largely defined in terms of sovereign territoriality, in contrast to alternative imaginations such as community, ecology or market. It may be perceived that such an alternative conceptualisation of Himalaya is not only possible but also necessary. But can we really work out such an alternative imagination especially when we find territorialisation and securitisation to be the two dominant modes through which the Himalaya is imagined both in the official context, and, by extension, in popular discourses. A historical logjam The Himalaya’s territorialisation bears a colonial legacy which also sets up its post-colonial destiny as played out within the dynamics of nation states. The arbitration of relationships between and among the five nation states falling within the Himalayan landmass has failed to transcend the approach derived from the given categories of territoriality, sovereignty and difference. As such, the fact that the lines of peoplehood and the national border, especially within the context of the Himalaya, never coincided, is bound to give birth to tensions while working out projects predicated upon national sovereignty. Given this historical logjam, what we can only expect is the escalation of territorial disputes as the immediate fallout when infrastructure development projects in the border areas are adopted by constituting nation states to secure their respective territories falling within the Himalayan landmass. Borders and their differences It needs to be recognised that political borders and cultural borders are not the same thing. Political borders are to be considered as space-making strategies of modern nation-states that do not necessarily coincide with cultural borders. In other words, while a statist imagination has a telling effect on the way a border is understood in political terms, culture in that sense defies the (political) idea of border or at best considers it as permeable, penetrable, connective, heterogeneous and one that can be accounted for mainly through dreams, passions, flows and livelihoods. The singular statist conception of a political border would then appear to become a ‘polysemic’ or even ‘rhizomatic’ when viewed in cultural terms, and, by extension, in terms of trade and ecology or the environment. It needs to be realised that human security cannot be effectively appreciated through the paradigm of sovereign territoriality, although state systems operating within the Himalaya have failed to devise any other framework to grapple with the issue of security. More often than not, the state has dominated the agenda of defining the domain of non-traditional security (such as human rights, cases of ecological devastation, climate change, human trafficking, migration, forced exodus of people, transnational crime, resource scarcity, and even pandemics) besides setting the tone of an approach to handling traditional security threats (such as military, political and diplomatic conflicts that were considered as threats against the essential values of the state, territorial integrity, and political sovereignty). Interestingly enough, it has often appeared as a fact that the measures to deal with traditional security threats from outside have in fact triggered non-traditional insecurities on several fronts on the inside. Understanding the Himalaya Keeping these arguments in order, it is proposed that there could be several alternate ways of reading the geopolitical and the security concerns of the Himalaya and if the statist meaning (territoriality, sovereignty and difference) is privileged over and above those of the anthropological, historical, cultural, and ecological ones, it would continue to reflect a set of mental processes predicated on a certain conception of spatial imagination that could be anything but ‘unHimalayan’ or, for that matter, antithetical to the very idea of the Himalaya itself. How long should one go on referring to the Himalaya as the one of the largest biodiversity hotspots? Or as the largest water tower of Asia? Or as a zone that is culturally and linguistically diverse, sharing a common historical pool of resources, communities, cultures, civilisations and memories, and susceptible to climate change and ecological vulnerabilities? When would these terms of references be predicated in our scholarly, and, by extension, pedestrian, attempts to understand the Himalaya and produce impactful policy research on the Himalaya? The argument is simple. The Himalaya being a naturally evolved phenomenon should be understood through frameworks that have grown from within the Himalaya. The Himalaya needs to be visualised with an open eye and taken in as a whole instead of in parts unlike the ancient parable of the efforts of the blind men in trying to understand the elephant in parts. The Himalaya is a space whose history defines its geography rather than the other way round. Since histories are always made rather than given, we need to be careful about what kind of Himalayan history we are trying to inject or project in the way we imagine the Himalaya. Viewing the Himalaya as a space of political power and, by extension, through the coordinates of nation states epitomising differential national histories is a violent choice, which actually enriched ultra-sensitivity towards territorial claims and border management. A road map of other routes In contrast to this, if we are ready to consider the Himalaya as a space that is deeply embedded in human subjectivities, we can possibly come out of the grip of a national absolute space, which is actually necessary if we are to address the concerns of trade, commerce, community, ecology and environment — issues which are no less important when we are to think of securing livelihoods, cultures and the environment in the Himalaya. In fact, the road map of all these alternative routes — trade, community, environment — are located beyond the absolutist statist position. The need is that these alternative imaginations of security should be given the required space in the way policy making, state-building strategies and diplomatic relations are worked out in relation to the Himalaya. The time has come when we need to take position between the Himalaya as a national space and as a space of dwelling instead of avoiding our encounter with this ambivalence.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||A Hindu-Muslim dialogue without conditions||In what has been widely perceived as a gesture of conciliation towards Muslims, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said in a recent speech (https://bit.ly/3j2Oe6t) that Hindus lynching minorities for cow slaughter were acting against Hindutva, and those asserting that Muslims have no place in India were not Hindus. He also tried to allay Muslim fears about the bleak future of Islam in India saying the religion was not in danger, and asked Muslims to help the RSS in making the country a world leader ( vishwaguru ) on the basis of the fact that all Indians, being the descendants of common ancestors from the last 40,000 years, have the same DNA. The viewpoints Muslim opinion makers either brushed off Mr. Bhagwat’s remarks as “mere rhetoric” because “RSS leaders often spoke with a forked tongue”, or tried to mollify him by saying that “if there is someone who can initiate perestroika in the RSS, it is Bhagwat” because, “in a gradual manner he has been trying to change the Sangh’s attitude towards Muslims”. If the untenability of the first viewpoint is based on a dismissive distrust of the RSS, the second amounts to nothing more than complaisant backslapping. Such facile responses, to say the least, exude an attitude that is not conducive to a genuine Hindu-Muslim dialogue the RSS chief hopes to initiate. To his credit, the RSS chief spoke with an open mind and wanted the mistrust ( avishwaas ) between Hindus and Muslims to be understood and dispelled in an atmosphere of forthright outspokenness ( khari khari baat ko jaisa hai waisa samajna ). However, communal unity ( ekta ) through such a dialogue was possible only if Muslims acknowledge India as their motherland; accept its traditions and culture ( parampara, sanskriti ), and honour their common ancestors ( samaan purvaj ). Mr. Bhagwat virtually rendered these three prerequisites a sine quo non for establishing one’s Indianness with the condescending summation: baaqi hamaare yahaan sab swatantrata hai (there is freedom for everything else in our land). A melding This attempt to meld Indianness and Hinduness together is eerily similar to V.D. Savarkar’s credo which defines a Hindu as one who regards the entire subcontinent as his fatherland ( pitrubhu ); descended of Hindu parents, and considers this land holy ( punyabhu ). For Savarkar these three conditions signified a common nation ( rashtra ), a common race ( jati ) and a common culture ( sanskriti ), respectively, and together they form the foundation on which Hindutva rests. Several assertions of Mr. Bhagwat reflected this attitude. For instance, his full statement on cow vigilantism was Hindustan Hindu Rashtra hai, gaumata pujya hai ; lekin lynching karne waale yeh Hindutva ke khilaf jaarahe hain (India is a Hindu nation, the cow is worthy of worship; but the lynchers are going against Hindutva). He also quoted the RSS founder K.B. Hedgewar as stating that Hindus were wrong in blaming the British and the Muslims for their pitiable state ( durwasta ) because, despite being the owners ( maalik ) of their country, and their large numbers, if Hindus could be reduced to such a state then there must be some shortcoming ( kami ) in them that needs to be addressed. This, Mr. Bhagwat said, is how the RSS conceptualises the situation and therefore, in its view the minorities are not the reason for the miserable condition of the Hindus in a Hindu country ( Hinduon ke desh mein ). Portraiture of India Had the Muslim commentators listened to Mr. Bhagwat’s 34-minute speech made in Ghaziabad — instead of relying on selective versions of it publicised by the media — they would perhaps have challenged, in the spirit of the candidness he suggested, the portraiture of India as indigenously Hindu with a non-native Muslim population. Nonetheless, was Mr. Bhagwat trying to say that Muslims, even if they are “our own brethren” ( hamaare apne bhai ) now, are outsiders? But he did want the people to know that Islam’s entry into India was aggressive ( woh aakramakon se saath aaya ), but even so, all those who came to our land are still here coexisting peacefully ( hamaare yahaan jojo aaya hai woh aaj bhi maujood hai ). Islam in the subcontinent Mr. Bhagwat should have known that Islam in the subcontinent predates the forays of invaders such as Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori, and Muhammad bin Qasim who captured Sindh and Multan from Raja Dahir around 711 CE. It was around 630 CE that Islamised Arab merchants started arriving in the coastal regions of Konkan-Gujarat and Malabar in continuation of the trade links they had with India from pre-Islamic times. The cordiality of this transactive relationship was such that it resulted in the spread of Islamic culture and religion in India. Thus, most Indian Muslims today are the descendants of the locals who converted to Islam and, therefore, they have always considered India their motherland and respected it traditions, culture, and diversity. The ultimate proof of this patriotism was demonstrated when they chose India over Pakistan after Partition. But it would be unfair to expect this loyalism to be rooted in the subliminal recognition of an autochthonous Indian race that magnanimously “accommodated” them. For there is no evidence to show that such a race existed in India, nor are the Muslims aliens. Researcher Tony Joseph, in his engrossing book Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From and subsequent articles, has shown that Indians are a multi-source civilisation who draw their cultural impulses, traditions and practices from a variety of heredities and migration histories. He calls the earliest direct ancestors of people living in India today, the ‘First Indians’. They were the descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who arrived here about 65,000 years ago. The First Indians were later joined by Zagrosian herders from Iran with whom they formed the Harappan civilisation. After 2000 BCE came the Aryans, the Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman-language speakers, and, much later, the Greeks, the Jews, the Huns, the Sakas, the Parsis, the Syrians, the Mughals, the Portuguese, the British, the Siddis — all of whom left small marks all over the subcontinent. In short, says Mr. Joseph, almost all the population groups of India carry 50-65% of their ancestry from the First Indians, no matter where in the caste hierarchy they stand, what language they speak, which region they inhabit or what religion they belong to. This being the truth, India cannot be spoken of in terms of Hindu on ka desh (Hindu country) or Musalmaanon ka desh (Muslim country). It belongs equally to all communities living here, and as pointed out by the RSS chief himself, India being a democracy cannot countenance the dominance of Hindus or Muslims. Likewise, any Hindu-Muslim dialogue must be unconditional and take place in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In Mr. Bhagwat’s own words: Darke maare ekta hona nahin hai (Let there not be unity out of fear). A. Faizur Rahman is the Secretary-General of the Islamic Forum for the Promotion of Moderate Thought.E-mail: themoderates2020@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-hindu-muslim-dialogue-without-conditions/article35643135.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Patchwork progress||The Government hopes to ring in fresh changes to the 1961 Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation law in the monsoon session, after the Cabinet nod this week. From savers’ perspective, the most significant modification on the anvil is a 90-day deadline for the Corporation (DICGC) to remit the insured deposits of customers in troubled banks. As per the plan, once the RBI imposes curbs on a bank, the clock will start ticking and by the 91st day or thereabouts, account holders will get their outstanding balance back with a cap of Rs. 5 lakh. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said this will not apply retrospectively, she did indicate that this would apply to cases of lenders already under a moratorium. In the last two years, Yes Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and the PMC Bank, have faced such a bar on depositors seeking to withdraw. PMC Bank accounts still face such curbs, even as savings parked in other co-operative lenders that have gone under continue to elude their rightful owners. The Minister said it normally takes eight to 10 years for insured deposits to be forked out, from the time a bank hits a hurdle and myriad conditions are imposed on withdrawals. But these delays were well-known last year too, when the insured deposit amount was raised to Rs. 5 lakh from Rs. 1 lakh laid down in 1993. Making incremental changes in quick succession suggests a piecemeal approach to governance rather than a system-wide view, even though the government stressed it has been working ‘overtime’ to resolve the PMC Bank crisis. Nevertheless, given the rising distress in households and the downward momentum in savings levels due to the pandemic, this change must be allowed to make it through the din in Parliament. As per RBI data, Rs. 76.21 lakh crore or almost 51% of deposits are now insured, but 98.3% of all accounts have balances of Rs. 5 lakh or less so they are fully insured. This can be a source of renewed comfort for people in the banking system, grappling with bad loans, dwindling deposits and a still-fledgling insolvency framework. It is important for financial stability that people feel it is safer to park their money in a bank than stashing it under a mattress. For several people with limited financial literacy and access to retirement savings instruments, with lifetime earnings (possibly over Rs. 5 lakh) parked in a neighbourhood co-operative bank, this would still be a less than perfect outcome. The RBI needs to up its oversight game, and the Centre, which has recently made the Department of Cooperation a full-scale ministry, needs to allow it to do so. Moreover, just as the latest amendments have an enabling provision to raise the premium paid by banks to the DICGC in future, there should have been one to raise the insured deposit limit in line with inflation and per capita income trends.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/patchwork-progress/article35643128.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Law and lawmakers||The Supreme Court ruling that legislative privilege cannot be extended to provide legal immunity to criminal acts committed by lawmakers ought to be welcomed for two reasons. It lays down that legislators charged with unruly behaviour that results in offences under penal laws cannot be protected either by their privilege or their free speech rights. Second, the decision revivifies the law relating to a prosecutor’s role in withdrawing an ongoing criminal case. The LDF government in Kerala has suffered a setback as it strongly favoured the withdrawal of cases against six members sought to be prosecuted for creating a ruckus in the Assembly on March 13, 2015, when they boisterously tried to interrupt the presentation of the Budget presented by the erstwhile UDF regime. Their action resulted in destruction or damage to some items, amounting to a loss of Rs. 2.20 lakh. Based on the Assembly Secretary’s complaint, the police registered a case and later filed a charge sheet against them for committing mischief and trespass under the IPC and destroying public property under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. This year, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, had rejected the application by the public prosecutor for withdrawal from prosecution, an order that was later affirmed by the Kerala HC. It is not surprising that the apex court concurred with these decisions, as it is indeed an unacceptable argument that the alleged vandalism took place as part of the legislators’ right to protest on the floor of the House. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, who has rejected calls for asking his General Education Minister, V. Sivankutty, one of the accused, to resign and face trial, maintains that the matter ought to have been seen as a political protest and something that should not have been taken into the domain of criminal prosecution. He is indeed right when he says that courts ought not to re-appraise a prosecutor’s decision to withdraw a case, and that they should only examine whether the prosecutor had applied his mind independently. However, there is equal force in the proposition that it is the court’s duty to decide whether the withdrawal is in good faith, is in the interest of public policy, and is not aimed at thwarting the process of law. Legislative privilege and parliamentary free speech are necessary elements of a lawmaker’s freedom to function, but it is difficult to disagree with the Court’s conclusion that an alleged act of destroying public property within the House cannot be considered “essential” for their legislative functions. It is indeed quite legal for Mr. Sivankutty to remain in office, as he is yet to be convicted. However, he will be well-advised to take a cue from several recent precedents of those in ministerial positions stepping down until their names are cleared by due process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/law-and-lawmakers/article35643129.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Core sectors grew 8.9% in June||Output at India’s eight core sectors grew by 8.9% in June but the pace remained below the production levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its second wave this year, indicating the economy’s recovery remains uneven. Crude oil was the only component whose output shrank from a year earlier in the June Index of Eight Core Industries released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry on Friday, contracting 1.8%. Natural gas and steel both posted growth of more than 20%, while cement, coal, electricity, petroleum and fertilisers recorded moderate expansions in the range of 2% to 7.4%. The core sectors had expanded by 60.3% in April and by 16.3% in May, thanks to the base effect linked to the sharp contraction in output last year due to the national lockdown. The government also revised the March index, pegging growth in that month at 12.6% from an earlier estimate of 6.8%. CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis said June’s core sector data had “once again been influenced by the negative base effect syndrome” which would continue to dominate most economic data. “Despite the gradual unlocking after the second wave, the sequential uptick in the overall core index in June was mild at just 1.1%, with double-digit increases in cement and fertilisers, dampened by a month-on-month decline in petroleum refinery products and coal,” ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said in a note. ‘Incomplete recovery’ Stressing that core sectors’ output was 4.7% lower than the pre-COVID level of June 2019, and also lower than the April print, Ms. Nayar said this was consistent with “the picture of an incomplete recovery” suggested by other high-frequency indicators. The index of industrial production (IIP), in which core sector output weighs in at 40%, could grow at 12%-17% in June, the ICRA economist reckoned, while Mr. Sabnavis projected a 15%-20% increase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/core-sectors-grew-89-in-june/article35643106.ece

The data on bank credit was collected from 33 scheduled commercial banks, accounting for about 90% of the total non-food credit deployed by banks for the month of June 2021. On a year-on-year basis, non-food bank credit grew 5.9% last month, slowing from June 2020’s 6.0%, the central bank said. Credit to industry contracted by 0.3% in June 2021 from 2.2% growth in June 2020. Size-wise, credit to medium industries registered robust growth of 54.6% in June after having posted a contraction of 9.0% a year earlier. Credit to micro and small industries rebounded to growth of 6.4%, after shrinking 2.9% in June 2020, while credit to large industries contracted by 3.4% after growing 3.6% a year earlier, the central bank said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gold-loans-spur-personal-loans-bank-credit-slows/article35643100.ece

31 July 2021||Colombo,||Chance to reflect that not all wickets will be flat, says Dravid||Rahul Dravid believes that the new crop of Indian batsmen will learn with experience that “not all wickets will be flat” and they need to develop the art of scrapping it out on low-scoring tracks like the ones on offer during the last two T20Is against Sri Lanka. India lost the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka 1-2 on Thursday, playing without nine of its first team players due to COVID-19 related isolation. Found wanting Rookies Devdutt Padikkal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Nitish Rana, along with Sanju Samson, literally struggled against a quality spin bowling attack led by leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga. Asked if he was disappointed in the manner the younger players were found wanting against Hasaranga and company, the head coach replied in the negative. “I am not disappointed as they are young. They are going to learn and get better only when they are exposed to these kind of conditions and quality of bowling. Sri Lankan team’s bowling attack is an international bowling attack,” Dravid said while assessing the overall performance in the series. But the former India captain did admit that there is lot to learn on how to play on challenging tracks, saying pitches in domestic cricket have become easier to bat as compared to his times. “They would have liked to score a few more runs. They now have an opportunity to reflect that not all wickets are going to be flat. We need to find ways to scrap and score 130, 140 on these wickets,” Dravid observed after seeing the Ranas and the Padikkals struggle on a Premadasa track where ball wasn’t coming on to the bat. “It’s really a good learning as they are all young players. This is a great opportunity to reflect on these performances and may be come up with some slightly better strategies. “Let me be fair, we don’t get these kind of conditions very often in T20 cricket but when you do, I think, you have responsibility to play slightly better,” Dravid said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chance-to-reflect-that-not-all-wickets-will-be-flat-says-dravid/article35643117.ece

It was yet more heartbreak for the 20-time Grand Slam champion at the Olympics, where his best result is a bronze in 2008. Zverev is looking to become the first German to win singles gold since Graf in Seoul after winning 10 of the last 11 games against Djokovic. Djokovic can still win multiple medals, with the bronze-medal match against Pablo Carreno Busta to come on Saturday after his mixed doubles semifinal with Nina Stojanovic against Elena Vesnina and Aslan Karatsev later Friday. Khachanov, meanwhile, produced an impressive display to dispatch Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-3. Khachanov is bidding to become the first Russian champion in the men’s singles since Yevgeny Kafelnikov struck gold in Sydney 21 years ago. Women’s World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty’s third and final attempt to win a gold was ended after defeat alongside John Peers in the mixed doubles semifinals against Russians Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Andrey Rublev.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/zverev-dashes-djokovics-hopes/article35643490.ece
31 July 2021||TOKYO,||Lovlina punches her way into the medal zone||Lovlina Borgohain walked into the ring with a smile on her face and left with an even bigger one — she had just assured India of its second medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The Indian boxer let out a roar after the bout at the Korugikan Arena even as her camp jumped for joy. A medal was definitely coming home. The 23-year-old outpunched Chinese Taipei’s Chen Nien-chin to storm into the semifinals of the 69kg category, where she will face Turkish world champion Busenaz Surmeneli. She is the third Indian pugilist after Vijender Singh (bronze, 2008 Beijing Olympics) and M.C. Mary Kom (bronze, 2012 London Games) to win a medal at the Olympics. Lovlina — a good three-inches taller than her opponent — was in cruise control as she stamped her authority from the bell and pushed Chen onto the backfoot with an all-out attacking approach. The judges awarded the opening round to the Indian. She was dominant as all five judges awarded her the second round and she was comfortably ahead in the third too as she punched her way into history. Though she’s assured of a medal, Lovlina was confident of leaving Tokyo with the coveted yellow metal. “It’s a very big day for me, but I want to win gold. I needed a medal and I have achieved that now. I can fight freely now and go for gold,” said Lovlina. All the more sweet The victory was all the more sweet as she got the better of Chen for the first time in five attempts. “I had lost to her four times. I used to plan a lot before getting into a bout with her... I know her game, so I was attacking from the get-go. My game is to counter, but today I changed my tactics and was on the attack,” she said. “The plan was to play according to the merit of the opponent. I backed myself to handle any situation. I have been working hard for the last eight years and wanted to channel all that effort into the bout today.” Simranjit loses Earlier, Simranjit Kaur, another medallist on the world stage, lost to two-time World championship medallist Sudaporn Seesondee of Thailand 0-5 in a women’s 60kg pre-quarterfinal. The experienced Thai boxer landed her punches on target even as Simranjit put up a good fight by using her combinations. Simranjit stepped up her attack in the second round but also provided room for Sudaporn to deliver some fine left shots. The Indian kept battling it out till the end but could not stop the Thai boxer from advancing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lovlina-storms-into-last-four-assured-of-medal/article35643452.ece
31 July 2021||Chennai,||Hari Nishaanth, Vivek propel Dragons||Dindigul Dragons breathed fire. And Salem Spartans’ innings was burnt before it could take flight. Spartans, chasing 186, slid down the slippery slope in this one-sided TNPL clash at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Friday. In the end, the margin was 76. It would have been worse but for M. Ashwin’s 38-ball 47. Incisive bowling Dragons’ bowling was incisive. R. Suthesh can be deceptively sharp with his left-arm seam and he castled S. Abhishek with a delivery that came in sharply. Vijay Shankar struck L. Vignesh for a sweet six over long off. But then, Suthesh got him chasing a widish delivery. Rash strokes and panic running meant the Spartans continued to lose wickets. Earlier, Spartans elected to field. There is an ease about Hari Nishaanth’s ways at the crease that soothes your senses. A six down the ground off Vijay Shankar was marked by a still head and balance. And the swing of the willow was smooth and straight. The young man handled the pressures of captaincy capably, opening the innings and stringing together partnerships during his 42-ball 52. The thrust to the innings was given though by R. Vivek who threw in big punches during his 41-ball 59 at No. 3. He smashed left-arm spinner Ganesh Moorthi over long-on after the bowler had sold the dummy to S. Arun. When Vivek cut, he did so hard. He displayed delicate touch too by slicing G. Periyasamy between deep point and third-man. Lokesh Raj had Vivek taken at third man to end the 76-run second-wicket stand and then consumed the dangerous K. Mani Bharathi with his next delivery. R.S. Mokit Hariharan blazed away towards the end with a furious 15-ball 32 not out.  The scores: Dindigul Dragons 185/6 in 20 overs (C. Hari Nishaanth 52, R. Vivek 59, R.S. Mokit Hariharan 32 not out, Lokesh Raj 3/33) bt Salem Spartans 109 in 18.4 overs (M. Ashwin 47, L. Vignesh 2/25, R. Suthesh 2/7, S. Swaminathan 2/8).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hari-nishaanth-vivek-propel-dragons/article35643526.ece
31 July 2021||TOKYO,||Sindhu passes the Yamaguchi test, enters semifinals||P.V. Sindhu, with searing smashes and delicate drop shots, overcame a gritty Akane Yamaguchi of Japan 21-13, 22-20 in the quarterfinals here on Friday.

To make a comparison, the fastest bullet train in Japan runs at an estimated speed of 320kmph! Chasing a second successive Olympic medal, after her silver in Rio 2016, the Indian surged ahead 14-8. However, Yamaguchi made a comeback, cutting down the lead to two points (13-15). Then came the moment of the game. The shuttle went back and forth for 63 seconds before Yamaguchi finished the point with a down-the-line smash. Both players sank to their knees in exhaustion after the exhange. Winning that point seemed to have boosted Yamaguchi’s confidence as she led 20-18. But Sindhu dug deep to save game points and won the next two to wrap up the contest. “This was my best match here,” Sindhu said after the 56-minute quarterfinal. “The second game was very crucial. Even though she was leading, I never lost hope. I was ahead 14-8 and all of a sudden she was leading 20-18. My coach was constantly saying, ‘it is okay, it is not over yet... be focused and you can do it’ and I did it.” Sindhu she was up for the Yamaguchi challenge. “I was prepared for the rallies. I always knew she would come back, and I was prepared for it. I needed to maintain my attack because that’s my strong point. I am happy I closed out the match in two games,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-passes-the-yamaguchi-test-enters-semifinals/article35643450.ece

Japan pulled a goal back two minutes later, while Watanabe restored parity three minutes after the change of ends, India restored its lead almost immediately as Shamsher deflected home Nilakanta’s pass. India extended its lead soon when Harmanpreet found Surender Kumar on the left flank with an inch-perfect aerial ball. The latter passed to Nilakanta who deflected the ball home. India made it 5-2 when Gurjant scored off a variation from his side’s fourth penalty corner. Another defensive error allowed Japan to reduce the margin just a minute from the final hooter through Murata.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gurjants-brace-helps-india-outclass-japan/article35643443.ece

31 July 2021||Chennai,||‘We need to be tougher in the mind’||M. Venkataramana has a challenging job in the season ahead. He will not only be the coach of the Tamil Nadu senior cricket team but will also head the State Cricket Academy. The 55-year-old Venkataramana, a former Test cricketer with 247 First Class wickets bowling off-spin, is unfazed by the demanding task ahead. He told The Hindu on Friday, “The idea behind the move is that the transition of the talented cricketers from the Tamil Nadu Academy to the State team should be smooth.” He added, “If one man is in control, things will be easier. During the time I am away with the Tamil Nadu team, I will be in touch with the coaches at the academy.” Integral part Venkataramana was an integral part of the State team’s spin attack when Tamil Nadu last triumphed in the Ranji Trophy way back in 1988. He said, “We are good in white ball cricket. Despite our ability, we have not delivered in the Ranji Trophy. We need to improve.” Venkataramana elaborated, “We have some capable batsmen, but in the Ranji finals that we reached, we did not make enough runs.” He added, “We, as a team, need to be tougher in the mind during high-pressure situations.” Tamil Nadu had some handy pacemen but needed spinners for the longer format, Venkataramana felt. “We need to take 20 wickets to win. It is the bowlers who win matches.” There is this quiet resilience about Venkataramana. Tough he certainly is.  We need to take 20 wickets to win.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||He enables worship||Thirumoolar in his Thirumantiram likens Lord Siva to clouds in the sky. He sees the relationship between himself and Lord Siva as that between a calf and its mother. He calls out to Lord Siva, who is known as Nandi, for who else can impart jnana to him? Lord Siva showers His blessings on those who inhabit the earth. He also lives among the celestials. He draws everyone like a magnet. He is fond of music, and Thirumoolar acknowledges that he sings Siva’s praises only because of the grace of the Lord. It is Lord Siva who makes it possible for anyone to worship Him, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. Manickavachagar expresses a similar sentiment in his Thiruvachagam, when he says that he came to worship at the feet of Lord Siva entirely due to the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is the enabler, but for whose love, none would be able to approach Him. In his Kolaru Padhigam, Gnanansambandar, speaking of Siva playing the veena, says that His fingers gently glide over the strings of the veena (veenai thadavi). He is the head of the celestials. None can fathom His greatness. Yet, we worship Him in whatever way possible. Since ancient times, people have understood God in different ways. But none has understood Him fully. Many have sung verses praising God, but they have not comprehended His greatness completely. Sivakochariyar was a well-read sage. But even his bhakti was not equal to that of Kannappa Nayanar. The latter had no instruction in the Vedas or other scriptures. But in terms of devotion, Kannappa Nayanar was unparalleled, for he was willing to give both his eyes to Lord Siva, when he saw the linga’s eyes bleeding. Nothing can surpass the fragrance of the kasturi. Likewise, nothing can equal the true path shown by Lord Siva, says Thirumoolar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/he-enables-worship/article35643185.ece

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||A new outing||A young niece wanted to take us out for a meal, and we were wondering where to go. I’d heard that a new restaurant had opened up in Khan Market. It was called Klap, signifying a cheerful clapping of hands. What interested me was the fact that one of the partners was an innovative chef called Gurmehar Sethi. I had eaten at his restaurant Ziu in Sangam Courtyard and had been struck by the nouvelle Thai that he served. So, our party of four — vaccinated and masked — reached Klap one afternoon. The restaurant is in the middle lane. It’s quite roomy, with tables at a distance; well-lit, with a happy décor. The menu included dishes from across India and the world, from shakarkandi chaat and chicken red curry arancini to galouti puff, spicy salmon sushi and Bengali mustard paneer. We ordered a medley: okra som tam (Rs. 445) and baby chicken, celery, roasted chilli garlic dim sum (Rs. 495) for starters. For our mains, we had a small plate of Belgian pork belly (Rs. 695), smoked spicy prawns (Rs. 695), hopper taco mushroom pepper fry (Rs. 525) and Kerala meen pollichathu (Rs. 595). The som tam salad is an old favourite. I love the taste of the crispy fried papaya, tossed in a chilli lime and palm sugar dressing. Klap’s salad includes bits of okra and cherry tomatoes. The dim sums were wonderfully soft and cased in an appetizing shade of pale pink rendered by beetroot, our helpful, cheerful server told us. The pork was tender, and I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet and hot taste of the gochujang sauce, topped with chillies and vinegar. The prawns — large, juicy, crunchy and lightly flavoured with kaffir lime — were delicious. What was disappointing was the Kerala fish. The sole came wrapped in a banana leaf, with tamarind-onion-tomato jam on the side. But the skin was too spicy and crusty, and our friend, who had ordered it, was looking forward to something soft and steamed. But the ghee rice that came with the fish was delightful, and we finished it all. I had a bite of the appam with mushroom pepper fry, and thought the delicate taste of mushroom had been smothered by the spices. The dessert, however, lifted our spirits. Called the Klap egg tray, it is a signature dish of coconut and jaggery ice cream served in a chocolate shell with caramelised mung bean (Rs. 395). All in all, we had a great time. The food is good, the restaurant is welcoming, and the warmth of the staff added to the experience. I put my (sanitised) hands together and gave it a round of quiet applause.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Now WhatsApp a||Pandemic-scarred and second wave-battered, I found myself checking into The Lodhi one weekend in June, drawn by the promise of space and emotional recuperation. Just time spent doing nothing but stare at flickering images of Mughal-style jaalis that dominate the architecture of the hotel, in the deep plunge pool within my suite. But the real reason why we stayed put for four days is not the suite’s roominess or giant TV screens, but Naveen, the personal butler assigned to my family and I. His unobtrusive care smoothened every First World problem I thought of: how to get the rooms cleaned in our absence without actually being absent? How to give laundry instructions with minimal contact? That the wine was to my liking? Above all, the Hamletian dilemma: to go or not to the rather excellent restaurants in the hotel. “It is full today, so perhaps you wouldn’t like to,” Naveen Tiwari, 26, said quietly from behind his mask and face shield, having gauged my need for strict privacy. He would instead bring up restaurant-style meals — from billowy baos to black cod miso — and lay them out on the dining table, edible flowers, micro greens, frills and all, with the flair of a restaurant chef and bartender. A far cry from messy “room service”.  Traditional to tech  Luxury Indian hotels have always prided themselves on offering the best private butler services to special and/or high-paying guests. In the past, my own encounters with this kind of uber pampering has ranged from a butler waiting up in the wee hours till I returned from a party to ask whether I would like a glass of hot chocolate before retiring for the “night”, to helping coordinate sight-seeing. The pandemic has altered things, though. Guests now seek privacy, minimal interactions, and the least intrusive ways of communication. Privacy, in fact, is the new luxury. And butler services are pivoting to cater to this new normal while trying to retain personalisation and warmth — with help from technology. WhatsApp is the preferred mode of communication lately. “Your plate is hot, please be careful,” Naveen would, for instance, ping to tell me, as he unobtrusively left the suite after plating our food. At The Leela group of hotels, the messaging service has, in fact, been integrated into the hotel’s communications system. Apart from individual numbers that are exchanged between butlers and guests, there is an ebutler programme on a centralised number where guests can message instructions and requests. “Today, the guest has the choice to decide who they want to interact with and how much. We, as a brand, have tried to balance hi tech with hi touch,” says Anuraag Bhatnagar, Chief Operating Officer, The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts. But technology apart, since butlers are now more likely to be the sole representative of a hotel that guests are likely to interact with, their role has extended to ideating and suggesting unique experiences based on their intuitive understanding of the guest. Suchetna Pal Roy, a 21-year-old recent graduate from IHM Kolkata and a butler at the newly-launched Leela Jaipur, explains how she approaches her assignments. “I was recently assigned to a top corporate executive from Korean. Before he arrived, I researched his background, how many years he has worked at his job, where in Korea he is from, what his food and drink preferences are, whether his kids were accompanying him [they were, so amenities like cup cakes were arranged]. On the basis of this, I created unique experiences for his family,” she says.  Socially-distanced experiences  Unlike earlier, when butlers oversaw a team when setting the table or offering turn down services, now Pal-Roy and her tribe are trained in every department, including the kitchen, and are sensitised adequately to new safety protocols. Their tasks include subtly reassuring guests about safety, hygiene, and vaccination status of all staff during the course of initial conversations to build confidence. At The Leela Jaipur, these include private meals on terraces, evening tea rituals, art walks or even a courtyard experience titled ‘ Jhilmil sitaaron ka aangan ’, where dinner is laid out al fresco in a space lit with 100 lamps. Most hotels report a substantial jump in in-room dining revenues (with the idea of “in-room” being redefined). “Butlers suggest our many open air areas at different hotels, from gardens and rooftops to even a small jetty [at the Taj Langkawi] where a table for two can be set up,” says a spokesperson from the Taj group of hotels. “We also have features such as the ‘floor is yours’, where an entire floor can be booked for a family or small group, which can be serviced by a butler.” Even for non leisure guests, butler services are now relevant with a “contact light” model of service. At ITC Grand Chola in Chennai, the “knock and drop” programme enables them to leave smartly-packed meals outside a room, or serve evening drinks and service via door-to-door trolley service. And tech-savvy butlers have even been fielding requests to set up Zoom sessions for older guests, concludes a spokesperson.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Pearls on Zoom and suits||Pearls are shedding their prim, old-fashioned tag and enjoying a contemporary comeback. The New York Fashion Week 2020 set the tone, with designers such as Marc Jacobs, Prabal Gurung, and Jason Wu pairing their outfits with gorgeous strands and large, asymmetrical pieces. Since then, we’ve spotted these classics on modern tastemakers, including Harry Styles and Rihanna. And don’t forget, when Kamala Harris was sworn in as America’s first female vice-president this January, she accessorised her purple Christopher John Rogers dress with a custom pearl necklace by Wilfredo Rosado. The fact that the oldest-known gems are seeing a resurgence doesn’t surprise Chennai-based entrepreneur and designer, Mita Banker. “It’s always appropriate to wear pearls; they are evergreen,” she exclaims. The force behind 32-year-old fashion jewellery brand, Estele, Banker launched her second brand, Isadore, in 2018, to create collections that draw inspiration from her travels. Like her first collection, Ottoman Empire — the pomegranate design, worn for good luck and prosperity, was a hit among Delhiites when she exhibited there. “I pull out things from my travels. Then I research the ideas and launch my designs,” she says.  Channelling royalty  Banker is full of stories about pearls. “La Peregrina is the world’s most famous [the 58½ carat gem was gifted by actor Richard Burton to Elizabeth Taylor],” she reminds me, sharing how pearls have always been worn as a sign of wealth. “Queens Victoria and Elizabeth favoured them; our n awabs and maharajas flaunted them. Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur was famous for her chiffons-and-pearl look.” Now, she is offering that touch of royalty with her collection at Evoluzione on Kadar Nawaz Khan Road. On offer: seed, round and oval pearls, along with coloured ones — in grey, champagne, peach, and pink. “You could buy them in strands or bunches, and have aunique piece designed for yourself,” she says. If coming up with your own design is tedious, pick up something from the Isadore line of bracelets, earrings, and necklaces. “I’ve created a half-black-half-white neck piece with onyx and pearls,” she says, adding that customers must check out the double strand pearl neck piece with rubies and emeralds. “These gems fit well with the corporate environment — team it with a suit or wear a saath lada haar with a sari.” So, when Zoom calls demand you look sharp at 9 am, don pearls for instant glam.   Prices from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 40,000. Details: 9840752100||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/pearls-on-zoom-and-suits/article35643337.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Foreign objects||When Ambujam mami walked in wearing her scarletkanjeevarammask with the zari trishul motifs, I knew it was bad. ‘This is totally unacceptable,’ she said, her face just a shade less fiery than her mask. ‘Has Sri Vegan been ordering samosas from Buharis, mami ?’ I asked, thinking of her herbivorous Labrador that wasn’t allowed to order anything other than masala dosai from Sangeetha’s. ‘Far worse. My phone has been hacked. By that Pega-something-thingie.’ ‘What?’ I said. ‘But why would they? More importantly... er... who would?’ ‘What do you mean who ? Foreign powers, that’s who!’ saidmami. She paused, giving me the look she gave Sundarammamawhen he came home with 20 Tic Tacs stuffed in his mouth. ‘You are aware that my daughter in New Jersey is on the verge of unveiling her magnum opus ‘ Hidimbi Parinayam, ’ right?’ How could I not be?Mamihad sent me the motion poster, the teaser to the trailer, and the third look of the forthcoming megabudget fusion dance ballet, with her daughter in the eponymous role, and mami billed ‘Creative Producer’. And insisted I forward it to everyone on my phone. ‘Yes,’ I gulped. ‘But what’s that got to do with your being hacked by foreign powers?’ ‘You’ve heard of that vixen, Amrutavalli, right? She runs that sidey dance school in California. Former student of Pankajam’s — actually part of the first batch — at her Nritya Canyon School of Bharatapudiyattam (NJ’s Only School of Indian Fusion Dance).’ I shook my head. ‘Well, the ingrate is putting up a dance ballet called ‘ Dakini Kalyanam ’. One week before my daughter’s performance. And it has the exact same concept as our ballet.’ ‘I still don’t get it,’ I said. ‘You’re hopeless,’ mami said. ‘Which is why you’re still languishing in Besant Nagar when even our istriwallah Marimuthu has got his green card. Don’t you see the hand of foreign powers?’ I ignored her jibe. ‘ Arré , can’t you see this is an attempt by that diabolical double agent Amrutavalli to malign my daughter’s reputation. Just before my daughter is awarded the Natya Gandabherunda award instituted by the Semi-legal Hispanic Gardeners Society of New Jersey?’ ‘I guess,’ I said. ‘Remember, the same thing happened two years ago, just before she was awarded the Bhava Parakashta Natya Samayochitani by the East Coast Parents of NRIs Dedicated To Grandchild Welfare Association.’ ‘What happened?’ ‘The organiser was hospitalised. After eating the badam halwa made by my daughter at the pre-award dinner.’ ‘I don’t get it.’ ‘It was poisoned, fool,’ said Ambujam mami . ‘By that Amrutavalli woman, who hacked into my daughter’s phone, and slyly added an ingredient to the recipe my daughter was using that nearly killed the man. Award was cancelled. And my innocent child was saved only because the DA’s nephew learns mridangam from my son-in-law.’ ‘I still don’t get it,’ I said. ‘Putin, you gnanashunyam , Putin!’ Ambujam Mami spat out. ‘With the possible involvement of Kim Jong Un and Meryl Streep. That’s who that Amrutavalli is working for, my sources tell me.’ When I continued staring, mami continued. ‘This is an attempt to bring disrepute to the patriotic NRIs of USA, I say!’ she said. ‘Sundar Pichai, Priyanka Chopra, my daughter — these foreign powers are unable to handle the glory coming their way. And they’re using a turncoat like Amrutavalli to achieve their ends. I am not going to let that happen.’ ‘What are you going to do, mami ?’  Mami gave me a look that would have made MN Nambiar go ‘Mummy!’ ‘ Margazhi is coming, no?’ she said. ‘She won’t know what hit her.’ Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/foreign-objects/article35643342.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Voices from Maximum City||Raghu Karnad fondly recalls how, out of the blue, he and a friend chanced upon dolphins off the Bandra Bandstand rocks. “It struck me suddenly that we in Mumbai see the sea as scenery, as a backdrop, and not as a living world filled with creatures that are our neighbours,” says the writer-journalist. This sense of wonder was one of the starting points of Marine Lines , a 10-part podcast that Karnad (winner of the 2019 Windham-Campbell Prize in the non-fiction category) is hosting. Produced by Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic and DeadAnt Studios, it explores “Mumbai’s hidden worlds, from the suburbs to the sea”. The conversations cover natural spaces (like the Sanjay Gandhi National Park), the creatures that inhabit them (everything from leopards to sea slugs), as well as broader topics like urban consumption patterns and sustainability. They seek to introduce listeners to ecosystems they may not have given a second thought to. “The podcast was pitched to me by the producers who wanted to explore Mumbai’s natural spaces and ecosystems, and I leapt at the idea,” says Karnad over the phone, adding that they recorded most of the episodes during the second wave, in April. “One of the things that I felt deprived of during that time, psychologically, was access to public, shared spaces. So the opportunity to have these conversations, to imagine I’m there with experts who’ve spent a lot of time documenting these areas, appealed to me,” he says. The three episodes so far have featured marine wildlife photographer Shaunak Modi (also director of the Coastal Conservation Foundation), actor Dia Mirza (also UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador), and wildlife biologist Nikit Surve. Future guests include writer Amitav Ghosh, and film critic Anupama Chopra. The magic of the ordinary Karnad’s guests not only document their own experiences with the natural world, but also point out the various ways in which the lives of entire communities intersect with environmental issues. For example, Surve’s podcast mentions his brief encounter with a young Warli girl living in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, who was nonplussed at seeing a leopard pass by. “I had so many emotions running through me, but she was so casual. She said that leopards often walk past their home, and the next morning we discovered that there’s even a local deity, Waghoba (in Marathi, ‘ wagh ’ covers both tigers and leopards),” he said.  Making space for the wild How does one convince the average urban-dweller to think a little bit more about the environment, especially? That’s the problem Marine Lines wants to tackle. It is as much of an outreach issue as a scientific one, which is where the podcast can be a great resource: the conversations are accessible and broad-ranging, yet rooted in distinctive spaces. The host comes across not as an expert, but as someone learning with the audience. Karnad says, “Shaunak Modi had this great line in the first episode — ‘you don’t protect what you don’t love and you can’t love what you don’t know exists’. It made such an impression on me and the producers, and we treated it like our motto for the remaining nine episodes.” Although this edition is Mumbai-centric, Karnad, who grew up in Bengaluru, hopes to host similar conversations for other cities. “I’d love to be able to do them for Delhi — it has The Ridge [in the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor], rivers, and more green spaces than Mumbai,” concludes the host.  Marine Lines is   available on Spotify, Gaana, Hubhopper and Audible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/voices-from-maximum-city/article35643351.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Olympics in the classroom||“Aunty, do you know that when Michael Phelps was small, he was scared of water?” piped up a young voice in class. We were chatting about the greatest Olympian of all time. “And Simone Biles was adopted, my mother told me,” added another, incidentally an adoptee herself. As a story educator, I have come to realise this wonderful way to introduce past and present athletes to children of all ages, opening a window into lives so different from their own, and showing them that dreams do come true. With the torch lit and the Olympic spirit in full force, it wasn’t difficult to turn their attention to a few specific picture biographies. The Story of Simone Biles by Rachelle Burk (2020, Rockridge Press) charts her life from a foster child to the greatest gymnast in the world. Wilma Unlimited: How Wilma Rudolph Became the World’s Fastest Woman by Kathleen Krull (1996) documents the journey of a child with polio to that of an Olympic gold medallist. Stories from Greek mythology have always been popular in my area of work as children are fascinated by how they trace the etymology of common words and expressions. Last week, we began with how the ancient Olympics were held in honour of Zeus; of Kallipateira, who defied the stringent laws that did not allow married women to watch the Olympics, so she could watch her son compete; and Pheidippides the messenger’s run at the Battle of Marathon, a historical event which today’s race commemorates. These stories created a huge buzz about the Games among my students, as they tracked its journey to its modern avatar. The new Olympic motto, ‘Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together’ also helps them learn to appreciate our diverse world.  The backstory : The Story of the Olympics by Mina Lacey (2010) is perfect for younger children, while Richard Brassey’s book by the same name (2011) will satisfy the curiosity of the older ones. You Wouldn’t Want to be a Greek Athlete by Micheal Ford (2004) places the reader in the story, dealing with the nudity and violence of the ancient games deftly and with humour that both educates and entertains. Key events such as the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, and Greece’s position in the Parade of Nations have all piqued a deeper interest in Greek mythology. The Hour of the Olympics (1998) and its companion book Ancient Greece and the Olympians from theMagic Tree Houseseries (2004) are a perfect combination of fiction and non-fiction reads.  Indian athletes: Sportswomen like weightlifter Mirabai Chanu — who won a silver on day one, badminton player PV Sindhu, and boxer Mary Kom have sown little dreams in the hearts and minds of my students. While, unfortunately, there are no books available about current athletes, India at the Olympics by Seetha Natesh (2021, Harper Children’s) celebrates 100 years of Indian athletes’ participation in the games. Shuttling to the Top: The Story of PV Sindhu by Krishnaswamy V (2020, HarperSport) and Unbreakable by MC Mary Kom (2013) are inspiring reads for teens.  Geography : The Olympics offer the perfect opportunity for children interested in geography  to familiarise themselves with the location of the countries and their flags. A good picture atlas and book of flags are invaluable resources to have on hand. Children’s Picture Atlas by Collin Kids (Collins, 2019) and The Book of Flags by Rob Colson (2017) are great options.  Culture: The host country, Japan, with its unique heritage on display at the opening ceremony had the children talking about manga, anime and a host of cartoons. Japanese folktales like The Boy Who Drew Cats by Anushka Ravishankar and Christine Kastl (2009), and Urashima Taro and Other Japanese Children’s Favourite Stories by Florence Sakade (2018) will give them a peek into the country’s rich traditions.  Science: Does Farting Make You Faster? by Glenn Murphy (2012) and The Secret Science of Sports by Jennifer Swanson (2021, Black Dog & Leventhal) are my choices to keep a child fascinated by the science of sport.  Poetry: I cannot resist suggesting the fun book of Olympic Poems: 100% Unofficial by Brian Moses and Roger Stevens (2016), as this is a genre not appreciated by many of my children.  Inclusivity : What Are The Paralympic Games? by Gail Herman (2020, Penguin Workshop) details why the paralympics was started, while two Indian published sports themed books Against All Odds by Ramendra Kumar (2016) and Kittu’s Very Bad Day by Harshikaa Udasi (2017) appreciate diverse abilities.  The writer is a Chennai-based library educator who uses stories to open conversations around diverse topics.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Speak to the toothbrush||So my love-hate relationship with my dentist picked up where we left off pre-pandemic. Where I drop the mask, close my eyes and lie back. For a thorough professional clean-up, with 80’s rock playing in the background. Barring the saliva ejector, an inquisitive straw-like suction tube that sucks out moisture from the oral cavity, I can almost visualise a mini spa session. Till the hygienist drops her verdict — a hundred fillings or prepare for possible pain in the near future, a root canal, the removal of a tooth, an implant, thank you. Despite all that brushing and daily water flossing, perhaps pandemic snacking did me in. Which is why, armed with a dental plan for those fillings and squeaky clean teeth (for now), I decide to once again swap manual for electric and get on top of my brushing game. In the past, heavy vibration, the noise factor and maintenance have seen me repeatedly return to the simple toothbrush; often bamboo, for sustainable reasons. But the Oral-B iO8 from the world’s biggest electric toothbrush maker promises six times more plaque removal around the gumline, with the oscillating rotation and micro-vibrations of its round brush head. Another winning factor: the smart pressure sensor. Dentists’ concerns about gum recession and enamel loss are real, so the ring on the handle that lights up when there is excess pressure is a big plus (the red light is the one to avoid). By connecting via Bluetooth to my phone, I track my brushing technique in real time and can review improvements. The dentist-recommended two minutes is the default on this self-care gadget. Even with the teeth divided into zones on the phone and visual aid, it seems rather endless. For those who can’t get enough, the app allows changes to the timer from two minutes to four! With entry-level electric toothbrushes on Amazon at Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,500, should one put down Rs. 15,999 for the Oral-B iO8? It is rather steep, yes, and not compatible with brush heads of earlier Oral-B models. But the six smart modes include gentle cleaning for sensitive teeth, a deep cleanse, gum care for inflamed or bleeding gums, and a daily routine. And it tracks brushing coverage. The result? My teeth feel just as smooth and polished as it did at my dentist’s. Perhaps it will get me past another lockdown? Pity the Oral-B iO8 can’t do fillings too.  Look out for offers at Amazon.in, where the Oral-B iO8 comes at a reasonable discount.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/speak-to-the-toothbrush/article35643371.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Baradari’s 2021 edit||Baradari returns After raising close to Rs. 50 lakh for five weaver and embroidery communities in India last year, Baradari is back with its 2021 edition. The online fashion fundraiser conceptualised by actor Kareena Kapoor Khan and journalist Namrata Zakaria has already seen designers Sabyasachi, Tarun Tahiliani, Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla, Manish Malhotra, Anamika Khanna, Rahul Mishra, and Masaba, among others donate their signature products for an e-commerce sale next month. “Baradari is a wonderful initiative as it speaks about economic equality in the world of fashion and textiles. This is the most important conversation fashion in India needs to be having,” says Khan. The lineup also includes accessory labels Misho, Outhouse, and Rohira. Addressing the impact of Baradari 2020, Zakaria says the artisans and their communities have used their ‘seed capital’ wonderfully, “which is what Baradari intended the funds to be”. “A Srinagar-based embroiderer has paid off his home loan, our weaver from Benares purchased the next-door plot to store looms, a cluster in Burdwan, West Bengal, has been able to repair its homes and units ravaged by cyclone Amphan that hit last year,” she adds.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Realty sentiments remain upbeat||As per the recently-released 29th edition of the Knight Frank-FICCI-NAREDCO Real Estate Sentiment Index Q2 2021 (April - June 2021), future sentiments of real estate sector stakeholders remained optimistic in Q2 2021 despite the second wave of the pandemic. The survey report further highlights that the reaction of stakeholders to the second wave was not as severe as it was during the first wave as indicated by the relatively lesser drop in sentiment scores in Q2 2021. The Current Sentiment Score has dropped from 57 in Q1 2021 to 35 in Q2 2021, but the drop is less intense than it was during the first Covid-19 wave (Q2 2020) when the score had hit an all-time low of 22. The Future Sentiment Score has inched down marginally from 57 in Q1 2021 to 56 in Q2 2021 continuing to remain in the optimistic zone. Here as well, the outlook of stakeholders reflects more resilience in Q2 2021 than in Q2 2020, it reports. Key highlights In terms of geography, the West zone saw the sharpest recovery in the Future Sentiment Score. This zone’s Future Sentiment Score jumped from 53 in Q1 2021 to 60 in Q2 2021. With the resumption of economic activity, future sentiments (for the next six months) of stakeholders have remained in the optimistic zone, across most regions. Stakeholder outlook on office market saw an improvement in Q2 2021 especially with respect to leasing activity. In Q2 2021, 40% of survey respondents were of the opinion that office leasing activity would increase over the next six months, up from 34% last quarter. Around 21% of the Q2 2021 survey respondents, up from 15% in Q1 2021, expects office rents to increase in the next six months while 40% expect rents to remain stable. The optimism in residential market outlook has continued in Q2 2021. More than 50% of the Q2 2021 survey respondents continue to expect an increase in residential launches and sales in the coming six months. On the macroeconomic front, more than 80% of the Q2 2021 survey respondents continue to have an optimistic outlook for the economy in the coming six months. While on the credit availability front, stakeholder outlook has improved in Q2 2021 with 46% respondents — up from 41% in Q1 2021 — expecting an increase in the coming six months. Current Sentiment Score The Current Sentiment score dropped from 57 in Q1 2021 to 35 in Q2 2021, lowest in the last 12 months, moving into the pessimistic zone.  After the onset of the first wave of the pandemic, the Current Sentiment Score had recorded an all-time low score of 22 in Q2 2020. A score of 35 in Q2 2021, although still in the pessimistic zone, is indicative of a more resilient market compared to the last time. Future Sentiment Score  The Future Sentiment Score has inched down marginally from 57 in Q1 2021 to 56 in Q2 2021, indicating the continuity in the positive outlook of market stakeholders. Developments such as relaxations in lockdowns and restrictions, and the re-opening of offices since June 2021 have buoyed the stakeholder outlook for the coming six months.  The impact of the second wave was lesser on the Future Sentiment Score than on the Current Sentiment Score reflecting the market’s preparedness to bounce back from the disruptions caused by the harrowing phases of the pandemic. Zonal Future Sentiment Score  Buoyed by the post-second wave resumption of economic activity, future sentiments of stakeholders for the next six months have remained in the optimistic zone across most regions.  North zone’s score has inched down marginally from 56 in Q1 2021 to 55 in Q2 2021, while for the South zone, the score has fallen from 63 in Q1 2021 to 57 in Q2 2021.  The East region has entered the pessimistic zone with a fall from 53 in Q1 2021 to 48 in Q2 2021.  In contradiction to such drops, the West zone’s score has climbed up this quarter, going from 53 in Q1 2021 to 60 in the second quarter of this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/realty-sentiments-remain-upbeat/article35643407.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Betting on branded housing||Leading listed developers continue their winning streak, with homebuyer preferences increasingly favouring them. Listed players now have their eyes set on tier 2 and 3 cities — take for instance Bengaluru-based Puravankara and Sobha who will expand to Kochi, Coimbatore, GIFT City, Hosur, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram. The listed developers considered are Brigade Enterprises, Godrej Properties, Kolte-Patil, Mahindra Lifespace Developers, Prestige Estates, Puravankara, and Sobha. Data from the financial presentations of the top seven listed realty companies reveals that they are gearing up to launch approx. 92.5 million sq. ft. of new residential space within the next 1-2 years. Apart from the top cities, the developers are also zeroing in on major tier 2 and 3 cities, and at least 70-75% of this supply may be launched in FY2022 itself. Finances in check These listed developers’ corresponding financial presentations data from previous financial years indicates a steady y-o-y growth in new launches. Despite COVID-19 in FY2021, the total new launches by these top seven listed players rose by 11% against the preceding FY — from approx. 28.3 million sq. ft. in FY2020 to approx. 31.37 million sq. ft. in FY2021. The current expansion pipeline of approx. 92.5 million sq. ft. clearly indicates that strong, listed developers will continue to dominate the new residential supply and accelerate their market share gain. “COVID-19 has driven a lot of latent demand into tier 2 and 3 cities,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, adding, “This demand is driven by the improved economic growth, infrastructural developments, lower cost of living and more attractive real estate prices in these cities. However, it is the new Work From Home (WFH) dynamic which has worked most strongly in their favour as they continue to attract migrant professionals riding on the WFH option.” Demand metrics The days when these cities’ residential supply was dominated by local players will soon be over. Demand is also chasing projects by leading developers, so their expansion into tier 2 and tier 3 cities is a given. “These players have extremely ambitious expansion plans for the next two years. Even if 70% of their total projected new supply of approx. 92.5 million sq.ft. is launched in FY2022, they will have doubled their footprint as against the preceding financial year 2021, when they launched approx. 31.37 million sq.ft. residential space,” explains Puri. The robust housing sales by the top seven listed real estate players in the previous financial years has been a huge confidence booster for them. Data indicates that these listed players cumulatively sold approx. 32.61 million sq.ft. of housing in FY2021 despite the pandemic — an increase of 7% over FY2020, when approx. 30.45 million sq.ft. area was sold. The direction of housing demand after the pandemic started unfolding now guides their next steps — tier 2 and tier 3 cities are definitely the new growth precincts to explore.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Down in the mud||It is easy to find the home of Jose Master near Perinthalmanna, in Kerala. Similarly, Hamza Kakkadavath’s residences, near Changaramkulam, is well-known in the neighbourhood. Set in the State’s Malappuram district, both houses have become talking points for their clever use of modern technology combined with sustainable materials. Built by 75-year-old Madhavan Namboodiri — a retired water management specialist who operates from Kuttippuram, a rural village in Malappuram — they were constructed last year. Namboodiri began researching building materials and methods that cause least damage to the earth in 2018. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit a year later, underlining the need for us to lead more sustainable lives, he began work in earnest. “It is ironic that sustainable architecture, meant to be affordable, is expensive — like any organic lifestyle. We need to reverse that. In fact most of the burning environmental issues of Kerala are due to poorly conceived habitat systems,” he says. Namboodiri’s interest in sustainable management of natural resources began as a 22-year-old. In 1966, he started work with a national NGO, AFPRO, in villages across India, and spent nearly 25 years imbibing indigenous wisdom. Later, as a freelance consultant to national and international agencies, he worked on several sustainable water management and water governance projects. One of his prominent works includes Punarjani, a project in collaboration between the French Government and Government of Kerala for regeneration of the environment and livelihood avenues of the Tsunami affected regions in Alappuzha. Going past Baker Inspired by legendary architect Laurie Baker, who did pioneering work in the field, as well as proponents of mud architecture like G Sankar and Thrissur based P K Sreenivasan, he began drawing up his own plans to create a sustainable housing model. Baker’s technique of using terracotta tiles requires clay mining, which Namboodiri says uses excessive heat energy in the kilns and creates carbon dioxide emissions. Mud architecture, using the traditional rammed earth and cob method too, proved unsatisfactory on the count that it requires building thicker walls, and hence space is compromised. He also found it labour intensive and expensive. Namboodiri ’s experiments with soil led to the conclusion that, by and large, the soil of Kerala, except of the coastal area, is suitable for making compressed stabilised bricks. His method is to use soil from the site to which a small percentage of stabiliser — such as fly ash, lime or cement — is added. “Soil is ground in a portable machine and made into blocks under high compression using a hand operated brick making machine. The idea of portable units was chosen because the blocks are to be made in situ, by locals and generate employment for them. Almost 350 to 500 blocks can be made by two people in a day,” he says. These Shanghai model bricks have a central hole and produce walls with vertical holes that run throughout the height, thus facilitating passage of electrical wiring and plumbing pipes. It also enables insertion of vertical reinforcement bars at appropriate intervals to increase stability, he explains. “The finished walls are internally given a smooth coat of a mix of clay, powdered sand and plaster of Paris, and externally two coats of varnish are applied. As conventional mortar, plastering and paint is not required, construction is faster, requires less labour and it is cost effective. At the same time, this method retains all the advantages of a mud wall,” adds the expert. The soil story Namboodiri stresses on the importance of using soil from the site to make bricks. “Just making a mud house does not give you ecological sanction. Where is the mud coming from is a big question,?” he asks, adding that mud mining is damaging to the environment, and leads to serious loss of agricultural land. By insisting that soil from the site is used in construction, the excavation of mud leaves a pit, which can be repurposed, as an underground rain harvesting receptacle covered with a lawn, a pond, a swimming pool, or even an underground car park. At Master’s house, he used soil from a neighbouring plot, which was scooped out to make a well. One inch thick machined coconut planks are nailed over the joist to make the first floor, thus avoiding the need to use flooring materials. Coconut rafters and clay tiles are used to build the roof. “Coconut timber is an integral part of Kerala landscape, it is recyclable, strong and available in plenty,” he says. The roof has openings that exhausts hot air from the interior, keeping the house cool. He approaches a habitat holistically, offering other sustainable solutions like water conservation, solid waste management and renewable energy.“It has to be a total package with grey water recycling, bio gas, solar panels,” he says. Kakkadavath’s 3,200 sq.ft. three storied house, which includes a boundary wall and gate, was built at a cost of Rs. 50 lakhs, (Rs. 1,500 per sq.ft.). In comparison the rammed earth model (Rs. 2,000 per sq ft); the Laurie Baker model (1,800 per sq.ft.), and concrete (1,800 per sq.ft.) are costlier. Work in progress With two houses ready and more experimental work in the pipeline, (wooden houses and log cabins) Namboodiri is encouraged by the enthusiastic response to these homes. But, he is also guarded in his success, “I still have to address many grey areas before I can claim that I am making a sustainable house. I am not an environmental fundamentalist and am prepared to compromise until sustainable alternatives are developed,” he says. Meanwhile, Kakkadavath is proud of his choice. “My wife, Shyny, and I were looking for a house that avoids four things: pomp, concrete, air conditioning and bore wells. Our home is simple and traditional. Thanks to the wooden floors, cool walls and cross ventilation we do not need fans. And we have no worries for the summers as our rain water tank is full,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/down-in-the-mud/article35643402.ece

I submitted all the necessary documents along with the registration fee of Rs. 800. My plot is located at Alamathi village, Sholavaram Panchayat, but the CMDA rejected my application on the grounds that it comes under a catchment area. This is surprising as the survey number of my plot is 307, whereas plots under survey number 312 do not come under a catchment area - which is not far away from our plot. In its notification, the CMDA has not mentioned that such plots in catchment areas will not be given approval. How do I proceed? A S Thirumalai Chennai The regularisation of the unapproved plots can be done only if certain conditions/parameters are met. If the authorities have rejected your application on reasonable grounds, you may not have any remedy. In December 2016, I bought a flat from a developer with a proper agreement and registered it with a bank loan of Rs. 32 lakh. From this amount, I had paid Rs. 28.5 lakh at the time of registration. The developer delayed the project’s completion beyond the agreement period. Out of seven flats, six were completed and handed over to their owners. My flat is yet to be completed, and I approached the Consumer Court and a case was filed in June 2018. The matter is still pending (case status-adjourned) for the past three years. I am facing heavy monetary losses due to this. How do I go about this process? R. Saravanan Chennai Since the matter is pending in the Consumer Redressal Forum, we cannot comment on the same.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Pearls on Zoom and suits||Pearls are shedding their prim, old-fashioned tag and enjoying a contemporary comeback. The New York Fashion Week 2020 set the tone, with designers such as Marc Jacobs, Prabal Gurung, and Jason Wu pairing their outfits with gorgeous strands and large, asymmetrical pieces. Since then, we’ve spotted these classics on modern tastemakers, including Harry Styles and Rihanna. And don’t forget, when Kamala Harris was sworn in as America’s first female vice-president this January, she accessorised her purple Christopher John Rogers dress with a custom pearl necklace by Wilfredo Rosado. The fact that the oldest-known gems are seeing a resurgence doesn’t surprise Chennai-based entrepreneur and designer, Mita Banker. “It’s always appropriate to wear pearls; they are evergreen,” she exclaims. The force behind 32-year-old fashion jewellery brand, Estele, Banker launched her second brand, Isadore, in 2018, to create collections that draw inspiration from her travels. Like her first collection, Ottoman Empire — the pomegranate design, worn for good luck and prosperity, was a hit among Delhiites when she exhibited there. “I pull out things from my travels. Then I research the ideas and launch my designs,” she says.  Channelling royalty  Banker is full of stories about pearls. “La Peregrina is the world’s most famous [the 58½ carat gem was gifted by actor Richard Burton to Elizabeth Taylor],” she reminds me, sharing how pearls have always been worn as a sign of wealth. “Queens Victoria and Elizabeth favoured them; our n awabs and maharajas flaunted them. Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur was famous for her chiffons-and-pearl look.” Now, she is offering that touch of royalty with her collection that she co-creates with clients who are so inclined. On offer: seed, round and oval pearls, along with coloured ones — in grey, champagne, peach, and pink. “You could buy them in strands or bunches, and have aunique piece designed for yourself,” she says. If coming up with your own design is tedious, pick up something from the Isadore line of bracelets, earrings, and necklaces. “I’ve created a half-black-half-white neck piece with onyx and pearls,” she says, adding that customers must check out the double strand pearl neck piece with rubies and emeralds. “These gems fit well with the corporate environment — team it with a suit or wear a saath lada haar with a sari.” So, when Zoom calls demand you look sharp at 9 am, don pearls for instant glam.  Prices from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 40,000. Details: 9840752100||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/pearls-on-zoom-and-suits/article35643970.ece

And it has the exact same concept as our ballet.’ ‘I still don’t get it,’ I said. ‘You’re hopeless,’ mami said. ‘Which is why you’re still languishing in Besant Nagar when even our istriwallah Marimuthu has got his green card. Don’t you see the hand of foreign powers?’ I ignored her jibe. ‘ Arré , can’t you see this is an attempt by that diabolical double agent Amrutavalli to malign my daughter’s reputation. Just before my daughter is awarded the Natya Gandabherunda award instituted by the Semi-legal Hispanic Gardeners Society of New Jersey?’ ‘I guess,’ I said. ‘Remember, the same thing happened two years ago, just before she was awarded the Bhava Parakashta Natya Samayochitani by the East Coast Parents of NRIs Dedicated To Grandchild Welfare Association.’ ‘What happened?’ ‘The organiser was hospitalised. After eating the badam halwa made by my daughter at the pre-award dinner.’ ‘I don’t get it.’ ‘It was poisoned, fool,’ said Ambujam mami . ‘By that Amrutavalli woman, who hacked into my daughter’s phone, and slyly added an ingredient to the recipe my daughter was using that nearly killed the man. Award was cancelled. And my innocent child was saved only because the DA’s nephew learns mridangam from my son-in-law.’ ‘I still don’t get it,’ I said. ‘Putin, you gnanashunyam , Putin!’ Ambujam Mami spat out. ‘With the possible involvement of Kim Jong Un and Meryl Streep. That’s who that Amrutavalli is working for, my sources tell me.’ When I continued staring, mami continued. ‘This is an attempt to bring disrepute to the patriotic NRIs of USA, I say!’ she said. ‘Sundar Pichai, Priyanka Chopra, my daughter — these foreign powers are unable to handle the glory coming their way. And they’re using a turncoat like Amrutavalli to achieve their ends. I am not going to let that happen.’ ‘What are you going to do, mami ?’  Mami gave me a look that would have made MN Nambiar go ‘Mummy!’ ‘ Margazhi is coming, no?’ she said. ‘She won’t know what hit her.’ Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist.

31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Voices from Maximum City||Raghu Karnad fondly recalls how, out of the blue, he and a friend chanced upon dolphins off the Bandra Bandstand rocks. “It struck me suddenly that we in Mumbai see the sea as scenery, as a backdrop, and not as a living world filled with creatures that are our neighbours,” says the writer-journalist. This sense of wonder was one of the starting points of Marine Lines , a 10-part podcast that Karnad (winner of the 2019 Windham-Campbell Prize in the non-fiction category) is hosting. Produced by Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic and DeadAnt Studios, it explores “Mumbai’s hidden worlds, from the suburbs to the sea”. The magic of the ordinary The conversations cover natural spaces (like the Sanjay Gandhi National Park), the creatures that inhabit them (everything from leopards to sea slugs), as well as broader topics like urban consumption patterns and sustainability. They seek to introduce listeners to ecosystems they may not have given a second thought to. “The podcast was pitched to me by the producers who wanted to explore Mumbai’s natural spaces and ecosystems, and I leapt at the idea,” says Karnad over the phone, adding that they recorded most of the episodes during the second wave, in April. “One of the things that I felt deprived of during that time, psychologically, was access to public, shared spaces. So the opportunity to have these conversations, to imagine I’m there with experts who’ve spent a lot of time documenting these areas, appealed to me,” he says. The three episodes so far have featured marine wildlife photographer Shaunak Modi (also director of the Coastal Conservation Foundation), actor Dia Mirza (also UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador), and wildlife biologist Nikit Surve. Future guests include writer Amitav Ghosh, and film critic Anupama Chopra. Karnad’s guests not only document their own experiences with the natural world, but also point out the various ways in which the lives of entire communities intersect with environmental issues. For example, Surve’s podcast mentions his brief encounter with a young Warli girl living in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, who was nonplussed at seeing a leopard pass by. “I had so many emotions running through me, but she was so casual. She said that leopards often walk past their home, and the next morning we discovered that there’s even a local deity, Waghoba (in Marathi, ‘ wagh ’ covers both tigers and leopards),” he said. Making space for the wild How does one convince the average urban-dweller to think a little bit more about the environment, especially? That’s the problem Marine Lines wants to tackle. It is as much of an outreach issue as a scientific one, which is where the podcast can be a great resource: the conversations are accessible and broad-ranging, yet rooted in distinctive spaces. The host comes across not as an expert, but as someone learning with the audience. Karnad says, “Shaunak Modi had this great line in the first episode — ‘you don’t protect what you don’t love and you can’t love what you don’t know exists’. It made such an impression on me and the producers, and we treated it like our motto for the remaining nine episodes.” Although this edition is Mumbai-centric, Karnad, who grew up in Bengaluru, hopes to host similar conversations for other cities. “I’d love to be able to do them for Delhi — it has The Ridge [in the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor], rivers, and more green spaces than Mumbai,” concludes the host.  Marine Lines is   available on Spotify, Gaana, Hubhopper and Audible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/voices-from-maximum-city/article35643961.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Growing up non-binary in today’s India||“I knew I was different. I didn’t fit into what boys used to like or what girls used to like, but I didn’t know the words,” says Rubani Singh, 19, a budding pastry chef from Mumbai, who identifies as non-binary and prefers to be addressed by the pronouns they/them instead of she/her. Confused? If the usage of pronouns on social media bios, and the number of young people contacting therapists are any indication, an increasing number of children, teenagers and young adults are identifying themselves as non-binary — an umbrella term for people who do not see themselves as fitting into the gender binaries of exclusively male or female. They may not identify with any particular gender (agender), may not have fixed which gender they identify with most or may not want to be restricted by any gender (genderfluid), may encompass a bit of both genders (bigender), or may identify completely with the binary that’s across from them (someone born female could identify with the male gender and, therefore, chooses to be a trans man). The incongruence sets in because the world doesn’t see them the way they see themselves. Publicly listing the pronouns they are comfortable with on their social media handles is one step towards bridging this. “I don’t see it as a phenomenon, something fashionable or cool. I think it’s because young people have found the language to express what they are experiencing,” says Shelja Sen, Child & Adolescent Psychologist, who counsels gender non-conforming youngsters at Delhi’s Children First, along with her husband, psychiatrist Dr Amit Sen. Access to the internet, online support groups that offer safe spaces to communicate, lived experiences, and representation via OTT shows, books and movies, have all helped non-binary people find a voice. Popular celebrities such as singer Miley Cyrus, actors Amandla Stenberg and Elliot Page, and songwriter-singer Sam Smith speaking up has also helped. Perhaps what Smith said in a BBC interview explains it best: “I’ve always had a little bit of a war going within my body and my mind… I’m not male or female, I think I flow somewhere in between. It’s all on the spectrum.”  Transitions are never easy  “I can see a clear cultural shift and an acceptance [within a younger age group] of a spectrum of gender identities,” says Dr Amit Sen. “However, what we are witnessing is only in small pockets and the stigma still runs deep.” Fighting on the frontlines to make this change happen is Delhi-based Air Cmde (Dr) Sanjay Sharma (Retd), CEO and MD of ATHI (Association for Transgender Health in India). His journey from commanding Air Force hospitals to taking premature retirement to set up ATHI has been paved with years of personal struggle as his first-born male child — now a 26-year-old trans woman — started exhibiting a non-binary narrative early on. Like most parents, they had initially dismissed it as a phase. “It started with him wearing my wife’s heels, trying on her make-up, and asking me to buy Barbie dolls for his sister which he would then play with. As puberty hit, there was bullying, and as the male features became pronounced, he started withdrawing, became impulsive,” recalls Dr Sharma, who is also a board member of WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health). “At age 14, he came out to his mother thinking he was homosexual. However, he did not fit into that peer group and the mental health issues began getting worse.” Meetings with several mental health professionals followed, but the self-harm continued. One day, Dr Sharma got a call from his very disturbed son, wanting to end his life. “I had to make a decision and I decided to stand by my child.” Post-surgery, Tia now works with her father at ATHI, which aims to provide holistic care for trans people.  Finding acceptance at home  The realisation of gender or the questioning of ‘who am I’ starts fairly early. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, by age two, children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls, and by the time they turn four, they have a pretty good idea of their gender identity. “When people referred to me as a girl, it never resonated with me,” says Vibha Hegde, 22, a BBA student from Bengaluru who identifies as non-binary. “Sometimes, when I look in the mirror, I can’t recognise myself. My chest makes me very uncomfortable, and I feel like my head has been Photoshopped on to my body.” They went through the usual labelling of ‘tomboy’ for their masculine gender expression via clothes and hairstyles, and initially thought they were a trans man. Once they knew, they told their mother. “She didn’t understand at first, but is now very understanding. She told my dad too, but he’s never brought it up. He’s very conservative and I don’t have the courage to talk to him,” they admit. Emotional distress, especially non-acceptance from parents, can lead to several problems. “Many years ago, we had an eight-year-old girl who had strong gender dysphoria and eventually developed severe psychological problems because of it. Anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, self-mutilation, massive guilt, confusion, could all be outcomes,” says Dr Amit Sen. Usually dysphoria gets aggravated at puberty, he adds. Parental acceptance is key to a child leading an emotionally and psychologically fulfilling life. But parents often find it hard to come to terms, often blaming themselves. Hemangi Vyawahare, a queer affirmative psychotherapist practising in Mumbai and Bengaluru, says several parents call her, worried about whether society would accept their child, would their child be bullied, sexually abused, and so on. “The realisation that the future they have envisaged for their child is not going to be the same now, is what engulfs them,” she says. It’s difficult for young people, too. “The journey can be painful and long. There is confusion and doubt, it takes time to accept, to speak to your parents, to find your tribe. But for a child to hear from their parent ‘I have your back, no matter what’, makes a huge difference,” says Shelja Sen.  Taking it to schools  “I didn’t know I was non-binary,” says Rubani. Growing up, they were equally excited by an older cousin’s make-up and skirts, and a male cousin’s toys. At 13, they used to like wearing shorts but with a palazzo underneath. It was only when their supportive brother showed them a poem that deeply resonated with them that they started searching for online support groups (Pause for Perspective helped), and spoke to their parents. “I feel very privileged that everyone has been so supportive,” they say. Rubani doesn’t feel the need to change their name as it is gender-neutral, and though “there are a few parts I want to dispose of”, they want to understand their body better. They shaved their head during the pandemic but the only permanent step they’ve taken is a fresh tattoo designed by them, featuring the non-binary gender sign. “It’s a big achievement for me.” Not everyone is so fortunate. “Many children who come to me have been dismissed, invalidated, and are coming from a place of hurt. They first ask me if I’m queer-affirmative; what they are basically asking is ‘is this a safe space?’” says Vyawahare. Of course, schools are the big bastions where change is key. “Schools can have gender-neutral bathrooms [or let trans kids use the restroom of the gender they are expressing], make uniforms inclusive, and make language more accommodating. The management, teachers and support staff, all need to undergo sensitisation workshops. And instead of sex education, they should have relationship education and teach consent, borders, gender,” says Vyawahare, who has worked with schools on gender and sexuality. Vedica Saxena, a TEDx speaker and project director at Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, says the school launched Breaking Barriers, a student-led campaign to raise awareness about the LGBTQIA+ community way back in 2013. “We use inclusive language [policeperson not policeman], ensure everyone feels safe to speak freely without any teacher hushing them, have a curriculum that is free of gender stereotypes, and have trained counsellors. We want to raise empathetic and informed students.” While it all sounds easy, the fact is such systemic change needs to be introduced across the board with everyone being mindful of it all the time.  Calling all allies  India is very reflective of the world. While large-scale surveys haven’t been carried out in most countries, a 2016 study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law showed that at least 0.5% of Americans identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. Estimates place the UK’s non-binary population at 1%. And countries are beginning to officially recognise non-binary people; Argentina just became the first Latin American country to allow people to choose the gender X on documents; Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some US states also allow the same. So does India. As the world moves towards inclusivity, we need to bring up children who have a voice, have safe spaces to speak up, and this needs to move beyond just their homes, their friends and family. Ram Sinha, co-founder of Pride Circle, a Bengaluru-based Diversity & Inclusion organisation, says the way forward for non-binary recognition is the way the LGBTQIA+ community did it: through education and exposure. In a country where more than half the population is below the age of 25, many youth are already allies and strong advocates. The onus now lies on us as parents to educate ourselves and find the vocabulary to raise and support gender non-conforming children. “Parents must question their own gender roles at home, reduce gender stereotyping, include diversity in their social circle by say, inviting a gay couple home, so children develop a diverse worldview and realise this is okay,” concludes Vyawahare.  If you are in crisis, call the 24x7 helpline at Aasra (9820466726).   “[When I spoke with my parents] my dad was very quiet. He is old-school; it’s hard on him. I think he felt I might make changes to my body, but I assured them that I’m the same person. My relatives started showing me a lot of love and even now, if they misgender [calling them she, for instance] me, I keep correcting them”  Rubani , 19, a budding Mumbai-based pastry chef||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/growing-up-non-binary-in-todays-india/article35643969.ece
31 July 2021||New Delhi,||Assembly passes GST (Amendment) Bill||The Delhi Legislative Assembly, on the final day of its two-day monsoon session, passed the Delhi GST (Amendment) Bill 2021 and amendments to the ambitious ‘Bed and Breakfast Scheme’. While the GST (Amendment) Bill was presented for the dual purpose of removing difficulties faced by taxpayers of the Capital and to increase the accountability of people who evade taxes by making them liable, the amended Bed and Breakfast Scheme will seek to promote tourism in Delhi. “There have been small changes in 15 sections in the Bill and Schedule II, paragraph 7 is being omitted from the Bill,” Mr. Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said while tabling the Bill. “These changes have been incurred after looking at the experiences and receiving feedback of the business people and these amendments have been approved in the 39th GST Council Meeting after wide deliberations,” he also said. He stated that the proposed Delhi GST (Amendment) Bill 2021 has been brought up to ease the difficulties of people, smoothen the process of GST and to further make all those people who took advantage of the GST being a new act accountable and “hence took money from the people but did not commit it to the government.” Lens on tax evaders This proposed amendment Bill will hold all these people who evade taxes as liable, he said. Listing the features of the proposed amendment, Mr. Sisodia said one of its key features was the removal of the requirement of compulsory submission of audited annual accounts and reconciliation statements for the registered taxpayers. “Since, the audit and reconciliation was earlier necessary, traders had to be reliant on chartered and cost accountants,” he said. Further, in case of detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyance in transit, the goods can be released on the payment of penalty only as opposed to the previous practice of goods being released on the payment of applicable tax and penalty. To stop some wrong practices of evading taxes, the GST council has ascertained that attachment of property and bank accounts is permitted not only of the taxable person but also of the other beneficiaries. This amendment, he said, was targeted at those individuals who set up fake firms under names of other individuals and get away with claiming taxes. “Now, this amendment will ensure these master minds are held liable,” he said. Fillip to tourism Mr. Sisodia also moved a motion before the House to amend the ‘Bed and Breakfast Scheme’ under which houses will now get registered in 30 days instead of 90 days. The Deputy Chief Minister, who also holds the tourism portfolio, stated tourists, especially foreign tourists, can stay in an Indian family’s home for the purpose of experiencing Indian familial traditions and culture under the scheme. In order to cover more and more households under it, he said, the Delhi government had reduced the entire process of registration from 90 days to 30 days by making changes in it. “Along with this, the landlords will not have to go to the offices to get the certificate, but will be provided with the certificate online,” he said. Under the scheme, landlords who live in properties along with their families with one to six rooms that are empty and not in the category of a guest house, lodge, or hotel can apply, he said. This scheme, Mr. Sisodia stated, will not only benefit tourists but will also be a source of income for the hosts. Tourists, he added, can directly contact the landlord without coming in contact with any middleman. “So far 1,630 rooms of 347 houses have been registered under the ‘Bed and Breakfast Scheme’. This number will increase rapidly after the government changes the rules to promote tourism,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assembly-passes-gst-amendment-bill/article35643628.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||The New Normal||The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life as we know it. As the rate of infections begins to slow down, early signs of recovery are appearing with businesses, schools, colleges, institutes, cinema halls, restaurants and malls starting to slowly reopen with Government mandated protocols and sanctions. The last year saw markets and physical stores shut down all over the world. The global pandemic has shaken the retail sector to its core, but with challenge comes opportunity. Though COVID-19 accelerated a shift away from physical locations, there is still a huge role for traditional retail to play in the new hybrid world. Some aspects of a shopping experience simply require the personal touch and can never be recreated or replaced by a 2-D or 3-D image on a screen. Consumers stayed home for months, clicking and browsing on digital devices for their daily needs and indulgences. But as the pandemic has shown, the value of personal attention may be far greater than the credit given to it. The pleasure of tangibly browsing and physically checking out each product, garment and item is irreplaceable. The sheer joy of window-shopping (not on a digital window platform, but in an actual brick-and-mortar store), roaming through the aisles of a mall, checking out the latest launches, and chancing upon an unplanned-for-but-just-perfect item while browsing through a store… these are unparalleled joys that are sorely missed by the average shopper. The COVID-19 virus is here to stay. That is an indisputable fact. And now, co-existing with virus is the need of the day. There is no going back. Although fortunately, thanks to the massive drives and efforts by the governments – both local and central; a direct result of the swift vaccine rollout, implementation of safety norms and growing optimism, is the emergence of a distinct path to a promising future. It is now the time of the ‘New Normal’. There is no doubt that consumers are looking forward to the idea of returning to traditional in-store experiences. There will always be room in the market for quality goods and services; and providing services is where retailers score. In-store services add to the customer experience as a focal point right next to product and service quality. Although at least initially, when it comes to in-store shopping, things are going to be a bit awkward for a while. Some consumers will want to wear masks and keep their distance, others will yearn to return to their pre-COVID shopping habits. But practicality, safety and common sense has to take precedence. Shoppers have to realise that wearing masks, using sanitizers and following basic hygiene protocols is for the better good of everyone. After more than a year of staying-at-home, working and studying from home, closed markets and malls, quarantines, and restrictions; people in general are ready, or rather desperate to venture out of their homes and attend offices, schools, colleges, visit malls and markets, travel for pleasure and work… basically live life normally, rather than stay cooped indoors. The work-from-home scenarios are gradually on the downtrend with many companies and educational institutions opening up in a gradual and phased manner. And with people are getting ready to attend offices and colleges, the need for new clothes and accessories is on the rise. Armed with temperature checks and vaccinations, consumers are eager to get back to shopping, as stores and malls are also re-opening. Also, with a spree of festivals in the next few months, shoppers are eager to replenish their wardrobes and invest in the latest devices and gadgets. Topping the shopping list are clothes, make-up, jewellery, footwear, bags, purses and more; even luxury items and branded goods. The modern, post-COVID consumer has a new set of preferences and expectations when it comes to retail, and business owners have to adapt to stay relevant and thrive. Accordingly, keeping in tune with the need of the day, stores have adapted to the ‘New Normal’ by introducing a slew of safety measures - like providing a sanitized ambience, masked attendants, availability of sanitizers at store entrances, checking temperature of every employee and even customers, ensuring hygienic surroundings and even getting their employees vaccinated on a priority basis. After all, it is essential to ensure consumer confidence. COVID restrictions have become more ‘normal’, in the sense, people are now more acclimatised to the use of masks, face shields, sanitizers, maintaining distances and washing hands frequently. And as they get more accustomed to these safety measures, consumers are also getting more adventurous and innovative as well. Like travel and tourism has also seen a revival of sorts, post the enforced lock-downs. Which is why even the automobile sector has witnessed an increase in sales, as quite a sizeable number of families prefer travelling in their own vehicles rather than taking unnecessary risks with public transport. A ‘road-trip’ is the new norm. Especially amongst the automobile enthusiasts who enjoy the sheer joy of a long drive. Alternatively, people opt for at least covering a significant distance travelling by air, and then leasing a vehicle for local travel for the duration of their stay. If travellers and tourists are ready to visit, then hoteliers are also ready to welcome them with adequate arrangements as well. Sanitized rooms and services is now a common feature provided by hotels of repute. With the service industry and retailers striving to provide a sanitized and safe environment for consumers, the accountability of behaving responsibly falls on the consumer. For instance; wearing a mask or a face-shield when stepping into any store or institute, using sanitizers as and when necessary, avoiding creating a crowd unnecessarily, conforming to the requests of the service personnel towards safe shopping and travelling, and generally observing safety and hygiene protocols. Almost everything in today’s world has completely changed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Stepping into a store or getting a service of any sort is drastically different now than it was in 2019. And with the impact of the pandemic expected to last for years, people will be adjusting to changes long after COVID-19 has been contained. And life goes on. Welcome to the New Normal!     Focussing on a hands-on, experience-based, and practice-oriented approach towards learning, Centurion University has been successfully shaping lives and empowering communities since its inception.

31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||99.84% Class XII students clear CBSE exam in Delhi||In the CBSE Class XII results released on Friday, Delhi East and Delhi West saw a pass percentage of 99.84% — the second-highest in the country after Trivandrum (99.89%). Last year, the pass percentage for Delhi was 94.39%. In 2019, Delhi had a pass percentage of 91.87% and in 2018 result, it was 89%. Region-wise, in 2020, Delhi West and Delhi East were placed in fourth and fifth positions respectively in the national list with Trivandrum, Bengaluru and Chennai regions scoring better. The CBSE Class XII examination was scheduled to be conducted on May 4 but was cancelled due to the sharp rise in COVID cases. The board came out with an alternative policy for assessment that was cleared by the Supreme Court on June 17. The policy gave 40% contribution to marks obtained by students in Class XII based on unit test/mid-term and pre-board examination, 30% contribution to Class XI marks based on the theory component and 30% on the average theory component of the best three performing subjects out of main five subjects in Class X. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter to announce the results of the performance of Delhi govt. schools: “Congratulations to Delhi govt. schools students, teachers and parents Congrats Team Delhi Education Overall pass : 99.96% (97.92% last yr) 875 Schools have 100% result (396 last year) 885 students score above 95% (442 students last yr) Its historic! [sic].” Congratulating the students, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisoida tweeted: “Congratulations to all our class 12th students on your board exam results. I am extremely proud of you as you have survived extraordinary circumstances and adapted to the new form of learning. My best wishes for your journey ahead [sic].” This year, the CBSE had not released a merit list of a breakup of results between private and government schools in the Capital. The result for over 65,000 candidates is still being prepared and will be declared by August 5, the CBSE said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/9984-class-xii-students-clear-cbse-exam-in-delhi/article35643616.ece

31 July 2021||Patna,||MGNREGS registration needs improvement in Bihar: CAG||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report for the year ending March 31, 2019, has observed that registration of all potential job seekers, especially landless casual labourers, under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) needs to be substantially improved in Bihar. The report also says that the Bihar Mahadalit Vikas Mission (BMVM) had ineffective financial management. “Though Bihar has the highest number of landless casual labourers in the country at 88.61 lakh and 60.88 lakh (69%) were surveyed, only 3.34% (3,007 out of 90,161 of willing landless households) were issued job cards. In the test-checked districts, less than one per cent job-seekers (146 out of 22,678 willing landless households) were issued job cards and survey work was discontinued. Specific plans, as required, for providing employment opportunity to the vulnerable group of households were not prepared,” said the CAG report, which was tabled in the Bihar State Assembly on July 29. The report further observed that only 9%-14% of the registered disabled persons and 5%-9% of senior citizens were provided employment under the scheme during the 2014-19 period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mgnregs-registration-needs-improvement-in-bihar-cag/article35643611.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Police officers divided on Asthana’s appointment as chief||Delhi Police officers are divided on their opinion about the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the Police Commissioner. Mr. Asthana, a 1984-batch Gujarat cadre IPS officer, assumed office on Wednesday — a day after the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order and just four days before his retirement. A senior IPS officer termed it a good move, saying Mr. Asthana will have “clarity” on actions. “S.N. Shrivastava was the acting Commissioner in his entire tenure, but for one month. Balaji Srivastava was the interim chief till the new Commissioner was found. In Mr. Asthana, we have an officer who has been made the chief for the next one year — in a clearly written order. Unlike his predecessors, he will feel more confident in taking decisions because he doesn’t need to ensure that his position is safe.” The officer added that there is “nothing unconstitutional” in the appointment of Mr. Asthana as due procedure has been followed. “The appointment of the chief of police, especially in Delhi, is a political move and the Home Minister has the right to choose in his power. One cannot question Mr. Asthana’s seniority as he is senior to both the former Commissioners. There is no pending investigation against him...,” he said. Another senior IPS officer said since Mr. Asthana has been a trusted officer of the Home Minister and the Prime Minister for years, “there will be clarity in decision making”. “In Delhi, a lot of things happen in the national interest. For instance, riots broke out and investigations took place around the ‘toolkit’. As Mr. Asthana has a direct line with the top bosses, he will know what decision has to be taken and when. Because there will be no panic at his level… it will not percolate down the ranks,” he said. The officer added that Mr. Asthana’s — before his fallout with former CBI director Alok Verma wherein both levelled corruption charges against each other — was “brilliant” and known for his integrity. However, another senior IPS officer had a different opinion on the appointment and believed that it reflects badly on the AGMUT cadre. “Everyone knows he is a political appointee. A question arises on whether officers in the AGMUT cadre weren’t good enough that a Gujarat cadre officer had to be brought in. Has the leadership in AGMUT cadre failed,” he asked, adding that the appointment of Mr. Asthana may be challenged in court by someone wondering if the due course was followed. “The reason of his appointment has been given to be in public interest citing pandemic and farmer’s agitation. However, a pandemic is not a law and order issue and farmers have been sitting for eight months now,” he added. An Inspector-rank officer said he only hopes that Mr. Asthana’s arrival would lead to transparency and merit-based appointment of Station House Officers unlike “others” who used “different means” of selection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-police-officers-divided-on-asthanas-appointment-as-chief/article35643613.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Cut-offs for many UG courses likely to go up in Delhi University’||Principals of several colleges under Delhi University on Friday said the cut-offs for various merit-based undergraduate courses are likely to go up this year due to a higher number of students scoring above 95%. According to data provided by the CBSE, over 5.3% of candidates — a total of 70,004 students — have scored above 95%. 70,000 seats in DU According to DU officials, there are around 70,000 UG seats on offer this year. In 2020, over 38,000 students — 3.24% of candidates — had scored above 95%. Last year, the highest cut-offs announced in DU was by Lady Shri Ram College, with an asking score of 100% for three honours courses. Following the declaration of CBSE XII results, LSR principal Suman Sharma said while students have scored well this year, deliberations and analysis of data provided by DU will be required to project this year’s cut-off marks. Gargi College principal Promila Kumar said: “The cut-offs will definitely increase substantially. The university is in the process of framing policies. We can only analyse the data after that and see. But there is no doubt that the cut-offs will increase.” Several principals also added that the cut-off marks will also depend on the number of students applying to particular courses and colleges. Gyantosh Jha, principal of Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, said: “The high board exam scores will have an effect on the cut-off marks, but it will also depend on how many students apply...” Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, said: “The cut-offs will go higher but how much higher is something that will differ from college to college...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cut-offs-for-many-ug-courses-likely-to-go-up-in-delhi-university/article35643619.ece
31 July 2021||July 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Respond to shooter’s plea, HC tells panel||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI) to respond to an appeal by five-time Paralympian shooter Naresh Kumar Sharma challenging a July 27 High Court order that declined to interfere with his non-selection for the upcoming Tokyo Paralympics. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh also issued notice to the Centre on the plea and posted it for hearing on August 6. Advocate Varun Singh, representing Mr. Sharma, sought an early date for the hearing as the Tokyo Paralympics will commence on August 24, and the deadline for the Tokyo Paralympics 2020 (postponed because of the pandemic) Organising Committee to receive sports entry forms submitted by National Paralympic Committee. The High Court, however, refused the plea on the ground that Mr. Sharma should have approach the court “a little earlier and not at the last moment”. Mr. Sharma, an Arjuna and Rajiv Gandhi State Sports Awardee, said the High Court’s July 27 order failed to consider the facts in proper perspective when it refused to grant any relief to him, in spite of noting that the PCI had acted in violation of its own criteria in the selection of the Paralympic shooting team. The appeal stated that the Tokyo Paralympics are set to commence from August 24 and therefore, a direction can still be passed to the PCI to send Mr. Sharma’s name for his participation in the R7 shooting event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/respond-to-shooters-plea-hc-tells-panel/article35643623.ece
31 July 2021||New Delhi,||Water level continues to rise in Yamuna, crosses ‘danger mark’||The water level of the Yamuna in Delhi crossed the ‘danger mark’ on Friday morning and continued to rise during the day, according to authorities. The level measured at the Old Railway Bridge in Delhi was 205.34 metres at 11 a.m. and it increased to 205.58 by 8 p.m., as per official data. The warning level of Yamuna in Delhi is 204.5 metres and the danger mark is 205.33 metres — both measured at the Old Railway Bridge. The government has also started evacuation of people living close to the river, a process which happens during most monsoons in the national capital. “The government has been preparing since June and a control room was set up on June 15. In the East district, 15 vulnerable points were identified and we are erecting tents and are in the process of moving some people from these vulnerable points. It is an ongoing process and the administration is fully prepared,” said Sonika Singh, District Magistrate (East). The level is expected to rise further during the night. “At 6 p.m., 37,109 cusecs of water was being released from Hathnikund barrage in Haryana and we expect the water level to rise during the night in Delhi,” an official said. Hathnikund barrage is a point along the river in Haryana, upstream of Delhi, and water released from the barrage affects the flow of the river in Delhi. Orange alert issued Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert, predicting moderate rain on Saturday and warning of possible waterlogging in low-lying areas and major traffic disruptions The department has issued a yellow alert for Sunday, and orange alert also for Monday.

31 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Cash, gold seized from Odisha govt. employee||The vigilance department has unearthed assets worth Rs. 3.79 crore from a private secretary to a member of the Odisha Staff Selection Commission (OSSC). The assets are hugely disproportionate to the known source of income of Biranchi Narayan Sahoo, whose houses and that of his relatives were searched at six different locations in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack on Friday. Three teams, comprising 4 Deputy Superintendents of Police, 13 inspectors and other staff, were involved in the operation after the vigilance directorate was tipped off. They recovered cash amounting to Rs. 12 lakh from Mr. Sahoo’s house and Rs. 13 lakh from his brother-in-law’s residence. Gold ornaments worth over Rs. 60 lakh were also recovered. Two double-storey buildings at Niladri Vihar, a posh locality of Bhubaneswar, two buildings at Bhakti Vihar in Bhubaneswar and Godibandha in Cuttack districts were found to be in Mr. Sahoo’s possession. Besides, 14 prime plots were purchased by him in Bhubaneswar, Khordha and Puri.

31 July 2021||New Delhi,||Respond to misinformation charge, Ramdev told||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought response from Yoga guru Ramdev on a lawsuit filed by several doctors’ associations accusing him of spreading misinformation through his statements against allopathy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Justice C. Hari Shankar granted him a week’s time to submit his response. “Public nuisance has some consequences on the defendant [Mr. Ramdev]. It is open to the defendant to say that there is no case. Can’t say that I won’t give him an opportunity,” the court said. The court’s remark came after senior advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for the doctors’ associations, argued that to grant permission to institute the suit, the court had to only look at the plea before it and need not seek the other party’s response. Thecourt will hear the case on August 10. They alleged that Mr .Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for several people infected with COVID-19 dying, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing the deaths. The associations have submitted that the yoga guru was sowing doubts in the minds of general public with respect to the safety and efficacy of not only allopathic treatments, but also COVID-19 vaccines. It said that Mr. Ramdev being a highly influential person, it was apprehended that the statements could influence lakhs of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reply-to-misinformation-charge-hc-tells-ramdev/article35643621.ece
31 July 2021||New Delhi,||Ozone levels exceeding permitted levels: study||A Centre for Science and Environment study has found that ozone levels are exceeding the permitted levels even during winter in Delhi-NCR, making the smog more “toxic”. “Ozone is now a round-the-year problem requiring urgent [action] and the situation demands refinement of clean air action plan to add strategies for ozone mitigation, with stronger action on vehicles, industry and waste burning,” says CSE Executive Director Anumita Roychowdhury. Despite the pandemic and lockdowns, more days and locations witnessed higher and longer duration of ozone spells, the study said. Year-round menace Ozone, a highly reactive gas and dangerous for those suffering from respiratory conditions and asthma, is becoming more widespread in Delhi and NCR across all seasons, the CSE said. “Contrary to the notion that ozone, produced photochemically from interaction between gases in the presence of sunlight, is predominantly a summer phenomenon, the analysis finds the gas has emerged as an equally strong concern during winter as well,” it said. The study was done by analysing the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The CSE analysis found that the city-wide average largely remains within the standard with just occasional exceedance. But the ‘good’ category days have fallen to 115 days in 2020, which is 24 days less than in 2019. “A location-wise analysis presents a different story. It shows that exceedance of the eight-hour average standard is quite widely distributed in the city. At the moment, it is not possible to compute the peak pollution in the city as the data that is available from CPCB is capped at 200 ug/m3. This also makes daily AQI reporting ineffective,” the study said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ozone-levels-exceeding-permitted-levels-study/article35643631.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man held for killing uncle over ‘construction work’||A 27-year-old man has been arrested for killing his uncle in Dwarka, the police said on Friday. Two others have also been held in connection with the case. DCP (Dwarka) S.K. Meena said the accused have been identified as Rajbeer (27) and his friends Abhishek (19) and Lalit (24). The trio shot 63-year-old Ajeet Singh while he was sleeping. After this, the trio robbed a food delivery boy of his motocycle at gunpoint. On July 26, the victim had a fight with his nephew over construction work that was under way at the former’s house. The victim’s son and the accused’s father were also involved in the fight. Rajbeer had also allegedly threatened to kill Singh. The same day, he booked a room with his friends, got drunk and hatched a plan to kill Singh. Mr. Meena said with the help of technical surveillance, they traced Rajbeer’s location near Galaxy Royal hotel Ramphal chowk. A pistol with two live cartridges, the robbed motorcycle and mobile phones were recovered, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-held-for-killing-uncle-over-construction-work/article35643614.ece
31 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Out of nearly 2,000 people, 65% had no job in April and May, shows CPI(M) survey||The Delhi unit of CPI(M) on Friday released a report on the impact of the second COVID wave in Delhi-NCR. The survey showed that despite the additional ration entitlement announced by the government, 27% of the households got less than 5 kg ration per person in May this year. The survey also said out of 1,917 respondents across the Capital and Ghaziabad, 65% had no employment in April and May. “Even the rest faced a considerable loss of employment. Around 14% of them did not find any work for more than 30 days in two months, 6% for 15-30 days in two months and 4% for 15 days in two months. Only 3% of the respondents reported that they did not face any loss of employment,” the report read. The report also reflected that 72% of those, who worked as casual workers before the second wave, had no jobs during April and May. “While most casual workers became unemployed, those who were self-employed were also unable to work for many days. Hence, they saw their incomes falling drastically,” the report said. The survey also showed that a large section was also unable to access subsidised foodgrains through the public distribution system during the second wave. Letter to CM In a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the party said around 78% of the workers had not received their first dose of COVID vaccine. “This tardy pace has to be reversed and the government must ensure at least one dose vaccination for all workers in the unorganised sector by August 15. This should form part of the preparedness of the Delhi government for an imminent third wave. The health infrastructure must be ramped up in tune with the peak load of the second wave with oxygen plants at hospitals, more ICU beds and fresh recruitment of health workers,” the memorandum read. CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat said the survey underlined the urgent need for cash transfer of Rs. 7,500 to the working-class households.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/out-of-nearly-2000-people-65-had-no-job-in-april-and-may-shows-cpim-survey/article35643618.ece

31 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||FIR against hospital on charges of extortion||An FIR has been registered against Paras Hospital management in Sector 43 on charges of extortion for illegally charging parking fee from vehicles parked in the open. According to the FIR, the police involved the complainant Ramesh Kumar into the investigation following a complaint from the Zonal Taxation Officer-III of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) in this connection and found that the Paras Hospital management had committed an offence under Section 384 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code by illegally charging parking fee from the vehicles parked in the open. The FIR has been registered at Sushant Lok Police Station. Mr. Kumar, an RTI activist, said he had gone to the hospital with his friend in September last when the hospital charged him for parking his vehicle outside the hospital premises on the roadside and he pursued the matter with the police and the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) to get the case registered. Tax rebate “A little investigation on my part revealed that the hospital was seeking rebate in property tax from the municipal corporation claiming that basement-2 of the hospital was allowed for free parking. But it was found that commercial activities were being run from the second basement. When the MCG pointed out this, the hospital readily paid Rs. 16 lakh property tax with penalty,” said Mr. Kumar.Paras Hospital spokesperson, in a statement, said: “At Paras Hospitals, Gurugram, we have a free-of-cost parking space in our basement for multiple cars. In our hospital premises, we also have a valet parking facility that resumes only when the basement parking is full. The valet parking is free for first 15 minutes...All these parking details are mentioned near the entrance gate for the convenience of our patients. We are ready to cooperate with the officials for further investigation into the matter.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/fir-against-hospital-on-charges-of-extortion/article35643620.ece
