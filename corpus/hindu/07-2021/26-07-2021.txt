26 July 2021||Shimla,||9 killed as boulders hit vehicle following Himachal landslip||Nine tourists were killed after heavy boulders fell on their van following a landslip near Basteri in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh on Sunday. Multiple landslips triggered by recent rain occurred near Basteri on the Sangla-Chitkul road at 1.25 p.m., resulting in a bridge collapse and damage to some vehicles, the police said. A video of the incident, which has gone viral on social media, shows several boulders rolling downhill and smashing into the bridge, causing it to collapse. According to the police, nine persons died and two were injured after heavy boulders fell on the van. The passengers were going to Sangla from Chitkul. In a similar incident, a pedestrian was injured in another landslip in Kinnaur district, they added. President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences over the death of people due to the landslips in Kinnaur. “Deeply saddened by the news of the death of many people in a landslip in Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh. Express my deepest condolences to the bereaved families and wish the injured people a speedy recovery,” Mr. Kovind tweeted in Hindi. Mr. Modi said all arrangements were being made for the treatment of those injured and announced an ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to the injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur also expressed grief over the deaths, and asked the district administration to carry out immediate relief and rescue operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/9-killed-as-boulders-hit-vehicle-following-himachal-landslip/article35531354.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Metro, buses to allow only sitting travel||The Delhi Metro and intra-State buses will run at ‘100% seating capacity’ from Monday, after the Delhi government eased some COVID-19 restrictions. However, long queues outside metro stations and bus stops during peak hours are likely to continue as passengers will not be permitted to stand inside buses or metro coaches. Confusion over new rules The Delhi Metro on Sunday clarified that only 50 passengers will be allowed to sit in each coach and entry to stations would continue to be regulated. Several sections of the public are under the impression that the metro will be operating at 100% capacity — this is not the case, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement. “The DMRC would like to make it clear that from Monday, a maximum of 50 passengers per coach are permitted, as against 300 prior to COVID-19. As a result, though queues outside stations may slightly reduce, they might still be there during peak hours,” it said. The DMRC appealed to the public to travel by metro only when absolutely necessary and to observe all COVID-related travel protocols. A notification issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Saturday had said that metro trains can operate at “100% seating capacity of the coach”, but specified that standing travel is not permitted. Standing travel comprises around 80% of the total capacity of each coach. Since the resumption of metro services following relaxation of lockdown norms in the Capital, commuters were permitted to sit on alternate seats and standing travel was not permitted. At 50% seating capacity, 25 people could travel in each coach. Under the revised rules, around 50 passengers can sit in one coach. 17-20% coach capacity With standing travel still barred, metro trains will be able to utilise only 17-20% of its coach capacity. According to sources, an eight-coach metro train can accommodate around 2,400 passengers. With the revised guidelines, an eight-coach train will be able to accommodate 400 passengers seated next to each other.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/metro-buses-to-allow-only-sitting-travel/article35531656.ece
26 July 2021||Chennai,||Excess deaths in West Bengal 11 times official COVID-19 tally||The number of “excess deaths” registered by the Civil Registration System (CRS) in West Bengal ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit (from April 2020 to May 2021) was an estimated 1,20,227, which is 11.1 times the official reported figure of 10,787 deaths for the same period. Five districts — Darjeeling, Jhargram, Kalimpong, North 24 Parganas and Paschim Medinipur — were not considered for this analysis as either the online registration data was incomplete for all years (Darjeeling and Kalimpong) or for some years, 2018, in particular (Jhargram, North 24 Parganas and Paschim Medinipur). The high multiple of excess deaths over the COVID-19 toll was a characteristic of both the first wave in 2020 and the more lethal second wave in 2021. The “excess deaths” figure for April to December 2020 of 64,520 was 9.4 times the COVID-19 toll (6,833) while the same for 2021 (55,207) was 14.1 times the COVID-19 toll (10,787). In April and May 2021 alone — a period that coincided with election in the State — there were 51,353 “excess deaths”, 14.4 times the official COVID-19 death toll of 5,212 in these districts. The overall COVID-19 death toll for all 23 districts as of 31 May 2021 was 15,536, which has since increased to 18,073 as of July 25. The figures were arrived at from data on deaths registered month-wise in the online Civil Registration System from January 2018 to May 2021 in West Bengal and accessed by The Hindu . Data for Kolkata was added to the tally from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation figures. As with other States, not all excess deaths could be related to COVID-19 but a bulk of them will be during the pandemic period. The estimated undercount factor of 11.1 for the State (without five districts in the analysis) is higher than the factor for States such as Haryana (7.3), Tamil Nadu (6.4 adjusted to 4.4 if CRS COVID-19 tally is considered), Karnataka (4.3) and Kerala (0.42 based on reconciled COVID-19 tally) but is lower than that for Madhya Pradesh (23.8) and Andhra Pradesh (17.9) if the same baseline is considered (deaths registered in 2018 and 2019).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/excess-deaths-in-west-bengal-11-times-official-covid-19-tally/article35531357.ece
26 July 2021||MANGALURU,||NH 66 stretch again dotted with potholes, craters||The stretch of National Highway 66 between Baikampady and Kulur, a part of New Mangalore Port Connectivity Project that witnesses voluminous traffic, is again filled with craters and potholes as the monsoon rain this season has washed away the road which was maintained spending crores of rupees. The Kulur Bridge stretch on the Udupi-Mangaluru carriageway is particularly the most affected one with the bitumen surface almost wearing out resulting in formation of large craters. The completely worn-out stretch at KIOCL Junction, a large speed breaker erected just before the Old Kulur Bridge and a rough patch just after the bridge have been affecting smooth vehicular movement. During the morning and evening peak hours, vehicles pile up as far as MCF due to slow moving vehicles on this particular stretch. The remaining stretches of both the carriageways between Kulur and Baikampady are dotted with potholes and craters at several places threatening road users. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which maintains the Port Connectivity Project between BC Road-Nanthoor Junction (NH 75) and Nanthoor-Surathkal (NH 66), has spent around Rs. 14 crore for the upkeep of the stretch since 2019. Mahesh Krishna, who regularly drives from Udupi to Mangaluru for work, wondered about the rationale behind the NHAI collecting hefty toll at its NITK-Surathkal toll plaza. “I have to pay Rs. 50 one-way for my car for a distance of 17 km and now, there is no justification for this hefty toll fee,” Mr. Krishna said. It has become an annual affair; every monsoon the stretch gets damaged and thereafter, it is repaired. Motorists are able to drive or ride on good roads only for about three-four months, he added. While repairing the road, the NHAI did not address water-logging issues at many places resulting in extensive damage to the surface, said Srikanth Raja, a resident of Baikampady. While the road geometry itself appears faulty and no corrections have been made to address those faults, the shoulder drains too are not regularly cleaned for the smooth flow of rainwater, he said. Mr. Raja added that the authority filled potholes with bitumen mix recently insome places. Except offering a bumpy ride or drive, the filling has not helped motorists in any way, he said. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M.A. Nataraj said that the traffic police will ask the NHAI to repair the road immediately to facilitate smooth traffic flow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nh-66-stretch-again-dotted-with-potholes-craters/article35531918.ece
26 July 2021||HYDERABAD,||Revised pay scales from this month’s salary||The State government employees are likely to get their full revised pay scales with 30 per cent hike from this month’s salary payable next month, marking an end to the agonising wait they are undergoing since the announcement of pay revision four months ago. The drawing and disbursement officers concerned are said to have completed the exercise of obtaining options from all the employees in different categories. The details are subsequently sent to the Pay and Accounts office here and the Director of Treasuries in respect of staff at the district level. The accounts, according to senior officials, have been updated and bills are being prepared to ensure implementation of the revised pay from this month. The Finance department had in fact completed formalities pertaining to implementation of the revised pay structure from salary for the month of June itself. Supplementary bills are accordingly generated and sent to the PAO and Treasuries offices. The process relating to crediting of additional amounts for June has already commenced and is likely to be completed in a couple of days before the preparation of the salary bills for July. As a result, the arrears of salary hike in June were credited to accounts of staff now. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has announced pay revision for different categories with fitment of 30 per cent as against the 7.5 per cent recommended by the Pay Revision Commission headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal citing financial health of the State. Employees were subsequently assured that they would be paid arrears pertaining to April and May some time during the current financial year while the arrears due from July 2018 to March 31, 2020 were declared as notional benefit. There were delays on account of eliciting options from the employees and then updating the same in the registers. There were also delays in the updation process. Officials, however, said the development of new software took some time and the process had been expedited once it has been deployed. The software has been developed in such a manner that the Finance department will get information about the salary related issues in real time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/revised-pay-scales-effective-from-this-months-salary/article35531774.ece
26 July 2021||DOWLESWARAM / POLAVARAM,||First flood warning issued in Godavari||Authorities issued the first flood warning in the Godavari in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday as the discharge reached about 10 lakh cusecs at the Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage at Dowleswaram by 7.30 p.m. Issuing the warning, G. Srinivasa Rao, Godavari River Flood Conservator and Godavari Head Works Division Executive Engineer, said, “However, the forecast indicates a fall in flood level by Monday.” The first warning alert would enable the district authorities to gear up for the flood mitigation exercise, particularly downstream Dowleswaram. Rescue teams ready Meanwhile, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) 10th Battalion and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), the Police, the Revenue and the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) officials swung into action in the flood-affected villages. The AP State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) directed the officials deployed on flood duty in West and East Godavari districts to evacuate people from the low-lying areas. APSDMA Commissioner K. Kanna Babu said that two NDRF teams had been deployed in Chintoor, while one team was positioned in V.R. Puram mandal. Advice to villagers “Villagers are requested to cooperate with the officials. They are advised against venturing into the flood waters for fishing, or taking a bath, or travelling on small boats as the flood is heavy,” Mr. Kanna Babu said. The water level at the Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage was 11.75 feet, and the Irrigation officials were releasing 10.08 lakh cusecs as of 7.30 p.m., Mr. Srinivasa Rao told The Hindu . “We are discharging the flood water into the Bay of Bengal by lifting all the 175 gates. We have cautioned the officials and the villagers staying in the low-lying areas and on the riverbed to be alert as the discharge is heavy,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. “As of 7.30 p.m., the inflow at Dowleswaram was 10,08,685 cusecs and the outflow 10,08,685,” the Irrigation officials said. At the Polavaram spillway, the water level was 33 metres and the discharge was about 9 lakh cusecs, the officials said. Flood water was being released downstream from all the gates from Polavaram, they said. ‘Flood receding’ Officials withdrew the first warning at Bhadrachalam, as the flood level fell to 41.80 feet in the Godavari. “The flood is receding in the river,” the Central Water Commission (CWC) officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/with-godavari-in-spate-ap-issues-first-flood-alert/article35531326.ece

26 July 2021||Pune,||Centre, State will help flood-hit people: Rane||Assuring the flood-hit people of Konkan and western Maharashtra that both the Centre and State governments would do everything to rehabilitate them, Union Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narayan Rane said that the crisis was not the time to indulge in politicking. Mr. Rane, who along with former chief minister and Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, visited the landslide-hit Taliye village in Raigad district, assured that destroyed houses would be rebuilt through the PM Awas Yojana. “This is not the time to point fingers or make comparisons [between the Maharashtra and Central governments] or play politics… All focus should only be on rescue and relief operations,” said Mr. Rane, the Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. He added, “We have come to give succour to those whose livelihoods have been destroyed by floods and landslides. Rescue teams are having a tough time to dig up the dead bodies… 44 bodies have been dug out and almost the same number are feared missing. Some bodies have been found dispersed as far [away] as 2 km. So, the priority now is to complete these operations.” Mr. Rane said the Prime Minister would be given a detailed report of all damage suffered by people in the Konkan region and western Maharashtra. “We will also try and ask the Centre to keep an NDRF [National Disaster Response Force] team permanently stationed in the Konkan, which normally is prone to such disasters, in the future,” Mr. Rane said. Promise of more aid Remarking that the NDRF, SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) and other rescue teams along with local police and other administration officials were working hard on the ground, Mr. Rane said that more aid would be provided to the afflicted populace in the event the official relief aid provided by the Centre and the State government fell short. “This is a truly unfortunate incident. Although the families of the victims have received assistance from the Centre and the State, it does not mean we will not help them further if this aid proves inadequate… those whose homes have been destroyed will be given good and solid houses through the PM Awas Yojana. However, the only thing we can’t bring back are the dead,” he said. Mr. Rane said that he had instructed the Raigad District Collector to ensure that survivors were rehabilitated as per their wishes and that an independent official be appointed to especially cater to their needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-state-will-help-flood-hit-people-rane/article35531953.ece

26 July 2021||New Delhi,||CPI(M) MP moves SC for probe into snooping||Rajya Sabha member John Brittas has moved the Supreme Court for a court-monitored investigation into allegations of snooping on activists, politicians, journalists and constitutional functionaries using the Israeli spyware Pegasus. The parliamentarian said the government’s response in the House to the allegations was “evasive”. Mr. Brittas, a Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP, said allegations pointed to a “critical invasion into privacy”. It actually amounted to a “cyberattack” on citizens. He termed Pegasus a “weapon” used to “hack” into private smartphones to cause a chilling effect on free speech and expression. So far, the MP said the only response from the Centre was a statement by IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in the Rajya Sabha that “time-tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur”. Mr. Brittas asked the court whether the statement meant if the surveillance was authorised by the government. If so, the MP asked, were the procedures under the Indian Telegraph Act, Information Technology (Amendment) Act, Section 92 of Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Telegraph Rules for “lawful interception” followed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cpim-mp-moves-sc-for-probe-into-snooping/article35531657.ece
26 July 2021||CHENNAI,||Databank of migrant workers soon: Minister||In a first, Tamil Nadu will soon create a digital databank of migrant workers employed in industries, particularly the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises and hospitality sectors, across the State, Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu said on Sunday. “There are a few lakhs of labourers from various States engaged in industries across Tamil Nadu. A majority of them went home during the peak of COVID-19. We need to have a clear record on how many returned to work, their vaccination status and other identification details,” Mr. Thennarasu told The Hindu . Major industries rely on a few labour contractors for hiring workforce. Each contractor has about 50,000 workers from States such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal. “We will launch the exercise of mapping migrant workers in districts like Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chennai and Chengalpattu, where their concentration is high,” the Minister said. According to him, the enumeration of workers, along with their profile, will not just help weed out illegal immigrants and anti-social elements, but also in building a data portal on the industry-wise employment scenario. The decision comes close on the heels of intelligence agencies issuing a specific alert in the second week of July, 2021, on how illegal immigrants were posing a serious threat to the country’s internal security. Though not a foolproof mechanism, the real-time data management system could be of immense use in the event of an emergency. “Whenever new investments come in, the industries assure employment to thousands of workers. But there is no mechanism now to follow up on that…the database will help to assess such job opportunities and analyse the workforce on certain parameters like skills.” Security alert The decision to create a centralised data of migrant workers in the State comes close on the heels of intelligence agencies issuing a specific alert in the second week of July, 2021, on how illegal immigrants were posing a serious threat to internal security. It was reported that a large number of Bangladeshi nationals were residing illegally in many districts, including Chengalpattu, Erode, Kancheepuram and Tiruppur, under the guise of Indians. The immigrants had no valid travel documents but managed to procure Indian documents like Aadhaar Card by posing as residents of West Bengal. After many such illegal immigrants indulged in offences like drug peddling, intelligence agencies issued the alert to senior police officers in all cities/districts to apprehend them and initiate appropriate action under the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/databank-of-migrant-workers-soon/article35531575.ece

Rains subsided across north Karnataka and Maharashtra, on Sunday, that led to a reduction in the inflow into the Krishna and other rivers. The Indian Naval Emergency Response Team (ERT) from the naval base in Karwar evacuated 160 people from two flood-affected villages in Uttara Kannada. Traffic snarls In Bengaluru, waterlogging, traffic snarls and power outages were reported in several areas on Saturday evening. According to the Indian Meteorological Department control room, until 5.30 p.m., the city had received just 0.2 mm of rain, but by 8.30 p.m., it increased to 59 mm; HAL airport recorded 46.4 mm of rain. C.S. Patil, Director, IMD Bengaluru, told The Hindu that the city was likely to receive light to moderate rains over the next five days. He attributed the rains to low pressure over Jharkhand and adjoining areas, apart from the off-shore trough running from Karnataka coast to Kerala coast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rain-intensity-reduces-in-parts-of-state/article35531536.ece
26 July 2021||Belagavi,||‘Disburse all pending flood relief amount’||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has instructed officials to disburse all pending relief amount among flood victims. At a meeting at the government guest house here on Sunday, he asked officers to ensure that all those who have lost their houses are properly compensated. “Officers should act with responsibility and human empathy. If they face any problems, they have to contact the senior officers concerned and resolve all issues,” he said. He said that there is no dearth of funds for flood relief. There has been heavy rainfall for a week now. Officers of revenue, police and irrigation departments should be in constant touch with their counterparts in Maharashtra for exchange of information, he said. There are reports that inflow from Maharashtra could increase in the next two or three days. The State government is ready to manage the situation, he said. Officers told him that 113 villages in seven taluks are facing floods. Over 8,900 persons are housed in 89 relief centres. Revenue Minister R. Ashok said that the State government has written to the Union government to increase allocation under National Disaster Response Fund norms. Officers can purchase medicine and other essential commodities under NDRF. “If you need more, please send a detailed proposal,” he said. Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, who is in charge of Public Works, said that the district has suffered a damage of around Rs. 1,200 crore. He urged Mr. Yediyurappa to release Rs. 170 crore for immediate relief. According to him, 1,400 km of road and 305 bridges have been damaged. Mr. Karjol asked officers to distribute relief to farmers whose cattle have died. Officers have impounded 72 tmcft of water in the Alamatti dam. Outflow will be maintained based on the minimum amount of water to be retained in the dam, he said in reply to a request from Deputy Chief Minister Lakshman Savadi to release water from dams on the Krishna. Mr. Karjol asked officers to allot houses to those who were not allotted houses during the last floods. MLA Mahantesh Koujalagi urged the Chief Minister to release all pending relief. MLA Anil Benake urged the Chief Minister to sanction funds to find a permanent solution to the floods in Belagavi city. This could be done by building a network of channels around the city, he said. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath said that heavy rain had claimed three lives in the district. As many as 40 houses have completely collapsed and 1,200 partially damaged, he said. Of the 37 bridges that were submerged, alternative routes are available for 35.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-tells-officials-to-disburse-all-pending-flood-relief-amount/article35531746.ece

26 July 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan reshuffle put off as Congress stand-off continues||The expectations of an early Cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan turned out to be a damp squib with senior Congress leaders on Sunday leaving the decision to the party’s central leadership. Two emissaries from New Delhi could not convince Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in favour of making an immediate power sharing arrangement with the rival faction. AICC general secretaries Ajay Maken and K.C. Venugopal, who arrived here on Saturday to bring about a reconciliation within the ruling party, left on Sunday afternoon after meeting the Pradesh Congress Committee office-bearers. In their interaction with Mr. Gehlot earlier, the latter reportedly refused to act under any pressure while making the political appointments. An uneasy Mr. Maken told presspersons outside the PCC headquarters that there was “no conflict” among the Congress leaders in the State and all of them had left the final decision about the Cabinet expansion to the party high command. Mr. Maken is scheduled to return to Jaipur on July 28 for a two-day meeting with party MLAs on the functioning of the government as well as the party organisation. Pilot’s meeting Former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, who along with 18 MLAs staged a rebellion against Mr. Gehlot in July last year, was among the leaders who met the two AICC general secretaries at the PCC headquarters. A large number of Mr. Pilot’s supporters gathered outside the building and raised slogans in his support, besides demanding that the MLAs loyal to him be accommodated in the government. The Pilot camp has been issuing statements demanding power sharing between Mr. Gehlot and the disgruntled group of MLAs. According to Congress insiders, Mr. Gehlot suggested to the two emissaries that they seek the opinion of all MLAs through a “broad consultation” about new appointments to the Council of Ministers and nominations to various boards and corporations. Mr. Maken and Mr. Venugopal are members of a committee appointed by the AICC last year to address the issues raised by Mr. Pilot and evolve a compromise in the party’s State unit. Mr. Venugopal is also a Rajya Sabha member elected from Rajasthan. Mr. Pilot left for his Assembly constituency, Tonk, after meeting the two leaders and met a cross section of people in the town, 100 km from Jaipur. He refused to comment on a possible Cabinet expansion. Nine vacancies Mr. Pilot, who was sacked both as the Deputy CM and the PCC president during the political crisis, had recently indicated that he was in touch with the central leadership and was hopeful that the Congress would shortly take steps to address the issues raised by him. The MLAs of his camp have also been demanding that the party fulfil the promises made to him. The State can have a maximum of 30 Ministers. There are at present 21 members in the Council of Ministers, including the Chief Minister, and nine slots are vacant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-reshuffle-put-off-as-congress-stand-off-continues/article35531281.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Deal on Gogra, Hot Springs likely soon||India and China are set to hold the 12th round of Corps Commander-level talks aimed at resolving the stand-off in eastern Ladakh soon, and an agreement for disengagement at Gogra and Hot Springs is likely to be reached. China had suggested July 26 as a possible date for the talks, but the Indian side conveyed that the day being Kargil Vijay Diwas, it would not be convenient. Fresh dates are expected to be agreed upon soon. “The situation on the ground is stable. There have been no attempts to reoccupy the peaks vacated. The sense is they (China) are ready to disengage from all places. We got positive inputs and it will happen,” a senior defence official said. “We continue to talk at all levels.” The two sides are also looking at a Major General-level talks to be held after the 12th round of talks, a second official said. Since the stand-off began, the two sides have held 10 Major General-level talks, 55 Brigadier-level talks and around 1,450 calls over the two hotlines. India and China have two hotlines for communication at Chushul and Daulat Beg Oldi. Friction points While disengagement was completed on both banks of Pangong Tso in February, the other friction points that remain to be resolved are Gogra and Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang. The buffer zones established in some places as part of earlier talks remain in place. “Buffer zone varies from place to place,” the first official said. In eastern Ladakh, India and China have two mutually agreed disputed areas — Trig Heights and Demchok — and 10 areas of differing perception. Officials said since the stand-off last year, additional five friction points have emerged. These are Km 120 in the Galwan area, Patrolling Points 15 and 17, and Rechin La and Rezang La on the south Bank of the Pangong Tso, the second official said. “China wants de-escalation first and disengagement later which is not acceptable to India as they can bring back troops and equipment much faster then we can do,” the second official said. Some of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) peace locations are located as far as 3,000 km from the LAC, but they can mobilise much faster, the official said. Access issues For India, the area is cut off for several months a year which is not the case with China. Both the Zoji La and Rohtang passes were kept open longer than usual last year due to the stand-off and are available for seven or eight months. Construction work on several tunnels is under way on a priority basis, including at Baralacha La and Tanglang La, among others, the officials said. Stating that they have a clear picture of what the PLA is doing and they have vacated and gone back in some places, the official said China has not increased its troop levels since the stand-off began but has rotated its troops. The PLA, too, is closely watching the movements of the Indian military. “We have about 1,000 vehicles going up and down the Rohtang axis everyday,” the official added. However, at least two officials said the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will not become like the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan with very close deployments by both sides. “The LAC will not become like the LoC. But the force levels have gone up as the trust is lost. All agreements are broken,” the first official stated. New protocols have to be worked out, another official stated||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/deal-on-gogra-hot-springs-likely-soon/article35531287.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM calls for a ‘unite India movement’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Indians to participate in the “Amrit Mahotsav” launched to mark the 75th year of Independence, asking citizens to forge a unity of purpose or “Bharat Jodo Andolan” in the same manner as Mahatma Gandhi’s “Quit India” or “Bharat Chhodo Andolan”. “Just like Bapu [Mahatma Gandhi] led the ‘Bharat Chhodo Andolan’ [Quit India movement], every Indian must lead the ‘Bharat Jodo Andolan [unite India movement]’. It is our responsibility that we do our work in such a manner that it helps in uniting our country which is full of diversities,” Mr. Modi said, adding, “We have to move forward with ‘Nation first, Always first’.” Many programmes in connection with Amrit Mahotsav were being run, the Prime Minister said, adding that the Ministry of Culture had started an initiative to have maximum number of Indians sing the national anthem together. For this, a website too has been created. Cautions on COVID While greeting citizens on the upcoming festival season, he cautioned that the threat of COVID-19 still loomed large and that all precautions must be taken to prevent its spread. Noting that on July 26 the nation would mark Kargil Vijay Diwas, the Prime Minister asked the people of the country to pay tributes to those who made the nation proud in 1999. In the broadcast, he also cited a study done by MyGov to highlight that out of those sending messages and suggestions for Mann Ki Baat , close to 75% were below 35 years. “I view this as a very good indicator. Mann Ki Baat is a medium which has positivity, sensitivity. In Mann Ki Baat , we talk about positive things; its character is collective,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-calls-for-a-unite-india-movement/article35531315.ece
26 July 2021||Chennai,||Excess deaths much higher in rural West Bengal||A district-wise look at the excess deaths in West Bengal and their multiple over the COVID-19 toll showed that rural districts such as Purba Bardhaman (7,556 excess deaths — 60.4 times the official toll of 125), Puruliya (6,224 and a multiple of 58.7), Cooch Behar (4,429 and 52.7), Malda (5,859 and 32.7), Bankura (6,986 and 31.9) and Murshidabad (8,378 and 30.4) had high number of “excess deaths” and multiples. Only Paschim Bardhaman (home to Asansol and Durgapur) with 9,652 deaths — 32.6 times the official COVID-19 toll of 296 — had a high multiple among urban districts in the State. Kolkata had an estimated 12,708 excess deaths, but they were only 2.9 times the official toll of 4,456 which signified a relatively better monitoring of COVID-19 related deaths in the State capital relative to other parts of the largely rural and agrarian State. The online data for the 18 districts showed that 3,68,477 and 4,10,503 deaths were registered in West Bengal in the CRS, which were close to 94.4% and 90% of the deaths reported by the Annual Report on Vital Statistics based on CRS 2019 for these years. Excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the registered deaths in the pandemic period and the average number of deaths registered in 2018 and 2019 for the same months. The CRS annual report for 2019 notes that death registration in the State improved from an estimated 91.8% in 2018 to 100% in 2019. An estimated 91.7% of all deaths were also registered within 21 days of the occurrence according to the same report, which is relatively high compared to other States. “During the second wave, in West Bengal, there was marked deficiency in COVID testing facilities, in rural areas and even in towns and cities. In many places, people had to travel a lot to get tested. As a result, many patients with COVID-like symptoms could not get tested and diagnosed. Therefore, a certain section of deaths was not included as COVID deaths. Also, patients dying from post COVID complications were not counted in COVID deaths,” renowned public health expert Punyabrata Gun said on the excess COVID deaths in West Bengal. Dr. Gun added that lack of testing and lack of infrastructure for COVID-19 related healthcare could be reasons for higher deaths than what was officially reported. Sajal Biswas, general secretary of Service Doctors' Forum in West Bengal said the high excess deaths count was due to multiple reasons including deliberate suppression and inadequate testing facilities, resulting in a large number of deaths without diagnosis.

26 July 2021||Srinagar,||President on four-day visit to J&K||Amid a tight security blanket, President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday arrived in Srinagar on a four-day visit to the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, as the country prepares to observe the 22nd anniversary of the 1999 Kargil War. J&K Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha received the President at the Srinagar airport around 11.15 a.m. Mr. Kovind was accorded a guard of honour. Officials said Mr.Kovind interacted with the Army’s top brass in Srinagar. In the evening, he attended a function at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre located on the banks of the Dal Lake. A thick security blanket has been put in place in Srinagar. Several stretches on the access to the venue have been closed to civilian traffic for the next three days. This has evoked sharp reactions from locals as well as tourists. Scores of tourists were stranded at the famous boulevard near the lake due to barricades erected at multiple points. The President will leave for Ladakh on July 26, and will pay homage at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass. He will return to Srinagar to address the 19th convocation of the University of Kashmir on July 27. Ahead of the President’s Kargil visit, Kargil Vijay Diwas celebrations were kicked off on Sunday. An official said senior Army officers met war veterans and “ veer naari s (brave women) at the Lahmochan View Point, and remembered the soldiers who laid down their lives while clearing Pakistani intruders. Indian soldiers recaptured peaks, including Tiger Hill, Tololing Top, Three Pimples and Trishul HT, and Drass town. General Officer Commanding, 16 Corps, Lt. Gen. M.V.

26 July 2021||New Delhi,||Opposition to persist on Pegasus row||The second week of the monsoon session of Parliament could once again start on a stormy note on Monday as a section of the Opposition is keen to keep the pressure on the government over the Pegasus snooping controversy. The Lok Sabha strategy group of the Congress virtually met on Sunday to discuss the week ahead, said a source. Senior Congress leaders indicated that the session could be their “2G moment,” referring to the washout of the winter session of Parliament in 2010 by the BJP-led Opposition over allegations of corruption in allocation of 2G spectrum. A final decision on a joint Opposition strategy, however, is likely to be taken on Monday morning after Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge discusses the issue with other floor leaders. “Our demand for a judicial inquiry still exists as the government statement on the Pegasus issue didn’t have anything. Kharge ji will meet leaders tomorrow morning,” Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury told The Hindu . On Friday, speaking to reporters, Rahul Gandhi said, “Pegasus is classified by the Israeli State as a weapon and that weapon is supposed to be used against terrorists. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister have used this weapon against the Indian State.” However, there is also a view among some parties that there should not be continued disruptions of the Parliament. They argue that there should be a structured debate around “issues” such as fuel price hike, farm laws, pace of vaccination and preparedness for the COVID-19 third wave among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-to-persist-on-pegasus-row/article35531277.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ready to engage on rights, says India||India on Sunday stressed that issues such as human rights and democracy were universal in nature, and said these values were not limited by “national or cultural perspectives”. Informed sources here elaborated on the current Indian perspective on human rights as it is likely to feature prominently during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week. Officials said India would place Pakistan’s alleged links with financing of terrorists on the agenda of talks with Mr. Blinken. “Issues such as human rights and democracy are universal and extend beyond a particular national or cultural perspective. India is proud of its achievements in both domains and is always glad to share experiences. As a long-standing pluralistic society, India is open to engaging those who now recognise the value of diversity,” said a source. The statement indicates that India prefers a general conversation on human rights instead of bringing its own record on that front to the table. The argument about the condition of human rights and democratic values in India appears to have been made in clear response to the comments by Dean Thompson, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs. Mr. Thompson on Saturday laid out the agenda of Mr. Blinken’s tour and said, “With respect to the human rights and democracy question, yes, we will raise it, and we will continue that conversation, because we firmly believe that we have more values in common on those fronts than we don’t.” The alleged use of Pegasus spyware to track journalists and activists in India is also expected to be taken up by Mr. Blinken. “Undemocratic uses of tech/Internet are a major concern for Mr. Biden. His administration has already been critical of Internet bans in India and Mr. Blinken will likely bring up Pegasus,” said Michael Kugelman, South Asia Senior Associate at the Wilson Center. “On the regional situation, implications of withdrawal of the U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan on terror financing and terror havens will be part of the agenda,” said the source on growing Indian concern about the evolving situation in Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ready-to-engage-on-rights-says-india/article35531294.ece

However, the Jal Shakti Ministry considers the current progress an achievement. “Big boost to children’s health & hygiene in the country!” said a tweet from Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday, linking to an official statement from the Ministry. “PM @narendramodi ji’s desire to see all centres of learning provided with clean water has resulted in 66% schools & 60% anganwadi centers across the nation getting FHTC [Functional Household Tap Connections] through the #JalJeevanMission in just 10 months,” he added. The 100-day campaign to achieve 100% coverage, and provide potable piped water supply for drinking and cooking purposes as well as tap water for hand washing and in toilets in every school, anganwadi and ashramshala or residential tribal school, was launched on October 2, 2020. At the time, about 40% of schools and anganwadis already had tap water access. From 4.1 lakh before the campaign started, the number of schools with taps rose to 6.35 lakh by February, according to the JJM dashboard. For anganwadis, the increase was from 4.3 lakh to 6.3 lakh. In its report on the demand for grants submitted to the Lok Sabha in early March, the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Water Resources deplored the slow rate of progress, pointing out that “children are more susceptible to water-borne diseases, more so, when there is also a need for repeated washing of hands as a precautionary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic”. The Jal Shakti Ministry told the panel that “some States/ UTs have indicated that they need more time to complete the task and sustain the efforts” and said the campaign had been extended till March 31, 2021. Almost four months after that extended deadline, the JJM is yet to achieve its goals. In fact, it has only added tap water access in about 50,000 schools and 40,000 anganwadis since that time. In its statement on Sunday, the Ministry said the progress came “despite Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown”. In fact, there is widespread disparity among States, with a few laggards pulling down the national average, despite the fact that nine States and Union Territories have already achieved 100% coverage. In Jharkhand and West Bengal, less than 15% of schools and less than 10% of anganwadis have tap water access. On the other hand, 80% of the schools in Uttar Pradesh have access to tap water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/35-of-govt-schools-anganwadis-have-no-tap-water/article35531310.ece
26 July 2021||New Delhi,||Union Ministries owe Rs. 147 crore to newspapers||The Union government owes more than Rs. 147 crore to various print media outlets as payment for advertisements, according to a recent response to a Right to Information (RTI) query made by law student Aniket Gaurav. There are more than 76,000 outstanding bills for print media campaigns pending with the Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity (DAVP), the oldest of which dates as far back as 2004. For electronic media, the pending amount is Rs. 67 crore, while the unpaid bills for outdoor publicity amount to almost Rs. 18 crore. Gaurav, a first year law student at Meerut University, said he had sent the query as he was concerned about the number of newspapers which were being shut down. “As a reader, I feel that the major reason for any newspaper shutting down would be because of loss of revenue. As government ads constitute a large part of revenue, so I thought I should find out whether the government is paying for its ads on time, and which Ministries have unpaid bills,” he said. “I was shocked to find that there are ads which have not been paid for 17 years.” Defence Ministry dues The RTI response from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting provided data on the outstanding bills that Central Ministries owed to the DAVP, which in turn pays media organisations for running advertising campaigns. The largest pending amounts for print media come from the Defence Ministry, which has 12,271 unpaid bills worth more than Rs. 16 crore, followed by the Finance Ministry, with 6,668 unpaid bills worth Rs. 13 crore. The information is updated until June 21, 2021. With regard to electronic media, the Ministry said a full list of the number of outstanding bills was not readily available, nor were records maintained regarding the date of the bills. However, the information available indicated that more than Rs. 67 crore is yet to be paid to TV channels. For context, the total pending amount of Rs. 147 crore is higher than the Rs. 118 crore “commitment” made by the government to all newspapers during 2020-21, as well as the Rs. 65 crore actually paid out as “expenditure” for print ad campaigns during the same period, according to data available on the DAVP website.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-ministries-owe-rs-147-crore-to-newspapers/article35531292.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Centralisation not a risk worth taking’||Fourteenth Finance Commission Chairman Y.V. Reddy said on Sunday that the Centre did not support States enough at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, resorting to “burden-sharing” instead, and questioned the move to abandon the existing inoculation system of the Centre providing free vaccines and the States using their resources to deliver the shots. Warning against a growing tendency towards centralisation even on State subjects under the Constitution, Dr. Reddy said the idea of different development models adopted by States is no longer on the table under the Narendra Modi government and there is a worrying asymmetry between the responsibilities of States and the resources available to them. “There is an impression gained that the Central government feels it can do a better job in regard to various activities even if they are in the State list. On fiscal federalism too, the Fifteenth Finance Commission recommendations were accepted but not fully implemented and its terms of references were controversial,” he said, adding that the States’ borrowing limits have also been made conditional which is a “real problem”. “There is a rebalancing going on between the State and the market and also between the Centre and States in India, but in the process of rebalancing, we should not underestimate the strong sub-national sentiment within loyalty to the country,” he averred in a talk on Centre-State relations hosted by the Manthan Foundation. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s decade in office saw the emergence of different development models among States, as their governance capabilities matured and policies unique to their needs were adopted, Dr. Reddy recalled. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, has been able to project a national agenda, and the idea of different States having different models is not very much on the table now. And there are some tensions also,” he said, stressing that pressures and tensions between the Centre and States may be counterproductive. “The basic problem is centralisation in a diverse country can produce risks which are not worth taking,” he said, stressing that the underlying logic for India’s federal structure is to recognise the diversity of States in order to strengthen national unity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centralisation-not-a-risk-worth-taking/article35531308.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Today’s Kisan Sansad at Jantar Mantar will be all-woman affair||When farmers return to Jantar Mantar to continue their parallel parliament protest on Monday, the participants will look different from their counterparts inside Parliament as well as the delegates of previous Kisan Sansads in one major way: they will all be women. “The Mahila Kisan Sansad will reflect the key role that women play in Indian agriculture, and their critical role in the ongoing movement too. Convoys of women farmers from various districts are reaching the morchas for the Mahila Kisan Sansad,” said a statement from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) joint platform of farm unions coordinating the protest. According to Census data, 30% of all cultivators and 43% of all agricultural labourers are women, though few of them have land rights in their own names. At the height of the ongoing agitation against the three farm reform laws in January, 15-20% of protesters were women, according to Kavitha Kuruganti of the Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch, an alliance of women farmers organisations and supporters. However, few women have been in the leadership of the movement. None of the SKM’s nine core committee members are women, nor are the leaders of the individual unions that make up the platform. Ms. Kuruganti herself was the only woman among the 30-odd delegates sent by the farm unions to negotiate with the Central government earlier in the year. On July 22, the first day of the Kisan Sansad, only seven of the 200 protesters allowed each day were women. As the women take over the stage at Jantar Mantar on Monday, most of the SKM leadership will head for Lucknow, where they will launch ‘Mission U.P.’ to outline their plans for next year’s Assembly election. “In the panchayat elections held earlier this year, the farmers’ movement left its mark, with the BJP candidates punished in many places and Independents gaining most number of seats,” said the SKM statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/todays-kisan-sansad-at-jantar-mantar-will-be-all-woman-affair/article35531304.ece
26 July 2021||Panaji,||Snooping allegations baseless, says Nadda||BJP president J.P. Nadda on Sunday termed as baseless the Pegasus snooping allegations, and hit out at the Opposition parties for disrupting Parliament. “It is baseless… It is issueless. The Opposition parties led by the Congress do not have any issue which they want to raise for people. That is why they raise this kind of issue,” he told reporters here. ‘Issueless Opposition’ Mr. Nadda said although the Centre was ready to hold talks over different issues, the “issueless” Opposition parties, led by the Congress, were disrupting the proceedings of Parliament. “The Congress, along with other Opposition parties, has become disappointed and issueless and hence resorts to such disruptions…They do not know what to do. They want to stop Parliament over issueless things.” “But people know that despite all their efforts, the productivity of Parliament has broken all the records under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the business has broken all the records,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/snooping-allegations-baseless-says-nadda/article35531289.ece
26 July 2021||New Delhi,||After Punjab, Congress to focus on Rajasthan||The resolution of infighting in Punjab has not only prompted the Congress to address the issue of factionalism in Rajasthan but also resolve some of the long-pending issues with regard to other States. In Rajasthan, the peace formula to bring the warring factions of former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is in its final stages. While some of Mr. Pilot’s supporters will find a place in the Gehlot cabinet, Mr. Pilot himself is likely to be drafted as a general secretary in the All India Congress Committee (AICC). Party president Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have spoken to Mr. Gehlot to speed up the process of expanding his Cabinet to accommodate the different sections. Conveying a sense of urgency, the Congress president has also met senior leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kamal Nath and Anand Sharma to discuss organisational issues. Gujarat is one State that is a priority for the high command as the Assembly election is due in the latter part of 2022. The party needs to appoint a new State leadership as well as a new AICC in-charge. Feedback for the process is currently on, said a source. While the former in-charge Rajeev Satav passed away earlier this year, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief had resigned last year after the party’s rout in the byelections. Another State where the Congress is keen to put up a united front is Karnataka amid reports of a leadership tussle between PCC chief D.K. Shivkumar and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who is also leader of the party in the Assembly. “To ensure that the party takes this up unitedly, Rahul ji had long deliberations with Shri Siddaramaiah and Shri D.K. Shivakumar. Let me assure the Congress party is united and there is no difference of leadership,” AICC general secretary for Karnataka Randeep Surjewala said after the meeting last Tuesday. The party has revamped its unit in poll-bound Uttarakhand and tried a course correction in Assam with a new team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-punjab-congress-to-focus-on-rajasthan/article35531276.ece

The High Court’s order came while asking the FRRO to accept the OCI card application of an Iranian woman, who has been living separately in Bengaluru after her relationship with her husband, an Indian citizen, turned sour. The woman submitted that once her marriage with an Indian citizen since 2009 has been proved and is an undisputed fact, the same should be enough to merit grant of an OCI card in her name. On the other hand, the Centre’s counsel argued that unless her spouse comes forward at the time of making the OCI card application, the FRRO cannot even consider the same. Justice Palli, however, pointed out that the provision in the Visa Manual “merely makes it requisite for all OCI applicants to be present for a personal interview, either physically or through video conferencing”. “...Given that there is no rule or guideline which mandates the presence of both the spouses , it is surprising that the checklist was formulated in a manner to impose such a condition,” Justice Palli observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/spouses-presence-not-mandatory-for-oci-card/article35531275.ece
26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Uddhav for NDRF teams in high-risk districts||Rescue operations continued in full swing amid a brief respite in the rains. The Chief Minister, who toured rain-battered Chiplun on Sunday, said while the State government and local administration was currently focusing on providing immediate relief in form of food, clothes and medicines, he would officially announce a relief package once a comprehensive survey of all the affected districts in western Maharashtra and the Konkan was completed over the next few days. Comprehensive relief “I am not announcing any package just to make people feel better. This is not merely limited to Chiplun, but Raigad and other parts of the State also. The estimates from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara have yet to come in… The damage to property has been enormous with shops, establishments, infrastructure be they roads, bridges, power lines destroyed by the fury of the floodwaters… So, let the financial review be completed and only then will we be announcing a package,” Mr. Thackeray said. Grief-stricken residents accosted Mr. Thackeray and his entourage the moment he entered Chiplun, pleading for provide immediate relief. Reassuring them of every aid possible, Mr. Thackeray said he would be touring western Maharashtra tomorrow to take stock of the destruction in Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur. Responding to allegations that no help was given to stricken residents for more than 17 hours after the waters rose, Mr. Thackeray said the intensity of the rains had not left anybody with any chance to plan or warn of the dangers ahead. “Hence, we will be requesting the Centre to keep an NDRF team in such districts. So, at least operations can commence at the earliest at local levels,” he said. “We have now started experiencing the effects of climate change…areas where villages had nestled comfortably in the mountains for years, unaffected by vagaries of nature, are now being buried by landslides in an instant. This is not merely excess rain, but a far more terrible phenomenon,” he said. He informed that doctors (including veterinary doctors) from other civic bodies were being brought in the afflicted areas to help stave off any epidemic eruption in the wake of the floods. Rivers in spate Meanwhile, while rains gave a momentary reprieve to Kolhapur and Sangli, the Panchganga and Krishna river waters were still flowing way above their danger levels in the two districts. While over 1.40 lakh citizens were evacuated to safer zones, more than 75,000 of these were from Kolhapur alone, where six teams of the NDRF and a column of the Army carried out round-the-clock rescue operations in the flood-hit areas. “While the water level of the Panchganga river at the Rajaram weir near Kolhapur city has dipped, vehicular traffic on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway however, remained closed as a stretch near Shiroli village in the district was under water,” District Guardian Minister Satej Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uddhav-for-ndrf-teams-in-high-risk-districts/article35531278.ece
26 July 2021||CHENNAI,||CMA National Online Business Quiz 2021 held||Priyanka Surana and Riya Chandak emerged winners in the CMA National Online Business Quiz 2021 organised by The Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI) and The Hindu . From nearly 10,000 participants, 263 were shortlisted and eight were chosen to participate in the finals. While Sanvedi Rane came second, Bhagyashri Taparia got the third place. The preliminary round turned out to be edge-of-the-seat when six of the eight participants had the same score. Quiz master Debasish Mitra, chairman, Board of Advanced Studies and Research, had to conduct four tie-breaker sessions to choose the four finalists. From “Who became the first woman chairperson of NASSCOM?” to “Who is known as the ‘oracle of Omaha’?”, the participants had to answer a host of questions. The finalists went through five rounds of questions from which the two winners were chosen, in a stiff competition. Balwinder Singh, chairman, Training and Educational Facilities and Placement Committee of the ICAI, said such contests not only evaluate the knowledge of the participants but also help students learn within and beyond academics. Suresh Balakrishna, chief revenue officer of The Hindu , said there has been a tremendous response for the quiz. “We at The Hindu are always committed to education and also for furthering the cause of health, education and fitness. We are also planning to conduct a virtual marathon soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cma-national-online-business-quiz-2021-held/article35531279.ece

We don’t feel so.” He added that Mr. Yediyurappa was taking care of things in his own way. Mr. Nadda was speaking in Goa. The Chief Minister thanked the party president for appreciating his government’s work. Mr. Nadda’s remarks are significant as Mr. Yediyurappa had said two days ago that he expected directions from the party high command on July 25 and he would abide by their decision. In a different tenor, C.T. Ravi, said to be a chief minister hopeful, also in Goa, said the party had given “all opportunities” to Mr. Yediyurappa, making him Chief Minister four times, subtly hinting he now has to make way for others. Mr. Yediyurappa said there was nothing wrong in what Mr. Ravi said he was indeed a loyal worker of the party and was thankful to the party for these opportunities. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, a convention of Veerashaiva-Lingayat seers urged the BJP high command to continue with Mr. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister. However, the CM sought to distance himself from the convention. Later in the evening, the Chief Minister said, “I have not got any directions from the high command yet. If they ask me to continue as chief minister, I will do so. If they ask me to resign, I will tender my resignation and work for the party for the next 10-15 years.” Mr Yediyurappa is scheduled to preside over an event to celebrate the achievements of his government over the past two years in Vidhana Soudha on Monday. Multiple sources said the BJP leadership is yet to take a final decision on Mr. Yediyurappa’s replacement as on Sunday night. Meanwhile, Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot, who was away for sometime, returned to Bengaluru on Sunday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/suspense-continues-over-karnataka-leadership/article35531284.ece
26 July 2021||New Delhi,||CPI(M) MP moves SC for probe into snooping||Rajya Sabha member John Brittas has moved the Supreme Court for a court-monitored investigation into allegations of snooping on activists, politicians, journalists and constitutional functionaries using the Israeli spyware Pegasus. The parliamentarian said the government’s response in the House to the allegations was “evasive”. Mr. Brittas, a Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP, said allegations pointed to a “critical invasion into privacy”. It actually amounted to a “cyberattack” on citizens. He termed Pegasus a “weapon” used to “hack” into private smartphones to cause a chilling effect on free speech and expression. So far, the MP said the only response from the government was a statement from Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw in the Rajya Sabha that “time-tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur”. ‘Authorised or not’ Mr. Brittas asked the court whether the statement meant if the surveillance was authorised by the government. If so, the MP asked, were the procedures under the Indian Telegraph Act, Information Technology (Amendment) Act, Section 92 of Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Telegraph Rules for “lawful interception” followed. “Hence, the government needs to appraise the reasons for the interceptions made to the gadgets of its own Ministers, staff, constitutional authorities, including Election Commissioners and judges, CBI officers, a Supreme Court staffer, activists, scientists and journalists,” Mr. Brittas argued. On the other hand, if it was an unauthorised snooping exercise mounted by a foreign power, it would amount to an act of external aggression. “Despite the very serious nature of allegations, the government has not cared to investigate into the allegations involved in the issue but made only a hopeful hope that the time-tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur. This statement is as empty as making a hope that there will not be any crimes in India because the Indian Penal Code is there,” Mr. Brittas, represented by advocate Resmitha R.

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Steps to realisation||Most of us who are involved in worldly concerns are said to be in Pravritti Marga. This kind of preoccupation ties us down to samsara, the cycle of birth. Vedanta vichara shows that there is also another marga, Nivritti, which leads us to release from this cycle. Tremendous effort is needed to travel in this path and realise the subtle self as the abode of everlasting peace and bliss. In the Ashtavakra Gita, the preceptor Ashtavakra imparts to Janaka this highest knowledge of the self, praised in the Gita as Raja Vidya and Brahma Vidya, in clear cut terms, pointed out Sri R. Rajagopala Sarma in a discourse. At the outset itself, Janaka is taught to differentiate between the body and the self. Understanding this dichotomy can bring about equanimity in any individual, a most difficult ideal to attain even for realised souls. We can say and feel the self as distinct and as the essence of consciousness. But the bondage caused by the body is also very real and makes a great impact on us all the while. We are constantly aware of the limitations of the body, birth, old age, disease, death, and we cannot escape all kinds of misery that life plunges us in. But once one is able to leave aside the bodily concerns, he can sense the freedom and joy of being only conscious of the self and not the body. The thought that ‘I am the doer’ is the greatest hurdle to be overcome in this quest. Instead one should repeatedly evoke the thought that ‘I am the consciousness and the one and only self, existing eternally and always apart from the created universe.’ Listening to such explanations of Ashtavakra, Janaka, the disciple, who is already well versed in Vedanta and is also a ruler par excellence, is overwhelmed with the awareness felt within and is grateful to his preceptor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/steps-to-realisation/article35531300.ece

The moves and the messages indicating a thaw in relations between the neighbouring countries did put brakes on the escalating tensions. Both the countries should ensure that people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh live a life free from unending miseries,” Dr. Abdullah, who was addressing party workers in Kulgam, said. He emphasised that his party had all along been a strong votary of Indo-Pak. dialogue, and underlined that the dialogue should result in J&K-centric confidence building measures, including resumption of cross-LoC trade through a proper banking mechanism and doing away with the present barter system. “It will indeed help the two countries solve their disagreements amicably and in an objective manner for the greater good of the people of J&K, Ladakh and the entire region,” he said. The five-party amalgam Gupkar alliance president Dr. Abdullah’s statement comes one month after the alliance’s engagement with the Centre “failed to bring any change on the ground or saw any push on Kashmir-specific CBMs”. It is Dr. Abdullah’s first major political statement since he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24 in New Delhi. He stressed that a result-oriented dialogue between India and Pakistan will benefit the people of J&K the most. “Both the nations, I have maintained all along, have to live side by side. It is up to them, if they want to live as enemies or supportive friends and partners in development. Both countries can achieve much by joining hands in progress,” he added. He said if the ties between the two nations were to improve then they have to come out of their shells and narrow down the space of their differences and source of conflict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-substitute-for-dialogue-says-farooq/article35531290.ece

26 July 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TAMIL NADU||Coal production hit||Though heavy rain that battered the coal belt region of Telangana last week abated since Saturday, the recent spells of heavy downpour impeded coal production and overburden removal in almost all the opencast projects (OCPs) of Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) spread across six districts including Bhadradri-Kothagudem district. The State-owned SCCL reportedly suffered a huge production loss to an extent of more than five lakh tonnes in all the 21 OCPs together in the company’s 11 areas due to heavy rainfall in the coal belt region last week, sources said. The average daily coal output fell by almost 50% from 1.90 lakh tonnes to little over 90,000 tonnes in the past five days, sources added. Excess rains took a heavy toll on overburden removal in the OCPs as rain water flooded sumps at the deep most points of the open cast coal mines in Kothagudem region. The Manuguru area, which has a distinguished track record in meeting the set production targets, registered a significant drop in overburden removal to the extent of 50% daily in the past few days. The Manuguru Area comprising the Manuguru OCP, the PKOC-IV and the PKOC-II has so far produced 41 lakh tonnes of coal as against the stipulated coal production target of 112 lakh tonnes in this financial year (2021-22). The full-scale coal production in the OCPs is expected to resume in the next few days as intensive efforts are on to drain out the stagnant rain water that accumulated at various stretches of the open cast mines, SCCL sources said. Dozens of high-capacity pumps and graders are being used to flush out the accumulated water and remove the slush to facilitate the full-scale coal production and overburden removal in the OCPs at the earliest. In pursuit of its annual production target of 70 million tonnes of coal for the current fiscal, the SCCL management has laid renewed focus on scaling up coal production to compensate for the loss of production suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic during April and the recent spell of heavy rains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coal-production-hit/article35531328.ece
26 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. launches drive to beautify overlooked areas||The Greater Chennai Corporation has launched a major beautification drive, focusing on locations which have so far been overlooked during infrastructure development and maintenance. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin held a meeting with civic officials recently to initiate the beautification drive. The efforts include removal of debris and posters, promotion of aesthetic landscapes and the waste-to-sculpture project. Marina beach is expected to get more flowering plants and re-laid roads, and development projects will include maintenance of the flora and art work in the median and road islands in 150 locations. Every location is expected to reflect the unique aspects of Tamil language, culture, technological advancements, heritage and archaeological aspects, literary works and social values. Instructions have also been issued to make the beautification drive cost effective. A meeting of residents’ welfare associations will be held this week to discuss various aspects of the beautification drive, inviting objections and suggestions. Tree planting, landscape development with flowering plants and removal of posters have been proposed to be taken up with residents’ support. On Saturday, IAS officer Sharanya Ari, Central Regional Deputy Corporation Commissioner, tweeted: “Residents’ welfare associations/organisations interested in tree plantation in their neighbourhood are welcomed by #GCC. If yes, kindly drop a message at +91 94451 90698. We at @chennaicorp are ready to help you take it forward. #CentralChennai zones 6 to 10.” Geetha Ganesh, of the A.G.S. Colony Residents’ Welfare Association, said, “That’s a great initiative like corporation social responsiblity (CSR). It is the residents’ social responsibility. We welcome it. We have already planted around 200 trees in our colony in 2017. As part of this programme, we have decided to plant around 20 more.” Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said, “We want the entire city to be beautiful. Not only the developed core areas, but also the extensions. We have told that all the medians on roads should have flowering plants or crotons, which will look nice. All roundabouts should have green patches. A water fountain should be installed wherever possible.” “Residents’ welfare associations should plant trees in common areas and along the roads, and maintain them. We want the public to take initiative. I have told zonal officers to bring in efforts of five residents’ associations every fortnight. This is besides what contractors do. The contractors should maintain flowering plants along road medians and water them regularly,” he added. Meanwhile, debris will be removed in mass cleaning initiatives. The Corporation will start fining those who indulge in unauthorised dumping of debris. Debris has already been removed from river banks, parks and roundabouts. Mr. Bedi has ordered civic officials to penalise contractors who have failed to maintain the facilities at 700 parks. The list of parks that have not been maintained properly would be ready in two days, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-launches-drive-to-beautify-overlooked-areas/article35531589.ece

Senthilbalaji made a surprise visit to the two thermal power projects being executed by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco). The visit to the North Chennai Stage 3 and Ennore SEZ, which are under construction, comes in the backdrop of environmental activists crying hoarse about the damage caused to Kosasthalaiyar river due to construction activities carried out for the plants. While sources in the Tangedco did not connect the visit to the protests, Mr. Senthilbalaji inspected the construction site of the bridges, which would bring coal from the Kamarajar Port to the North Chennai and the Ennore SEZ power plants. He interacted with officials working on the alignment plan for the coal conveyor belt facility. He was accompanied by Tangedco Chairman and Managing Director Rajesh Lakhoni, and directed the officials to complete the project on time. Earlier, environmental activists had called upon the State government and the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court to stop all construction in the Ennore Creek for the thermal power stations. In a press meet held last week, environmental activists Prof. Janakarajan, T.M. Krishna and G. Sundararajan, of Poovulagin Nanbargal, cautioned the State government that the liabilities arising out of the actions of the Tangedco would result in a substantial burden for the exchequer. The activists, who have initiated the Save Ennore Creek campaign, also released a booklet titled Illegal Immunity - Tangedco’s Violations in Ennore Creek , documenting the various industrial activities, including coal yards, petroleum terminals, power plants and ash ponds, resulting in the destruction of more than 1,500 acres of the water spread and the livelihood of the local fisherfolk. More than 1,000 acres of land in the Kosasthalaiyar river basin had been choked with coal ash, the report alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electricity-minister-inspects-construction-site-of-thermal-power-projects-in-ennore/article35531591.ece

26 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Workers in four out of 10 malls vaccinated: Corpn.||The Greater Chennai Corporation has managed to vaccinate all employees working in the outlets in four out of 10 major malls in the city through the COVID-19 vaccination outreach drives carried out over the past few days. Encouraged by the improvement in coverage, the civic body has planned to decentralise its vaccination strategy further by delegating powers to officials at zonal levels to organise vaccination drives in different places, apart from the designated vaccination centres, based on availability and demand. For instance, a vaccination drive with the availability of around 250 doses was organised at Anna Nagar Tower Park on Sunday. While information on doses available at the designated vaccination centres are updated daily on the Corporation’s COVID-19 web portal, details about ad-hoc vaccination drives are communicated through fever survey workers to households in the respective localities. “We arrange drives in public places like parks so that people, who are walking-in, can get vaccinated if needed,” one of the zonal officers said. Vishu Mahajan, Deputy Commissioner, Revenue and Finance, said the civic body was organising vaccination drives at 10 malls and 27 marketplaces on an almost daily basis, depending on the availability of vaccines. He said almost 100% coverage was being targeted in the remaining six malls over the next few days, depending on the availability of vaccines.  Special drives Apart from this, he highlighted that the civic body also organised special drives for bus conductors, drivers and autorickshaw drivers. On days when the Corporation received surplus vaccines, apart from those allocated to vaccination centres, malls and markets, zonal-level officers are allocated doses to arrange drives in different localities. He said if and when supply-related constraints are eased, the Corporation intended to have at least one vaccination centre in each of the 200 wards so that people need not go far to get vaccinated. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said vaccination was being provided utmost priority as it was the most important tool to prevent a third wave of COVID-19. “To reach as many people as possible, instead of a centralised approach, we have delegated powers to the Regional Deputy Commissioners and in turn to zonal-level officials to organise more drives to vaccinate more people quickly,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/workers-in-four-out-of-10-malls-vaccinated-corpn/article35531593.ece

26 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No move to lift ban on lottery ticket sale, says Finance Minister||Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Sunday categorically ruled out any move to lift the ban on the sale of lottery tickets in the State. On Saturday, AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami said that there were attempts to reintroduce lottery tickets, and the DMK government should not allow the same. “I would like to assert that the talk about lottery did not arise in any of the discussions or review meetings of the Tamil Nadu government,” Mr. Rajan said in a statement. He said the erstwhile AIADMK government had left the State finances in tatters for the new government to improve it. “Even when we attempt to restore it, Mr. Palaniswami should understand that lottery is not at all in our minds,” he said. Mr. Rajan said while the former Chief Minister was welcome to improve the State finances if he had any creative ideas, he should not indulge in false campaigns and find fault with the government based on his imagination. The Minister said the previous AIADMK government was responsible for poor State finances and Mr. Palaniswami’s claim was a result of his frustration. Taking a dig at Mr. Palaniswami for not tabling the Comptroller and Auditor General’s reports on the floor of the Assembly in time, he said only after the DMK came to power, the administrative failures of the AIADMK had come to light. “The AIADMK’s administrative failure will further be exposed when the white paper on finances is released,” Mr. Rajan said. Pointing out how several files were not cleared by the AIADMK government for months, he said even a file relating to then Chief Minister’s announcement for the release of funds for the welfare of deceased police officers from the Disaster Response Fund, in September and October last year, was not cleared until this May.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-move-to-lift-ban-on-lottery-ticket-sale-says-finance-minister/article35531629.ece

Arul, was arrested by the police on Saturday, and has been lodged in the Saidapet sub-jail. The arrest was effected following an order of the Supreme Court on a contempt petition filed by his estranged wife Jennifer Arul, a journalist based in the city and the United States of America. The court sentenced him to three-month imprisonment in civil prison for not paying the compensation to her. Police sources said immediately after the court passed the order, he went into hiding. A domestic violence case was instituted by Ms. Jennifer in 2009, and the trial court had directed the husband to pay compensation. This order was upheld by higher courts. Last March, the then Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, Justices V. Ramasubramanian and A.S. Bopanna said Arul had ignored the court order, giving him a last chance to pay the entire outstanding amount along with the monthly maintenance regularly. In its order the court noted, “We have already given a long rope. The respondent [Arul] has not utilised the chances so given. Therefore, we punish the contemnor/respondent for committing contempt of this court, and sentence him to imprisonment for a period of three months in civil prison.” Police said he was arrested in Muttukadu on Saturday and lodged in the sub-jail on the orders of the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/son-of-former-inspector-general-arrested-for-contempt-of-court/article35531594.ece

Different from the routine of calling and asking customers to share one-time password (OTP) or card verification value (CVV) details, under the new modus operandi, the fraudsters send an SMS with the suspicious link, asking the user to update the details. Concerned over the rising number of complaints of such frauds, the police have issued an advisory. The suspicious link is circulated as an SMS, making it look like it has been sent from their bank. It informs the users that their account has been blocked, and that they should update KYC/PAN card/Aadhaar card details through a link. Raghavendra K. Ravi, Assistant Commissioner, cyber crime wing, said: “Subsequent to issuing an appeal to the public to be vigilant over this, we have intensified investigation to trace the scammers. The authorities of SBI and other banks have been alerted about this fraud.” Police sources said the fraudsters used tunnelling services, provided by firms based in the U.S., and indulged in the fraudulent acts by their hiding IP addresses. On clicking the link, the mobile phone is compromised, and the criminals gain access to bank account details, the police said. Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspicious link created a tunnel between the mobile phone and the server used by the fraudsters. At least a dozen complaints had been reported till Saturday. In this fraud, money is withdrawn from the account of the victim, unlike online transfers or online purchases, which is usually done by vishing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cyber-crime-wing-begins-probe-into-new-form-of-phishing/article35531597.ece

The park would have varieties of ornamental and hedge plants and a lawn. Various facilities, such as a walkers’ track and benches, have been provided for visitors. Planned facilities There are plans to add toilet blocks, he added. People were using the 2 km walkers’ track laid on the bund. Officials of the Water Resources Department said about 20 solar-powered lamps had been recently installed. The walls would be adorned with colourful paintings, depicting rural and urban life. Volunteers were involved in painting the walls for a distance of nearly 250 m. Spread across 600 acres, the lake is one of the major sources of groundwater. However, it still continues to be an easy target for sewage pollution and encroachments. Meanwhile, members of the Korattur Aeri Padhukappu Makkal Iyakkam wanted the surplus channel bringing excess water from the Ambattur lake to be cleared of vegetation. The channel must be desilted to facilitate smooth flow of floodwater into the Korattur lake, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/korattur-lake-eco-park-will-be-opened-today/article35531580.ece

26 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Simon Hercules’ body reburied in Kilpauk||The mortal remains of neurosurgeon Simon Hercules, who died of COVID-19, were exhumed from the Velangadu burial ground on Sunday and reburied in the Kilpauk Christian cemetery, after the Greater Chennai Corporation withdrew the appeal against the High Court judgment. Dr. Hercules died on April 19, 2020, of coronavirus and was buried in Velangadu, following protests by residents of Kilpauk during the pandemic. The High Court had ordered on March 31, 2021, to exhume the body and rebury it in the Kilpauk Christian cemetery, as per the last wish of Dr. Hercules. But the Corporation obtained a stay during the previous AIADMK regime. G. Leonard Ponraj, head of department, Sports Medicine, Tamil Nadu Government Super Speciality Hospital and a friend of the deceased, said the reburial was done only after the intervention of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin. The Corporation decided to withdraw the appeal against the High Court judgment following directions from the Chief Minister. “To be fair, there was not much awareness among the general public that the virus immediately dies once the person dies. Although this fact was well-known to the Health Officers of the Corporation, the previous Commissioner was wrongly advised,” Dr. Ponraj said. “In June 2021, we represented the issue to the Chief Minister, who was kind enough to pass on our request to the Corporation Commissioner, who ordered officers to withdraw the appeal against the High Court order and made all arrangements for the exhumation and reburial,” he said. Relatives of Dr. Hercules, including his wife Anandhi Simon, were present at the cemetery during the reburial on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/body-of-neurosurgeon-reburied-in-kilpauk/article35531582.ece

26 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Shining a spotlight on native fish breed||Beta Mahatvaraj has a ‘Fish Room’ in his house in the city, which has more than a dozen fish tanks but none of them have the usual exotic fish species one normally finds in aquariums. He has been travelling, spotting, collecting and documenting over 100 native Indian fish species for over 30 years now. The 41-year old’s interest in fish developed when he was five years old. “There was a stream near our house in Kerala, where we used to catch fish. I had a tank at home but with exotic fish. Over the years I realised, native fish species in our streams, lakes and waterbodies are often overlooked but their world is equally interesting!” Soon after his family moved to then Madras in the late 1980s, Mr. Mahatvaraj, hailing from Nagercoil, scouted for native freshwater fish in and around the city. His interest in fish helped him explore the fish species in nearby ponds and temporary puddles during the monsoon. Over the years, he visited hill streams in the Eastern and Western Ghats to collect fish species from there. He along with a few like-minded enthusiasts camp in specific parts of the Western Ghats for a few days to snorkel, photograph, document and study the native fish species found there. For his contribution to the study of one of the fish species in the Western Ghats, it was named Betadevario ramachandrani.  “These fish species live in microhabitats. Some of them live near the banks, some of them mid-stream, where they can live in the high flow of water, some of them closer to where marginal plants are seen. Each species is unique and has certain characteristics that are probably not found in other parts of the world,” Mr. Mahatvaraj explains. Unfortunately, he says, sand mining, destructive fishing methods, pesticide run-offs, dumping of waste, debris and effluents in waterbodies have led to the loss of the country’s native fish species. Invasive fish species such as the African-native tilapia, mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis ), African catfish ( Clarias gariepinus ) among others have also killed native fish species, he points out. Mr. Mahatvaraj, who is a delivery manager with a multi-national IT company in the city, has also been supporting several publications by ichthyologists. He recalls that the 2015 floods was a nightmare, when he lost a huge part of his collection in his pond. But, he plans ahead to overcome challenges, and has kept his hobby going for 30 years, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shining-a-spotlight-on-native-fish-species/article35531600.ece

26 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||City police return to foot patrolling||Despite having fleets of vehicles and networks of surveillance cameras, the Coimbatore City Police have reintroduced a rather difficult, but time-tested method of patrolling. Police personnel attached to all the 15 stations in the city are now conducing foot patrols in their respective limits to build the “missing bond” with people. An initiative by City Police Commissioner Deepak M. Damor, foot patrols are conducted in or more areas coming under each police station every day. “Patrols are of different types including four-wheeler patrol, two-wheeler patrol and foot patrol. Each patrol is suitable for different types of areas and has its pros and cons. The main objectives of foot patrol are to ensure visible policing and better engagement with the community to understand local area-specific challenges,” he said. According to him, police personnel get much better understanding of the lay of the land during foot patrols which also enhances the enforcement and problem-solving capability of the police. It is helpful in curbing violence, improving public health and in building relationship between the police personnel and the community. “Relationships built through foot patrols can change the view of the community on police officers. Citizens get to know their officers and vice versa,” Mr. Damor said. Though the police are getting positive feedback from the public, the human resource crunch is a hurdle for the police to conduct foot patrols in organised and effective manner. A team consisting of inspector, sub-inspector and police personnel from each police station will conduct the foot patrols in one or more designated areas in a day. Foot patrols have been reintroduced in addition to the 24 four-wheeler patrol teams and 42 two-wheeler patrols teams in the city. Increased vehicle use “Foot patrol used to be a routine in all police stations until some years ago. The practice faded slowly following increased use of vehicles for patrols. Reintroduction of foot patrols will definitely bring in visible results,” said an Assistant Commissioner of Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-police-return-to-foot-patrolling/article35531644.ece
26 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||High raw material prices impact demand||With no signs for raw material prices reducing, Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) are seeing demand slowing down. President of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers Association K.V. Karthik said that after the lockdown relaxations last year, demand picked up. This year, there was no such growth in demand after the lockdown. Instead, there was a degrowth. This was mainly because high raw material prices had affected the market sentiment. Coimbatore Tiny and Small Foundry Owners Association president A. Shiva Shanmughakumar said there was a 40 % hike in raw material prices in the last six to seven months. Larger industries were seeing their profits taking a hit because of this and they did not want to place orders now. “There is a drop in demand. Though migrant and domestic workers are returning to factories slowly, if the demand had picked up, the foundries would have faced labour shortage. But the units are able to manage now because the orders are low,” he said. According to P. Nallathambi, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association, just about 60 % of workers have returned. But, orders are not increasing and this is affecting industries. “We are not feeling the impact of worker shortage because orders have slowed down,” he said. J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said just about 65 % of workers had returned. There was no support from the government and the MSMEs were facing financial stress on different fronts. There were reports of a survey of micro and SME units in the city and it was said that the units were asked to share GST numbers too. There were also reports of MSMEs asked to pay VAT dues. These were all affecting the units, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-raw-material-prices-impact-demand/article35531640.ece
26 July 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Transgenders take up Silambam to break gender barriers in sports||When a group of transgenders from Coimbatore wanted to venture into sports, the first thing that came to their mind was Silambam – an ancient form of martial art from Tamil Nadu that has earned global recognition. Around 25 transgenders from Kavundampalayam area ensure that they are present on a ground at Thoppampatti, near Coimbatore, in the evening hours, where their coach B. Prabhu trains them in Silambam . Sports quota “This is a big step taken by a group of transgenders towards securing their place in [traditional] sports. Like in many other fields, transgenders need to come up in sports. In future, they can also request for sports quota for the third gender while applying for government jobs and admissions,” says Mr. Prabhu, a trained wrestler and Silambam player who is providing the free training for the transgenders. The group of transgenders headed by S. Anushya received the push to learn Silambam from ‘Mangaiyanavan Foundation’, which was started by seven women coaches with an aim to bring the third gender people into sports. “We, the seven women, felt that transgenders were not getting the encouragement and support to get into sports. Most of the transgenders used to play any of the popular games in their childhood. After becoming the third gender, they lack support and do not get the space to practice sports,” says Jamuna Rajavelappan, managing trustee of the foundation. To give the initial push, the transgenders were trained on handball and a match was held for them on the International Women’s Day. Prizes were also distributed. Now, they learn Silambam from Mr. Prabhu for two hours in the evening, except on Sundays. “We have been waiting for the right opportunity to enter into sports. Mangaiyanavan Foundation and Mr. Prabhu came forward to support us. Now, our aim is to take the message to more transgenders in Coimbatore and Tamil Nadu. In future, we expect separate sports meet for transgenders at the State and national levels,” said Ms. Anushya, a transwoman taxi driver.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgenders-take-up-silambam-to-break-gender-barriers-in-sports/article35531654.ece

About 1,000 colour television sets, purchased by the erstwhile DMK government [2006-11] under its free colour TV scheme, are stored on the premises. Though tokens were issued for the free TVs to the residents of Semmandalam and surrounding wards, they were not distributed due to the change in government in 2011, said residents. Profitable business Residents of the locality rued that while private wedding halls were making huge profits through rentals, the Cuddalore Municipality, having constructed a modern building, continued to keep it locked. The community hall has all facilities, including a modern kitchen, dining hall and washrooms. The building was constructed in 2008. When the community hall was inaugurated in 2009, it was touted to be a long-felt need of the local residents. A few social gatherings, including weddings, were held here. It was, however, sealed in 2010, said the residents. “Residents have been denied the facility for 11 years. Though repeated representations have been made to the authorities to reopen the community hall, they have failed to evoke any response,” said B. Ramkumar, a resident. ‘Issue taken up’ A municipal official said the authorities were unable to use the facility as the Revenue Department had stocked the free TVs inside. “We have asked them to remove the TVs and distribute them to government hospitals and other institutions. We have taken up the issue with the Revenue Divisional Officer,” the official said.

26 July 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Absence of signboards affects motorists||Absence of signboards displaying the direction to various destinations on Karur Bypass Road is worrying road users as they urged the State Highways Department to install boards to prevent confusion. The bypass road starts from Erode – Dharapuram Road Junction and reaches Solar Junction from where two roads, one to Karur and the other to Muthur start. People from other districts pass through Solar Junction frequently to take roads to Namakkal, Karur, Tiruchi and other destinations. But, in the absence of signboards, travellers face hardship as they have to stop their vehicles on the road and seek direction from the commuters waiting at the bus stop or from petrol bunk or from nearby shops. The situation is difficult during night because all the shops will be closed and the travellers find none to answer their queries. Lorry drivers face difficulty in identifying the roads that lead to Karur and Muthur and end up travelling for many kms on the wrong direction. “Thousands of vehicles pass through the junction every day, but there is no signboard which is essential”, said a hotel worker at Solar. He said that travellers and lorry drivers frequently seek their help to know the directions to Karur and Muthur. Shopkeepers and the public wanted a signboard to be installed at the junction with proper illumination so that travellers continue their journey without hardship. “The board should be visible clearly at least 200 m away”, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/absence-of-signboards-affects-motorists/article35531731.ece

The present incumbent, M. Krishnan, has been recently appointed as the Vice-Chancellor of Central University, Tiruvarur. Hence, a convenor’s committee must be constrituted before Mr. Krishnan takes charge as at the Central University, said Madurai Kamaraj University Faculty Association treasurer J. Balasubramaniam. According to the Constitution of the MKU, a three-member convenor’s committee has to be formed, which will perform the duties until a new VC is appointed. However, several vacancies in the MKU Syndicate have made it difficult to constitute the convenor’s committee. Currently, there are one University lecturer, three University professors, one University reader, two governor’s nominees and eight government officials with the Syndicate. Syndicate member R. Lakshmipathy said that he had written to Governor Banwarilal Purohit intimating that M. Jeyalakshmi, the seniormost assistant professor, who was part of the syndicate, abruptly resigned from her post on July 24. The High Court had restrained three University professors, who are members of the syndicate, from attending the syndicate meeting. As a result, there are issues in having University faculty in the convenor’s committee. So, the convenor’s committee must be constituted immediately with three locally available members of the syndicate, said Mr. Lakshmipathy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/constitute-convenors-committee-for-mku-till-new-vc-is-appointed/article35531907.ece

26 July 2021||MYSURU,TAMIL NADU||Karnataka reservoirs filling up rapidly||Rainfall in the district has been near normal so far this year and there has been excess rains in July. Vigorous monsoon in the catchment areas of the Cauvery and the Kapila has helped augment the inflow into the reservoirs though they are yet to reach their optimum levels. Mysuru district received 176.1 mm as against the long-term average of 195.22 mm for the period June 1 to July 25. But a variation of 20% above or below the long-term average rains is considered normal. However, for July the district has received 112.8 mm against the long-term average of 100.5 mm. Minister for Cooperation S.K. Somashekar, who is also in charge of the district, reviewed the situation and said here on Sunday that parts of Karnataka, north and central Karnataka and the coastal belt, has been ravaged by floods, but no such situation exists in Mysuru. The authorities said any flash flood in Mysuru is more likely owing to the high outflow from the Kabini and the KRS reservoirs, and not because of heavy rains in the region. Meanwhile, the inflow into the KRS was at the rate of 39,613 cusecs on Sunday and the outflow was stepped up from around 6,446 cusecs to 9,658 cusecs. The water level in the reservoir was 109.55 feet against the full reservoir level of 124.80 feet. This is higher than what it was on the same day last year when the water level was hovering at 107.41 feet. The gross storage in the reservoir has also increased to 31.27 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) against the full capacity of 49.45 tmcft. Similarly, the inflow into the Kabini reservoir at Beechanahalli in HD Kote taluk remained high and was at the rate of 25,968 cusecs and the outflow was maintained at 25,800 cusecs. The reservoir level was 2279.82 feet against the FRL of 2284 feet. The authorities at the Kabini tend to maintain a buffer of 2 to 4 feet as a safety measure as the dam is relatively small and tends to fill up rapidly when the monsoon is active. In Harangi, the inflow was at the rate of 12485 cusecs and the outflow was higher at 12,722 cusecs and the reservoir level was 2,854.29 feet against the FRL of 2,859 feet. The inflow into the Hemavathi reservoir at Gorur in Hassan district was at the rate of 27,057 cusecs thanks to copious rains in the catchment area of the river in Chikkamagaluru last week. The FRL of the reservoir is 2,922 feet against which the water level on Sunday was 2,915.82 feet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rains-near-normal-in-mysuru-reservoirs-filling-up-rapidly/article35531963.ece

26 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Traffic choke points grow around Puducherry town||Traffic bottlenecks are not new to commuters passing through the town but of late, vehicle users as well as pedestrians have started feeling the pressure of traffic jams even on suburban routes. One such area which has started witnessing heavy traffic is the Moolakulam area, particularly the stretch from Reddiarpalayam junction to the Vazudhavoor turning on the Puducherry-Villupuram road. New colonies With rapid urbanisation of the area, the road has become increasingly congested. The number of educational institutions and commercial hubs on the Villupuram route and the recent appearance of housing colonies and apartments on either side of the road up to Moolakulam have added to the traffic. Apart from those commuting between Villupuram and Puducherry, hundreds of people staying in residential colonies and apartments on either side of the road till Moolakulam are caught in traffic jams during peak hours.  The Villupuram road has become yet another commercial stretch. As a result, residents find it very difficult to move during peak hours as the carriageway is drastically narrowed because of two and four wheelers parked on both sides. The several turns off from the main road such as Reddiyarpalayam PSR Silks, opposite Lassi Shop etc., also mean that vehicles have to wait for a long time at junctions adding to the pile up, said R.D. Shrikanth, a resident of Balaji Paradise in Balaji Nagar. Nandakumar, past president of Srinivas Towers at Moolakulam, said the peak traffic times are between 8.30 a.m. to 9. 45 a.m. and 5. 30 p.m. to 8 p.m. “What used to be a safe and quiet road just about five years ago has now become a nightmare for residents. For children, crossing the road is extremely dangerous and we need to have a security guard to help them. It takes almost five minutes to cross the road. The problem is caused due to the turn off to the Vazhudhavur road. There is no traffic signal or policemen to regulate traffic, and it is a free for all,” he added. The problem was compounded by the reckless driving of private buses on the stretch, he added. Past secretary of Sreenivas Towers Owners Welfare Association, Oulgaret M.V. Kannan said though a busy stretch, authorities have failed to provide any pedestrian crossing marks on the stretch from Indira Gandhi Square to Moolakulam. Long term solutions The problem is also compounded by the increasing vehicle numbers in the Union Territory as well as the growing numbers of daily commuters to the city. Another major cause for the traffic jam is the presence of vendors on either sides of the narrow stretch, Mr. Kannan said. He suggested that the traffic jam could be eased if the road that branches off from the over-bridge on the 100 Feet Road is opened as early as possible. One temporary solution to ease the congestion is to push back the high tension transformers, particularly near Jaya Nagar and Opposite RSR Silks, said Mr. Shrikanth. The traffic police say manually regulating traffic on a narrow stretch having a regular flow of vehicles is near impossible. “Even if we have a signal constructed on the point where the road turns to Vazhudhavur, the problem will persist,” a police officer added. Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department V. Sathyamurti said the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had already sanctioned Rs. 72 crore for road improvement works in the Union Territory. The Moolakulam stretch had been included in the project for road widening, construction of medians and pedestrian crossings. Also, the government proposed to approach HUDCO for funding to construct a four-lane road connecting Cuddalore road and Arumparthapuram on the Villupuram route, he added. The traffic bottleneck could be solved with the road improvement works at Moolakulam and a new four-lane road, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-choke-points-grow-around-puducherry-town/article35532002.ece

26 July 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Silver anklet manufacturing industry sees slow revival in Salem||Silver jewellery manufacturing, which is a major industry in Salem, is seeing slow signs of revival following relaxation of lockdown restrictions. The silver jewellery manufacturing units that employ over a lakh workers, including a large number of migrant workers, are seeing orders trickling in from other States, too. The silver jewellery is mainly handmade and about 10% of workers are from other States. The industry had seen a complete halt of business activities due to the lockdown and now the anklet making units have restarted to deliver orders received before the lockdown and the job orders received for the festival season. K.V. Chandrapal, a silversmith, who is into the business for the last 20 years, says that following relaxations in lockdown, guest workers who had gone to their home towns have returned and units here have resumed operations. The orders are coming from northern States, too. C. Srianandarajan, secretary of Salem District Kolusu Manufacturers Kaivinai Sangam, said the units here have received orders for manufacturing silver anklets from Maharashtra for about 10 tonnes. Usually, the orders for festival season start coming in from beginning of July and the units start delivering after 20 days after receiving orders. This year, the orders for festival season are 50% less compared to earlier years. Manufacturers say that all stocks are freshly manufactured, and full revival of the industry depends on lockdown restrictions for containing the pandemic. Mr. Srianandarajan also said that due to continuing lockdown restrictions in Kerala, the orders from that State for Onam festival has reduced by 50%, this year.

26 July 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||A visit that has brought hope to tribal people||For Paliyar tribals of Sellayi Colony in Keezha Vadagarai,Theni district, it was a pleasant surprise when Collector K. V. Muralidharan visited them on Saturday. During an interaction with them for about 45 minutes, the Collector got to know about their economic activities and their educational level. Karuppiah, whose hut the Collector visited, had migrated from the interior forest to the plains about a decade ago after the officials had asked them to do but now they live in poverty. “In one dwelling, about five families live. With just a bamboo screen as a wall between two families, the womenfolk cook food with firewood and sleep there. They have no toilet facility. The women use a sanitary complex,” an official said. The community has Aadhaar cards, ration cards and Scheduled Tribe certificates. In the entire colony, one girl has just passed class 11 and is going to a government school. A few other children are going to the nearby Anganwadi centre, Karuppiah said. Along with the men, some of the women go to the foothills and collect honey, pick gooseberries and herbal plants. The produce, which includes broomsticks, is sold to vendors and middlemen, who give them paltry sums. Speaking to The Hindu , District Executive Officer (Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project) S. Rajathi said that the Collector has proposed to get them free house site pattas and build dwellings for them. The petitioners had requested for skill-based training which would help them get higher incomes. Under the convergence activity, the Collector said that in about 100 days, the dwellings should be in place and the proposal to give them cattle and milch animals would be explored. Currently, only five people in the group are earning daily wages through goat rearing. Some of the tribals are also earning a little money from working as night watchmen in some of the coconut and mango orchards in the nearby villages owned by private people. The visit of the Collector to their colony with senior officials has brought hope for Karuppiah and other tribal families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-visit-that-has-brought-hope-to-tribal-people/article35531717.ece
26 July 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers upset as water hyacinth poses a problem to ‘kar’ crop||The Peikulam farmers near Sawyerpuram in Thoothukudi district have taken up ‘kar’ crop in their fields after 25 years as the district administration had released water for irrigation on June 1. However, the mushroom growth of water hyacinth in the region is being seen as a major issue by the farmers. Though the officials from the PWD and other departments have promised to remove them, the farmers' are keeping their fingers crossed as they require water for irrigation till October, when the harvest takes place. The ayacutdars in the Melakkal, Keezhakal, Srivaikundam Vadakal and Thenkal get water for irrigation from Tamirabharani in the main canal. Close to 4000 hectares have so far been covered by the farmers following the timely release of water. Though the tanks are fast filling up, the farmers here are worried that the fields may not get the due share due to the presence of the hyacinth growth. According to P Rajan a farmer from Sivathaiyapuram here, the water hyacinth had to be removed immediately as the water bodies were covered with a green sheet. " This will drain the water and also block the channels..." he claimed. One the one side, we are happy that the rainfall had led to water filling up in the reservoirs, but since the hyacinth in all the channels en route Srivaikundam had been washed off and got clogged in Peikulam tank, we are worried," he said. The Peikulam tank could feed water to 2500 acres in the block. Thousands of farmers depended on this. About 400 acres of ‘kar’ crop had been raised, while the rest are raising plantain crops. The officials should remove the hyacinth on a war footing, especially, in the channels which received water from the Peikulam tank. During a recent interaction, the Thoothukudi MP K. Kanimozhi had promised to get the water hyacinth removed. This had come as a relief to us, the farmers said and added that timely action would enable them to harvest this season after over two decades. The PWD officials have given an assurance to the farmers to clear the water hyacinth, which would be handed over to the self-help-groups who could sell them with a value addition in the markets, they added. Collector K Senthil Raj has also inspected the block recently and promised to support in the initiative for the farmers could reap in added earnings from the ‘kar’ crop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-upset-as-water-hyacinth-poses-a-problem-to-kar-crop/article35532044.ece
26 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Travel on ghat road to Pachamalai an ordeal for villagers, tourists||The 14-km stretch of ghat road from Pachamalai hills to Top Sengattupatti lies in a worn-out state. Residents of hamlets living on the hills struggle to travel, while tourists think twice before making the trip. The damaged stretch causes daily discomfort for travellers. While villagers depend on two-wheelers, trucks that take the road to load vegetables harvested on the hills hinder the narrow path. “Travelling on the bus is scary as it takes the sharp hairpin bend turns. The uneven roads add to the problem. The hour-long trip is something we do not look forward to,” a resident said. The road, maintained by the forest department is ridden with potholes, causing drivers to apply the brakes several times. The person driving up the hill needs to be skilful as it is a tricky terrain. “My car’s steering box malfunctioned and it cost me Rs. 30,000 to fix it. I am now taking the bus to avoid these issues,” Sampath Kumar, Medical Officer in charge at Top Sengattupatti Primary Healthcare Centre told The Hindu . Tourists who visit the hill station this time of the year are also put off by the roads. “We usually take a trip from Thuraiyur to the waterfalls on the hills. However, with the trucks taking this road, the damage increases,” S. Suresh, a tourist, said. A section of residents is of the opinion that maintenance of the road has to be entrusted with Department of Highways. “In other hill stations, the department has maintained the roads so well. We would also like the roads to be better so that tourists visit our hills and experience it,” another resident said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/travel-on-ghat-road-to-pachamalai-an-ordeal-for-villagers-tourists/article35531708.ece
26 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||New bridge planned across Cauvery river, says Minister||A new bridge across the Cauvery has been planned between Melachinthamani and Mambalasalai in the city. Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru told reporters on Sunday that construction of a new bridge had become inevitable since the existing bridge had become weak due to improper repair and maintenance work under the previous AIADMK government. Mr. Nehru, who earlier held a discussion with MLAs of the central districts on the demands of the people in their areas, said the existing Cauvery bridge constructed about 48 years ago had developed cracks. Hence, the State Highways had started preliminary works for formulating a plan for a new structure. When his attention was drawn to reservations expressed by the people on expansion of municipal and corporation limits by merging adjoining town and villages, Mr. Nehru said the exercise was aimed at creating more facilities for the people. It would depend upon their receptiveness. If residents had objections to the expansion, the government would listen to them and desist from taking any decision in a hasty manner.  Flyover project On the delay in acquiring a piece of defence land at Mannarpuram to complete the Aristo flyover bridge, he said sincere steps would be taken. As sought by the Defence Ministry, the State government had initiated a process to hand over alternate land site of same value. Once it granted the nod, work on completing the remaining portion of the flyover would begin. The Tiruchi Corporation would carry out the remaining work. As far as the Smart City Mission projects were concerned, Mr. Nehru said the previous AIADMK government had spent 70% to 80% of allotted money. Work orders had been issued to various projects before the election. However, the DMK government had committed to completing all projects within the stipulated timeframe.

26 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Association demands Karaikal-Bengaluru daytime express train||The Nagore Nagapattinam Rail Users Association has appealed to the Railway Minister to operate the Karaikal-Bengaluru passenger train that was suspended due to COVID-19 since March 2020 as a daytime express train. In a memorandum to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who took charge recently, association secretary MMAA. Sithiq and president S. Mohan said local residents and tourists faced hardships in the absence of the train. South Western Railway, which operated a daily passenger train from Karaikal to Bengaluru and back, suspended the service due to the pandemic. The service continues to remain suspended till date, the association said and suggested that the service may be introduced during day time as an express train. At present, local travellers are dependent on the lone Mysore-Mayiladuthurai-Mysore overnight express train via Thanjavur and Tiruchi, which remains crowded, and, hence, the request for introduction of Karakal-Bengaluru express train service during daytime. The association has also appealed to the Railway Minister to introduce a day time express train from Velankanni to Madurai or via Madurai to any southern districts of Tamil Nadu. It also sought introduction of a new bi-weekly train between Ernakulam and Velankanni and back via Kollam. ‘Utilise BG stretch’ It has urged the Minister to take steps to introduce express rail services on Tiruvarur- Karaikudi broad gauge stretch via Pattukottai that was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge. Though the Tiruvarur-Karaikudi stretch was converted to broad gauge more than two years ago by investing crores of rupees, regular train services are yet to commence. Further, there must be a day-time express train between Chennai Egmore and Rameswaram via Tiruvarur and Karaikudi and an overnight express train from Karaikudi to Chennai Egmore everyday. It has also urged the railway administration to allocate sufficient funds to complete the new BG line from Karaikal to Peralam and for the new line between Nagapattinam and Tiruthuraipoondi via Thirukkuvalai. It has also appealed to the Minister to introduce a weekly express train between Nagore or Karaikal and Ajmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/association-demands-karaikal-bengaluru-daytime-express-train/article35531710.ece

26 July 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Vulture population on the rise in tiger reserve||A recent study of the population of vultures in the Sigur plateau has found that the population of all four resident vulture species have seemingly been on the rise over the past few years. In a study titled Population status and seasonal distribution of vultures in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve , published in the Journal of Science and Technology, authors S. Manigandan, P. Kannan, H. Byju, S. Bharathidasan and B. Ramakrishnan recorded vulture sightings between January and October of 2018, along 61 km of roads through the reserve. The roads pass through key vulture habitats in Siriyur, Vazhaithottam, Masinagudi, Moyar, Theppakadu and Kakkanallah. The researchers had 1,602 encounters with vultures, with a majority of them being with the critically-endangered white-rumped vulture ( Gyps bengalensis) , followed by the long-billed vulture ( Gyps indicus) , the red-headed vulture ( Sarcogyps calvus ) and the egyptian vulture ( Neophron percnopterus ). Though white-rumped vultures were the most frequently recorded, with 1,405 encounters, researchers said there were also encouraging signs that the populations of long-billed vultures, asian king vultures and egyptian vultures using the landscape was increasing. Mr. Ramakrishnan, assistant professor at the department of zoology and wildlife biology at the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam and one of the authors of the paper, said it was interesting that data pointed to a clear increase in the number of sightings of vultures between the months of January and May, indicating that vultures were using the tiger reserve as a key nesting habitat. “The study is indicative that there are good nesting sites for vultures here, as well as excellent food availability, which in turn points to a healthy number of carnivores, whose kills the vultures depend on for food,” he said. Younger vultures Another encouraging sign that the researchers noticed was the increasing number of juvenile asian king vultures. It must be noted that researchers are yet to find a single nesting site for the rarely-spotted species on the Sigur plateau, and the records of younger vultures is indicative that the species is breeding and their numbers increasing. “Of the nine vulture species found in India, the four resident ones, as well as three seasonal migrants — the Eurasian griffon vulture, the Himalayan griffon and the cinerous vulture — are spotted in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) every year. The fact that these vultures are seen here is a sign of the importance of the landscape as a whole,” said another researcher. Deputy Director of MTR (buffer zone) L.C.S. Srikanth said the Forest Department was facilitating long-term studies of vultures in the reserve. “We have noticed new nesting sites, with the growth of Terminalia arjuna trees along newly-established check dams, which is also very encouraging. We have also proposed the setting up of a vulture breeding and rehabilitation centre to help in the long-term conservation of the species,” he added.  Of the nine vulture species found in India, the four resident ones, as well as three seasonal migrants, are spotted in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve every year||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vulture-population-on-the-rise-in-tiger-reserve/article35531634.ece
26 July 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Traffic police hold counselling session for habitual offenders||In an effort to end the menace of haphazard unauthorised parking, mainly of autorickshaws, the Vellore District Traffic Police organised an hour-long counselling for habitual offenders at the traffic police station on Vella Mundy Street on Sunday. Based on the CCTV footage on key stretches such as Anna Salai, Fort Round Road, Court Road and Green Circle since June, the traffic police shortlisted 55 habitual offenders, mainly for unauthorised parking. Most of the violators were mainly autorickshaw drivers from Vellore, Katpadi, Sattuvachari and Rangapuram on the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway (NH 48). Lack of adequate parking space was said to be the cause of unauthorised parking by autorickshaw drivers. Vellore has 30,000 autorickshaws. “Similar counselling sessions will be held for others breaking rules like jumping the signal, wrong side driving and parking beyond the spotline based on CCTV footage soon. The aim is to bring down such violations by awareness rather than merely imposing fines,” Albert John, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Vellore, told The Hindu . At the counselling session on Sunday, 16 persons, who violated the traffic rules mostly within 5-km radius of the Vellore Fort covering key stretches, participated. Along with officials from the office of the Regional Transport Officer (RTO), Vellore traffic police spoke about various inconveniences caused to the public, including traffic chaos and accidents, by such unauthorised parking. The counselling team, which was led by road inspector (traffic) R. Srinivasan, and Motor Vehicle Inspector (MVI) S. Sakthivel, explained laws that prohibit such unauthorised parking in public places and punishment, including fines for such offences. Undertaking sought The offenders were encouraged to give an undertaking that they would not break the rules again in future. Unauthorised parking has become rampant in old bus terminus, Fort and Sarathy Mansion. A special traffic team has been formed to monitor rash driving and jumping of the signal from the traffic control room set up in the Vellore North police station recently. As a first step to ease traffic flow on Anna Salai, only two-wheeler parking has been allowed along the Sarathy Mansion, in front of the Fort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-police-hold-counselling-session-for-habitual-offenders/article35532052.ece

In a statement, Collector J. Meghanath Reddy said that small and marginal farmers with land holdings up to 5 acres will be given the drip irrigation facility with 100% subsidy. Other farmers can have the facility for up to 1.25 acres with 75% subsidy under the Prime Minister’s Precision Irrigation Scheme. The statement said Virudhunagar district is a rain-shadow region, and to make up for water shortage, drip irrigation will help in judicious usage of water and also help increase the farm coverage and generate higher income for farmers. The drip irrigation system will reduce weed-removal charges and also shorten the duration of irrigation for crops.  Horticulture farmers who are interested in availing of this benefit need to produce land documents along with passport-size photographs, copy of Aadhar, ration card and soil and water testing reports and certificates for small/marginal farmer from the Tahsildar.

The immigrants had no valid travel documents but managed to procure Indian documents like Aadhaar card by posing as residents of West Bengal.

Just as morning walkers were completing their stroll, MLA and BJP leader Abhay Patil drove a tractor full of garbage to the official residence of city corporation commissioner K.H. Jagadish. He moved the tractor in front of the gates and unloaded it. He got off the tractor and shovelled the garbage dumped in front of the gate, on the pavement, evenly. His associates helped him. The corporation commissioner’s house is at a stone’s throw distance from the home office of Member of Parliament Mangala Angadi and senior officers, including the Additional Deputy Commissioner. Mr. Patil defended his act by calling it his morning cleaning routine. He said that he was sick and tired of complaining about garbage removal from streets and public places in his constituency of Belagavi South. “I tell them every day, but officers don’t do their job. People of my constituency are forced to walk around in garbage. It can spread disease and their lives are endangered. I decided to protest against their inaction by dumping garbage in front of the top officer’s house. They will understand our problems, only when we do what they do to us,” he said. “If the city corporation continues to neglect the issue, I will continue to do this. I will bring garbage form my constituency and throw it in front of the commissioner’s house,” he said. Mr. Jagadish then said that he would view the development with a positive outlook. “Our staff are busy in flood management. They are doing a very good job in clearing gutters and cleaning tanks in the city limits. I will ask them to focus equally so on garbage disposal in the city,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mla-dumps-garbage-in-front-of-corpn-officers-house-in-protest/article35531754.ece
26 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Flood-hit people in Belagavi district express anguish||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa faced some opposition from some flood victims in affected villages in Belagavi district on Sunday. Flood victims expressed their anguish against the State government in Yamagarani and Sankeshwar. Manjunath Dole from Yamagarani told journalists that officials have been negligent to flood victims. “We were shifted to flood relief centres three days ago. We have not got proper food, blankets and other things for two days. Only today, officers gave us proper food, as the Chief Minister is visiting,” he said. Banneppa Tumbad, a farmer from Sankeshwar, told journalists that the State government has failed to provide proper relief to farmers who have lost houses. “My brother’s house collapsed in last year’s floods. He is yet to get the Rs. 5 lakh compensation that the Chief Minister announced last year,” he said. Yallavva Tumbarmani of Ramdurg sought permanent resettlement of all vulnerable villages. “We are tired of shifting to nearby villages and towns every monsoon. For two years now, we have lost our foodgrains and vegetables stored in our houses. We have not got proper compensation for the losses suffered. We want the government to find a permanent solution to our problems,” she said. Mr. Yediyurappa, who addressed the flood victims in a meeting in Sankeshwar, said that the government will provide houses to all those who have lost theirs. He said that he will direct officials to ensure that all flood victims of earlier years are also properly compensated. Officials have identified a 50-acre land in Sankeshwar to create a resettlement village. “If the flood victims cooperate, we will build houses for all of them,” he said. He visited houses affected by floods in Math Galli, Nadi Galli and Kumbar Oni in Sankeshwar. He spoke to inmates of the relief centre set up in Shankarlinga Mangal Karyalaya. The Chief Minister met flood victims in Yamagarani and Sankeshwar and visited flood-hit areas in some villages. However, he did not stop to receive any grievances from the public. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath told the Chief Minister that officers have set up five relief centres where 630 people are being given shelter. More will be opened if needed, he said. The district administration has helped relocate 20,000 people to safety in a week, he said. The conspicuous absence of the former Minister and Gokak MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi and Arabavi MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi raised some questions. Some BJP workers wondered whether it was indicative of a sign of changing political equations. Gokak city unit BJP president Bhimshi Bharamannanavar denied that it was a political decision. “Both the brothers are busy in providing relief to flood victims in their constituencies. That may be the reason why they could not attend the Chief Minister’s programme,’’ he said. Deputy Chief Ministers Govind Karjol and Lakshman Savadi, Food Minister Umesh Katti and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flood-hit-people-in-belagavi-district-express-anguish/article35531753.ece

26 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two years of lurching from crisis to crisis||A sense of déjà vu marked the eve of the second anniversary of B.S. Yediyurappa’s tenure as Chief Minister, as he toured flood-hit Belagavi district on Sunday. Two years ago, soon after taking over, he had visited the North Karnataka districts that witnessed a deluge, even as he awaited clearance from the BJP high command to form a Cabinet. To repeated questions on whether he was stepping down from the top post, his refrain on Sunday was that he was awaiting a “message” from the high command on his future. This uneasy relationship with the high command from day one continued has through the term. Defectors and balancing game “Even during efforts to topple the Janata Dal (S)-Congress coalition, the gap between the party high command and Mr. Yediyurappa was evident. This only grew once the defectors came into the Cabinet,” a senior Minister said. Amid constant speculation over “how long” he would survive as Chief Minister, Mr. Yediyurappa lurched from crisis to crisis — first the floods and then the COVID-19 pandemic spread over 15 months, besides constant jibes from his detractors within the party. Floods and the pandemic put immense strain on the State’s financial situation, often creating political problems as well. The Chief Minister, who holds the Finance portfolio, received no special support from the Union government. The constant complaint was that the Chief Minister was “partial” in fund allocation, with focus on the 17 Legislative Assembly segments of defectors that saw bypolls. This was one of the first planks of dissidence against him, highlighted by Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, one of his most stringent critics. Though Mr. Yediyurappa scored big, winning 12 of 15 seats of defectors that saw bypolls in December 2019, he had a tough time expanding his Cabinet to include the defectors. Several trips to Delhi were cancelled and there were times when he failed to even secure an appointment with the central leadership. He expanded his Cabinet twice — in February 2020 and in January 2021 — and both were preceded by speculation of leadership change and a months-long process to secure clearance. Son’s role As the Chief Minister celebrated his 78th birthday in February 2020, dissidence within the party peaked. Two unsigned letters, purportedly circulated by disgruntled MLAs, alleged interference and corruption by his son B.Y. Vijayendra and demanded leadership change. This was the first open articulation of the demand. With only defectors being inducted into the Cabinet, many seniors were left out and they began meeting in groups, leading to speculation about a revolt. Before Mr. Yediyurappa could complete one year in office in July 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, pushing the leadership change question to the back burner. But it eventually re-emerged, after the first wave of infections peaked and dropped. This period was marked by several communities, especially the Panchamasali-Lingayat subsect, seeking a better deal in the reservation pie, for the first time creating a rift within the vote bank that remained the USP of Mr. Yediyurappa. In fact, Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure was marked by voices of dissent from within the community — Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Umesh Katti, Murugesh Nirani, to name a few. Other voices that emerged over time were those of C.P. Yogeshwar and A. H. Vishwanath. After several months of lobbying with the high command, he again expanded his Cabinet in January 2021, accommodating some dissidents such as Mr. Katti, Mr. Nirani, and Mr. Yogeshwar, but failed to control the open dissidence, even from those within the Cabinet. Though the Chief Minister’s camp lodged complaints against the dissenters, the party high command did little. Through the second wave of the pandemic that hit the State during April-June this year, speculation about leadership change again took a break, only to return with vengeance as the Yediyurappa government hurtled towards its second anniversary. In not acting against dissidents and not clarifying on speculation about leadership change, the high command kept the State’s political cauldron constantly stirred for the past two years. The party did not clarify even when Mr. Yediyurappa said on June 7 that he would resign if the high command asked him to. Hours before his second anniversary, he was on a loop saying the same thing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-years-of-lurching-from-crisis-to-crisis/article35531570.ece
26 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Heavy rains leave many roads, houses inundated in city||A day that began bright and sunny turned into a gloomy evening with heavy rains, bringing several parts of the city to a near standstill. Civic agencies on Sunday evening were inundated with complaints of flooded roads and slow-moving traffic. Flooding was reported on many key roads and junctions, including Rajarajeshwarinagar Arch, Coffee Board junction, Vittal Mallya Road, near Town Hall, Minerva Circle, Leprosy Hospital on Magadi Road, and under the railway bridge near Khoday’s Circle. At Shivajinagar Chowk area, pedestrians were seen wading through knee-deep water. Ongoing roadworks added to the chaos. “Several roads and drains in the city have been dug up. This is one of the reasons for the flooding in these areas,” sources in the BBMP said. Personnel at the BBMP’s control rooms said apart from complaints about flooding in a few places, no other complaints had been received. However, according to the personnel in the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, rainwater had entered a few houses at Srinivasapura. “We have forwarded the complaint to the jurisdictional BBMP control room,” they said. Following a burst in a pipeline, water reportedly flooded a house in Sanjeevappa Line, adjacent to Cubbonpet Main Road, while a wall of a house in Gowtham Colony in Domlur ward collapsed following the heavy rain. According to the former councillor C.R. Lakshminarayan, rainwater had flooded over 10 houses in the slum. He added that no one was injured in the wall collapse. As per the alerts by Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, highest rainfall of 100.5 mm was recorded at Hemmigepura, 77.5 mm at H. Gollahalli, 75.5 mm in Jnana Bharathi ward, 67 mm at Hampinagar, and 66.5 mm in Kengeri. C.S. Patil, Director, IMD Bengaluru, told The Hindu that the city was likely to receive light to moderate rainfall over the next five days. The rain is being attributed to the low pressure over Jharkhand and adjoining areas, apart from the off-shore trough running from Karnataka coast to Kerala coast. “Rainfall in the State will reduce in intensity and distribution, albeit temporarily, from July 25. A low pressure area is developing over the Bay of Bengal and more rain may be expected after July 28,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heavy-rains-leave-many-roads-houses-inundated-in-city/article35531546.ece
26 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||KSRTC to modify AC buses to transport agricultural produce||The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), which has taken a huge financial hit due to the pandemic, is experimenting with new ways to rake in non-fare revenue. Taking a cue from the Railways’ Kisan Rail initiative, which helps farmers transport agricultural products to different parts of the country, the corporation is planning to convert some of its old air-conditioned buses to ferry agricultural produce within the State. Initially, buses will be operated from Chickballapur, Kolar, Hoskote, and other areas located closer to Bengaluru. “Buses will be run on a pilot basis in a month. Each division has been asked to modify an old AC bus that is in good condition. The KSRTC is likely to spend Rs. 6 lakh to Rs. 7 lakh to modify the bus,” said KSRTC managing director Shivayogi C. Kalasad. The corporation is hoping to cash in on Bengaluru city’s demand for agricultural produce from neighbouring districts and suburban areas, and at the same time help farmers. “At present, farmers bring vegetables, fruits and other produce in regular buses in the morning and sell them at K.R. Market or other places. If we provide AC transport in the coming days, it will help them,” said Mr. Kalasad, adding that the service will be provided on a contractual basis either to a farmer or a group of farmers. “Their societies can also book these vehicles.” KSRTC had planned to introduce the service in April, but postponed it in the wake of a strike by employees and the subsequent lockdown during the peak of the second wave of COVID-19. The corporation introduced AC buses in its fleet in 2003, and currently has 500 vehicles. A bus is scrapped after it runs over 11 lakh to 12 lakh km or has been in use for over 13 years. Over the years, the KSRTC has scrapped around 283 AC buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ksrtc-to-modify-ac-buses-to-transport-agricultural-produce/article35531558.ece

26 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Health camp held on the street after school reneges on promise at ‘BJP leader’s behest’||Members of a non-governmental organisation were forced to conduct a health check-up and blood donation camp on the street after a government school which had given them permission to conduct it went back on its word, allegedly after a BJP member put pressure on the school’s headmaster. The camp was organised by Bhavya Narasimhamurthy, who heads B and N Foundation, a registered NGO. Ms. Narasimhamurthy is also Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson and is the State in-charge of ‘Priyadarshini’ in the Mahila Congress. Around 150 people attended the health camp while 23 donated blood. Ms. Narasimhamurthy said it was a huge inconvenience to doctors and the people who attended the camp as it was conducted on the street. While the school’s headmaster had reportedly given oral permission to conduct the camp inside the Government High School at Srirampura, in Dayanandanagar ward which falls under Rajajinagar Assembly constituency, she said they refused to allow them on Friday afternoon, allegedly after the intervention of a BJP member who is a close aide of Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar. The BJP member is said to have told Ms. Narasimhamurthy that Mr. Kumar would decide if she could conduct the camp at the school. “I even called up Mr. Kumar’s office and informed them of the matter. But I got no response. So I decided to go ahead and conduct the camp in front of the school,” she said, condemning “petty politics”. She said that after the camp was held, she stood outside Mr. Kumar’s house demanding why she was refused permission. Mr. Kumar, who was not in his house, said he would meet her on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/health-camp-held-on-the-street-after-school-reneges-on-promise-at-bjp-leaders-behest/article35531555.ece
26 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two caught while withdrawing cash from ATM fraudulently||Staff of an electronic surveillance and cash management company caught two men in the act of withdrawing cash fraudulently from an ATM at K.P. Agrahara on Friday. Based on a series of complaints, the bank manager roped in Transaction Solutions International to look into the matter. Staff kept a close surveillance of ATMs and after analysing CCTV camera footage zeroed in on the two men. The accused, later identified as Anand Kumar and Shahid Ahmed from Uttar Pradesh, were caught seconds after they withdrew Rs. 10,000 from the ATM at Jain Temple, Pipeline Road, by employees of the firm. Though the duo had withdrawn cash, the balance in their accounts were intact. “Inquiries revealed that the duo used an indigenous method of jamming the cash dispenser to block the sensor at the time of dispensing the cash. As the machine is jammed, the transactions would not be recorded even if the money is withdrawn. Using this modus operandi , the duo had withdrawn huge amounts of cash from many ATMs across the city,” said a police officer. He added that they had opened accounts in several banks. “The bank staff alerted the K.P. Agrahara police who have taken up the case,” the police officer added.  Similar case the Rajajinagar police arrested Deepak H., 20, also from U.P., who used a similar modus operandi to fraudulently withdraw cash from ATMs. Immediately after inserting the ATM card and pin, Deepak would jam the cash dispenser with his fingers while simultaneously pulling out the cash. “The system would then report a technical snag and the transaction would be nullified,” said the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-caught-while-withdrawing-cash-from-atm-fraudulently/article35531550.ece
26 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Only a few pvt. hospitals interested to buy vaccines||Only a few private hospitals are continuing to express interest in administering COVID-19 vaccines even as the Centre has pulled up the private sector for not utilising the 25% quota of vaccines. According to the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), only around 120 hospitals in State are still procuring vaccines. PHANA has around 6,000 members. PHANA president Prasanna H.M. told The Hindu that the availability of free vaccines in government hospitals and erratic supply of vaccines were major reasons for the lack of enthusiasm among hospitals, especially the smaller ones, to procure and administer vaccines. “We were keen to buy vaccines from June 26, but only four lakh doses were indented by mid-July. Why hospitals are hesitant is because the government itself is advertising free vaccines. Who will buy when that is the case? We were vaccinating around 200 to 300 people per day. Now, those who are vaccinating administer jabs for around 40 to 50 people. People don’t want to invest in vaccine stocks and sit with unused stocks. Only big chain hospitals and medical colleges can and are vaccinating. Most others have almost stopped,” he said. Mid-July, the State government had asked private hospitals to raise indents for vaccines under the 25% quota for the private sector as the pace of vaccination was hit due to short supply. The government had said 15 lakh doses were available for private hospitals in the State this month. A huge investment “We have to pay upfront and it becomes a huge investment. If we are unable to liquidate it, we incur huge losses. We have to pay Rs. 630 per dose for Covishield and Rs. 1,250 for Covaxin. In addition, the supply chain was erratic. For instance, we had paid for doses on July 15, but we still have not got supply,” Dr. Prasanna added. Paid vaccines find takers only in cities such as Bengaluru and Mysuru and where there are corporate clients, he said, adding that in taluks and tier-2 cities, people do not want to pay for vaccines as they are available for free from the government. Recently, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal had taken on the private sector for not utilising the vaccine quota, alleging that sector had made tall promises about delivering crores of jabs, but failed to deliver. He had also said that the government would ensure everybody gets free vaccine in the country with or without their help.  We were keen to buy vaccines from June 26, but only four lakh doses were intended by mid-July. Why hospitals are hesitant is because the government itself is advertising free vaccines. Who will buy when that is the case?

26 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Political turbulence hit the administration hard||Amid tussles involving Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the BJP high command, and the leader’s detractors, it was often the people of Karnataka who had to pay the price over the past two years. Administration took a back seat with no new flagship schemes or landmark projects taken up, while the COVID-19 pandemic that paralysed everything like never before made up a good part of the two-year period. Though the Ministers list a slew of schemes and policies, they do not match Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s much-touted pre-poll promise of putting Karnataka on the fast pace of development. In fact, history repeated itself as the bickering between Mr. Yediyurappa and the party’s old-timers that marked his first stint as Chief Minister came back to haunt him; as did corruption charges. But despite political turbulences, the first stint had stood out for enthusiasm, leading to the government taking up some noteworthy schemes. But this was missing, both among those in government and the party cadre, this time. In fact, criticism over lacklustre performances came strongly from the party leaders themselves. While disgruntled leaders such as Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, A.H. Vishwanath, and C.P. Yogeshwar publicly criticised the government for not matching the people’s expectations, some of the party old-timers did not hesitate to express their displeasure over the functioning style of the government while participating in legislature debates. However, the Chief Minister’s defenders point a finger at the COVID-19 pandemic for the slow pace of development. “Like elsewhere in the country and the world, the pandemic that gripped us had a multi-dimensional effect. Apart from causing a medical emergency that required the utilisation of manpower from various departments and pumping in financial resources, the pandemic also crippled our revenues,” observed a senior Minister. Second wave woes But the manner in which the government responded to the second wave of the pandemic also came under criticism. Many leaders believe that the Chamarajanagar tragedy of 24 COVID-19 patients dying because of lack of oxygen supply could have been averted had there been proper coordination among officials. On the whole, the reading was that the political bosses could not establish control over bureaucracy because of the political uncertainty. Amid complaints of corruption and favouritism, senior Minister K.S. Eshwarappa’s complaint to the Governor — that the Chief Minister was interfering in the administration of his department — provided adequate fodder for those trying to find reasons for discontent among some Ministers. Both the supporters and detractors of Mr. Yediyurappa agree that the manner in which the government was formed (by getting 16 MLAs from other parties into the party fold and providing ministerial posts to most) was the root cause of lack of enthusiasm and the government as the party’s old guards and workers felt left out. In hindsight, many leaders now even argue that it would have been better for the party to opt for President’s Rule and midterm polls after dislodging the JD(S)-Congress coalition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/political-turbulence-hit-the-administration-hard/article35531571.ece

Shivakumar on Sunday urged the government to dissolve the State Assembly and go for a fresh mandate. “Let the new dispensation come based on what the people want and decide,” he told reporters after receiving the State-level COVID-19 report from an MP-led Congress committee onCOVID-19. Referring to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s visit to flood-affected areas in Belagavi, he said, “Why is it that the government has failed to provide relief to those affected by floods in the past two years? Why has not Prime MinisterNarendra Modi come to Karnataka though the State has seen floods for three years? Why is there a discrimination in flood relief?” He added, “Mr. Yediyurappa has confessed that there is political instability since they took over. That is the only gift he has given to the people. The government has failed to address the public’s woes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dissolve-state-assembly-says-dks/article35531572.ece

On Friday, landslips were reported at two places, between Caranzol and Dudhsagar (at Tunnel No. 7) and between Dudhsagar and Sonaulim. The engine and first general coach of Train no. 01134 Mangaluru Jn - Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus Express Spl. (which was running on the diverted route via Madgaon-Londa-Miraj due to overflow of Vashishti River between Chiplun and Kamathe) had suffered a derailment on the Dudhsagar-Sonaulim section. According to the Chief Public Relations Officer of SWR Aneesh Hegde, the derailed engine at Dudhsagar-Sonaulim Section was re-railed last night and two coaches were re-railed on Saturday morning to clear the site. The debris, rubble and muck at Tunnel No. 7 were cleared around 2 a.m. on Saturday. And by 2.15 p.m. on Saturday, the track was cleared and restored for traffic at the second spot (Dudhsagar-Sonaulim), Mr. Hegde said through a press release. “A speed restriction on 10 kmph has been imposed, temporarily, in view of safety and further monitoring of the spots and nearby locations will be carried out for the next 24-48 hrs, very closely. To prevent further landslips, and erosion of earth of the hill due to rain, shoring arrangements are being done using rails and sleepers at these and nearby spots,” he said. In all, 100 workers and two excavators were involved in the marathon restoration work during which several cubic metres of muck, debris and rubble was cleared. Senior officers from SWR headquarters and Hubballi Division monitored the restoration. What had complicated the problem was that the ghat section had no road access.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/landslips-dudhsagar-railway-track-restored/article35531764.ece

26 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Alert train crew rewarded for timely action||Considering the timely action (which averted a major mishap) by a loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and guard of Train No 01134 (Mangaluru Jn.-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Mumbai), which suffered a derailment, the South Western Railway has rewarded them. General Manager of South Western Railway Gajanan Mallya appreciated the presence of mind, swift action by the loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and the guard and announced a cash award for them, a press release said. The incident occurred on July 23. At about 6.10 a.m., while driving the train from Kulem towards Castle Rock (up ghat), at km 39/800 near Dudhsagar-Sonaulim section, loco pilot of the leading engine Ranjeet Kumar observed that mud was slipping, ahead on the track, from the side walls of the hill beside the track. He immediately applied the emergency brakes and brought the train to a stop. Due to mud and soil-mixed boulders on the track, the engine derailed along with two sets of wheels, despite the immediate braking. He alerted the Station Master of Dudhsagar to relay the message to Control Office, Hubballi. Meanwhile, noticing emergency brakes being applied, guard Shailender Kumar applied hand brakes in the brake van and proceeded to the engine. Parallelly, the guard and the loco pilot instructed the assistant loco pilots of the leading and banking engines to place detonators at stipulated distance on the track in both the rear and front and also secured the train by tying chains to the track, placing wheel-skids, as per standard safety protocol. Having noticed that slush and mud were also falling on coaches attached to the front engine, they shifted the passengers from the first three coaches to the rear coaches and un-coupled these coaches from the rest of the train. Subsequently, they utilised the rear (banking) engine to pull the train with 345 passengers back to Kulem Station. Guard Shailender Kumar accompanied loco pilot S.D. Meena and assistant loco pilot S.K. Saini to take the train safely with passengers to Kulem, while Ranjeet Kumar and his assistant Hashid K. stayed back with the derailed engine near the spot to assist in restoration, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/alert-train-crew-rewarded-for-timely-action/article35531755.ece

26 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Protest against anti-labour policies||As part of the nationwide campaign against the Centre’s anti-labour, anti-people policies, members of CITU and KPRS held an awareness programme and a protest in Hubballi on Sunday. The campaign is part of the nationwide campaign from July 25 to August 8, which will be followed by nationwide agitation on August 9, the day to commemorate the Quit India movement. CITU State Secretary K. Mahanthesh alleged that on the pretext of reforms in labour laws, the Union government had brought four labour codes, which would ultimately push workers into the vicious circle of bonded labour. It had already snatched away minimum wages and life security and with allowing prices of essential commodities to skyrocket, the people were being fleeced, he said. He appealed to the people to observe Quit India Movement day by organising protests at taluk and district centres on August 9. District President of Karnataka Pranta Raita Sangha (KPRS) B.S. Soppin said that although farmers of the country were agitating at Delhi borders for eight months now, the Centre ad totally neglected their rightful demands. The August 9 agitation was being held to support the farmers’ agitation and also to protest against the price rise and anti-labour policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi led BJP government, he said. District Secretary of CITU Mahesh Pattar said that if agricultural land was handed over to the corporate companies, then the food security of the country would be lost and unemployment would increase. Because of the wrong policies of the Modi Government, the farm sector was facing a great threat, he said. Leaders of other organizations including Amrut Ijari, B.I. Iligeer, Shivappa Lamani, Gurusiddappa Ambiger, Lalita Hiremath, Anjnana Badiger and others took part in the agitation and awareness campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-against-anti-labour-policies/article35531771.ece

The 80-year-old Mr. Fernandes was injured during a routine workout on July 18. He turned unconscious following dialysis at the hospital and was admitted in the intensive care unit on July 19.

26 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Kateel says Siddaramaiah sidelined Dalit leader||State BJP president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel on Sunday took swipes at the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who had dared the BJP to nominate a Dalit as the next Chief Minister and said that it was Mr. Siddaramaiah who had sidelined Dalit leader G. Parameshwara when he became the Chief Minister. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of his visit to Parkala near Udupi to participate in a fallow paddy field rejuvenation project, Mr. Kateel said that Mr. Siddaramaiah had buried the discussion on making a Dalit as the Chief Minister soon after he took over administration. On the other hand, the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, has made a Dalit the President. Dalit Ministers account for nearly 30% of the Union Cabinet strength, he pointed out. On the issue of leadership change in the State, Mr. Kateel said that he has not received any message from the party higher-ups so far. He has read and heard about it only through the media. Complimenting Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Mr. Kateel said that he was the one who gave importance to farmers by presenting the first agriculture budget. He was also instrumental in waiving farm loans. Speaking at the paddy field rejuvenation event organised by Kedarothana Trust under the guidance of Udupi MLA K. Raghupathi Bhat, Mr. Kateel said that this initiative will go a long way in keeping alive the traditional agricultural practices. In fact, there has been agricultural revolution in Udupi, Mr. Kateel said, participating in the programme at Sannakki Bettu near Parkala. Mr. Kateel said that ancestors in the region did not view agriculture as a form to earn profit; but as a mode of reverence. Agriculture forms the base of almost all rituals and folk arts. At a time when agricultural activities have been grounded due to commercial interests, it was a welcome move people are again evincing interest in these activities. He said that the BJP governments at the Centre and in the State have been promoting agriculture on a large scale by providing various facilities. He later joined local farmers in transplanting paddy shoots in the field. Mr. Bhat and others were present.  ‘Ministers from Dalit communities account for nearly 30% of the Union Cabinet strength’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kateel-says-siddaramaiah-sidelined-dalit-leader/article35531926.ece
26 July 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||People throng temples, churches, mosques||With the State government permitting performance of all rituals associated with places of worship and prayers, religious tourism received a boost with people thronging temples, churches and mosques in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts on Sunday. There was brisk sale of fruits, flowers and other puja articles outside the places of worship on Sunday.

26 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Marketing ghee, bamboo as premium products||The Forest Department will launch an initiative for the benefit of local farmers in M.M.Hills-B.R.Hills belt to procure milk from Hallikar breed of cattle and manufacture ghee to be branded and sold as a premium product. The project is set to commence from August 15 at Ponnachi and the objective is to enhance the income and economic conditions of the local farmers. Deputy Conservator of Forests V. Yedukondalu told The Hindu that the Hallikar cattle was commonly found in the region and was more of a drought breed used for agriculture and ploughing and produced only a small quantity of milk. “We intend to collate about 1,000 litres of Hallikar milk daily from the owners of the cattle who will participate in the project and process it into ghee,’’ said Mr. Yedukondalu. The cattle will be fed only organic and natural fodder and the ghee will be stamp marked and branded as Hallikar ghee and sold at a premium through organic retails and online shops. The project will also ensure that the drought cattle, which otherwise are sold to slaughter houses at throw-away prices, are retained by the farmers, said Mr. Yedukondalu. Talks have already been held with the local community and many farmers have evinced interest in the programme whose functioning will be akin to that of a cooperative society. Bamboo mission This is the second project to be taken by the Forest Department in the region to shore up the income generating capacity of the local community. The authorities recently launched an initiative to provide livelihood options to the tribal communities, especially the womenfolk, under Bamboo Mission. This entailed handicraft manufacturing by local women using bamboo. “We procured bamboo from Kodagu but will take up bamboo plantation on a 200-hectare plot of land to ensure that there was a steady supply of raw materials that can be sourced locally’’, according to Mr. Yedukondalu. A common facility for the manufacture of bamboo-based products is also being established at Ponnachi and is set to commence functioning in due course. An NGO, Industry Foundation, is involved in the project and the tribal women are being trained to make water bottles, table lamps, trivet of bamboo useful to place hot utensils etc. The marketing of the bamboo products will also be through multi-brand malls and online retailers. If successful, this model will not only prevent migration for livelihood but also enhance the income of the local community, said Mr. Yedukondalu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/marketing-ghee-bamboo-as-premium-products/article35531938.ece
26 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Foundation stone for library likely to be laid on August 12||Government agencies involved in the construction of a building to house a public library in Rajiv Nagar in Mysuru, where Syed Ishaq’s library was gutted in an accident earlier this year, are hoping to lay the foundation stone on August 12, which is also the National Librarians’ Day. Though the Department of Libraries, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), and the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) had initially planned to launch the construction work on April 23, the World Book Day, the COVID-19 curbs had delayed the project. While Mr. Ishaq said the officials are tentatively looking at August 12, which is also the birthday of the ‘Father of Library Science’ S.R. Ranganathan, Deputy Director of Libraries, Mysuru, B. Manjunath said a final decision in the regard will be taken only after a meeting of officials with Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham on July 29. Mr. Manjunath confirmed that the MUDA had allotted the Civic Amenities (CA) site, on which Mr. Ishaq’s makeshift library existed, to build a full-fledged library. The MUDA has allotted the CA site under a 30-year lease agreement to build the library which will function under Mr. Ishaq till his death. The CA site is spread across 556.3 square metres or about 1,825 square feet. A decision had already been taken to entrust the construction to Nirmithi Kendra. “We will soon have a draft plan prepared and lay the foundation stone,” said Mr. Manjunath. In view of the assurance from authorities, Mr. Ishaq has dropped his plan to set up a temporary structure for newspapers and its readers at the library site. Even though thousands of books were destroyed in the fire this April 9, Mr. Ishaq continues to subscribe to 18 daily newspapers, besides eveningers and other newspapers in Urdu and Tamil. The land, where Mr. Ishaq had set up the library, continues to draw people, who read newspapers on concrete blocks arranged outside the burnt library. But the rains in Mysuru are proving to be a dampener. “The officials have now convinced me against the temporary shelter on the promise that the construction will start soon,” said Mr. Ishaq.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/foundation-stone-for-library-likely-to-be-laid-on-august-12/article35531962.ece
26 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Seers slammed for lobbying for BSY’s continuance as CM||Members of the Karnataka State Backward Classes Forum staged a demonstration in the city on Sunday criticising the interference of religious heads in politics and lobbying for the continuation of B.S. Yediyurappa as the Chief Minister. The activists, some of whom were dressed in ochre robes as seers, questioned the mathadipathis for their support based on caste and religious leanings and said it did not behove of their status or their ordained role in society. The activists, led by K.S. Shivaramu, said the role of the religious heads is well-defined and the seers have the responsibility of preaching the concepts of religious harmony and equality besides the message espoused by saint-reformer Basavanna. But instead they have allowed themselves to be used for political machinations which has sullied their image besides dismaying their followers, said Mr. Shivaramu. The brazen support for Mr. Yediyurappa — who is speculated to be on his way out — by seers amounts to backing corruption, said Mr. Shivaramu, alluding to the alleged charges of corruption against the government. The activists of the forum said they have no objection if the seers donned Khadi and abandoned Kavi (ochre robes) to enter politics. But bringing religion into politics through their interference was a bad augury for democracy, said Mr. Shivaramu. The forum also flayed the convention of seers held in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seers-slammed-for-lobbying-for-bsys-continuance-as-cm/article35531965.ece

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||On Friday, as speculation was rife about the possibility of him being replaced within a few days by a younger leader, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa appeared keen to make the point that he was unfazed by it all and could still do some running around, despite his age. He went around Bengaluru, inspecting various development works taken up by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. At the end of the two-hour inspection, which included a short break for refreshments at a popular eatery on Commercial Street, he faced a volley of questions from reporters, mostly about the flood situation in North Karnataka districts. While Mr. Yediyurappa appeared calmer than usual for the most part, when reporters sought to know why the district in-charge Ministers were all in Bengaluru instead of the affected districts, he snapped. “Why are you sitting here and making comments?” he shot back, before walking away in a huff. It was not clear if he wanted the civic reporters of Bengaluru to change their beat and rush to cover floods or if it was just his internal tension bursting forth.   Tourism Minister C.P. Yogeshwar, who has petitioned the BJP high command seeking a change in leadership in the State government, seems to be in no mood at the moment to come face to face with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. To avoid an embarrassing situation, on Tuesday last, the Minister took the side door to enter the State Secretariat. Television footage showed the Minister making an escape when he spotted Mr. Yediyurappa walking down the steps of the Vidhana Soudha after chairing a meeting. Apparently, after complaining to the high command about the CM’s style of functioning and the alleged interference of his family in governance, Mr. Yogeshwar has not met Mr. Yediyurappa. Now that change in leadership is being talked about, it will be interesting to watch the next encounter between the two.   Actor-turned-politician and Minister B.C. Patil, who holds the Agriculture portfolio, backed his former colleague in the film industry Darshan, who is facing the charge of assaulting a hotel worker in Mysuru. Mr. Patil, who has acted in several films, ruled out removing Darshan from the role of ambassador of the Agriculture Department and said some “vested interests” were trying to tarnish the image of the actor who comes from a humble background. Soon after the electronic media started broadcasting news related to an exchange of allegations between Darshan and film director Indrajit Lankesh, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leaders demanded removal of the actor from the honorary ambassador post. But the Minister, whose old loyalties seem to be intact, turned down this demand. Chitra V.

He left his cow and her newborn calf at a shed on his house premises with no one to look after. His concerns, however, were short-lived as the cow and calf were shifted to an animal daycare centre run by the Kanjikuzhy grama panchayat on Saturday. The animals will be taken care of by the local body until Surendran and members of his family return home and fully recover. A person in charge of the centre milks the cow and the amount from the milk sold will be handed over to Surendran. Second wave The animal daycare centre launched at the beginning of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April is turning out to be a second home for many cattle in Kanjikuzhy. It ensures that the livelihood of dairy farmers is not interrupted while they recover from the disease. “We launched the centre to help dairy farmers suffering from COVID-19. If the entire family is under quarantine, there will be no one to look after their cattle. They cannot feed or milk cows. The cattle, mostly milch cows, belonging to such families are brought to the centre. The animals are provided fodder and are treated well. At the centre, the entire costs are borne by the grama panchayat and Milma,” says T.N. Viswanathan, convener, animal daycare centre, Kanjikuzhy. Around 25 cattle have been looked after at the centre so far. The management of the centre lies with a committee comprising the panchayat authorities, a veterinary doctor and representatives of dairy farmers. Functioning at a facility owned by Sambavan, a dairy farmer in Kanjikuzhy, it can house 12 cattle at a time. Buoyed by the response to the initiative, the local body is planning to set up a permanent animal daycare centre for all domestic animals. “Once ready, families going on tour or long trips could leave their pets and livestock at the centre,” says M. Santhosh Kumar, vice president, Kanjikuzhy grama panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-aid-a-daycare-centre-for-cows/article35531889.ece

26 July 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||A struggle for survival in closed tea estates||Come the rains, life in the closed tea estates in Peermade taluk turns risky with no annual repair works done for years to the workers’ quarters. As one enters the two divisions of Cheenthalar and Lonetree in Peerumade Tea Company, which remained closed for nearly two decades, the stark reality of life is evident. The two factories are near to collapse and many estate bungalows have already disappeared. The condition of the lanes (quarters) that were single-line buildings built during the early plantation period are in shambles. A large number of workers left to their native places after the estate was closed. However, those who had nowhere to go remained in the rooms of the estate lanes that had not given away. They eke out a living by plucking the green leaves under the monitoring of the local trade union leaders. Some of them also work outside the plantation area. The closed tea estate divisions in Peerumade taluk are Cheenthalar, Lonetree, Bonami and Kottamala. As per the estimate of the Labour Department, there are 369 families remaining in the lanes of the plantations that were not functioning. The details were collected as per the direction of the government in an effort to reopen the closed tea estates two years ago. A local trade union leader at Lonetree said there was hope of reopening the estate. However, it was not easy, he said, adding that nearly five years ago, the estate was given on lease. The new management also abandoned it. Many workers had expired without getting the pending wages or any other allowances. Those remaining in the estate lanes were with no other houses or places to go, he added. ‘No work’ Manikandan, a worker at Kottamala, said that he engaged himself in odd jobs. However, with the rainy season in, there was no work. The COVID-19 worsened the situation. Some of the workers living in the estate quarters covered the roof with plastic to escape the rains. “However, when the building itself falls what could we do?” he added. “Earlier we moved to rooms in the lanes that were unoccupied and were in better condition. Now no such rooms are available,” he said. For reopening the closed estates, huge investment is needed and it might be a reason for failing the efforts. If the government came with a proper plan, it might be possible, said Siva, son of an estate worker at Lonetree.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/monsoon-showers-misery-on-lives-on-idukki-estates/article35531819.ece
26 July 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Water level in Idukki dam touches 2,368.90 feet||Water level in Idukki dam reached 2,368.90 ft on Sunday morning. Compared to the water level of 2,333.76 ft on the same day the previous year, the reservoir had a better storage level, said an official of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). He said that as per the rule curve level fixed by the Central Water Commission (CWC) at 2,380.58 ft, a blue alert will be sounded at the level of 2,372.58 ft and the shutters of the dam would be opened only if the level reached the red alert level of 2,379 ft. At present, there was no threat of raising the shutters, he said. The CWC fixed the new rule curve level to avoid a sudden opening of the dam shutters as in the case of 2018. It was fixed for releasing the water to reduce the risk of opening the shutters at the maximum water level. The full storage level is 2,403 ft. The water level in Mullaperiyar dam on the upstream of Idukki dam was 135.25 ft. on Sunday. The water level on the same day last year was 1,14.55 ft. While there was an inflow of 4,875 cfs (cubic feet per second), Tamil Nadu was drawing at 907.50 cfs. The maximum storage level is 142 ft. There was a rainfall of 10.4 mm in the catchment area of Mullaperiyar dam on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-level-in-idukki-dam-touches-236890-feet/article35531893.ece
26 July 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Turning barren land into woodland, in 18 years||Away from the urban din and bustle, a nature lover has quietly transformed a barren land to a mini-forest on his homestead at Madakkimala, nearly 10 km away here. P.M. Nandakumar bought one-and-a-half acres of barren land nearly 18 years ago, with a total of 13 trees in it. Now, the site harbours 1,000-odd trees in 164 species. Thirty-seven of the species come under the rare, endemic, and threatened category. Sacred grove too Mr. Nandakumar has also given shape to a sacred grove inside the ‘forest’ with 20 varieties of bamboo and 18 varieties of climbers. There is a collection of wild orchids too that are endemic to the Western Ghats. The collection consists of 73 varieties of epiphytic orchids and 30 varieties of terrestrial orchids. The arboretum has allotted space for high-value medicinal plants, maintaining 56 species. There are also rhizomes such as ginger (red and black), black turmeric, and Kasthoorimanjal. Thirty varieties of ferns form another component of the woodland. Details for visitors Each species is planted with utmost care, with evergreen trees and deciduous trees occupying their own space. All plants are documented with their scientific and common names for a visitor to grasp their details easily. “Nearly one third of the flowering plants on earth are on the verge of extinction because of climate change and increased human intervention. This reality inspired me to transform the barren land to a miniature forest. I wanted to play my part in conserving Nature and its resources,” he says. The M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) here helped Mr. Nandakumar plant rare tree species in the woodland. “The effort of a single person has led to the conservation of a large number of species. He deserves to be called a biodiversity hero,” N. Anil Kumar, Senior Director, MSSRF says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/turning-barren-land-into-woodland-in-18-years/article35531860.ece

The Chief Minister’s Office directed the Director of Medical Education to probe the matter after K.P. Moidu, a social activist and resident of Pariyaram, raised it. He brought the matter to the attention of the Chief Minister’s Office after several postgraduate students who had left the college complained of not receiving the deposit despite repeated requests to the college authorities. According to Mr. Moidu, around Rs. 15,000 has been swindled by the hospital staff. Stipend payment Speaking on condition of anonymity, a doctor who had completed her PG from the college pointed to the possibility of those who had completed MBBS and nursing courses being taken for a ride. Similarly, complaints of PG students not being paid stipends are also emerging. Meanwhile, the medical college has received around 10 complaints, alleging that officials had declined to pay caution deposits citing excuses. When contacted, S.

26 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Irrigation Dept. to come up with flood control measures||The Irrigation Department will soon come up with an action plan to restore water flow and original extent of canals in Kochi. The department has identified 28 canals as well as issues faced by them as part of efforts to avert flooding in the city. Similar exercise is also being worked out for Thiruvananthapruam. The progress of flood mitigating work in both the cities are being reviewed every Thursday, said T.K. Jose, Additional Chief Secretary. Senior officials of the department have been given the responsibility of all the 28 canals in the city. They have been asked to report on issues faced by individual canals. They will also keep a tab on dumping of waste, encroachment, and other issues. Once the canals are de-congested and cleaned, the city will be free of flooding, he said. Moreover, free flow of water through canals will see that mosquito menace is addressed to a significant level. Restoring tidal action in canals will help destroy the breeding ground of mosquitoes, said Mr. Jose. Some canals, which existed in records, could not be located, as they might have been illegally filled up and land developed over the years. The sketches of canals that were developed were super-imposed on maps as part of efforts to trace them, he said. Officials will make a presentation on the status of canals in the city in the Kochi Corporation Council on Monday. A study done by the Irrigation Department, said R. Baji Chandran, Superintending Engineer, who is leading the team of officials, had revealed that the floor of Mullassery Canal had been illegally raised using concrete in some areas. The canal was also blocked in a few areas using concrete slabs, which prevented the flow of floodwaters. For the canal to be restored to its original extent and to ensure free flow of waters, at least 75 shops that were illegally set up near the canal need to be removed, he said. The slurry accumulated on the mouth of Perandoor Canal was removed, which helped in draining rainwater from canals to the Kochi backwaters, he added. The department will come up with short- and long-term projects to address waterlogging, he informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/irrigation-dept-to-come-up-with-flood-control-measures/article35531838.ece
26 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Call for elevated structure at Vyttila||A former member of the Bridge Maintenance Rehabilitation Committee of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) has suggested an elevated structure on the southern side of the Vyttila flyover, to decongest the junction where movement of vehicles in the east-west direction remains a nightmare, even after the flyover, whose design attracted considerable flak, was commissioned. Such a structure will do away with vehicles from Thripunithura having to wait for long to get the green signal to cross the junction, to proceed towards S.A. Road and Palarivattom, while at the same time not in any way disrupting the fast movement of vehicles along the NH Bypass. It will also come in handy for vehicles from Palarivattom wanting to cross over to S.A. Road without waiting for multiple signal changes, thus streamlining the flow of vehicles beneath the flyover, said Yacub Mohan George, who served in the IRC and retired from the PWD as Deputy Chief Engineer. The IRC prescribes technical and allied specifications for construction of roads, bridges, and allied infra in the country. “Vehicles from Thripunithura could even be diverted through Power House Road if the short but narrow road is widened as a two-lane stretch. The elevated structure could take off from the adjacent service road [about 500 metres south of the flyover], cross over the six-lane NH Bypass and touch the road level on the western side. For this, land will have to be acquired on the eastern and western sides of the service road,” he said. Mr. George, who shared a sketch of his proposal, further mentioned the possibility of having a pair of stairs and lifts on either side, to enable pedestrians to safely cross the accident-prone NH Bypass. On the flyover’s northern side (Palarivattom side), he suggested development of the long-overdue underpass beneath the railway overbridge, hardly 30 metres away from the existing narrow underpass. Vehicles from S.A. Road will thus be able to cross over to the Thripunithura side of the NH Bypass, without having to wait on end for the traffic signal at Vyttila. This proposal is in sync with the one that the Kochi Corporation and other agencies have been demanding for years. While welcoming the suggestion, an official who was associated with the construction of the Vyttila flyover said it would have to be complemented with widening the entire bottlenecked stretch on the eastern side (Thripunithura side) of the flyover, by adding at least two more lanes. “Most shop owners here were willing to surrender their land, even while the flyover work was under way. This must go hand in hand with substantial widening of the junction’s bellmouths and those of Kaniampuzha Road,” he added. The PWD had submitted such a proposal to then District Collector around three years ago. The proposal, which further included relocation of the police watch tower towards S.A. Road, remained a non-starter, as the State government did not allot funds. Social activist-cum-entrepreneur Shamier Abdullah, whose design for a clover-leaf-type flyover at Vyttila became a storm on social media and which won applause from, among others, Metroman E. Sreedharan, said the suggestion for an elevated structure on the southern side of the flyover looked good. “It will need at least 10-metre width, to hold two lanes of vehicles. This must go hand in hand with widening narrow parts of the junction,” he observed. “With almost everyone terming the PWD-built flyover as an unscientific one, I hope the State government will at least now rope in traffic planning experts and ready a comprehensive plan to decongest Vyttila, the biggest junction in Kerala,” Mr. Abdullah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-elevated-structure-at-vyttila/article35531843.ece

V.T. Gireesh, a trawler boat owner from Munambam, said around 800 boats operated out of Vypeen, Kochi and Munambam harbours, employing 10 persons each on an average, while thousands were engaged in fish sale. According to him, the loss of fishing days has resulted in serious crisis, and most boat owners do not have the wherewithal to even repair boats and fishing gear even as the annual 52-day trawling ban is set to end on the midnight of July 31. Memorandum In a recent memorandum to the State government, All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association had said that the annual ban on trawling left the fishing community in dire straits even as it came close on the heels of the lockdown and consequent loss of fishing days owing to closure of fishing harbours. The association said with over 3.5 lakh people depending on the fishing sector for livelihood, long-term restrictions would exacerbate their crisis. Meanwhile, Mr. Gireesh called upon the government to take a sympathetic view of fishers’ concern and not to insist on heavy licence fees. While other States do not impose heavy fees, boat owners from Kerala are forced to pay huge registration fees. Moreover, the Fisheries Department has instructed boat owners to renew their licences by July 31. Diesel The steep rise in the price of diesel too has been a big drag on fishing operations. The cost of each fishing expedition has gone up by around 30%, and poor landings have added to boat owners’ woes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/future-looks-bleak-for-trawler-boat-operators/article35531830.ece
26 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Maritime Board for extension of coastal shipping subsidy||The Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) has recommended to the State government the extension of the subsidy scheme to take freight operators away from the State’s congested and accident-prone highways to the coastal waterway for another three years, from January 2022 when the existing scheme lapses. This is in addition to Ports Minister Ahammad Devarkovil urging the Cochin Port Trust earlier this week to recommend to the Union Shipping Ministry incentivisation for the State’s coastal shipping sector. The steps were in keeping with the board’s action plan to rev up initiatives to invigorate Kerala’s underutilised waterways, said official sources. Stakeholders in the sector, including merchants bodies and chambers of commerce, have been seeking legislative and other reforms so that cargo, especially non-perishable commodities, are ferried through Kerala’s inland waterways, while the coastal shipping route could be used to transport cargo in bulk to ports within the State and outside. The KMB, which spearheads coastal shipping, and the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) that is in charge of dredging and readying infrastructure along the Kollam-Kottappuram-Kozhikode inland waterway, too have raised such reforms. “We need to consider the manifold advantages of water transport, which was once the only available mode to ferry agricultural produce and other cargo in bulk, till roads were developed. Over time, goods carriers dominated Kerala’s roads and highways, so much so that 60,000 containers from the Kochi port are transported through narrow and chaotic highways to other districts and States every month. This in turn affects the durability of roads while worsening pollution levels and increasing accidents,” said a senior KMB official. The KMB, IWAI and other stakeholders have been demanding that the densely populated Kerala take the lead in shifting cargo transit through waterways, beginning with hazardous items such as petroleum products, LPG and chemicals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/maritime-board-for-extension-of-coastal-shipping-subsidy/article35531834.ece

The MoU was signed at the Rubber Research Institute in Kottayam on Friday, said a communication from the Rubber Board. Site-specific nutrient management and judicious use of fertilizers are important for economic and environmental reasons. The Indian Cardamom Research Institute, Myladumpara, the research wing of the Spices Board, initiated the collaborative project with the Rubber Research Institute of India, Rubber Board, and the Geospatial Analytics Division of the Digital University (formerly IIITM-K). The project will document major, secondary and micronutrient status of cardamom growing areas and apply geo-statistical techniques to generate spatial models of soil nutrients and disseminate information to farmers through the app. Spices Board Secretary D. Sathiyan said the aim was to develop an equivalent of RubSIS app launched by the Rubber Board to help farmers access data on location-specific soil nutrient status and fertilizer recommendations online. The Spices Board is one of the five commodity boards under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. It is responsible for the export promotion of 52 scheduled spices and development of small and large cardamom. Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu are the major producers of small cardamom. According to Spices Board figures from an advanced estimate for 2020-21, around 69,000 hectares are under the crop in the country with a production of 22,500 tonnes. Meanwhile, cardamom production in Kerala is likely to see a fall this year with farming operations witnessing disruption from shortage of labour and heavy rain. The State has around 50,000 hectares under the crop. The annual average production is nearly 20,000 tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mobile-app-to-be-developed-for-cardamom-growers/article35531831.ece

They have sought an investigation into the incident and remedial measures as per rules governing welfare of animals. Meanwhile, the Opposition LDF councillors accused the ruling UDF coalition of straying from the established rules of controlling stray dog population. Around 30 dog carcasses were reportedly exhumed on Saturday from a municipal waste dumping yard. Some of them had been subjected to post-mortem to ascertain the cause for death. It is alleged that the dogs were administered poison injection. The post-mortem results are expected on Monday, said animal rights activist T.K. Sajeev, who is also the secretary of the Ernakulam unit of Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. M.K. Chandrababu of the CPI(M) and Opposition Leader in the 42-member municipal council alleged that the health wing of the municipality had a pact with a group of dog-catchers from Kozhikode to kill stray dogs. The problem had not been discussed in the council or any other forum, he claimed. Municipal Chairperson Ajitha Thankappan of the Congress said the municipal authorities were not aware of the killing of dogs. She said on Sunday that she learned about the incident through the media.

Eyewitness accounts suggested the incident took place along the Ayarkunnam-Lakattoor road around 6.50 a.m. According to them, a rope was tied around the neck of the dog and it was being brutally dragged along the road. The locals who witnessed the incident tried to chase down the speeding vehicle though to no avail. Later, they collected a video footage of the incident from a CCTV installed at a library near Chennamattom and another house near the location. The local police too were alerted though no complaints were lodged. The identity of the person who drove the vehicle and whereabouts of the animal were yet to be ascertained. The Ayarkunnam police was yet to register a case . A similar incident reported from Manjali in Ernakulam district late last year had triggered an uproar across the country, forcing the police to book the culprit and book him under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dog-dragged-along-road-in-kottayam/article35531820.ece
26 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||With poor public awareness, SIM verification fraud thrives||The number of people being duped in the name of SIM card verification is on the rise, as many continue to respond carelessly to spam messages and calls. According to cyber cell officials, many people are not yet aware of the fraud and have not secured their bank accounts. Recent incidents in Kozhikode in which the SIM cards of various mobile service providers got blocked due to unknown reasons have also contributed to an increase in the number of mobile phone users falling prey to the fraud. Confusion Since automated verification calls are a common practice by mobile service providers to welcome new customers to the network, many users are confused about how to manage the situation. Though banking records are not required to verify a SIM, many people respond positively to spammers’ calls and SMSes and readily provide their bank account details. Many police stations in the district have witnessed a spike in the number of complaints related to banking fraud involving exchange of banking details with spammers. “An automated SIM verification process is adopted by most cell phone service providers, which can be easily accessed by customers through the interactive voice response system. “No customer care executive will contact the SIM cardholders to verify bank accounts. People are yet to be aware of this simple fact,” said an official with the Police Cyberdome. He added that the campaign undertaken by the police across the State against exchange of banking details was yet to be taken seriously. Fake profiles The SIM card verification fraud comes close on the heels of the scam using fake profiles on social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp.  With increased public awareness, those responding positively to funds requests made from the fake profiles of their contacts have decreased across the State. The quick response from social media platforms to requests for blocking such profiles has also helped prevent fraud. “The creation of fake WhatsApp profiles using stolen photos of prominent individuals to request money is still happening. Many of those who were reluctant to verify such messages by calling the persons concerned have fallen victims,” said a senior officer with the Kozhikode Cyber Police station. He said those who had lost money in the fraud were all educated people. Physical verification Senior executives with prominent cellular operators said incidents of unexpected SIM card blocking could be easily addressed through authorised service centres. They said the reactivation and delivery of blocked SIM cards were not done via online customer care. Duplicate SIM cards would be issued to customers directly only after physical verification of identity documents, they added.  Call for caution Automated verification calls are a common practice by mobile service providers to welcome new customers However, banking records are not required to verify a SIM Reactivation, delivery of blocked SIM cards not done via online customer care, say cellular service executives Duplicate SIM cards issued to customers directly only after physical verification of identity documents||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-poor-public-awareness-sim-verification-fraud-thrives/article35531832.ece

Participants who spoke at a national conference on paediatric COVID-19 held here on Saturday and Sunday said there was no reason to delay vaccination among children as they were unlikely to get side-effects like elders. The event was held by the Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, in association with the Kozhikode Branch of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Health Mission. The doctors said that social media was rife with rumours and discussions about the impact of the third wave. There was a natural chance of unvaccinated children getting infected because all those above 18 were getting the jab. That was just an inference and not a theory based on the change in virulence of the virus or its genetic structure. Compared with elders, children so far had rarely shown acute symptoms. It was yet to be scientifically proven whether the situation would change in the coming days, they pointed out. The participants also urged the government and the society to address COVID-induced socio-psychological issues in children. They said many children had lost their parents. Some others had lost their means of livelihood. There were children who faced psychological problems owing to online education, and some were facing physical and mental torture from their parents. The impact of excessive use of social media was another problem, the participants said. They suggested that local bodies could try to sort them out. Practical suggestions Opening the conference, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said the State government was committed to implementing practical suggestions on the socio-health issues faced by children due to COVID-19. Minister for Health and Family Welfare Veena George asked the organisers to submit a gist of the deliberations at the conference with key recommendations to be acted upon. Thottathil Raveendran, MLA, was present. The speakers included Sudhir Gupta, who established the Foundation for Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases, the U.S.; Condino–Neto of University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Kishore Chandran of Nottingham University Hospitals, the U.K.; Siddharth Ramji of Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi; Priyankar Pal of Institute of Child Health, Kolkata; Vinod Scaria, Principal Scientist, CSIR–Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi; and Tanu Singhal of Kokilaben Hospital, Mumbai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/doctors-allay-fears-on-impact-of-third-wave-in-children/article35531810.ece

As many as 830 police officers will join the full-time surveillance to bring down the daily caseload in the district. The service of 530 police officers will be used within Kozhikode City to implement field-level enforcement work. Vehicle checking will be intensified to prevent casual trips and public gatherings. Details of vehicles will be recorded at checkpoints. Flash inspection squads have also been formed to keep an eye on major shopping centres and markets, where people tend to violate physical distancing norms. Shop owners found flouting safety instructions will be asked to down shutters. Penal action will also be taken against them. Curbs on movement The movement of people who do not have a COVID-negative test result or vaccination certificate will be regulated based on the test positivity rate (TPR) and containment zone norms. Though many traders’ associations have opposed the move, the police have made it clear that it will be implemented strictly. “We are compelled to tighten the regulations considering the increasing number of cases and the casual behaviour of some citizens. Restricting the entry of unvaccinated people in public places has been successfully implemented in various countries as part of the improved preventive measures,” said a police officer from Koduvally. He said the demand for more community-level vaccination drives was under the consideration of local administrators to address public concerns. Health Department officials said ward-level details of unvaccinated people would be collected soon to offer walk-in vaccination facility. Accredited Social Health Activists would gather the details soon to make arrangements, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-open-more-checkpoints-in-kozhikode-to-arrest-covid-spread/article35531815.ece

Hansar T., a barber from Naduvannur, finds the situation unjust. For the past two days, the 37-year-old has been sitting under a tree in front of his barbershop at Puthiyappuram, with a noose hanging from the tree, as a form of protest against the “grave injustice towards the community”. “It has been a year-and-a-half since our shops closed down. Most of us are in dire straits. How long are we to sit at home when COVID-19 does not seem to be subsiding any time soon?” asks Mr. Hansar, while demanding that the government consider the situation more seriously. ‘Not about food’ “It is not just about food. We need to pay bills. There has been no cut in the electricity bill or building rent for the period the shops were closed. Besides, we have loans to repay,” he says. Mr. Hansar says he uses mostly disposable equipment in his barber shop, including blades, combs, masks, seat covers, and aprons. Sterilised many times The other equipment in the shop is sterilised and sanitised many times a day. “We allow only one person in the shop at a time. On the other hand, most shops here have a crowd inside on days they open,” he says. Mr. Hansar’s protest has also been an announcement of the Collectorate march and other protest measures planned by the State Barber’s Association on Tuesday. “We are ready to sit at home if the government heeds our basic demands,” he says. The primary demand is a waiver of electricity bills and building rents. Another is a special package to ensure the survival of the families of barbers. “We just need the consideration given to other enterprises. We are demanding only sustenance,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-protest-against-an-unkind-cut/article35531824.ece

26 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||No immediate threat to Ahamed Devarkovil||With the implosion in the Indian National League (INL) waiting to happen, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] will adopt a wait-and-watch approach in the coming days over the churning within its minor partner. At this juncture, Minister for Ports Ahamed Devarkovil, who is aligned with the Kasim Irrikur faction, faces no immediate threat to his ministership. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government does not want to ouster a Minister from a party with a lone legislator before completing 100 days in office. Sources said the CPI(M) State leadership preferred the Kasim-Ahamed axis which has an upper hand in the INL rather than favouring the faction led by A.P. Abdul Wahab. Besides, each faction would have to prove its strength internally even as the Central leadership of that party would want to be part of the government. However, the bitter infighting in the party and the corruption charges against its leaders are posing a headache for the government. The CPI(M) is equally worried that the image of the coalition as a well-knit alliance will take a beating in the coming days. Many reasons Acrimonious power struggle, ego clash between the State president and general secretary and aggressive political expansionist plans have now culminated in the two warring factions coming to blows in Kochi on Sunday. When Mr. Devarkovil was inducted into the Cabinet, leaders and cadre of the INL were elated that the 27-year-old party formed by Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait got due recognition after it broke away from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) following the Babri Masjid demolition. Sources said the CPI(M) had been ambitiously and energetically wooing the Muslim electorate in Kozhikode as well as in the neighbouring districts through the INL and other fringe groups such as National Secular Conference led by P.T.A. Rahim, MLA. But the turmoil in that party would blot the image of the coalition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-immediate-threat-to-ahamed-devarkovil/article35531861.ece

This was decided at a meeting convened by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) here on Sunday. According to sources, this is an indication of the toughening of their stand against the State government over the minority scholarship issue. A ‘Sachar Samrakshana Samiti’ has been formed under the leadership of IUML leader Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal to take forward the agitation. Members of the samiti would meet the Chief Minister after the dharna to submit a charter of rights of the community. Representatives of 14 organisations such as the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulema, factions of the Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen, Jamaat-e-Islami, Muslim Educational Society, Muslim Service Society and Wisdom Islamic Organisation, among others, were present at the meeting. The meeting demanded that the government devise a special scheme to implement the Sachar panel report, which were aimed only at the Muslim community. Schemes for other minorities should be devised in proportion with their population. The Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulema had convened a meeting on Saturday to discuss the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scholarship-muslim-groups-plan-dharna/article35531863.ece

26 July 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||A library reaches out to the needy||Over the decades, it has fostered a love for reading and helped people build stronger bonds through books. But what makes it unique, among the myriad of community libraries, is the inculcation of love for fellow human beings, which takes the form of assistance to the needy. Building on its long tradition of serving the local community, the six and half decade old Puthuvakkal Village Library in Kulanada, Pandalam has evolved itself as a charity centre that offers free food kits to the poor every month. Launched six years ago, the project is being run through a separate wing that coordinates the fund collection and distribution of these kits. “The food kits are being distributed to 10 families every month since 2015. The practice has largely remained below the radar as we do not collect funds or sponsorships from outside including the government agencies,” said Jose K. Thomas, president of the library. The library currently has about 120 active members and about half of them are currently settled abroad. The collective decided to form a charity fund in 2009 after some of its NRI members, who grew up hand-in hand with the 10,000 odd books here, urged its office bearers to host programmes in support of the local community. “It all began with the institution of an endowment fund for school students and over the years, the wing expanded its focus to different areas. The total assistance offered during the period is estimated to be just over Rs. 10 lakh,” he added. M. Rajesh, former secretary of the library, coordinates the collection of funds from the overseas members. P.J. Roshan, convenor of the charity wing, said the beneficiaries for the food-kit scheme were identified from locations in and around the Puthuvakkal village. The kits, worth around Rs. 1,000 per packet, contain essential groceries including 10 kilograms of rice, sugar, tea powder, pulses and edible oil. Generous members “The scheme has never faced any disruptions ever since its take off, thanks to our generous members. In view of the COVID-19 situation, the scope of the initiative has now been expanded to the distribution of mobile phones and television sets to children from financially backward families to support online education,” he said. Besides the charity initiative, the library also boasts a life skill and career guidance cell for the youngsters in the village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-library-that-reaches-out-to-those-in-need/article35531898.ece

The meeting, convened by the Ranni legislator Pramod Narayan, was also attended by officials of the Kerala State Transport Project including its superintending engineer, project consultancy, and the contractor agency. Addressing the meeting, the legislator pointed out that water supply to a host of locations including Tiyapara, Perumpuzha, Aithala and Mamukku had been cut off for at least six months due to road construction and directed the officials to fix the issue within eight days. He also urged to expedite the construction of the stretch from Blockpadi to Chethomkara. Though the authorities had asked four months for completing the works, it was finally decided to finish the works in two months and the stretch will be thrown open to traffic before the Onam. The MLA also lashed out at the apathy shown by the various agencies involved in the project in completing the project in a time-bound manner.

26 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Fatality rate punches hole in govt. claim||A stable case fatality rate (CFR) at 0.48%, despite the steep increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the second wave is a claim that the State always held on to; something which set it apart from the rest of the country. However, the latest data shows that the claim was built on the cumulative CFR figures till date. The COVID CFR in the State since April tells a different story, with the current fatality rate crossing 1%. If one were to take a closer look at the State’s CFR since April 15, when the second wave began, the COVID death rate has been steadily increasing every 15 days. From the fortnight from April 15 till June 30, there has been a steady, five-fold increase in case fatality rate. Why is the likelihood of COVID deaths rising when the State is past the peak of the second wave and when the pressure on hospitals and ICUs have supposedly eased? With a highly transmissible virus variant like Delta in circulation, the efficiency of COVID protocols or testing/ isolation strategy is extremely limited when it comes to preventing disease transmission. Hence, the focus now has to be entirely on COVID mortality reduction. But with the administrators going after test positivity rate (TPR) reduction, issues on the patient care front are being ignored. The outcome of hospitalised patients in the State seems to be becoming worse as each week passes. District-wise data “The government’s own district-wise data shows that the current CFR in many districts is over 1% (Thiruvananthapuram 1.6, Ernakulam 1.26, Palakkad 1.06, Kollam 1.03, Kannur 1.02, Kozhikode and Pathanamthitta 0.8) and that the risk of mortality has been going up even when the case graph has come down. Is it the poor quality of care in ICUs? Or is it because COVID-positive patients continue to present late in hospitals, by which time too many complications have set in? It could also be the variation of care in institutions or issues in transportation. “The first step in discerning this would be looking inwards and admitting that we are losing too many patients,” a public health expert said. The government’s data over the past 14 days shows that the current CFR is 0.91%. But what is projected is only the cumulative CFR (proportion of deaths amongst those who have tested COVID-positive so far) of .48%, which will be low as the denominator has now crossed 32 lakh. Two-week lag He points out that as there is a two-week lag between hospitalisation and death, current CFR should be calculated as death in the fortnight/cases in the previous fortnight multiplied by 100. Going by this, Kerala’s CFR has been steadily rising every fortnight, from 0.2% since April 15-30 to 1.02% in the fortnight from June 16-30. In other words the likelihood of death in COVID-positive persons has increased five times in this period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fatality-rate-punches-hole-in-govt-claim/article35531871.ece

The Congress and the BJP have attempted to put former Cooperation Minister and CPI(M) State committee member A.C. Moideen, MLA, on the dock. They accused Mr. Moideen of sharing a “cosy relationship” with the suspects in the case. Opposition politicians brandished purported pictures of Mr. Moideen attending the inauguration of a supermarket allegedly owned by a relative of a person accused in the fraud. They also accused Mr. Modieen of ignoring cautionary reports from various agencies, including the CPI(M) district committee, about the allegedly fraudulent dealings by the bank management. By some accounts the fraud had first surfaced when Mr. Modieen held the Cooperation portfolio in the previous LDF government. Later the portfolio was given to Kadakampally Surendran. The CPI(M) reportedly tasked CPI(M) State committee member P.K. Biju to probe the accusations initially. There were also reports that the CPI(M) in Thrissur had flagged the fraud in meetings attended by top party leaders, including party central secretariat member and Devaswom Minister K. Radhakrishnan and State secretariat member Baby John. Demand for CBI probe Mr. Moideen had denied the charges. However, the Congress and BJP seemed unwilling to give the CPI(M) any quarter. They demanded a CBI inquiry and accused the party of condoning the crime and profiting from it. The CPI(M) State secretariat had reportedly taken a serious view of the matter. An insider said disciplinary action was under way against at least two “errant committees” for extending tacit support to the culprits. The CPI(M) was reportedly wary that copycat financial crime could have occurred in other cooperative banks controlled by the party. Some leaders reportedly felt the scam would appear to justify the Centre’s recent creation of a Cooperation Ministryand take the sheen of the party’s campaign against the Centre’s alleged attacks on fiscal federalism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bank-scam-casts-cpim-in-bad-light/article35531864.ece

26 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||For Uthara, all the hard work bore fruit||Days after becoming the first tribal student from the Agasthyavanam forests in Kuttichal grama panchayat to get full A+ in the SSLC examinations, Uthara Suresh is still getting visitors, the latest being Shweta Nagarkoti, Assistant Collector, Thiruvananthapuram. Uthara, who appeared for the SSLC examinations from Sree Narayana Higher Secondary School, Uzhamalakkal, is elated that despite the challenges of online education in the Valipara settlement where she lives with parents Suresh Mithra and Bindu (a teacher) and sister Dakshina, her hard work bore fruit. She is also happy that another student from Valipara Vishnu Sunil got five A+ grades in the examinations. Like many students in tribal settlements and remote areas of the State, the past academic year has been tough for Uthara. While the Victers classes were available on TV at the Uravu Nattarivu Padhana Kendram for her and other students in the settlement, online classes on Google Meet would require her to climb a small hillock some 500 m from her house. But connection there was not steady always. So, Uthara would trek some more to another hillock. That, she says, was possible only if the live classes were held in the afternoon or evening; at night, there was no question of venturing out in search of range. Apprehensive Uthara’s family has a TV now, but she is apprehensive how she would study if school-level online classes get under way. Electricity supply is a problem, she points out, as also the fact that she has to cross a small river to reach the hillock where she can be assured of Net connectivity. However, during rains when the river swells, she is not able to reach the other side. Her father, activist Suresh Mithra, says an inspection was held to determine if a BSNL tower could be set up in the area a couple of weeks ago, but fears it would meet the same fate as earlier efforts. Tower With the Chief Minister having promised online education for each tribal student, he is hopeful the tower will come up soon so that other promising students in the Agasthyavanam region do not face the same hurdles as Uthara did. He fears dropouts at the higher secondary level may increase in the face such odds, especially as schools are closed. Mr. Suresh hopes a request for a laptop for Uthara to the Integrated Tribal Development Programme district officer will materialise. He credits Uthara’s class teacher Lini for paying special attention to his daughter and her sports teacher Sanjay Kumar (Uthara has represented the State twice at the national level in kho-kho) for keeping her motivated. Uthara who hopes to become a doctor is keen on getting admission to Plus One Science at the Uzhamalakkal school itself. For the moment though, she is enjoying every moment of her success.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/for-uthara-all-the-hard-work-bore-fruit/article35532033.ece

26 July 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Water goes down the drain||A stitch in time saves nine, goes the saying. And it would have saved precious Tungabhadra water flowing into the State from going waste. With the authorities failing to repair the structures on the Tungabhadra Right Bank High-Level Canal (HLC) at the Kannekal Balancing Reservoir, the water that had begun flowing into the State through the canal from Saturday had to be diverted to the Hagari river, near Cherlopalli village of D. Hirehal mandal in the district, till Sunday morning. The Kannekal tank is the first storage facility after water enters Andhra Pradesh at the 105-km point. Water had stopped flowing in the HLC on February 10 for last season, and water indent was given for release from July 25. But, the sluice gates repair work on the Kannekal Balancing Reservoir was taken up only on July 19. The delay in completion of work forced the authorities to divert the water through the escape channel into the Hagari river on Saturday, as a result of which the road connectivity to the nearby village was cut off with the stretch being washed away. “Water is leaking from the sluice gates at the Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh junction point. Had the water reached the Kannekal tank, the repair work would have been affected. Hence, water has been diverted into the river,” Anantapur HLC Superintendent Engineer Nayakanti Rajasekhar told The Hindu . “The repair work has now been completed, and we are receiving the entire quantum of 900 cusecs directly into the Kannekal tank,” he added. Earlier, Government Whip and Rayadurg MLA Kapu Ramachandra Reddy performed puja at the sluice gates where water enters the State. TDP flays govt.

This year, water was released from the dam on July 18 for the farmers in Karnataka. The HLC too had water till the 105-km point since July 21, he said.

Yediyurappa as Chief Minister, even as the latter in Belagavi put the onus on the high command for his continuation. Mr. Yediyurappa should be allowed to complete his term since he has been working with efficiency, the seers said at a council meeting that was convened to discuss the “current crisis”. They refused to call the event an attempt at show of strength by the Lingayat community. In light of speculation that the meeting was “engineered” by Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp to exert pressure on the party high command, they also clarified that they had gathered “voluntarily”. “We had to come to the fore since the high command is not taking any action against those casteist people within the BJP who have been conspiring against Mr. Yediyurappa,” Balehosur Mutt seer Dingaleshwara Swami claimed. He urged the party high command to consider this. Saying that Mr. Yediyurappa had given higher grants to mutts “to enable social, religious and educational service”, the seer said it was their “duty to show gratitude to him”. Responding to those asking religious leaders not to interfere in politics, the seer said that they were not interfering. “Mutts have been working well since the times of the Mysuru royalty and in the post-independence period,” he said. He added that mutts existed even before political parties came into existence.

The mauled couple was rushed to a local hospital and declared safe. According to information, Subramanyam Naidu (55) and Manjula Devi (50) of Lakshmipuram in Vadamalapeta mandal were going to Singirikona waterfalls, nestled at the foot of Narayanavanam hills, when a leopard reportedly pounced on them from a treetop. When both fell down from their motorbike, the leopard reportedly tried to take Manjula, trying for her neck, but her husband rushed to her rescue, kicking the animal. Confused with the wild shrieks of the couple, the leopard fled into the thickets. Overcoming the shock, the couple reached a private hospital at nearby Puttur for treatment. Subramanyam told the media that they had a two-minute-long tryst with the leopard. “When the leopard was after my wife, I had kicked it with all my strength and the animal vanished into the bushes. The impact has left my leg sprained,” he said. Forest Range Officer (Puttur) K. Subramanyam and his team rushed to the spot and inspected the surroundings. “As the terrain is of hard earth, we couldn’t come across any pugmarks. Going by the version of the couple and the injuries they bore, it is possible that a leopard has strayed into the Puttur range from adjoining ranges,” he said. The FRO said that the woman sustained a scratch on her head and a deep cut near the left eye. “It is for the first time that sighting of a leopard by public is being reported in Puttur forest range. Our personnel are posted at the forest road and the public is barred from visiting Singirikona till further notice,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/couple-survives-leopard-attack/article35531512.ece

26 July 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana temple gets World Heritage tag||In a major diplomatic triumph, the 13th century Ramappa temple in Palampet, Telangana, was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on Sunday. At the ongoing online meeting of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) in Fuzhou, China, the decision was reached after a consensus, with Norway opposing the inscription while Russia led an effort for the immediate inscription of the temple at 4.36 p.m. IST. A consensus with 17 countries backing the move ensured the inscription of the site. The nomination for a World Heritage Site for the Ramappa and Kakatiya temples was made in 2014. The site was in the reckoning for inscription in 2020 but the WHC meeting was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Built by Racherla Senapati Rudrayya, a general of Kakatiya king Ganapatideva, in the 13th century, the main temple is flanked by the collapsed structures of the Kateshwarayya and Kameshwarayya temples in Palampet, about 220 km from Hyderabad. The temple, known for its exquisite craftsmanship and delicate relief work, is a savvy blend of technical know-how and materials of its time. The foundation is built with the “sandbox technique”, the flooring is granite and the pillars are basalt. The lower part of the temple is red sandstone while the white gopuram is built with light bricks that reportedly float on water. Earlier, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) cited nine shortcomings at the site after an initial visit in 2019, but on Sunday a majority veered round to India’s view about the site’s outstanding universal value. Norway was the only country which opposed the move citing ICOMOS’s conclusion. India mounted a diplomatic offensive to ensure the World Heritage Site status for the Ramappa temple by reaching out to other countries whose representatives were to vote on the proposal. At the WHC session on Sunday, Russia invoked Rule 22.7 allowing India to make a statement after ICOMOS made its decision known to defer the examination of nomination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-temple-gets-world-heritage-tag/article35531352.ece
26 July 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Two Collectors touched KCR’s feet’||Former Minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir on Sunday demanded that the Centre take action against the District Collectors of Siddipet and Kamareddy for “touching” the feet of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in full public view, violating the All India Service Rules. In a letter to President of India Ramnath Kovind, he said the Collectors of Siddipet and Kamareddy districts P Venkatrami Reddy and A. Sharath respectively had violated the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, by touching Chief Minister’s feet in full public view during the launch of District Collectorate office complexes on June 20, 2021, in their districts. “They are not only IAS officers but also District Magistrates. They have sent the wrong message and set a wrong precedent by bowing before the Chief Minister, who is a political functionary,” he said in the letter that was also sent to Union Minister of State for Personnel Jithendra Singh. Mr. Shabbir Ali said that Section 3 (ii) of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, clearly says ‘Every member of the Service shall maintain Political Neutrality’. But the actions of both District Collectors clearly exposed that they were not maintaining political neutrality. “The Chief Minister is also the president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi. Therefore, by bowing down and touching his feet, the District Collectors have conveyed a message to the common people that they were inclined towards the ruling party,” he said. The Congress leader alleged that by touching the feet of the Chief Minister at a public function, both Collectors had insulted the Constitution and behaved like political functionaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/2-collectors-touched-kcrs-feet/article35531800.ece

In the last few months, the redsanders smuggling kingpins, operating from beyond the State’s borders, have been trying to expand their footprint in the forest by making good use of the government’s continued focus on enforcing lockdown. Going by statistics, the police department has slapped P.D. Act on eleven kingpins and pushed behind the bars more than 70 smugglers having nexus with international and national level operatives since COVID broke out. More than 80 cases have been booked, 526 persons arrested and 1,027 logs weighing 25.5 tonnes and 64 vehicles used to smuggle them seized in the said period. The notorious smugglers who were arrested recently are: Shaik Simpathi Lal Basha and Shaik Jakir of Kadapa, G. Venkatasubbaiah of Badvel, P. Venkatapathy and B. Srinivasulu of Vontimitta, Shaik Mastan and Gundala Sankar of Railway Kodur, Simpathi Fakruddin of Chapadu, Shaik Abdul Hakeem and Rangaswamy Bhaskaran of Chennai, Nanubala Ramudu and M.

However, there was no threat of flood in the Sabari so far. “The backwaters from the Polavaram project have reached up to Chintoor town, affecting the 19 habitations along the riverbed.

Meanwhile, the ITDA authorities prepared the ground for evacuating the 50 villages that would be affected if the flood warning at Bhadrachalam went beyond the third level. “The flood impact in the 44 project-affected habitations in Devipatnam mandal is less as people from 34 habitations have already been rehabilitated to the R&R colonies. However, people in Konda Modalu and P. Gonduru will be affected, and they are being persuaded to leave their habitations,” said ITDA-Rampachodavaram Project Officer Praveen Adithya. “The R&R colonies are ready, but the families from the two habitations will be rehabilitated after clearing the R&R package by August,” Mr. Adithya said.

B. Sai Praneeth, an EEE gold medalist from Anna University, Chennai, and a resident of M.R. Palle locality of the temple city, shot to fame for his concept of ‘AP Weatherman’, through which he used to provide weather forecast on social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, which benefited the farmers across the State and urban residents of Tirupati, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool cities. The idea was borne out of the questionable predictions being provided by various channels in the name of weather forecast, leaving the denizens disillusioned. In his address, Mr. Modi appreciated this software engineer’s efforts to reach out to the society. Though employed in Bengaluru, the 24-year-old is currently working from Tirupati. He has been providing accurate forecast since August 2020. “Many websites and agencies provide weather-related data, which are, more often than not, far from accurate. It was when I decided to take the plunge to help the farmers,” Mr. Praneeth told The Hindu on Sunday. Nivar prediction His near-accurate prediction of Nivar cyclone and the unseasonal rains in January and February this year made many subscribe to his media handles. His participation in an event on ‘Changing weather trends in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana’ organised by UN Habitat, which was also published in their journal, made his name heard far and wide. In fact, Mr. Praneeth credited the weather column appearing in The Hindu as the major source of inspiration behind the launch of his initiative. He thanked the Prime Minister for mentioning his work in his public address. “Such a recognition will help me focus more on better outcomes,” a thrilled Mr. Praneeth said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-weatherman-figures-in-modis-mann-ki-baat/article35531991.ece

26 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Raising loans against FRBM norms warrants special audit by CAG’||BJP Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao has alleged that the Andhra Pradesh government is raising loans over and above the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) limits in blatant violation of norms for implementing the promises made during the elections, instead of mobilising resources through proper channels. Addressing the media in New Delhi on Sunday, Mr. Narasimha Rao said a special audit should be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and also the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a substantial chunk of the debt was raised from the banks. He also stressed the need for the Central government to prescribe guidelines for direct cash transfers to the beneficiaries under various schemes. Mr. Narasimha Rao said the borrowing of huge sums through the AP State Development Corporation, whose functions and objectives were under a cloud and whose very formation was challenged in the High Court, should also be probed. He observed that the the State government was raising debt through “creative accounting systems,” and then diverting the money for purposes other than those they were intended for. ‘Fiscal profligacy’ The government was scouting for new loans every day, rather than first setting its house in order, and it was least bothered about the consequences of its fiscal profligacy, he alleged. The resources were being used to build vote banks, Mr. Narasimha Rao said, while taking strong objection to the practice of setting aside monies that were supposed to go into the Consolidated Fund. ‘Dubious approach’ Mr. Narasimha Rao further said the guarantees being given by the State government for raising loans and the conditions agreed there upon should also be investigated, as the debt that was piling up had far-reaching implications. The BJP MP said he would take the “dubious” manner in which the State government was mobilising funds to the Union Finance Minister’s notice to ensure that the Centre took corrective action lest the State should go deeper into crisis.  There is a need for the Central government to prescribe guidelines for direct cash transfers to the beneficiaries under various schemes. G.V.L.

26 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farmers begin cultivation of ‘forbidden rice’||Cultivation of black rice, a popular variety in the north-east India, has begun in Andhra Pradesh. Black rice, popularly known as ‘forbidden rice’, is said to have roots in ancient China and was believed to be exclusive for royal consumption. Around 150 farmers have been cultivating BPT 2841, a new black rice variety developed by the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU), in about 1,000 acres in the State. According to information, the ANGRAU has been supplying about 1,000 kg of seeds per annum to the interested farmers from all 13 disticts since the last three years. The farmers have multiplied the seed. A rough estimate suggests that the seed available with the farmers is sufficient to meet the requirements of around 15,000 acre. However, there is no concrete data. The farmers, who were given the breeder seeds by the ANGRAU, have used the produce for domestic consumption or distributed among their friends and relatives. So, roughly 1,000 acres are under black rice cultivation, the officials say. ANGRAU Vice-Chancellor A. Vishnuvardhan Reddy says that the paddy grains are dark in colour, However, it appears like normal white rice after polishing. Health benefits “People may have some reservations if the colour of the paddy is to be considered. However, black rice has a plenty of health benefits. It contains more Vitamin B and E, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc as compared to white rice. Black rice also has a low Glycemic Index (GI), a scale that indicates how quickly a food causes a person’s blood sugar to rise, when compared to white rice. The black rice may help patients of diabetes regulate the symptoms of diabetes,” says Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy. ANGRAU Director (seeds) A. Subba Reddy says that the process of developing BPT 2841 variety began seven years ago. Farmers, in some small pockets of the State, were cultivating black rice. But, it was a local variety. The varsity has improvised it. About 30 bags (75 kg each) acre of yield per acre can be expected from BPT 2841 variety when compared to 18 to 20 bags of the local varieties. “The university has plans to release it into the market next year after analysing the results of yields in the last three years,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-begin-cultivation-of-forbidden-rice/article35531979.ece

26 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘CM’s silence emboldening perpetrators to attack temples’||By remaining a silent spectator, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is encouraging the attacks on temples and actions that hurt the sentiments of the Hindus, BJP State president Somu Veerraju has alleged. Mr. Veerraju was addressing the media at Vinukonda while proceeding to the Tripuranthakam temple in Prakasam district as part of his ‘Devalaya Darshanam’ campaign on Sunday. Cow slaughter Accusing a few YSRCP MLAs of spreading hatred against the ‘Hindu dharma’, Mr. Veerraju questioned if the State government was in favour of cow slaughter. The BJP leader was quoting from a statement purportedly made by Yemmiganur MLA K. Chennakesava Reddy that the Act that prohibited cow slaughter should be scrapped. Tipu statue Mr. Veerraju said attempts to install the statue of Tipu Sultan at Proddutur in Kadapa district was another despicable act of the local MLA, which the Chief Minister did not condemn. “The Chief Minister should suspend the MLA. Alternatively, the MLA should step down on his own for hurting the sentiments of the Hindus,” he demanded. He said the Chief Minister had promised to rebuild the temples that were razed instead of nabbing the culprits. “Not a single person has been arrested,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cms-silence-emboldening-perpetrators-to-attack-temples/article35531984.ece

26 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||AU forms five-member committee to probe death of cow on campus||The death of a cow at Andhra University(AU) has sparked controversy with members of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jana Sena Party(JSP) alleging negligence of the security officials, which led to the death of the animal. The political representatives also demanded a probe into the issue to identify the accused and ensure strict punishment. MLC P.V.N. Madhav from the BJP visited the spot near YVS Murthy Auditorium, where the AU security officials hac buried the carcass of the cow, here on Sunday morning. He paid floral tributes to the cow at the burial site. Speaking to the media, Mr. Madhav said with the increase in concrete jungles, there was no option for a number of cows from Resupuvanipalem, Shivajipalem and Maddilapalem areas but to graze on AU campus. Till now, there was no incident of animal attack on students or property loss. But the AU officials have been imposing fines on the cattle owners, if these animals enter varsity premises, he said. “The AU security officials might have tortured it causing its death. Why did the security bury the animal on the AU premises? This has to be probed by the officials. We will send a notice to the AU officials and also take this issue to the notice of the Governor,” Mr. Madhav told media. He also demanded strict punishment of the security personnel and also asked the AU to pay compensation to the cow owner Venkat Rao. Meanwhile, AU Registrar V. Krishna Mohan said that Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy has ordered an inquiry into the alleged death of a cow on the campus. The five-member committee would inquire into the issue and submit a report within 48 hours. Principal of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar College of Law, Sripada Sumitra, is the convener of the committee. The Viswa Hindu Parishad(VHP) had filed a petition in the III Town Police Station on Saturday that a cow had died due to the alleged negligence of AU security staff. According to Inspector Eswar Rao, a cow had trespassed into the campus and the security staff had tethered the cow and had asked the owner to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000 and take back the animal. But by the time, the owner could pay the fine amount, the cow reportedly died of weakness. He also said that after the cow had died, AU officials asked the owner to take away the carcass. But since the owner did not turn up, the officials buried the animal, Mr. Eswar Rao added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/au-forms-five-member-committee-to-probe-death-of-cow-on-campus/article35532063.ece

However, when the INR values (International Normalised Ratio for patients on anticoagulant therapy) are high, the physician should reduce them and then ask patients to go for the jab, P.V.V.N. Markandeya Kumar, interventional cardiologist, CARE Hospitals, has said. He was delivering a virtual talk on “At the heart of COVID: What you need to know,” organised by Andhra Medical College (AMC), as part of the 79th Continuing Medical Education (CME) Update on COVID-19 on Sunday. Dr. Kumar elaborated on various aspects of the COVID-19 and heart disease. The complications among heart patients due to vaccination are negligible compared to the benefits. He, however, advised the physicians to avoid platelet transfusions.  CVD pandemic He expressed apprehensions that the COVID could ultimately lead to Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD) pandemic as an estimated 1 million to 2 million more CVD cases were expected to be seen post-COVID. Dr. Prasad VRK Chalasani, interventional cardiologist, Florida Heart Centre, who was the moderator, chose to be optimistic and said, “The increased mortality should be seen in respect of the entire syndrome and not just due to the COVID. The most important thing for physicians is not to cause panic about Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD) pandemic as fear causes more stress among patients.” Earlier, in his opening remarks, P.V.

26 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||New ration cards from today||The State government will start distribution of new ration cards to eligible beneficiaries from Monday till July 31. As many as 3.09 lakh cards will be issued to an equal number of families in different districts after the government had cleared all the applications taking ensuring that there is zero pendancy. With the issue of new cards, a total of 8.65 lakh beneficiaries would come under the coverage of the public distribution system. Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamalakar will start the process in Jayashankar Bhupalpally while Ministers, MLAs and MLCs will distribute the cards to eligible beneficiaries in their areas. Issuance of new cards, according to Mr. Gangula Kamalakar, would entail supply of 5,200 more tonnes of rice per month, in addition to the existing 62,400 tonnes per annum, incurring an additional expenditure of Rs. 14 crore a month totalling Rs. 168 crore a year. The State currently had 87.41 lakh ration cards covering 2.79 crore beneficiaries under the public distribution system. Addition of 3.09 lakh new cards would take the total number of cards to 90.5 lakh and the number of beneficiaries covered would be more than 12.88 crore. The government would incur an expenditure of Rs. 2,766 crore per annum at the rate of Rs. 231 per month on rationed items supplied through the public distribution system. The development follows the instructions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to ensure ration cards to all eligible beneficiaries who submitted their applications.

26 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘IT employees refusing to work from office insensitive to misery of others’||Principal secretary of IT department Jayesh Ranjan said that employees who have expressed reservations about resuming work from offices are “extremely insensitive” to the misery of others. Reacting to news reports which quoted him stating that the State government wants people to return to workplaces, IT employees had expressed a range of concerns such as fear of contracting COVID-19 and difficulty of managing responsibility of their children as schools stay shut. Some employees have even shifted to their native place and are working from there. Speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of a 50-bed ICU ward at Osmania General Hospital on Sunday, Mr Ranjan said that livelihoods of several sections of society depend on reopening of offices. “If they refuse to come to office when everyone else is going to office and when everything is safe, I will say they are extremely insensitive to the misery of others. They are only looking after their health, their children’s health, and the fact that they can relax in their homes. Livelihoods of taxi drivers, catering and security guys, and all other service providers are dependent on functioning of offices,” he said, mincing no words. The senior official said that he couldn’t have pushed people to take risks during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. But when the risk has become literally ‘zero’ now, he said people are not realising the havoc they are unleashing on others and that it is rather unfortunate and insensitive. Employees worried The concerns of IT employees not wishing to go back to office in a hurry include the fear of infection. “I am scared of contracting COVID and spreading it to my family members. The concern remains even after taking two doses of vaccine against it. My family has cut down all non-essential works outside home, which means no visits to gyms or public spaces. Why risk it all by going to office? My one-year-old child will not be able to communicate to us properly if she has any of the COVID symptoms,” said an IT employee on the condition of anonymity. Many others shared this opinion. Apart from the infection concerns, they stressed that their work output is the same or has even increased while working from home. Eager to go to office However, there is another section that believes it is time to return to IT campuses. Sai Kumar Gujjula, an employee, said that he works in sales division of a company and not having in-person interaction affects his work. “We gain better understanding on interacting in-person. And the opportunity of networking with colleagues, seniors, and others comes down if we rely entirely on the virtual medium. We get stuck at the career and aspiration ladder. Work-life balance went for a toss while working from home,” he added.  I am scared of contracting COVID and spreading it to my family. The concern remains even after taking two doses of vaccine.

26 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Crops damaged on 5L acres in five erstwhile districts||Let-up in the rain for the last two days has stopped further damage to the standing crops inundated/flooded during the recent spell of heavy rains allowing draining of logged water at least to some extent as also taking up enumeration of the damage by cluster-level officials of the Agriculture Department. However, large extents of standing crops were either washed away beyond any prospects of revival or silted with sand or mud, leading to near total loss of investment to the farmers concerned. According preliminary estimates, standing crops were damaged on over 5 lakh acres in the erstwhile Adilabad, Warangal, Karimnagar, Khammam and Nizamabad districts. The damage of standing crops is high on the fields along the courses of rivers, rivulets and low-lying areas. Now that the rain has stopped, damage would be minimised with draining of water, wherever possible. Officials of the Agriculture Department stated that detailed enumeration would bring out the exact extent of crop-wise damage, including the extent eligible for input subsidy given by the Centre for at least 33% of damage. The Centre, if satisfied with the assessment of damage after submission of report by the State government, could announce input subsidy up to Rs. 10,000 per acre. ‘Pulses worst hit’ The officials admitted that damage due to the rains was maximum to pulses such as greengram and blackgram, soybean, paddy, cotton and maize. Crops have been sown/transplanted on about 82.5 lakh so far this kharif season with cotton sown on about 48.77 lakh acres followed by paddy on 13.75 lakh acres, redgram 8.34 lakh acres, maize 5.18 lakh acres, soybean 3.39 lakh acres and greengram 1.21 lakh acres. Meanwhile, the average rain recorded in the State was 3.1 mm against the normal of 7.3 mm during the 24-hour period till 8.30 am on Sunday with the highest of 48.5 mm recorded at a couple of places in Adilabad district. On Sunday, from 8.30 am to 7 pm, a highest rainfall of 20.8 mm was recorded at Kunoor in Jangaon district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/crops-damaged-on-5l-acres-in-five-erstwhile-districts/article35532021.ece
26 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Centre should continue to be manager in water disputes’||Fourteenth Finance Commission chairman and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Y.V. Reddy has expressed the opinion that it is better if the Centre continues to be a manager, rather than running it by itself, in water disputes between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Reddy, who worked on issues related to water disputes, when asked about the Centre’s decision to intervene in States’ river water disputes, said this while speaking at a talk on Centre-State relations hosted by Manthan Foundation on Sunday. “I can say that If I were to advise the Government of India, I would have said it is not wise to get into river water disputes of States to resolve. They are impossible to resolve and so complicated. Sometimes, projects are undertaken without Central clearances. And most importantly, emotions run high. There is one dispute between Andhra Padesh and Telangana. If the Central government stepped in, there will be two disputes – one between the Centre and AP, another between Telangana and the Centre, and the Central government will never be able to satisfy the two of them. In certain matters, it is better if the Centre continued to be a manager, rather than running it by itself. It can lead to very emotional situations. So I only hope that this will be unwound in some ways and encourage the States to co-operate with creative tensions rather than imagine that they (the Centre) can fix the problem."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-should-continue-to-be-manager-in-water-disputes/article35531798.ece

26 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Daily case tally below 500 as testing drops||The State recorded less than 500 coronavirus cases for the second time in almost three-and-a-half months as fewer tests were conducted on Sunday. Of the 91,457 samples put to test, only 494 turned up positive and results of 941 were awaited. Usually, 1.1 lakh to 1.3 lakh samples are tested in a day.

26 July 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Wait ends on tragic note||Narsolla Chandraiah (56), an oustee of Rampur village in Toguta mandal, passed away on Sunday. He is survived by wife, two daughters and a son. One daughter is yet to be married off. Family members and villagers attributed his death to mental agony of not getting Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) package despite repeated appeals. Chandraiah’s son Kanakaiah, who reportedly has partial vision problem, was also not given package, family said. Chandraiah and his brother Mallaiah used to have about three acres of land, which was taken by the government for Mallannasagar and they were paid for land. As both brothers used to stay in the same house, officials reportedly sanctioned house only for Mallaiah and not Chandraiah. His repeated appeals for R&R package fell on deaf ears. As the government had not sanctioned R&R package, Chandraiah had been staying in a shed. Anjaneyulu, an oustee from the same village, said locals, including himself, had extended financial assistance when his shed collapsed. Officials are not available for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/wait-ends-on-tragic-note/article35532026.ece

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Keep aside routine for a few months’||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has given a clarion call to the voters of Huzurabad constituency where a by-election is due while taking the polls there as a testing ground for 2023 Assembly elections. During the ongoing padayatra of Mr. Rajender in the constituency, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Telangana unit president Bandi Sanjay Kumar called upon people to keep aside their routine for the next few months and work for the success of Bharatiya Janata Party candidate in Huzarabad byelection to herald a change in the State’s political spectrum. He says it would set the trend for catapulting the party to power in Telangana. For sure, other major parties vying for the seat – Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Congress – too are likely to make fervent appeals to the electorate making different promises. The next few months are before the Huzurabad electorate to buy one of the three parties’ promises!     It is a matter of surprise that Warangal town which is rated as one of the major tier two cities in the country spread over a hundred sq km does not have an underground sewer and drain system. As part of laying underground drainage on 15 select roads of the city under Smart City Project, the municipal corporation recently dug up trenches and pits on these thoroughfares, much to the inconvenience of traffic and pedestrians. The delay in laying pipelines has resulted in the dug-up places remaining uncovered. On Saturday, an old man fell into the caving opposite the Warangal head post office and had to be lifted up by traffic constables with the help of passersby.     Authorities often fail to delete the names of the deceased from the list of pensioners whenever the death occurred. This results in public money getting credited to their bank accounts for months until the matter was taken to their notice. The problem was more serious in municipalities where the interface of officials with public was less. They would get to know about a death only when the kin approached them for death certificate or during routine verification of pensioners. In rural areas, however, there is a foolproof method of verification with mandal development Officers keeping an updated record on the basis of reports of Panchayat Secretaries who were in regular touch with villagers. A 78-year-old woman who died in Sircilla municipality five years ago was one of those whose bank accounts of old-age pension continued to get credited.  (B. Chandrashekhar and N.

26 July 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Issue fresh notice in decade-old case, says Orissa HC||The Orissa High Court ordered the fresh issuance of notices in a case upon finding that it was listed only twice for hearing in a decade. This case pertained to a lawyer activist moving court seeking compensation for being put behind bars in a “false” sedition case. The lawyer activist, Pratima Das, was arrested on August 12, 2008 on allegations of participating in subversive activities of the banned organisation CPI (Maoist). She was charge-sheeted in two cases under various grievous charges, including murder, dacoity and sedition. Ms. Das had to stay in jails for over two years before courts acquitted her in those cases. After her acquittal, she moved the HC seeking compensation and punishment for the officers involved in the alleged fabricated cases that caused her to suffer mental trauma and public humiliation. “In neither of the two cases was the prosecution able to substantiate its case against the petitioner. But she suffered humiliation and harassment in jail for two years three months and five days,” said Prashant Jena, her lawyer. Mr. Jena said, notices were issued to the State Home Department, three Indian Police Service officers and other police officers, for the “malicious cases”. However, the counters to the notices were never received. When it came up for hearing on July 22, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice B.P. Routray observed, “Although this petition was filed in 2011, in the last 10 years, it was listed only twice — on February 23, 2012 and September 6, 2012 — for hearing.” Stating that the serving of notices was not complete, and the report of the serving of notices to two-three opposite parties was not available, the Bench directed the State Home Department to provide the correct present addresses of the opposite parties within four weeks. The petitioner filed requisites for the serving of notices upon three left out parties by registered post with AD (acknowledgement due) returnable by November 16, 2021, the judgment said. Ms. Das said, “The fabricated cases badly impacted my life. Media outlets presented my case in a colourful manner after going by the police’s version. I was branded a terrorist in society, apart from my painful days in jail.” She added, “But it was not enough. My family members too faced humiliation following my arrest. We never returned to the normal life of a lower middle class family. Compensation, punishment for the errant officers, would send the right message to society.”  Compensation, punishment for the errant officers, would send the right message to society Pratima Das Petitioner||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/issue-fresh-notice-in-decade-old-case-says-orissa-hc/article35531695.ece
26 July 2021||GURUGRAM,||Haryana withdraws order on land consolidation in Kot village||More than two years after the Haryana government ordered the consolidation of 3,184 acres of land in Kot village in Faridabad amid strong opposition from the locals and the environmentalists, the controversial orders have now been withdrawn. Those opposed to the consolidation then had argued that it was illegal and aimed at benefiting an influential yoga guru owning large chunks of “ Gair Mumkin Pahaar ” (non-cultivable land) in the village. It is for the fourth time over the past nine years that the government ordered the consolidation of the Kot village land, but then withdrew the orders. Withdrawing the latest orders for consolidation issued on February 1, 2019, the Director, Consolidation of Holdings, Haryana, said that “in case the consolidation exercise... is carried out, it would wrongly benefit certain influential outsider purchasers. ‘Non-cultivable land’ Of the total 3,184 acres notified for consolidation in village, an area of 2,565 acres is “ Gair Mumkin Pahaar ”. “The aim of the Consolidation Act is to consolidate the agricultural holdings for the betterment of agriculture, for prevention of the fragmentation of agricultural holdings and for the reservation of land for common purposes of the village. The object of the Consolidation Act would be defeated in case “ Gair Mumkin Pahaar ” is included,” said the order issued on July 23. ‘Usurping forest land’ Welcoming the withdrawal, Kot Sarpanch Mundresh Devi’s husband Kesar, in the forefront of the fight against the consolidation process, said the villagers had written to the Prime Minister’s Office, Union Home Minister and Chief Justice of India, among others, over the past two years seeking to stop the consolidation and were “happy” that they were heard. “The consolidation was aimed at benefiting the yoga guru to usurp the forest land. Most of the villagers rear cattle and need forest land for the grazing of the animals. The consolidation would have hit us hard. Now we demand that the illegal structures and boundaries constructed in the forest land be demolished to free it from encroachment,” said Mr. Kesar. Chetan Agarwal, a forest analyst, said this was for the fourth time the consolidation process was stopped on grounds of misuse to create plots in the Aravalis and forests. He expressed hope that it was also for the “final time” that the orders were withdrawn. Lt. Colonel (retd,) Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi, an environmentalist, said the consolidation process had been misused in Aravali villages like Mangar, Bandhwari, Ankhir, Mewla and Maharajpur etc. to create private plots and must be rolled back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-withdraws-order-on-land-consolidation-in-kot-village/article35531699.ece

As part of the joint ‘neighbourhood first’ policy, the honorary Consul in Mumbai said, Maldives invites people from Maharashtra to participate in marine, tourism, cultural and student exchange programmes. Maldives is planning to attract partners in areas such as core infrastructure, travel, maritime/marine, education, healthcare, defence, technology, and emerging businesses, Mr. Mohanty said. Mr. Mohanty had proposed a tourism bank in Male by Indian partners for rendering financial services in the Indian Ocean Region. Indians are the second largest expatriate community in Maldives. India is Maldives’ fourth largest trade partner after UAE, China and Singapore. At present, India is developing projects worth $2 billion encompassing social development infrastructure.

26 July 2021||Mumbai,||Pornography case: actor Gehana Vashishth, 2 others fail to appear before police||Actor Gehana Vashishth and two other persons, who were summoned by the Mumbai Crime Branch in connection with a pornography case, failed to appear for questioning on Sunday, a police official said. Notably, the police recently arrested businessman Raj Kundra, husband of Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a case, which they said, related to alleged creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some apps. After Mr. Kundra’s arrest, Ms. Vashishth, who worked in three films produced for Mr. Kundra’s app, had in a video said that erotic content was different from pornography. Ms. Vashishth and two others were recently summoned by the Crime Branch’s property cell. Before the Mumbai Crime Branch took over the case, there was a complaint with the Maharashtra cyber department about the porn films racket, a senior police official earlier said. The Malwani police had filed FIRs on the basis of complaints received from two women, while another one woman had submitted a complaint at the Lonavla police station, around 120 km from Mumbai, he said. The Mumbai Crime Branch had started investigation into the case after some victims approached the Malwani police station in February 2021, he said. During investigation, it came to light that some small-time artistes were lured by giving them break in some web series or short stories, he said. These actors were called for auditions and were asked to give ‘bold’ scenes, which later turned out to be semi nude or nude scenes, which were against the wishes of the actors, the official said. During the investigation, it also came to light that there were many porn-related apps which were operating in the cyber world, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pornography-case-actor-gehana-vashishth-2-others-fail-to-appear-before-police/article35531887.ece
26 July 2021||Patna,||Bihar Assembly monsoon session likely to be stormy||The monsoon session of the Bihar Assembly, which will begin on Monday, is likely to witness noisy scenes as the ruckus during the last meeting of the House over a special armed police Bill may cast a shadow on the upcoming proceedings. Chaos in budget session Unprecedented chaos had erupted on March 23 in the budget session when police was called to assist the marshals in evicting unruly Opposition members who tried to physically prevent Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha from taking his chair. The bone of contention was Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, which the Nitish Kumar government had introduced in a bid to give its police more teeth. The Opposition had termed it “black” legislation, taking strong exception to the provisions that empower the Special Armed Police, previously known as the Bihar Military Police, to conduct searches and arrests without producing a warrant. The Bill was passed, amid a “walkout” by the Opposition MLAs who had squatted outside the building and raised slogans, slighted by the manner in which they were ousted from the Hall on that day. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has already written to the Speaker, saying the Opposition legislators were scared to enter the House. “Let us know the result of the investigation on the March 23 incident. That was a black day,” Mr. Yadav wrote in his letter. 2 policemen suspended Two policemen were recently suspended after they were found guilty of assaulting Opposition MLAs in the Assembly on March 23. The Opposition parties have also chalked out a strategy to corner the State government on issues such as rising prices of fuel, cooking gas, fertilizers and edible oil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bihar-assembly-monsoon-session-likely-to-be-stormy/article35531697.ece

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||‘China’s wolf warrior approach is here to stay’||China’s assertive new diplomatic approach in the Xi Jinping era has come to be dubbed “wolf warrior diplomacy”, marked by a muscular posture in pursuing China’s interests. Peter Martin , author of the new book “China’s Civilian Army: The Making of Wolf Warrior Diplomacy” and previously a foreign correspondent in China, says the approach is not exactly new and is rooted in the Communist Party’s history. The current state of relations with India, he says, is “the best example” of how it has often backfired although, he argues, wolf warrior diplomacy is likely here to stay. Excerpts from an interview:  Where does the idea of ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy come from? There was this blockbuster movie that came out in 2017 about this Chinese action hero fighting foreign bad guys on the continent of Africa and avenging China’s enemies. It was this unexpected commercial success, the highest grossing movie ever at the Chinese box office. It came to symbolise this new mood in Beijing. How much of this new approach is down to Xi Jinping, and how much is shaped by broader trends? I think of Xi Jinping as both a cause and a consequence of changes that have taken place in China. The new assertive turn in Chinese diplomacy really started in 2008-09 in the wake of the global financial crisis. China had just hosted the Olympics. The West’s response to the financial crisis was sluggish and China’s was very, very decisive. In the ensuing years, China watched Western political systems deal with gridlock at home while its own economic growth continued. There are these trends taking place in China that are quite independent of Xi Jinping. But I think what Xi did was take a more confident and assertive tone, and accelerate it and make it more decisive and more permanent. At the time of Xi taking over, there was a debate on whether China should continue with the Deng Xiaoping era approach of “hiding brightness, biding time”. Has that debate been resolved now? I think the debate is still ongoing beneath the surface, although, in public, Xi Jinping, and those who want to continue this very brash, assertive tone, have certainly won out. There are large parts of China’s scholarly community on foreign affairs, and in fact some people in the Foreign Ministry, who would still like China to take a quieter, more humble approach to foreign policy. I don’t know that those people necessarily think that returning to the policy of the 1990s is realistic. There’s a refrain I heard quite a lot in Beijing that you can’t hide an elephant. The idea is China has gotten too big to really take that kind of low profile that it had in the past. But I think there are a lot of people who are very uncomfortable with this trend of picking apparently unnecessary fights and insulting foreign counterparts. How are domestic changes in China shaping its current diplomacy? In Chinese diplomacy, domestic politics is always king. We look on with bewilderment sometimes and think, why are they possibly doing this because these are the people who are charged with improving China’s reputation? In truth, we’re not the audience. They’re doing this to signal to people in Beijing that they are loyal to the regime, they’re loyal to Mao or Xi Jinping or whoever is in charge. Foreign audiences are really a kind of by-product there. How successful has this approach been on the whole? In the grand scheme of things, I find it really hard to come up with any kind of net positive assessment of it. It’s one of the factors which has contributed to this incredible decline in global perceptions of China in Pew polling that you’ll have seen recently. In my mind, India is perhaps the best example of where this approach has kind of backfired. Wolf warrior tactics, combined with, of course, great military assertiveness on the China-India border, has ended up pushing India much closer to the U.S., and alienating a billion plus-person economy, an emerging power on the global stage with good relations with the United States, and that shares a border with China. To me, there’s no better example of that kind of counterproductive approach than what’s going on there.(Read the full interview at https://bit.ly/XiDiplomacy)  I think there are a lot of people who are very uncomfortable with this trend of picking apparently unnecessary fights and insulting foreign counterparts||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinas-wolf-warrior-approach-is-here-to-stay/article35531265.ece
26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||China, Pak. outline ‘joint action’ to align Afghanistan strategies||China and Pakistan on Saturday said they would more closely cooperate and work together in Afghanistan amid the changing situation in the country, as their Foreign Ministers proposed building theChina Pakistan Economic Corridor(CPEC) into “a hub of regional connectivity”. Meeting in the Chinese city of Chengdu at the third strategic dialogue, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi outlined a five-point joint plan on working in Afghanistan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Mr. Wang described the current situation as arriving “at an important juncture” as he criticised “thehasty U.S. withdrawal of troops” for having “neither fulfilled the purpose of fighting terrorism nor brought peace to Afghanistan but created a new security black hole,” the statement said. He said “both China and Pakistan are most directly affected by the situation in Afghanistan” as its neighbours and it was “necessary for both sides to strengthen cooperation to cope with the change”, which he described as one of the focuses of the dialogue. Mr. Wang outlined “joint actions” in five areas, starting with “the immediate priority of avoiding the expansion of war and preventing Afghanistan from falling into a full-scale civil war.” The second focus would be to promote the intra-Afghan negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban and establish “a broad and inclusive political structure”. He said the third joint action would be “to resolutely combat terrorist forces”. Mr. Wang only named the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which China has blamed for attacks in its western Xinjiang region, underlining China’s concern that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into Xinjiang. There do, however, appear to be stark differences in how both countries appear to view the terror issue and the role of other outfits in Afghanistan. Earlier this month, Mr. Wang said in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart Mohammed Haneef Atmar in Dushanbe that the “Taliban should stand clear of any and all terrorist forces.” At the same summit on connectivity, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani publicly slammed Pakistan for failing to take actions to stop foreign terrorists from entering the country amid “an influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters”. The fourth joint action would be to “promote cooperation among Afghanistan’s neighbours” and “explore the construction of a platform for cooperation among them”. Both would also more closely work on international fora on the Afghan issue, Mr. Wang said. Terror attack in Pakistan Both sides, in a “joint press release” issued after the talks that was put out by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “reaffirmed their commitment to facilitate and support ‘Afghan-led and Afghan-owned’ peace and reconciliation process” and “their support for the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan”. Both also “vehemently condemned” therecent terrorist attack in Pakistanin which nine Chinese engineers working on the Dasu hydropower plant were killed, along with four Pakistani nationals. Both sides “expressed their firm resolve to expose the culprits and their reprehensible designs through the ongoing joint investigation, give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators, ensure comprehensive safety and security of the Chinese projects, nationals and institutions, and prevent recurrence of such incidents”, the statement said. The joint release also carried the now customary reference to Kashmir, saying the Pakistani side “briefed the Chinese side on the deteriorating situation in Jammu & Kashmir” while China “reiterated” its stand that it “opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation”, a position it has repeated in the wake of India’s 2019 reorganisation. The Chinese side “reiterated its firm support to Pakistan in safeguarding its territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence” and “striving for a better external security environment,” the joint release said, adding that both sides had agreed to push forward the CPEC “with the aim to continuously unleash the great potential of CPEC to make it a hub of regional connectivity.” On CPEC China’s Foreign Ministry said in May both countries had been in communication with Afghanistan over extending the corridor. “Afghanistan has imported and exported related goods through the Gwadar Port and Karachi Port. China, Pakistan and Afghanistan are discussing issues related to extending roads and expressways in Pakistan to Afghanistan,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, adding that “the CPEC is an economic initiative that is not aimed at third parties, and has nothing to do with territorial sovereignty disputes… and won’t affect our principled position on the Kashmir issue.” India has opposed the CPEC, which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, although China has pushed ahead with projects and stepped up its investments in PoK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-pak-outline-joint-action-to-align-afghanistan-strategies/article35531274.ece
26 July 2021||Washington,||Pelosi plans to appoint Trump critic to Capitol probe panel||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said she plans to appoint additional Republicans, including a staunch Trump critic, to the committee probing the January 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection, amid a fierce partisan showdown over who will serve on the body. Asked whether she would appoint a new set of Republicans, including lawmaker Adam Kinzinger, who voted to impeach former president Donald Trump, Ms. Pelosi told ABC “that would be my plan.” Earlier this week House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy withdrew the names of the five Republicans he had appointed to serve on the select committee, after Ms. Pelosi took the rare step of rejecting two of them, congressmen Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, out of what she said was concern for the investigation’s integrity. Hours after the Capitol insurrection, both were among several Republicans who voted against certifying election results in some states. “The two that I would not appoint are people who would jeopardise the integrity of the investigation and there’s no way I would tolerate their antics as we seek the truth,” Ms. Pelosi said on Sunday. The tit-for-tat moves represent the latest bickering over what many were hoping would be a united effort: investigating the riot in the citadel of American democracy. Ms. Pelosi’s Democrats had sought to create a bipartisan, independent 9/11-style commission to investigate the Capitol insurrection. Ms. Pelosi said that Republicans including Mr. Kinzinger, a strong Trump critic and six-term congressman from Illinois, “have expressed an interest to serve on the select committee.” Ms. Pelosi herself had already appointed to the committee Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who was also among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump in January. The first hearing of the commission is scheduled for Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pelosi-plans-to-appoint-trump-critic-to-capitol-probe-panel/article35531267.ece

26 July 2021||Islamabad,||Pak. bans domestic air travel for unvaccinated||Pakistan has banned the domestic air travel for unvaccinated people as the COVID-19 cases crossed the 1 million-mark in the country on Sunday, according to officials. The travel restriction, imposed by the National Command and Operation Centre, will be applicable from August 1 on unvaccinated people of over 18 years of age. “Restriction is for domestic air travel and people travelling from Pakistan to abroad or from abroad to Pakistan are exempted from restriction. It is also not applicable on link flights if these are within 72 hours of arrival or departure,” according to an NCOC document. Partially vaccinated people, foreign nationals, Pakistani nationals having documentary proof of vaccination abroad and patients with clinical conditions will be exempted from the restriction, it said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Health Services said that 45 people died in the last 24 hours due to the COVID-19, taking the death toll to 23,016. It said that 2,819 new cases were reported, taking the national tally to 10,04,694. The positivity rate reached 6.32% which is the highest during the fourth wave of the pandemic which hit the country this month. Minister for Planning Asad Umar, who is also the chief of the NCOC, urged people to get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-bans-domestic-air-travel-for-unvaccinated/article35531272.ece

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Joining the dots in the second coming of Pegasus||Pegasus is not a stranger to our shores. It first surfaced in our public discourse towards the end of 2019. Researchers from University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab called up some telephone numbers in our country and informed them that their WhatsApp chats were compromised. There were some stirrings, but the controversy died out quietly and disappeared from our public discourse. The attention then was predominantly on the issue of how secure WhatsApp was and how weak its claims of end-to-end encryption were. WhatsApp’s public relations exercise to reassure its customers of its safety and privacy grabbed disproportionate attention. All these deflected the public’s attention from our Government’s involvement in the ugly saga and the misuse of NSO of Israel’s spyware to snoop on its own citizens. Parliament and civil society let the Government off easily. Perhaps, the impression that the surveillance then was largely confined to the Bhima-Koregaon happenings also contributed to its limited appeal. Signs of a surveillance state Most of us failed to connect the dots. The frequent and prolonged instances of Internet shutdowns; use of the sedition law on critics of the Government’s policies; use of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) ; rushing of crucial pieces of legislation affecting core sectors of our economy through the Houses of Parliament; consigning the data privacy Bill to a select committee; the framing of rules to rein in digital news platforms, and the demonic efficiency with which State governments were toppled appeared less dramatic and had no shock value as unconnected events. But if connected with each other, and the Pegasus spyware running in the background, they present a picture of India’s descent into a surveillance state. Treated separately, each one of those incidents, caused little more than a few days of screaming headlines, reprimanding editorials, raucous prime-time television debates, weak and short-lived protests by political parties and rights activists. The probability that the second coming of Pegasus into our political discourse will not be very different from its first appears very real, if this too is treated as a separate and isolated event. Fortunately, this time it came with two major differences. The targets now This time the attention is exclusively on the Government’s role and there are no red herrings in the form of questions about the safety of encryptions offered by service providers. The people involved in the revelations are not just little known activists. They range from the Leader of the Opposition, a constitutional authority, a number of journalists, human rights activists, Ministers in the Government, ruling party leaders, several political leaders, serving or retired officers. The list also revealed that the government agencies made no distinction between state interests and the interests of the ruling party. The expansiveness of the global list of people named as intended targets of the spyware and the prestige of publications involved in cross-border collaboration are indeed arresting. Pegasus’s second coming has yet another distinction. It foregrounds the collusion between government and weapons grade surveillance tech that has no intermediary functions to confuse us. The episodes that were hitherto played out as government versus tech in our country allowed the combatants to compete for our support. The government and the tech companies claimed to fight one another on our behalf. However, they were actually fights between tech and government for possession and control of our data. Government sought its possession to control society, to eliminate dissent and opposition. But it tried to portray to us that it sought to tame the tech companies to protect our interests, privacy, and the security of the realm. Tech companies sought to possess our data sets to make prediction products out of them and sell them to advertisers. Both the Government and tech companies vied for surveillance over us. One for control and the other for profits. However, there is always the undetected possibility of their interests coalescing. In the case of Pegasus the collusion is evident. The NSO Group does not compete with the Government for the possession of data surplus of its application. It is a pure and simple provider of surveillance-as-a-service to the Government. In the event, Pegasus this time shines a light on the Government for civil society to see it as a clear accountable entity. Government stonewalling It is evident that the Indian government till now is acting out of a standard play book. It is stonewalling. It has so far evaded the essential questions that are raised by the revelations. Ministers and representatives of the ruling party are questioning the credibility of claims made by the global consortium of media organisations that announced the startling revelations. They are accusing the publications of acting with ulterior motives to undermine India’s democratic institutions. Supporters of the Government’s narrative charge the publications with attempting to defame the country. The Government’s, and its supporters’, defence so far is essentially semantic quibble and based on raising doubts on the source of the telephone numbers that the media consortium says is from a leaked list accessed by media portal Forbidden Stories. The uncommonly cautious wording of the preface to the consortium’s admittedly limited claims to their findings is sought to be used to undermine the extraordinary significance of its revelations. The consortium desisted from making sweeping claims. It said, the leaked list of 50,000 numbers “are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group”. The consortium also said that the list “indicates the potential targets” identified in advance by the NSO’s clients for “possible surveillance”. The list is only “an indication of intent” and the appearance of a number in it does not reveal “whether there was an attempt to infect the phone” or “whether any attempt succeeded”. But amidst all this extraordinary caution is this devastating revelation which the Indian government chooses to deliberately ignore to indulge in semantic wrangling: “However, forensic examination of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity — in some cases in as little as a few seconds.” Amnesty International’s forensic lab found that of the 67 phones examined, 23 were infected and 14 showed signs of attempts to penetrate. The rest were cases of possible change of devices or those using the Android operating system that did not keep record of logs needed for forensic work. By any standard this is considered an overwhelming basis for further investigation. It establishes an unquestionable basis for subjecting all the rest of the numbers from the list of 50,000 numbers for investigation. And in India’s case, all the 300 numbers from the country that were found in the list. Already, over 10 of them were forensically examined and found to be either successfully infected by Pegasus or attempted to be penetrated. That is enough of a case for a comprehensive investigation into the claims of the media consortium. But the Government narrative harps on words such as ‘indicative,’ ‘possible’ and ‘potential’  as being too general and dismisses snooping charges. The Indian government’s defence that rests on questioning the source of the list has little merit. Investigative journalism is under no obligation to reveal its sources. In fact, it is ethically bound to not reveal in order to protect the identity of its sources. As important as the questions that the Government forcefully articulates is its remorseless stonewalling of the most important question repeatedly asked of it. It does not tell us in unequivocal terms whether it has or has not purchased the Pegasus spyware. It did not answer that question during the country’s first brush with the spyware in 2019 too. Even today it seems to be firm in its resolve not to answer. It hopes to wear down the political opposition, activists, human rights groups, and civil society. It evidently thinks that it can wait out the news cycles to run their course. It probably can. Civil society and the media, cannot, beyond a point, keep the pressure on. A government with brazen determination, brute majority in the legislature, and as yet unchallenged political capital, can afford to wait out the limited firepower of its political opponents’ artillery. Judiciary as bulwark The only institution in the present situation that can make the Government accountable is the judiciary. The track record of our top court on major issues of defining importance to our national life is at best mixed in the recent past. What it chooses to do or not do now can make a difference to India. The options before it are clear as they are stark. To allow the present government a free run in turning India into a surveillance state is one. The other is to stop the Government in its tracks, restore to its people the gift of a free and liberal state that the founding fathers of the Republic gave them. The country has very little time.

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Lessons from India’s food security response||With a reduction in COVID-19 infections as the second wave weakens in India, it is important to focus on the pandemic’s disruptive impact on the food security and livelihoods of the poor and marginalised. The deadly virus has been around for two years and it is not clear as to how and when it will end. However, we do have enough in terms of a hindsight analysis of policies and interventions that promise food and livelihood security, along with the strengthening of health support, for millions facing the wrath of the pandemic. It is imperative to also note an alarming escalation in the global hunger that is unfolding right now. There was a ‘dramatic worsening’ of world hunger in 2020, much of it likely related to the fallout of COVID-19. While the pandemic’s impact has yet to be fully mapped, a multi-agency report, ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World’, estimates that around a tenth of the global population – up to 81.1 crore persons – were undernourished last year. India has made enormous progress in food production over the years, with an inspiring journey towards self-sufficiency in food production marked by the Green Revolution. In 2020, India produced over 30 crore tonnes of cereals and had built up a food stock of 10 crore tonnes. The country has registered record harvests over the last few years. India exported a record 1.98 crore tonnes of rice and wheat in FY21. Pivoting safety nets Coming to the impact of COVID-19’s fallout, vulnerable and marginalised families in India continued to be buffered against the food crisis by its robust Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). Key measures initiated by the Union government included allowing the States to lift their allocations for six months in one go, in anticipation of a surge in demand for foodgrains through the public distribution system. As data shows, there was an unprecedented spike in the uptake of subsidised and free foodgrains during the lockdown. The public distribution system became a lifeline for millions hit by the pandemic. Increase entitlements A dynamic analysis of the food security scenario and feedback from different stakeholders allowed the Government of India to increase entitlements given to National Food Safety Act (NFSA) beneficiaries in 2020. For instance, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), 81.3 crore NFSA beneficiaries received an additional 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month and 1 kg of pulses per family per month, free of cost, for eight months from April to November 2020. Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, 8 crore migrants were provided 5 kg of foodgrains per month, free of cost. The government also allowed NGOs/civil society organisations to buy rice and wheat at subsidised prices directly from nearby Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouses. Rice was sold at Rs. 22 per kg (market price is Rs. 35 per kg) and wheat at Rs. 21 per kg (market price is Rs. 27 per kg) last year. The PMGKAY was introduced in 2020 for eight months to provide relief to 80 crore beneficiaries covered under NFSA from COVID-induced economic hardships. The scheme was reintroduced this year for the third phase implementation for two months till June, and later extended till November under the fourth phase. During the third phase of PMGKAY, about 89% of the allocated foodgrains were distributed to beneficiaries. The distribution reached 94% in May. Implemented for eight months last year and for seven months this year, the PMGKAY outlay will add up to a total expenditure of Rs. 2,28,000 crore over 15 months. Addressing challenges The COVID-19 pandemic has once again drawn attention to addressing the aspects of access and portability of food entitlements. It is critical to leave no one behind in times such as these and crucial for states to find solutions so that no one goes hungry. Ensuring that food support focuses on at-risk groups, including persons with disabilities, the elderly, single women-led households, transgender persons, HIV-affected persons, displaced persons, refugees and orphan children, is at the heart of ‘Leave No One Behind’. The scale of India’s public food distribution systems is immense and has gone through constant navigation and improvement, which is commendable. But more needs to still be done to improve access and inclusion among the missing vulnerable population. Way ahead First, the introduction of the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme is an innovation that can be a game changer, allowing beneficiaries to access their food entitlements from anywhere in the country. This is especially important for a country like India with a massive mobile population and migration between States. The scheme takes the massive digitisation of the supply chain, distribution and access to the next step, ensuring anyone benefits from anywhere in India. Second, climate change will continue to affect agriculture and food security, and the impact on the poor and vulnerable can be devastating. Massive efforts are needed towards programmes that focus on building resilient agriculture that is adaptive to changing weather and needs through the introduction of newer varieties of crops, efficient irrigation systems, and the promotion of crops as per the agro-climate zones. Thirdly, a third of all food produced is wasted. There should be enhanced efforts to prevent losses. Lost or wasted energy used for food production accounts for about 10% of the world’s total energy consumption, and annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with food losses and food waste reaches to around 3.5 gigatonnes of the CO2 equivalent. Finally, 2021 offers a unique opportunity for advancing food security and nutrition through transforming food systems with the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit, the Nutrition for Growth Summit and the COP26 on climate change. The outcomes of these events will certainly shape the actions of the second half of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition. India has a central role to play in this transformation and offering experiences and solutions to address the thought processes and models for a resilient, equitable, and food-secure world.

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Getting India’s military convergence formula right||The Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat’s recent description of the Indian Air Force (IAF) as a supporting arm — in an interview on July 2 — and the IAF chief Air Chief Marshal R.K.S. Bhadauria’s rebuttal, is the newest bump in the turbulent journey marking the reorganisation process of the armed forces. Unfortunately, this bump, probably caused by misinterpretation of an oversimplification by the Chief of Defence Staff, comes just when the process appears to be touching down after being airborne for long. Whatever the cause, the differences do not speak well of the intellectual underpinnings of the reorganisation process. Is there a problem with air power? What about the IAF warning against splitting it into ‘penny packets’? Is air power an adjunct? Armies and navies will see air power as an adjunct, history being the reason. Analysing the experience of the United States, the greatest exponent of air power in history, the air power theorist Tami Davis Biddle wrote in 2019 that ‘aerial bombing cannot control the ground. It is fundamentally a coercive activity in which an attacker seeks to structure the enemy’s incentives — using threats and actions to shape and constrain the enemy’s options, both perceived and real. It is an important and much-utilized military instrument for both deterrence and compellence. However, its ability to produce results varies, and students of strategy must understand the circumstances under which it is more or less likely to achieve particular results or political ends’ (https://bit.ly/3iHHrza). Holding and controlling land or water is essential in conflict. From Vietnam to Afghanistan, air power failed to deliver the promised results to the U.S. But everyone acknowledges how greatly air power can aid victories though. Issues before the IAF Media reports suggest that counting even ageing aircraft, the IAF is 25% short on fighter squadrons. A pan service shortage of about 400 pilots, almost 10% of their authorised strength, further aggravates this. Therefore, the IAF has a point when it warns against splitting assets, for, there may be nothing much to split. Whether now, or in any future joint arrangement, the service chief is responsible for the operational availability of assets. He alone will be blamed for failures. So he must protest with all his might. Vulnerabilities should be known to all stakeholders. When the U.S. Navy faced a budget cut in 2015, Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations told the Senate that ‘(if the budget gets cut) more ships and aircraft (will be) out of action when in battle, more sailors, Marines and merchant mariners (will be) killed, and (there will be) less credibility, to deter adversaries and to assure allies in the future’ (https://bit.ly/2TxL1TJ). But shortage alone is not at the core of the IAF’s objections. It is also the prospect of operational plans for the IAF being made outside the service. Finding common ground A common understanding of the nuances of military air power is the key. Towards this, it has to be accepted that others too understand air power. The 67-year-old naval air arm figures among the top 10 air forces of the world. With the experience of operating almost every kind of aircraft the IAF operates, and with the benefits of the operational wisdom borne of the harsh integrity of the supremely tough aircraft carrier and other small deck operations, the naval leadership understands air power. This applies to the Indian Army too, in its own way. Confidence needs to be developed that rightly staffed apex joint organisations can draw up professional operational plans for air power. This will need some effort in the short term towards enhancing professional military education though, at the staff level. Synergy and hurdles With dwindling budgets, a steadily deteriorating security situation and the march of technology, the armed forces understand the need to synergise. But natural human faults interfere. For instance, different services do not co-exist well where they are colocated. Bitter fights over land, buildings, facilities, etc. mar optimal operational synergising. Then there is the issue of giving each other the best, or of wanting to be with each other. The Andaman and Nicobar Command suffered from the lack of a substantial operational charter, and the services not positioning appropriate personnel or resources there. Moreover, as a joint tenure did not benefit career, no one strove for it. The U.S., when faced with the same problem, made joint tenures mandatory for promotions. Steamrolling with decrees is useful in such areas. Major reorganisations must strictly follow the sequence of written concepts, their refinement through consultation, simulation or table top war gaming, field evaluation and final analysis before implementation. This would help address command and control, asset adequacy, individual service roles, operational planning under new circumstances and the adequacy of joint structures. Who gets to lead what also matters. The Western Command between the Indian Army and the IAF, the Northern Command with the Indian Army, Maritime Command with the Indian Navy and the Air Defence Command with the IAF may be an acceptable formula. What is needed As we hurtle towards inevitable reorganisation, some specifics are required. The first is the need for a comprehensive National Security Strategy to guide the services develop capacities required in their respective domains. The second is the need to transform professional education and inter-service employment to nurture genuine respect for others. The third is that the armed forces must resolve their differences among themselves, as the politicians or bureaucrats cannot do it. The fourth is to ensure good quality staff, in adequate numbers, at apex joint organisations, to reassure individual services and those in the field that they are in safe hands. The fifth is the acceptance of the fact that what works for other countries need not work for us. We may need tailor-made solutions which may need more genuine thinking. For genuine military jointness, a genuine convergence of minds is critical. Decrees have limitations. Commodore G. Prakash, a Nau Sena Medal recipient, served the Indian Navy for 35 years.

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Time to reflect||In less than two months, my tenure as the Readers’ Editor will come to an end. After being a journalist for nearly four decades, which includes the past nine years as a news ombudsman, I am moving on to pursue research on a range of subjects that are close to my heart. I would like to use this interregnum to look at the changing nature of the news industry, and the challenges it poses to a news ombudsman. Along with my personal reflections, I would like to hear and share the views of the readers about how they assess this institution in general, and within The Hindu in particular. First, we need to contextualise the role of a news ombudsman and how it is different from all other journalistic assignments. While every journalistic assignment goes on to create a body of public information, the evaluation by an ombudsman is clearly a post facto act. Autopsies help to understand the factors that led to the death of an individual — which is a significant contribution. The role of an ombudsman is not only to identify what went wrong but also to work on a visible mending process. The idea of a visible mending process is to ensure that the society makes its choices based on right information rather than a faulty one. ‘Required revolution’ Joshua Benton, founder of the Nieman Lab at Harvard University, in his article “From public to publics” has argued that “a strong, proactive public editor can be part of this current reckoning in journalism that is looking increasingly like a required revolution in journalism culture”. Over the course of next few weeks, I will also be touching upon some of the crucial questions about the role of a news ombudsman raised by Kathy English, who was Toronto Star ’s public editor for thirteen long years and my fellow board member at the Organisation of News Ombudsmen and Standards Editor. What is the need for this extended reflection and engagement? Is it an attempt to understand digital disruption? Is it an attempt to locate the elements of journalism within the changing contours of the news media industry? The answer is yes to all these questions and much more. I earnestly hope this extended engagement will deepen the compact between the newspaper and its readers. Integral for self-regulation A news ombudsman is an integral part of self-regulation for news media. According to a UNESCO framework, “Self-regulation is a combination of standards setting out the appropriate codes of behaviour for the media that are necessary to support freedom of expression, and process how those behaviours will be monitored or held to account.” The framework further states that “self-regulation preserves independence of the media and protects it from partisan government interference. It could be more efficient as a system of regulation as the media understand their own environment better than government”. The framework also alerts citizens that this approach may be used by the news industry to further its “commercial interests rather than the public interest”. While the Terms of Reference that govern this office give general guiding principles, individual Readers’ Editors evolve their own approach to effectively ensure that the newspaper does not stray from its core principles and editorial values. In my first column on September 24, 2012, I spelt out my approach: “The Terms of Reference defines my role and the Code of Editorial Values defines the role of the editorial team. Readers’ concerns, complaints and suggestions shall not be evaluated in an arbitrary fashion, but within a rigorous framework set out in these two documents, as they provide for an institutional framework for a mutual dialogue between The Hindu and its millions of readers. My job is to see that this dialogue takes place for mutual benefit.” The fulcrum of my ombuds universe is a value system that is deeply embedded in the notion of the commons and common good, where the central concern is to effect course correction and not to be punitive. I have both boundaries and possibilities, and I respect the prerogative of editorial freedom. The perimeter is set by the Terms of Reference and it would be unfair to breach this. Respecting the well-defined perimeter is an enabling quality as it opens up many avenues to look at the best practices of journalism. This debate is crucial to preserve public interest in journalism. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/time-to-reflect/article35531259.ece
26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Are law and technology a solution to fake news?||Fake news and its associated social problems have been a major concern and the Indian government has been attempting to bring in several legal amendments to deal with its creation, propagation and effects. Social media companies, too, are investing billions of dollars into technological solutions such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to identify fake news and its proliferation. Are these the best solutions to solve a problem as old as humanity or is there any other effective solution? Looking at statistics on the justice delivery system in India, the legal system needs to become more robust before it can be considered an effective solution. Further, the formulation of laws in themself do not prevent a wrong action. When Timnit Gebru, former co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, made an unceremonious exit, the MIT Technology Review identified the key aspects of her unpublished paper that had caused a stir within Google. In summary, to train large AI models, massive computing power and energy is required and this has been expanding since 2017, along with an ever-increasing carbon footprint. The Technology Review stated that the ‘Transformer’ model, as on January 2019, used 6,56,347 kilowatt-hour (kWh), producing a carbon footprint of 6,26,155 lbs of CO2 equivalent at a cloud computing cost between $9,42,973 and $32,01,722 for a single training of the AI model. Further, since the models tend to use text already present on the Internet, there is a tendency for the AI to reflect strong negative human biases. Fake news is disinformation that has no basis in reality, but is presented as fact. Being designed to manipulate both the intellect and emotions of a person, it can evoke strong emotional reactions in its reader, which could sometimes result in violence. In an experimental study conducted among first-year undergraduate History students, who were given some historical content, it was found that novice learners made claims that did not have supporting evidence, were either inaccurate or unrelated. India’s diversity is its strength, but also the source for numerous conflicts that have persisted over the decades. These conflicts, being rooted in historical claims around politics, culture and religion, will intensify if the historical assumptions and data behind related fake news are not contextually analysed. The problem is aggravated with the decline in history learning programmes worldwide. While the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) curriculum has elements of historical thinking, State boards are primarily focused on the memorisation of content. The Constitution of India provides a long-term solution under Article 51A (h), which says, “It shall be the duty of every citizen to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.” While the National Education Policy, 2020, captures the needs of the nation, it misses out on historical thinking. Historical thinking is the set of thinking skills required for learning history. It consists of concepts like points of view, evidence, validity and reliability of the source, contextualisation, and corroboration, apart from other skills. Historical thinking skills can also be applied to law, forensic science, politics and research, and dealing with ‘fake news’. In the case of fake news, a person would have to be able to read a piece of news, examine the source for bias and ascertain whether the claims being made are factual or whether they constitute deliberate misinformation. Since fake news is designed to appeal to emotion, it becomes all the more important that a person is skilled at interrogating evidence, contextualising the information and corroborating it with alternate sources. If historical thinking has such widespread application, why is it missing from active public discourse and in the education system?

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Money changer||In contrast to India’s continued ambiguity over the legality of cryptocurrencies, its stance on introducing an official digital currency has been reassuringly clear and consistent over time. And, four years after an inter-ministerial committee recommended that India launch fiat money in digital form, the Reserve Bank of India has indicated that pilot projects to figure out its viability are likely to be launched soon. In a speech a few days ago, T. Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, RBI, said, “RBI is currently working towards a phased implementation strategy and examining use cases which could be implemented with little or no disruption.” The clarity is welcome, given that the much-awaited Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, is yet to be introduced. In recent years, the significant rise of private cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether has spooked central banks throughout the world, and pushed the case for official digital currencies. Mr. Rabi Sankar himself cited a 2021 BIS survey of central banks, which found that 86% were actively researching the potential for such currencies, 60% were experimenting with the technology, and 14% were deploying pilot projects. China, having already engaged in pilot projects for its digital RMB, is in fact planning a major roll-out soon. There has been little doubt, therefore, that India needs a digital rupee. The important questions are about the details and the timeline. There are crucial decisions to be made about the design of the currency with regards to how it will be issued, the degree of anonymity it will have, the kind of technology that is to be used, and so on. It is possible that the question of the degree of anonymity, especially, will be quite a challenging one. While official digital currencies can borrow the underlying technology feature of private cryptocurrencies, they significantly differ from the latter in their philosophy and goals. Also to be considered are possible impacts of the introduction of an official digital currency on people, the monetary policy, and the banking system. There are risks to be considered as well, not the least of which will be those emerging from cyberattacks. What is more, many laws need to be amended to make the digital rupee a reality. So, while India might have done exceedingly well in digital payments in recent years — the Deputy Governor said they have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 55% over the last five years — the digital rupee will be something else altogether. Notwithstanding all these challenges, it would seem that the answer to Mr. Rabi Sankar’s speech title, ‘Central Bank Digital Currency – Is This the Future of Money’, is a yes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/money-changer/article35531248.ece
26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||A climate risk||The monsoon is nearing its halfway mark and July, which is among the rainiest months, began with a rainfall deficit but has since seen a revival. For most of last week, all-India rainfall has been over 50% more than what is normal for this time of the year. Many regions in the Konkan coast and the southern peninsula have been seeing instances of extreme rainfall. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data on the regional distribution, the ‘South Peninsula’ has seen 29% more rain from June 1-July 25 than what is normal for this period. Rainfall in Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra, was torrential enough to beat its all-time record, according to the IMD. The monsoon is characterised by unexpected variability that forecast models can capture only in a limited way. However, much evidence is accumulating that there is a distinctive change in climate patterns. The frequency and the strength of cyclones over the Arabian Sea have increased in the last two decades. There has been a 52% increase in the frequency of cyclones over the Arabian Sea from 2001-2019 and an 8% decrease over the Bay of Bengal compared to 1982-2002, when, historically, most cyclones have been in the Bay of Bengal, according to a new study in Climate Dynamics . Even the duration of these cyclones has increased by 80%. More cyclones are bringing in more moisture from the Arabian Sea and contributing to extreme rainfall events over the western coast, the most recent example being cyclone Tauktae in May, which at 185 kilometres per hour was among the strongest cyclones to approach Mumbai. They drive storm surges that flood the coast. Studies show that a heating globe has increased atmospheric moisture levels, contributing to short, intense spells of rains. The interaction between warming, rainfall and temperature is complex and variables such as aerosol emissions, particulate matter pollution, agriculture and forestry patterns must be accounted for. However, the broader picture is that extreme events — bursts of torrential localised rainfall and prolonged droughts and heatwaves — are likely to increase, making the role of accurate forecasts that are able to warn of such events at least three to five days ahead even more important. But the bigger challenge is to undertake so-called climate-proofing of the most vulnerable regions and taking warnings of scientific risk assessment seriously. Evacuations ahead of a flood or a cyclone are not always effective and what is needed is limited construction in places that have been marked vulnerable. Just as it is possible to plan earthquake-resilient structures and site them scientifically, but hard to anticipate a major quake, similarly, proper planning can insure against the inevitable extremities of nature. International climate change agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions will yield benefits only in the very long term but what is done in the near future will mean the difference between surviving and thriving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-climate-risk/article35531249.ece

That finger against the Red “Destruct” switch would start a series of events resulting in the jettisoning of the command module containing the three Apollo 15 astronauts, the destruction of the Saturn 5 booster rocket, and the ultimate descent to earth of the Apollo spacecraft from its recovery parachutes. From that moment on, it would be up to “Beach Boss” Col. Robert A. Van Arsdall and his air, land and sea forces standing by for just such a disaster. These two Air Force officers have in their hands the fate of astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin and Alfred M. Worden. They also are responsible for other life and property should the Saturn rocket stray from its programmed path. Although all of America’s 24 manned space flights have made it safely through those tenuous early minutes, safety crews are never sure. They constantly are working to perfect techniques and find new equipment. More than one million people are expected at the Cape area to watch the giant Saturn 5 blast-off. The weather is expected to be good for launch time. Scott and Irwin are scheduled to land on the moon at 3.45 I.S.T. on July 31 and return to earth, north of Hawaii, on August 8 at 2.16 I.S.T.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-switch-to-save-astronauts/article35531257.ece
26 July 2021||Tokyo,||Hafnaoui strikes gold||Tunisia and Japan celebrated unexpected golds on the opening day of swimming events before normal service was resumed with the Australian women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team smashing its own world record on the way to the title in Tokyo. Chase Kalisz settled American nerves by delivering the country’s first gold of these Games, winning the men’s 400m medley as part of a US one-two with Jay Litherland. On a day of surprises, Tunisian teenager Ahmed Hafnaoui pulled off the biggest shock of all with a stunning victory in the men’s 400m freestyle. The 18-year-old, the slowest qualifier, produced a blistering finish to pip Australia’s Jack McLoughlin to gold with a time of 3:43.36s, American Kieran Smith taking bronze. Hafnaoui’s gold is only the fifth by a Tunisian athlete at the Olympics, but its third in swimming.  Japan’s Yui Ohashi won the women’s 400m medley in 4:32.08s. American Emma Weyant took the silver 0.68s behind and compatriot Hali Flickinger took the bronze. While it was a disappointing day for Australia in the men’s events, the women set a world record of 3:29.69s in the 4x100m freestyle relay, with Canada taking silver, 3:09 behind the winners, and the United States in bronze position. The quartet of sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell, Meg Harris and Emma McKeon ensured a third straight gold in the event for Australia, taking 0.36 off the previous record of 3:30.05. Maana, Srihari out Meanwhile, Indian swimmers Maana Patel and Srihari Nataraj made their debut in the 100m backstroke heats. However, neither could progress to semifinals. Maana and Nataraj, together with Sajan Prakash in the 200m freestyle, 100m and 200m butterfly, make up the largest Indian swimming contingent since 2008, when four swimmers qualified. Maana swam a time of 1:05.20 in the 100m backstroke. “I am pretty happy because it was my best time. Going into the heat I was really fidgety and shivering. All the emotions piled up and I was overwhelmed,” the 21-year old said. Srihari placed fifth in his heat in a time of 54.31s. “It was fine and not so great at the same time. I felt ready for the race but I didn’t feel like it clicked. Maybe I let the pressure get to me. I am disappointed but I can live with it,” he said after his race.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hafnaoui-strikes-gold/article35531533.ece
26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Manika causes an upset, Sathiyan exits||Manika Batra stunned 20th seed Margaryta Pesotska of Ukraine to storm into the women’s singles third round while G. Sathiyan was beaten by Lam Siu Hang of Hong Kong in a men’s second round contest of the table tennis event on Sunday. On Saturday, Manika had refused to let National coach Soumyadeep Roy advise her during her first round match after personal coach Sanmay Paranjape was denied access to the competition area. This led to table tennis team leader M.P. Singh publicly rebuking her. On Sunday, however, Manika did not let the controversy affect her.  Not only was Pesotska ranked 43 spots above Manika, the Ukrainian was also renowned for doing well against players with long pimples, like Manika. That showed as Pesotska won the first two games in quick time. Stung by the losses, Manika changed tactics and started playing deep. She also began unleashing forehand winners on a consistent basis. Manika's tactics and new-found confidence helped her pull level 2-2. However, she couldn’t withstand her opponent’s onslaught in the fifth. In the do-or-die sixth game, the lanky Indian was down 2-5 when she opted for a time-out. It proved a masterstroke as she returned with renewed vigour and confidence. She started firing on all cylinders, rattling Pesotska with a series of winners and going on to win the game 11-5. The decider was a see-saw affair before Manika prevailed 11-7. The final scoreline: 4-11, 4-11, 11-7, 12-10, 8-11, 11-5, 11-7. Tough test awaits Manika will now face 10th seed Sofia Polcanova of Australia for a place in the pre-quarterfinals. While Manika survived a tough test , Sathiyan, the most consistent Indian paddler for the last few years, fell to a lower-ranked Hang. The World No. 95 had lost both his previous matches against Sathiyan. Brilliant fightback The Hong Kong player staged a stupendous comeback after being on the verge of defeat at 1-3 games down. While Hang had every reason to celebrate, Sathiyan — whose personal coach S. Raman wasn’t allowed to travel to Tokyo — would have felt disheartened to see his Olympic debut end in a 7-11, 11-7, 11-4, 11-5, 9-11, 10-12, 6-11 loss in the round of 64 after being a game away from progressing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/manika-causes-an-upset-sathiyan-exits/article35531331.ece
26 July 2021||Chennai,||Adnan, Aditya star in Warriors’ win||A. Muhammed Adnan Khan (55, 38b, 4x4, 3x6) and Aditya Ganesh’s (41, 44b, 4x4, 1x6) 84-run partnership for the fourth wicket helped Ruby Trichy Warriors snatch a close three-wicket win over Siechem Madurai Panthers in the Tamil Nadu Premier League here at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday. Electing to field, the Warriors bowlers did well to restrict the Panthers to 137/6 with some disciplined bowling, led by left-arm spinner M. Mathivannan (2/18). In trouble Adnan and Aditya came together when their team was struggling at 10/3 after Rohit picked two wickets in the first over. They complemented each other well, with the former the more aggressive of the two. The young Adnan came out guns blazing, starting with a cut through point before hitting Rohit for a boundary and a six over long-off to get going. He used the slog sweep to good effect against the spinners. Aditya, the left-hander played some beautiful drives through covers and deft late-cuts behind the wicket. He had a reprieve on 21 when the usually safe J. Kousik dropped a straightforward chance at point. Warriors had a minor hiccup when it lost three quick wickets. However, P. Saravana Kumar (15 n.o.) and M. Poiyamozhi (10 n.o.) chipped in with vital cameos to take their team across the line. Earlier, former champion Panthers started strongly, but struggled after a flurry of wickets fell in the middle overs. It could never find the momentum to post a competitive total. Mathivannan was the key for Warriors; he came up with a brilliant diving catch running behind from cover to see the back of K.B. Arun Karthick before picking up two wickets. Panthers was reduced to 55/4 in the ninth over before Kousik (44, 32b, 3x4, 2x6) and B. Anirudh Sita Ram (36 n.o.) added 79 for the fifth wicket. Panthers, however, could not get the final push.  The scores: Siechem Madurai Panthers 137/6 in 20 overs (J. Kousik 44, B. Anirudh Sitaram 36 n.o., M. Mathivanan 2/18, P. Saravanakumar 2/31) lost to Ruby Trichy Warriors 138/7 in 19 overs (A. Muhammed Adnan Khan 53, Adithya Ganesh 41, J. Kousik 2/17, L. Kiran Akash 2/19, R. Rohit 2/32). Points: RTW 2 (4); SMP 0 (2) .   On Saturday: Salem Spartans 164/5 in 20 overs (S.

26 July 2021||Tokyo,||COVID forces Rahm and DeChambeau out of Games||The Olympic golf tournament lost two of its top stars to coronavirus on Sunday, as World No. 1 Jon Rahm and 2020 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau were forced to withdraw. The PGA announced that DeChambeau was being replaced by Patrick Reed and the Spanish Olympic Committee said Rahm had pulled out after testing positive for the second time in two months. The virus has cast a shadow over the event, with a total of 132 Games-related cases in Japan so far. Thirteen of those are athletes. Reed, who won the Masters in 2018, will join Justin Thomas, recently crowned British Open champion Collin Morikawa and Xander Schauffele in the men's competition. Rahm, who stormed to victory at the US Open in June, returned a positive sample after undergoing mandatory testing following his recent participation in this month's British Open. Rahm is not being replaced in Tokyo. The only other Spanish player listed for the men's golf competition is Adri Arnaus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/covid-forces-rahm-and-dechambeau-out-of-games/article35531941.ece
26 July 2021||TOKYO,||Australia steamrollers insipid India||The Indian men’s hockey team was no match for Australia as the world No. 1 side stomped to a 7-1 win in their Pool A match at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Sunday. The result steadied Australia’s seat at the top with two consecutive wins, while India slipped to fourth spot. The top four teams from the six-member Pool will advance to the quarterfinals. Australia romped ahead in the 10th minute through James Daniel Beale, who cleverly guided Jacob Whetton’s flick into the back of the net. India had chances to restore parity within five minutes, but Ravinder Pal Singh was denied by a sublime goal-line block from Andrew Ogilvie. India will rue that missed opportunity as the Aussies snatched the game away in the second quarter with three goals in five minutes. Jeremy Hayward struck a thumping drag flick, while Ogilvie scored two minutes later with a sublime no-look finish. The Indian defence, battered, had no time to recuperate as Joshua Beltz joined the party. Tim Brand bombed down the left byline, cut inside and crafted a neat tomahawk towards the centre. Amit Rohidas could have cleared but was not quick enough and Ogilvie hammered it home. While the Indians were wasteful up front, the defensive shape also took a beating and the backline was susceptible to long passes — a tactic that the Australians relied on to create numerous one-on-one chances with goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/australia-steamrollers-insipid-india/article35531335.ece
26 July 2021||COLOMBO,||Suryakumar’s knock, Bhuvneshwar’s spell help India take 1-0 lead||Suryakumar Yadav continued his rich vein of form with an another attractive half-century, but Sri Lanka bowled well to restrict India to 164 for five in the first T20I here on Sunday. Suryakumar’s second T20I half-century was complemented by useful contributions from skipper Shikhar Dhawan (46 off 38 balls) along with Ishan Kishan (20 not out off 14 balls) at the back-end. Skipper Dhawan added 62 with Suryakumar in eight overs to provide a solid launch-pad, but the latter's dismissal surely cost India 20 extra runs. It was Suryakumar’s five fours and a six that really helped Kishan and Hardik to launch the final assault. At the start, Prithvi Shaw had a forgettable T20I debut as Dushmantha Chameera’s (two for 24 in four overs) outswinger found the edge of his bat off the very first delivery of the match. Sanju Samson (27 off 20 balls) hit his customary six while batting like a millionaire before Wanindu Hasaranga (2/28 in 4 overs) trapped him with a googly. Surya as usual was in his free-flowing self, hitting those whiplash on-drives, cover drives and ramp shots which is a sight to watch both against pacers and spinners. However what was exhilarating was how Surya picked all those back-of-the-hand slower deliveries from seamers Isuru Udana and Chamika Karunaratne. Udana was dispatched with a conventional sweep shot for boundary while Karunaratne was slog swept for a six. When Hasaranga came for his last over, he went inside-out to loft him for a straight six to complete his fifty but the leg-spinner had the last laugh as he was not afraid to flight once more and this time the inside-out chip shot didn't have required wings to soar over the ropes.

26 July 2021||Tokyo,||Mirabai realises another dream: Mission Pizza!||Having passed Mission Tokyo with flying colours, Mirabai Chanu entered a new mission on Saturday evening: Mission Pizza. This would be the tastiest pizza of her life — one that is garnished with the glee of achieving her life’s dream of winning an Olympic medal. The 26-year-old weightlifter, who carved her name in history with a silver in the 49kg category, wanted to celebrate it with a big cheesy pizza. She had, in fact, been building her appetite by keeping an eye on the pizza counter at the Games Village here. “Among all the varieties of junk food, I like pizza the most. And I’ve noticed since we got here that they have been serving pizzas at the Games Village. I’ve been eyeing the pizzas all along and I can finally eat one now!” she said. Her yearning for a pizza became the talk of the town and Domino’s India joined the party by throwing a small pizza party with her family back in Imphal. Mirabai, who has not been home in nearly two years, is expected to land in New Delhi on Monday and travel home a few days later. The 49kg section is a particularly tough one as the lifters have to eat clean and stay within a certain weight limit throughout the year. The Manipuri weighed 51 kilos and had to cut down to 49kg by reducing her carbohydrate and fat intake two days before her event. The pizza she ate — topped with cherry tomatoes, basil and cheese — would surely make up for all those weight cuts she's has had to endure during her remarkable journey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mirabai-realises-another-dream-mission-pizza/article35531969.ece
26 July 2021||Chennai,||Mani Bharathi, Nishaanth stun Kovai Kings||Having been bowled out for just 96 in its opening match, Dindigul Dragons on Sunday turned it around in style as it thrashed Lyca Kovai Kings by five wickets, chasing a mammoth target of 202 in just 18 overs in the Tamil Nadu Premier League here. K. Mani Bharathi (81, 32b, 8x4, 5x6) and skipper C. Hari Nishaanth (70, 37b, 6x4, 5x6) wreaked havoc in the second match of the day at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium with brutal power-hitting as Dragons created history for the highest total chased in the tournament. Blazing start Mani, who walked in at No. 3, made his intentions clear from the beginning smashing a six and two fours off the first three balls he faced off left-arm seamer E. Srinivasan. He never looked back as he punished the medium-pacers, hitting them over mid-wicket and covers at will. At the other end, Hari started slowly and found his groove when he took on the left-arm spinner M. Ajith Ram with a six and a four down the ground. He then went after the other left-arm spinner N. Selva Kumaran smashing him for two sixes and a four. They added 153 runs for the second wicket off just 58 balls. With just 26 needed off 37 balls, Mani was dismissed and the Dragons made it difficult for themselves by losing four wickets in five balls. However, S. Swaminathan ensured there was no further twist in the tale with an unbeaten 17. The chase overshadowed V. Ganga Sridhar Raju’s brilliant unbeaten 90 (57b, 6x4, 7x6) that helped Kovai Kings post 201/1. He was supported by debutant J. Suresh Kumar’s 58 (40b, 7x4, 1x6) and B. Sai Sudarshan’s unbeaten 40 (24b, 4x4). Earlier in the first match of the day, A. Muhammed Adnan Khan (55, 38b, 4x4, 3x6) and Adithya Ganesh’s (41, 44b, 4x4, 1x6) 84-run partnership for the fourth wicket helped Ruby Trichy Warriors snatch a three-wicket win over Siechem Madurai Panthers.

26 July 2021||TOKYO,||Biles makes a flawed entrance||American gymnastics superstar Simone Biles got off to a shaky start in her quest for five gold medals and Olympic history in Tokyo on Sunday, as an Uzbeki mother-of-one bid a poignant farewell after a remarkable career spanning eight Games. At 46 years old, Oksana Chusovitina, gold medallist at her debut Olympics in Barcelona in 1992, has earned the right to occupy her time in more sedate ways than exploding up a 25 metre runway and somersaulting backwards over a vault against competitors younger than her son. She received a hugely affectionate ovation from her team, rivals, media and photographers when she narrowly failed to qualify for the vault at her eighth and last Olympics. Born in 1976, Chusovitina’s Olympic odyssey began in Barcelona in 1992, where she won team gold, adding silver in the vault in Beijing 2008. Biles, who kept the wheels on her bid to level Soviet great Larisa Latynina’s record of nine gymnastics gold medals, but her qualifying performances were peppered with rare imperfections. On the floor, Biles over-rotated after one series of mesmerising tumbles and went off the mat, drawing a gasp from at least one onlooker in the near-deserted Ariake Centre. Disbelief She rolled her eyes after another unsteady landing over on the vault, and her performance director Tom Forster expressed disbelief after an untidy end to her beam routine. Biles qualified top in the all-around and vault, and was second on the floor, with the USA occupying the same position behind the Russians for Tuesday’s team final. But in the beam standings she paid for her flawed ending to lie sixth of the eight progressing. Biles also booked a place for the uneven bars final, though, which the 19-time World champion missed at Rio 2016, as the eighth qualifier. Another gold medallist, but from much further back than Rio, departing Tokyo was the evergreen Chusovitina.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/biles-makes-a-flawed-entrance/article35531615.ece

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Gritty Mary survives||India had a mixed day in the boxing ring on Sunday as six-time World champion and 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist M.C. Mary Kom won her first round match, while World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik exited after a valiant show. Beginning her quest for a second Olympics medal, Mary warded off a strong challenge from Dominican Republic’s Miguliena Garcia to record a 4-1 win and reach the women’s 51kg pre-quarterfinals. Mary will take on Olympic Games bronze medallist and third seed Ingrit Valencia of Colombia. Competing against an opponent 15 years younger to her, 38-year-old Mary boxed from a distance and moved around nicely to land some head shots. Miguliena replied by delivering a few straight punches in the first round. After staying ahead with an identical 3-2 verdict in two rounds, Mary connected some clean shots, including a few right ones, to have a clear advantage in the third. Miguel gave her best before bowing out of the Olympics. Manish went down fighting 4-1 against European silver medallist and Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Luke McCormack of Great Britain in a 63kg opening round match. The Britain boxer won the duel after a closely fought final round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gritty-mary-survives/article35531342.ece

She started strong and was third at the end of the first series, but a freak incident midway through the second disrupted her rhythm.

While Manu finished 12th. Yashaswini Singh Deswal ended a spot below her. In 10m air rifle, Dipak Kumar shot a below-par 624.7 to place 26th, while Divyansh Singh Panwar totalled 622.8 to finish 32nd.

Like his other counterparts, 27-year-old hoped his song brought people together with its message of hope, with lines like ‘ I will stand, no matter what / I will fight no matter what / I will love, no matter what / Survive, no matter what. ’ “My father had taken a loan and bought me my first keyboard and without him, I wouldn’t have been the musician that I am today,” says the rapper, who collaborated with singer John Mozart and rapper Joshua Kirubagaran. Since the pandemic also robbed those in mourning the chance to bid farewell to their loved ones with a gathering of friends and family at a funeral, making music was especially healing for artistes. Last year, TV actor Siddhant Karnick saw his father, an ex- army man, fight Covid-19 and finally succumb to it. “Writing my thoughts down was the only way to make sense of the senseless,” says Nashik-based Karnick on how the lyrics of ‘Best Before’ — released on Father’s Day (June 20) — came to be. Phone calls and CT scans Sugumaran explains how he began making notes for the song (also available on Spotify) right from the time his father was hospitalised. He recreated a phone conversation that he had with his father, and the video for the composition as well as the artwork is an image of his father’s last CT scan. On the other hand, Karnick’s ‘ Best Before ’, available on Amazon Music, is surprisingly buoyant for a track about loss. “I wanted to use the principle of playing against the dialogue, which is a popular technique used in theatre. It’s where, for example, the darker dialogues are delivered by the villain with a sense of comic timing,” explains Karnick, who approached Pune-based producer Gandhaar Amin to compose it.  “I expected them [the lyrics] to be more about the incident, but Siddhant turned it around into something positive,” says Amin. “Siddhant is someone who is always on the go, so I wanted the song to reflect that.” Unexpected death, combined with the inability to spend enough time with Covid patients during their last days, has left loved ones with unprecedented grief. “My uncle was the pillar of my family. He was my father figure and now that he’s gone, I feel so lost,” says Goa-based Allister Martins, 26, of his maternal uncle who passed away earlier this year due to Covid-related complications. Martins, who wrote the song ‘Without You’ the day his uncle passed away, has reflected on how those who are closest to the deceased deal with the situation. “His wife and he were high school sweethearts. So the lyrics are partly what I think and partly what could have been going on in my aunt’s mind,” says Martins, who also directed and shot the video (on YouTube, Spotify), which came out in June, on his phone. ‘ You told me you’ll be there / Till we’re old and have grey hair / Now I’m sitting all alone in your chair ,’ are lines that he wrote to depict his aunt’s emotions. Finding a sense of community Music has been a cathartic experience not just for the artistes, but for listeners as well. “The most touching message was from a friend I had reached out to work with on a lyric video. I had sent him the audio and the lyrics and, in response, I found out that he had lost his father a week ago and that the song had helped give him a sense of closure,” says singer-songwriter Abhilash LR from Mumbai. His composition ‘Reminiscing’, that released on YouTube, is dedicated to his grandmother who passed away before the pandemic. Besides supporting the bereaved, these songs have also created a sense of community. “The pandemic has shown us that we’re all in this together,” says vocalist Sharoni Poddar of Kolkata band, The Miliputs. The five-member band recently released ‘Bhule Jawa Blues’, an indie blues song in Bengali (also on YouTube). “Whether it’s about losing a person eternally or having to let go of someone because of the physical distance during the lockdown, our new release is all about the memories that haunt us when someone moves on,” concludes Poddar.  The writer is the former editor of Rolling Stone India and teaches journalism at FLAME University.

26 July 2021||FARIDABAD,||KHOri residents stay put on the debris, wait for goVERNMENT help||“We are not going to leave this place, not until the government makes an arrangement for us. We have lost all our savings and now have nowhere to go,” says Vijay Prajapati, 35, a daily wager, staying at Khori Basti for over a decade. The local municipal body, following the directions of the Supreme Court a month ago, has razed a majority of the houses in this 170-acre colony spread across Delhi and Haryana on the forest land. Most of its inhabitants — the migrants from across the country engaged in menial jobs — have covered the remnants of their partially demolished homes with plastic covers to continue to live in them and are reluctant to leave. Families with elderly members, pregnant women and even newborns are determined to stay put under the open sky with the intermittent rain leaving their clothes and beddings drenched and power and water supply snapped for almost a month now. “We have a little choice,” says Raman Chaudhary, a native of Bihar, who too lost his home in the demolition drive four days ago, but decided to stay back with his family, including aged parents, wife and two children. He says he had bought the plot for Rs. 1.5 lakh more than two decades ago, and now staying in tents on the same plot. Chander Shah, a painter, says that most of the people in this colony have been jobless for over a year due to the pandemic and are on the verge of starvation. “We would prefer to die here than to move out. Had we encroached upon the land, we would not have felt the pain. But we had bought it with our hard-earned money,” he adds. Habiba Parvin, 27, alleges that the police did not even allow them enough time to remove their belongings and demolished their home and shop. She says that her husband, when protested, was arrested on charges of preventing the government officials from discharging their duty. Her family has been staying in the colony for two decades now and recently bought another 120 sq m plot for Rs. 5 lakh. “My husband is in jail. I have all my belongings. I am the most unfortunate,” says Habiba. Many have rented rooms in the neighbouring colonies to shift their expensive belongings, such as television and refrigerators, but continue to stay in the colony with bare minimum essentials. Sitting amid the rubble of her home with her belongings pushed under a plastic cover hung across a wooden plank to resemble an improvised tent, Bimlesh breaks down and says that the trees that they had planted and raised are their only companions in this time of adversity. “No one has come to help us. Neither the administration nor the netas [politicians]. These trees are our lone companions offering us shelter and shade,” says the 48-year-old, adding that they had been surviving only on tea and bread for a couple of days. Her husband Bhola Singh, a private security guard, adds that at least one member of the family would continue to stay at the site of their demolished home even after they move to a rented room. Rehabilitation policy The couple had gone to the camp to apply for the government’s rehabilitation policy for the Haryana residents but did not have the requisite documents. Bimlesh holds a voter identity card for Haryana, but her husband and son have identity proofs for Delhi. “The staff at the camp told us that the entire family should have the identity cards for Haryana. I don’t think the government will find more than 700-800 people eligible for the policy after the scrutiny,” says Bhola. But not many seem enthusiastic about the government’s rehabilitation policy for different reasons. Though Bimlesh and her husband went to apply for the flats offered under the policy, the couple said that it was difficult to find any work in its neighbourhood. “The Dabua colony, where the flats are located, is around 15 km from here. There are no jobs for daily-wagers in that area. You need to have a two-wheeler to commute for work,” says Bhola. Chander says the rehabilitation policy is nothing but an attempt by the government to “loot” them by offering more than a decade old flats in ruins. He says the government is trying to “extort” money from the poor by selling off its flats in the name of rehabilitation and make them tenants for another 15 years. “Instead of the flats, we would prefer the government to compensate us monetarily for our loss,” suggests Bhola.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/khori-residents-stay-put-on-the-debris-wait-for-government-help/article35531694.ece
26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Frames and the man||A man in a whitekurtacrouching on the road as a mob surrounds him, sticks raised and raining blows. An overhead drone shot of hundreds of pyres burning in the night sky. Labourers trudging home, children on their shoulders, bemusement in their eyes. These iconic images from the Delhi riots of 2020, the second wave of the pandemic, and the migrant crisis of the first lockdown are just some of the works of photojournalist Danish Siddiqui doing the rounds in the wake of his death while on duty for Reuters in Afghanistan. When I posted a few of these images on Facebook, I found them published with a trigger warning label. Such an irony, given that the same conglomerate allows dozens of videos of people being beaten, lynched, assaulted, and humiliated to be shared widely and triumphantly on WhatsApp, the messaging service it owns. Facebook’s action comes on the heels of thousands of trolls taking to social media claiming that Siddiqui deserved to die because he had shared images of the funeral pyres of Covid-19 victims; trolls who gave sanctimonious justification for their anger, who insisted that the privacy of the last rites had been violated by Siddiqui and other photographers. Yet, thinking back, what flashes in my mind’s eye are all-day telecasts of the funerals of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, with Rajiv and Rahul lighting the pyres of their parents. Images from glamorous world magazines that regularly trawl theghatsof Varanasi to capture the dramatic last rites conducted on the Ganga’s shores. Photo essays from inside burningghats, which capture the minutiae of ongoing funerals, thesadhuswho live there, the esoteric Tantric death rituals some of them practise. Indians don’t flinch from death — they live with death all around them. It’s a joyously messy relationship that accepts and celebrates death as a rightful end. From childhood, we are witness to bodies being borne away not in silence and secrecy but in loud and public procession, accompanied by flowers and chants, and sometimes with loud drumming and abandoned, drunken dance. Indians don’t hide from death or hide death. Rajasthan has its professional weepers or rudaali, women hired to perform grief, loudly and in public. Tamil Nadu has the oppari tradition, a complex genre of death music that’s both eulogy and dirge. Such rituals, which have their folk counterparts across the country, are accompanied by wailing, keening, chest-beating, and singing. Grief is exaggerated in order to be subsumed. Given this far from private embrace of death, the outrage about photographs of funeral pyres and the hatred directed against Siddiqui and others are inexplicable, and one must seek the reasons elsewhere. Through the second wave, a section of citizens insisted that data about deaths and the pictures and videos of pyres, graves and oxygen queues be kept out of the public domain. That such ‘negative’ news is demoralising. That people need to hear ‘happy’ news to stay upbeat. The concern, then, was not so much about privacy as about ‘negative’ news exposing gaps and deficits in the country’s administrative and medical preparedness. This distinction is important — thrusting a mike into a grieving mother’s face is an invasion of privacy, but photographs of hundreds of pyres burning or graves dotting a riverbank are public records. They chronicle a moment in history. And history isn’t only a happy sequence ofmehendiceremonies, masala movies, and cricket matches. It is naïve self-deception, therefore, to expect continuous anodynes from reporters and photojournalists as well. As I was writing this, I stumbled upon an old cartoon by the inimitable RK Laxman, which shows the common man with his head buried in the ground, while on him lies a newspaper covered with headlines that say ‘Positive news’, ‘Good news’, ‘Happy news’. Photojournalists like Danish Siddiqui risk their lives to be at the crossroads where history is taking a significant turn. Siddiqui took as many pictures of kite-fliers and festivals as he did of crematoriums and riots, but one hails the latter more because it’s disease and sectarian violence that can slip into the bloodstream unchecked if left unrecorded. It’s the fault lines of a nation that need watching so that the songs and the celebrations can go on like ever before. Danish Siddiqui did just that and it makes him a hero of our times.

26 July 2021||July 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Cinema’s Afro-Asia roots||‘I hear the pain in your voice behind those strained threats. The pain of an outcast forever marked by their skin. No matter how skilled in battle or honourable you proved yourself to be. I’ve felt it too.’ These lines, from LeSean Thomas’s Netflix anime series Yasuke , are spoken by a female samurai named Natsumaru (voiced by Ming-na Wen in the English version) as advice to the titular protagonist. The reason why Natsumaru feels there’s solidarity between the two of them is that Yasuke (Lakeith Stanfield) is a rarity: a dark-skinned African samurai, the first of his kind. Yasuke has been loosely based on the real-life historical figure of the same name, an African samurai who serveddaimyo(a Japanese feudal lord) Oda Nobunaga in the 16th century. Released this April, Yasuke infuses several different kinds of genre sensibilities within its samurai origin story — there’s magic, gigantic fighting robots, and a whole lot else in its six episodes. It is also the latest example of Afro-Asian connections, both within Hollywood and across pop culture in general. Take the Wu-Tang Clan, for instance, one of the most famous and critically-acclaimed hip-hop groups of all time. Much of their early work, like their 1993 debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) , used dialogue samples from Hong Kong kung fu films, classics like The 36 th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The Wu-Tang Clan’s fascination with these movies and their tropes wasn’t a straightforward cinephile’s fandom. It was founding member RZA’s genuine affection for these cultures. RZA, of course, later starred in and directed a movie called The Man With the Iron Fists , which was an elaborate tribute to the Hong Kong kung fu movies he had loved as a young man. In several interviews down the years, RZA has spoken about solidarity between Asian-American and African-American communities, how they continually learn from each other. In Jim Jarmusch’s 1999 film Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai , we meet the titular Ghost Dog , a black man who has decided to live his life according to the tenets of the hagakure , the samurai code of conduct. A much older and certainly more famous example is, of course, the smash hit 1974 song ‘Kung Fu Fighting’, written by the British-Indian musician Biddu, and performed by Jamaican singer Carl Douglas. The song itself sought to cash in what was then a newly-minted American obsession: Bruce Lee and the entire Hong Kong martial arts film assembly line. The refrain of this song lends its name to historian Vijay Prashad’s 2001 book Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting . Prashad’s objective was to re-contextualise ‘default’ histories of Asia and Africa in order to underline the superiority of ‘polycultural’ over ‘multicultural’. According to him, ‘multicultural’ implies a kind of static, flat co-existence between minority communities which does not account for exchanges like ‘Kung Fu Fighting’ or Yasuke . Most importantly, Prashad locates the issue as a whole within a Marxist reading of class relations. Towards the end of the book, he writes about Japanese and African-American communities living in solidarity, fighting capitalist oppressors together.  Yasuke , over and above being a whole lot of fun, is also a reminder of these surprising connections across space and time. Hopefully, Netflix will invest in a second season soon, and also greenlight projects with similar ambitions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cinemas-afro-asia-roots/article35531945.ece
26 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ahead of I-Day, MHA orders strict vigilance to prevent drone attack||After a recent drone attack in Jammu and several other instances of drones entering prohibited zones, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) instructed all security agencies to be extra vigilant about such flying objects ahead of Independence Day celebrations. The MHA has ordered stricter adherence to the Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) that was framed to handle threats from Sub-Conventional Aerial Platforms like drones, paragliders, microlight aircraft, hot-air balloons etc. The order details a set of preventive measures to be taken by all district DCPs, precautions while shooting down any Sub-Conventional Aerial Platforms and if the flying object try to land near the rampart of Red Fort. “We have identified the buildings near Red Fort where policemen with long-range weapons will be deployed to shoot down any flying object approaching restricted space,” said a police officer. The SoP mentioned shooting the object if it tries to go near the sensitive area. It reads that if any object approaches the sensitive area, then wave a red flag to draw its attention and indicate it to land at a safe distance away from the vital installation or sensitive area. Shout on the loud hailer to draw its attention and instruct it to land immediately, failing which it will be shot down. The order states that if it does not follow the instructions, and there is no time to seek instructions from superior officers or seek clarification from the Indian Air Force agencies, the security personnel may shoot at it with the intention to de-capacitate the individual/aerial vehicle. In the SoP, DCP of North District — under whose jurisdiction Red Fort falls — may identify building’s rooftops from where the entire aerial view of the district can be seen. Watchers should be deployed on these rooftops. Trained manpower on rooftops around the sensitive locations and on the route of VVIP movements to prevent anybody from taking off from such platforms, read the order. These personnel shall be equipped with wireless sets, binoculars, red flag mounted on a stick and a loud hailer. “Each identified roof-top watcher should be accompanied by well-trained police marksmen equipped with a long-range weapon to bring down the flying object, if required,” it reads. The other district DCPs have been instructed for special patrolling particularly in the rural areas of Delhi, long stretches of lesser-used roads and bridges, large grounds to keep a watch on any such attempts of flying Para Motors. IAF is responsible to identify between ‘friendly’ and ‘unknown’ airborne objects and initiate appropriate ‘tactical action’ to destroy the object, if it is declared ‘hostile’, the SOP reads. It instructs district DCPs to activate human intelligence as it is the most reliable way to prevent such an attack. Beat constables should be trained to deal with such objects when they see it in the air or near vital installations/sensitive areas.

26 July 2021||New Delhi,||Explain how grounds of arrest are conveyed: HC||The Delhi High Court has asked the Director of Enforcement Directorate to explain how the grounds of arrest are informed to an arrested person in terms of the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. Justice Mukta Gupta gave the order while hearing ED’s plea challenging a trial court’s order directing it to supply a copy of the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) to RJD Rajya Sabha MP Amarendra Dhari Singh, arrested in a money laundering case related to an alleged fertiliser scam. The court also issued notice to Mr. Singh on ED’s plea seeking to set aside the trial court’s July 15 order. Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju, appearing for ED, argued that there is no specific power with the trial court to pass directions to the agency to supply the copy of the ECIR. The ASG stated that no prejudice has been caused to Mr. Singh by “non-supply of the ECIR, which is not like an FIR on the basis whereof investigation is started”. The court, however, directed the Director of ED to submit whether the ECIR “is merely a number or records some substantive information therein for the petitioner (ED) to start the investigation thereon prior to filing of the complaint case". The case pertains to an alleged fertiliser scam linked to the IFFCO and India Potash Limited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/explain-how-grounds-of-arrest-are-conveyed-hc/article35531667.ece

While staying the proceedings pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Delhi, initiated by Bank of Maharashtra, a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh said: “In our view, prima facie, it appears that the petitioner [homerbuyer] has been taken for a ride by the builder and it is not the petitioner who has received the loan amount.” “The bank has disbursed the loan amount to the builder, and in these circumstances, it remains to be seen as to whether or not the petitioner is at all liable,” the Bench said. The court’s direction came on a plea by Hridesh Kumar Pathak, who booked a unit in the ‘Shubhkamna City’ project developed by Shubhkamna Buildtech Private Limited in 2016. As per the buyer builder agreement executed in October 2016, the possession of the flat was to be delivered within 45 months, including a grace period of six months, after commencement of construction. Flats not constructed Advocate Anshul Gupta, representing Mr. Pathak, submitted that the homebuyer and the builder entered into and executed a tripartite agreement in January 2017 with Bank of Maharashtra for the sanction of loan amounting to Rs. 32.5 lakh in order to finance the purchase of the flat. The bank has disbursed a total amount of Rs. 27,63,000 towards the builder.

26 July 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi could get up to 5 high-mast Tricolours by Aug. 15||The Delhi government has started implementing the schemes announced under its ‘Deshbhakti budget’ with officials saying up to five high-mast Tricolours will be installed in the city by August 15. The Public Works Department (PWD) has been tasked with the project under which it will install the national flag on 100-feet high poles at 500 locations in the city. The officials said initially they will install high-mast Tricolours at about five locations in as many constituencies as a sample exercise. “To celebrate the country’s 75th Independence Day, we are planning to set up high-mast Tricolours in 4-5 Assembly constituencies including New Delhi and Patparganj. We are hoping to set up these by August 15. In total, the PWD will install 500 such flags across the city,” said a senior PWD official, who wished not to be named.  Rs. 45 crore set aside In March this year, the Delhi government had announced its annual budget themed on patriotism and named ‘Deshbhakti budget’ under which Rs. 45 crore has been set aside to install high-mast Tricolour at 500 locations across the national capital. The officials said that high-mast flags will be set up on the lines of the one at the Connaught Place in such a fashion that at least one is visible at every two-three kilometres. A PWD official said that a tender for the project has also been floated. Another senior PWD official said that initially five assembly constituencies have been identified where these flags are to be installed by August 15. These assembly constituencies include New Delhi, Patparganj, Shakurbasti, Kalkaji and Dwarka. New Delhi is Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s constituency while his Deputy Manish Sisodia is elected from Patparganj. Shakurbasti is represented in the Assembly by PWD minister Satyendar Jain. “The PWD has also been directed to conduct a survey and identify public places, parks, grounds, big commercial buildings complexes, big school premises, residential complexes to install high-mast Tricolours. The deadline of installing 500 Tricolours is yet to be fixed,” an official said.

26 July 2021||New Delhi,||HC to hear petition against Ramdev for ‘spreading misinformation’ amid COVID||The Delhi High Court will hear on Monday a plea by seven doctors’ associations against Yoga guru Ramdev for allegedly spreading misinformation by his statements against allopathy amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The matter will be heard by Justice C. Hari Shankar who had earlier asked the counsel for the associations to place on record the videos pertaining to the alleged misinformation. The associations before court are three Resident Doctors’ Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneshwar, Association of Resident Doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, Union of Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP); Resident Doctors’ Association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut and Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association, Hyderabad. They alleged that Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by COVID-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing deaths of the patients. ‘Sowing doubts’ In their plea, the associations have submitted that the yoga guru was sowing doubts in the minds of general public with respect to the safety and efficacy of not only allopathic treatments but also COVID-19 vaccines. Being a highly influential person, it is apprehended that Ramdev’s statements can influence lakhs of people and divert them from allopathic treatment which are prescribed as the standard form of care even by the government, the plea submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-to-hear-petition-against-ramdev-for-spreading-misinformation-amid-covid/article35531682.ece
