29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Democratic values bind India, U.S., says Blinken||Democratic values and free citizenry bind India and the U.S. together, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said here at the end of talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday. The two sides discussed cooperation on a wide range of issues, including Afghanistan, countering COVID-19, Indo-Pacific strategy and the Quad. During his day-long visit to New Delhi, Mr. Blinken also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, members of civil society and a representative of the Dalai Lama. After meeting Mr. Blinken, who is the third member of the Biden administration to visit India, Mr. Modi said he welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden’s “strong commitment to strengthen the India-U.S. strategic partnership that is anchored in our shared democratic values and is a force for global good”. After the bilateral talks, Mr. Blinken and Mr. Jaishankar told presspersons about their conversation on “shared values” of democratic freedoms. “The relationship between our two countries is so important and so strong because it is a relationship between our democracies. One of the elements that Americans admire most about India is the steadfast commitment of its people to democracy, pluralism, to human rights and fundamental freedoms,” Mr. Blinken replied to a question about whether he had raised a recent “backslide” in India’s human rights record. Mr. Blinken pointed at the free press and independent judiciary as part of the “self-correcting mechanism” that he said could repair challenges to any democracy. Mr. Jaishankar said he had responded to U.S. concerns on the issues with a number of points, making it clear that the “quest” for more perfect democracy applies to both the U.S. and India. He also said the Modi government’s policies “of the last few years” have been done to “right wrongs done historically”, and that while freedoms are important, they should not be “equated with the lack of governance”. In response to international criticism of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the government’s moves on Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the External Affairs Minister has in the past referred to the burden of “accumulated problems” of history, and has defended Internet restrictions as required for maintaining law and order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/democratic-values-free-citizens-bind-india-and-us-says-blinken/article35598193.ece

29 July 2021||Bengaluru,||‘33,344 children in 6-18 age group not going to school’||An ongoing survey of children in the age group of 0-18 years in the State has so far disclosed that 33,344 of them in the 6-18 age group, and 1,26,245 in the 3-6 age group in rural areas are not going to school. In urban areas, excluding Bengaluru city, 8,781 children in the 6-18 years of age are not going to school. The tentative data indicates that around 4,800 children in the 6-18 age group in urban areas and 9,700 children in the same age group in the rural areas never enrolled in schools. Survey progress While around 90% of the door-to-door house survey has been completed in rural areas, 79% households have been surveyed in urban areas using a mobile app, which has a pre-loaded data of households, which transmits collected data to “child survey portal.” The findings were submitted before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda during the hearing of a PIL petition which the court in 2013 had initiated suo motu based on a newspaper report on out-school-children. Senior Advocate K.N. Phanindra, who is the amicus curiae in the case, told the court that the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj and the Urban Development Departments have taken the step to cover children up to 18 years of age in the survey, even though the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012, mandates survey of children only up the age of 14 years. As Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has so far not commenced the survey of children as per the RTE Rules, the amicus curiae urged the court to direct boththe government and the BBMP to conduct the survey of children up to the age of 18 years as was conducted by the RDPR and UDD as the BBMP is contemplating to cover children aged between 6-14 years. Following this plea of amicus curiae, the Bench directed the Additional Chief Secretary (UDD) to direct the BBMP to conduct the survey of children on the lines of survey being conducted by the RDPR Department. Meanwhile, the Court directed the Government to compile the final data of survey based on different age categories as suggested by the amicus curiae.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/33344-children-in-6-18-age-group-not-going-to-school/article35598234.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||No immunity for acts of vandalism: SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that lawmakers cannot indulge in criminal acts on the Parliament or Assembly floors and then take cover behind the right to free speech. The court refused the Kerala government’s plea to withdraw prosecution of top Left Democratic Front (LDF)leaders accused of vandalism and wanton destruction of public property on the Assembly floor during a Budget speech in 2015. “Acts of vandalism cannot be said to be manifestations of freedom of speech and be termed as ‘proceedings’ of the Assembly. It was not the intention of the drafters of the Constitution to extend the interpretation of ‘freedom of speech’ to include criminal acts by placing them under a veil of protest,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah held in a 74-page judgment. Legislators cannot unleash violence, run riot in Parliament or a Legislative Assembly and then claim parliamentary privilege and immunity from criminal prosecution. Parliamentary privileges and immunities are not “gateways” for legislators to claim exception from the law of the land, especially criminal law, Justice Chandrachud, who authored the verdict, observed. ‘Law applies to all’ Boundaries of lawful behaviour apply to all, including MLAs who hold responsible elected office in the Legislative Assembly. No member of an elected legislature can claim either a privilege or an immunity to stand above the sanctions of the criminal law, which applies equally to all citizens. The State government and the accused LDF leaders, including the present Kerala Education Minister V. Sivankutty, who were in the Opposition in 2015, had claimed parliamentary privilege, arguing that the incident occurred inside the Assembly hall. They claimed immunity from criminal prosecution. They argued that the prior sanction of the Speaker was necessary before the registration of an FIR by the police. The court dismissed the need for prior sanction from the Speaker as this was not a case of corruption. The accused MLAs are facing charges of criminal trespass, mischief and destruction of public property. Televised images from the day of the incident show legislators come to blows on the House floor and hurl chairs, computers and other public property soon after Finance Minister K.M. Mani began his budget speech during the UDF government’s tenure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-immunity-for-acts-of-vandalism-in-house-sc/article35598200.ece

29 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||VMC approves new tax regime amid protests by Opposition corporators||The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Wednesday approved the implementation of the new tax regime based on the capital value of the property as per G.O. 198. During the council session convened exclusively to discuss the new tax regime and user charges levied on garbage collection, Municipal Commissioner V. Prasanna Venkatesh explained the new tax calculation methodology adopted by the government in tune with the guidelines of the Centre. ‘Unilateral’ Protesting against the “unilateral decision” of the ruling party, CPI(M) Floor leader B. Satya Babu launched a fast outside the council hall. The TDP and CPI(M) leaders staged a protest outside the VMC office after the session. YSRCP corporators defended the government’s decision to implement the new tax regime. “The Centre has mandated it for sanction of the 15th Finance Commission funds,” said B. Punyaseela. TDP Floor leader N. Balaswamy and Mr. Satya Babu told the council that their parties opposed the new tax regime as it would burden the people. They demanded that the governing body members belonging to the YSRCP stand by the people. “They should pass a resolution opposing the G.O. and send a message to the government,” they demanded. TDP corporator K. Swetha said the tax systems similar to the one proposed that had been implemented in a few places such as Mumbai had failed to achieve the desired purpose due to various reasons. Why should the government accept a system that would burden the people, she questioned. In response, Ms. Punyaseela said the TDP government too had implemented schemes such as AMRUT that were mandated by the Centre for the release of funds. “The new tax regime will not affect the poorer sections, and such a system is necessary for self-sustainability of the corporation and development of the city,” she added. Transparent, says Mayor Mayor R. Bhagya Lakshmi said under the new system, the tax on properties having less than 375 sft area would be only Rs. 50 per year. “It is a transparent system,” she added. Tax will be calculated based on the capital value of the property. Until now, property tax is calculated based on the rental value. The tax levied will differ based on the classification of the building, zone of location, usage, age of building and plinth area. The increase will not be more than 15% of the existing tax, it is said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vmc-approves-new-tax-regime-amid-protests-by-opposition-corporators/article35598824.ece
29 July 2021||Kochi,||HC stays cancellation of KTU offline exams||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday permitted A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) to go ahead with the first and third semester examinations of BTech courses in offline mode. The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali passed the order while staying a single judge verdict cancelling the ongoing offline examinations. The Bench’s order came on an appeal filed by the KTU against the single judge’s verdict. The single judge verdict came on a writ petition filed by eight students challenging the holding of examinations in physical mode in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases in the State. According to the petitioners, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had ordered that only final year semester exams need be conducted offline and other semester exams should be conducted online only. The single judge had held that the entire exercise of holding the offline exams was in violation of the UGC guidelines. The number of COVID-19 cases was not static and cases were increasing day by day despite seriously following the pandemic protocol. The single judge had also observed that there was no mechanism to avoid gatherings before and after the exams, which would pose a serious health issue. The conduct of offline/physical exams would entail a huge risk of transmission of the virus. When the appeal came up for hearing, P.J. Elvin Peter, counsel for the university, submitted that the UGC guidelines could not be made strictly applicable to technical institutions/universities. They were applicable only to the courses in arts and science colleges. Besides, the guidelines were not mandatory but were only recommendatory in nature. The All India Council for Technical Education had not issued any guidelines till date regarding the mode of exams to be held for technical courses. The appeal pointed out that a large number of students had already appeared and prepared for the exams. The prospects of a large number of students could not be put at stake at the hands of eight students who had already appeared in the physical mode exams held earlier. The single judge’s judgment setting aside all exams conducted by the university and also directing the university to conduct further exams in the online mode would jeopardise the interest of the students, who were waiting to appear for the exams and complete the courses. As scheduled In the wake of the court order, the university has decided to conduct the exams in accordance with the schedule from Thursday onwards. The revised date of the exams postponed on Wednesday will be announced later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-stays-cancellation-of-ktu-offline-exams/article35598592.ece
29 July 2021||Vijayawada,||VSP sale is well thought of, Centre tells HC||The Centre, in its affidavit on privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), has informed the Andhra Pradesh High Court that it is not a strategic enterprise, as the iron and steel sector has not been classified as “strategic” under the New Public Sector Enterprise Policy for the Atmanirbhar Bharat, and that the employees’ rights are not fundamental and not constitutionally mandated as such. The policy provided for privatisation of the Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) in the non-strategic sectors, wherever feasible, and closure of others, the affidavit said. Employees’ interests The decision to privatise the VSP was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on January 27, 2021, keeping the larger public good in view, and it included the protection of interests of the employees and other stakeholders, the Centre said. The affidavit was submitted by Assistant Solicitor General N. Harinath on behalf of Rajesh Kumar Singh, Under-Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), in response to a petition filed by V.V. Lakshminarayana, former Joint Director of the CBI. The affidavit said the definitive agreements pertaining to disinvestment of a CPSE provide an obligation on the new shareholder to not retrench, or terminate employees without cause, and to not reduce their benefits. The Centre said the process of disinvestment was a policy decision involving complex economic factors, and the matter was neither in the domain of courts, nor was there any scope for judicial review. The in-principle approval of 100% disinvestment of VSP was a well-considered plan, which was thoroughly deliberated, and the CCEA was assisted by highly qualified bureaucrats who knew the intricacies thereof, the affidavit said. The decision was taken on the basis of the recommendations of NITI Aayog, which studied the strategic sectors and the units to be considered for privatisation, merger, or conversion into subsidiaries of other PSEs, or their closure. As held by the Supreme Court, such decisions cannot be struck down on the ground of availability of other options, the Centre observed, insisting that the PIL was a part of the petitioner’s political agenda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vsp-privatisation-well-considered-centre/article35598005.ece

For long we have endured the ‘ achhe din ’ (the BJP slogan),” said Ms. Banerjee, who is on a five-day visit to the national capital. “It is going to be Narendra Modi versus the nation,” she added. Ms. Banerjee said, “ Khela hobe (the game is on, the Trinamool Congress slogan for the West Bengal election) will ring through the nation.” “What happened in 1977? Indira Gandhi was voted out. Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost his popularity within a year. There are many such precedents in our democracy.” “If you [the Opposition] are serious, all you need is six months,” she added. Ms. Banerjee evaded questions on the contours of such a unified Opposition and who would lead it. “I am not a political astrologer. It depends on the situation. I have no problem if someone else leads,” she said. Ms. Banerjee met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi at the latter’s residence in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/united-opposition-can-make-a-difference-in-6-months-mamata/article35598202.ece
29 July 2021||MANGALURU,||Residents can connect sewer lines to drainage network||After waiting for over five years, residents in Padil area in the city will be able to officially connect their sewer lines to the underground drainage network of Mangaluru City Corporation next month as the Padil wet well has been revamped and the network issues have been addressed, according to Mayor Premananda Shetty. The Padil wet well, which pumps sewage to the 20 MLD (million litres a day) processing capacity sewage treatment plant (STP) at Bajal, had remained defunct due to non-maintenance after the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) handed it over to the civic body in 2015. The pumps at the wet well have been repaired. The KUIDFC authorities have cleaned the manholes and have conducted flow test. The missing link on the trunk line near the railway underpass near Mangaluru Junction is through and has been connected. The civic body will issue a notification in a few days asking people to connect their sewer lines to manholes, Mr. Shetty told The Hindu . A KUIDFC official said that Padil wet well pumps sewage till Mangaluru Junction Railway Station. Later, it flows to the wet well at Kadekar through gravity in the underground network via Yekkur. The Kadekar wet well then pumps it to the Bajal STP. Once the corporation issues the notification, residents in about a 5-km radius of the Padil wet well can link their sewer lines to the underground drainage network, he said. However, some people have already unofficially linked their sewer lines to the network. Soon after after taking charge in early March, the Mayor reviewed the maintenance of underground drainage network and associated facilities built by the KUIDFC under the loan availed of from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the corporation. The Rs. 220-crore project was taken up under the Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environment Management Project (KUDCEMP). The Mayor who inspected it in late March noticed the poorly maintained Bajal STP and four wet wells connected to it at Padil, Faisalnagar, Jalligudda and Kadekar. Later, he had asked both the corporation and the KUIDFC to address the maintenance and pumpset repair issues jointly and revamp the facilities to put them into use. The KUIDFC official said that it would take another three months to repair the pumps at Faisalnagar and Jalligudda wet wells. Both the wet wells have been re-connected with power supply now, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/residents-can-connect-sewer-lines-to-drainage-network/article35598687.ece

The Chief Secretaries and the Directors-General of Police of both States attended the meeting, which went on for more than two hours. “Both the State governments agreed for deployment of a neutral force under a senior CAPF officer,” a Union Home Ministry official said, adding that they also agreed to continue mutual discussions to resolve the border issue in an amicable manner. Earlier, the Mizoram government requested the Ministry for directions to Assam to remove the road and rail blockades for resumption of flow of essential commodities and movement of people of the State. In a letter to Mr. Bhalla, the State government said National Highway 306 and other roads connecting Mizoram with other parts of the country from Assam had been blocked from Monday. “The blockade is affecting the livelihood of the people of Mizoram adversely. Movement of vehicles along other routes connecting Mizoram and Assam have also been blocked inside Assam,” it said. “...the State sponsored economic blockade was earlier imposed by Assam for a long period lasting from October 17, 2020, to November 11, 2020. That blockade had seriously affected the livelihood of the people of Mizoram, resulting in various hardships,” said the letter.The State government expressed concern that “Assam has been indulging in the practice of imposing economic blockade merely because of the fact the main supply routes i.e., national highways and railway lines are passing through the State. Incidents like this have occurred numerous times in the past in connection with other incidents.” “It is also reported that unknown miscreants from Assam have destroyed/removed railway tracks/lines at Mohammedpur railway station and Ramnathpur railway station in Hailakandi district, Assam. With this destruction, the only railway line connecting Bairabi Railway Station, Mizoram, has been blocked. This has the effect of blocking the only alternative route for entry of goods and supplies into the State,” the letter stated, seeking the Centre’s immediate attention in the matter. National Highways and railway lines were owned by the Central government and no State agency/entity or the general public had any right to block them, Mizoram pointed out and sought the Centre’s immediate intervention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mizoram-and-assam-to-solve-row-amicably/article35598241.ece

29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Great challenges for all democracies’||Inter-religious relations, media freedom, farmers’ protests, love ‘jihad’ violence and minority rights were part of the discussion that visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had with a group of people, including a representative of the Dalai Lama, here on Wednesday. The “civil society round-table” discussion, which is expected to raise some concerns from the Union government and a possible protest from China, was Mr. Blinken’s first engagement during his day-long visit to India. Sources said Tibet was not directly raised during the meeting, but the lack of progress in China’s dialogue on the issue was discussed at the round-table talks, which included Geshe Dorji Damdul, the Delhi-based Director of Tibet House. Mr. Blinken also met Ngodup Dongchung, Director of the Bureau of the Dalai Lama, in Delhi separately on Wednesday morning. While representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Authority, or “government in exile”, have met with U.S. diplomats in the past, the presence of Mr. Damdul in the meeting with Indian civil society and with the U.S. Secretary of State in Delhi is a first.  In his opening remarks, Mr. Blinken spoke of the “great challenges” for all democracies in the world, particularly India and the U.S., where Congress has been holding committee hearings on the January 6 attack on the Capitol House by pro-Trump protesters. Mr. Blinken said the India-U.S. relationship was one of the “most important” in the world, whose people were “connected by shared values”. “The Indian people and the American people believe in human dignity and equality of opportunity, the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief,” Mr. Blinken said in remarks released to the media. “We believe that all people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect no matter who they are,” he added. The Union government’s response to recent protests was part of the discussion that followed. A photograph of the meeting tweeted shortly after showed constitutional lawyer Menaka Guruswamy, Inter-Faith Foundation founder Khwaja Iftikhar Ahmed and representatives of the Ramakrishna Mission as well as Baha’i, Sikh and Christian NGOs present at the meeting with Mr. Blinken and U.S. Charge d’Affaires Atul Keshap. During the 45-minute discussion, Mr. Blinken received perspectives from the representatives on the status of religious freedom, including the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the anti-conversion (derogatorily referred to as love ‘jihad’) laws passed by some States, which have drawn international criticism. In addition, the problems of farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders over the agriculture laws passed last year were part of the conversation, sources told The Hindu . “India is passing through an ideologically transitional phase, and it is time for a closer engagement between those who hold secularism and those who hold Hindutva close to their hearts,” said Dr. Ahmed, when asked about the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/great-challenges-for-all-democracies/article35597982.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Seroprevalence in Kerala only 44%, says ICMR||Madhya Pradesh has the highest seroprevalance, or the presence of antibodies to the novel coronavirus, and Kerala the lowest among 21 States studied, according to the fourth national serology survey of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Though headline results of the survey were published last week, the State-wise approximate prevalence was issued on Wednesday. Kerala, which is recording the sharpest rise in cases in the country fuelled by the Delta variant, had a seroprevalence of only 44% implying 56% lacked antibodies and consequently remained vulnerable to the infection. The antibody levels reported State-wise as part of the ICMR survey did not distinguish between those in response to a natural infection or through vaccination. Madhya Pradesh has a seroprevalence of 79%, followed by Rajasthan (76%) and Bihar (75%). After Kerala, the least antibody prevalence was in Assam (50%) and Maharashtra (58%). ‘Partial picture’ An ICMR official said State seroprevalence gives a “partial” picture of how they are affected. “The extrapolation was based on 70 districts in 21 States, which were part of three previous rounds of the serosurvey. The districts were chosen based on population and so some States have more places represented,” said Samiran Panda, who was involved with the survey and who heads the epidemiology division at the ICMR. “The ELISA test used to check antibodies also has a role in marking antibody prevalence. This also suggests that States that may have managed the infection better in the first and second wave, and protecting a large fraction from infection, must also target rapid vaccination to protect the remaining vulnerable,” he said. The Centre on Wednesday advised all States and Union Territories to conduct the surveys in consultation with the ICMR to generate district-level data which was critical to formulating localised public health response measures, according to a letter by Rajesh Bhushan, Health Secretary, on Wednesday. The fourth National Sero-Prevalence Survey done by the ICMR said such studies should follow a standardised protocol. The same survey also showed that antibodies could be detected in over 88% of those vaccinated with at least one dose, though State-wise reports are not yet available as the survey is yet to be formally published in a scientific journal. Antibodies in children The survey also noted that more than half of the children (six to 17 years) were seropositive and seroprevalence was similar in rural and urban areas. It was also found that 85% of healthcare workers (HCWs) had antibodies and nearly one-10th was unvaccinated. “The national sero-survey by ICMR was designed to capture the extent of the spread of COVID infection at the national level. Therefore, the results do not reflect the heterogeneity of sero-prevalence between districts and even between States,” the Health Ministry said in an accompanying statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/seroprevalence-in-kerala-only-44-says-icmr/article35597995.ece

29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Parliament passes Bills amid din||Both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday cleared important Bills without debate amid continuing protests by Opposition members on the Pegasus snooping issue and the three contentious farm laws, against which farmers’ groups have been protesting for months. The Lok Sabha, which witnessed unruly behaviour in the form of tearing of papers and throwing them towards the Speaker’s Chair and the Treasury benches, saw the passage of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2021, as well as the first batch of the Supplementary Demand for Grants and the Appropriations Bill, numbers 3 and 4, without debate and by a voice vote. Though Speaker Om Birla managed to hold Question Hour amid the din, the first time in the current session, as soon as BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal replaced him in the Chair, the protests got louder and Opposition members such as Gurjeet Aujla, T.N. Prathapan and Hibi Eden from the Congress as well as some others tore up papers and threw them in the air. The Treasury benches demanded action against the MPs, including Mr. Aujla, Mr. Prathapan, Manickam Tagore, Jothimani Sennimalai and others of the Congress, for disrespecting the Chair. Sources told The Hindu that Mr. Birla spoke to the Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, on the issue. Mr. Chowdhury is learnt to have replied that the Opposition had specific issues and demands, and the protests were for those demands. Mr. Birla is learnt to have individually met the MPs concerned, but no action has been decided upon. The House was adjourned several times before legislative business was conducted amid the din and then adjourned for the day. In the Rajya Sabha, too, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021, was passed without debate and the House adjourned for the day before 3 p.m. Protests in the House, again on the Pegasus issue and the farm laws, continued even as Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani explained the proposed amendments. While the Bill was passed, the House was adjourned multiple times. Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu urged members to stop waving placards, but to no avail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parliament-passes-bills-amid-din/article35597980.ece

To a question by Biju Janata Dal MP Amar Patnaik, Minister of State for Labour and Employment Rameswar Teli’s written reply said the number of active job-seekers registered with the National Career Service portal had increased from 1.03 crore in 2019-2020 to 1.04 crore in 2020-2021. “Notifying final hiring figures is not a mandatory requirement on the NCS portal. However, till July 18, 2021, 86.13 lakh vacancies have been mobilised on NCS since the launch of the portal on July 20, 2015, including the vacancies in public and private sector,” the reply said. U.P. in the lead The data showed that of the 31,727 candidates given final offer letters in 2020-2021, 28,227 were from Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, about half the offers given in 2019-2020 came from U.P. (41,603). In 2018-2019, 72,539 job offers were handed out through the fairs, of which 31,077 were in Gujarat. To a question by BJP MP Vikas Mahatme on bonded labour issues during the pandemic, the Ministry said there had been no real change. “From the reports available from the State governments, no discernible change in the prevalence of bonded labour due to the pandemic is observed. However, keeping in view the challenges posed by the successive waves of the pandemic, all State/UT governments have been directed to prepare a State Action Plan for preventing and rehabilitating victims of bonded labour and labour trafficking.” Victims rescued However, to a question by BJP MP Neeraj Shekhar, Mr. Teli provided data on the number of bonded labourers released and rehabilitated, which showed an increase from 320 in 2020-2021 to 1,174 in 2021-2022 so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-job-fairs-see-drop-in-offers/article35597984.ece

A discussion on data security and privacy would have entailed questions on the alleged Pegasus cyberattack.

The BJP, he said, wanted to expunge Pegasus from any debate, scrutiny or enquiry. “What are they so afraid of?” Sources said that right at the very beginning, the BJP members started protesting. They accused Mr. Tharoor of running the “Congress agenda” and not discussing the subject of meetings with the members before finalising it. This led to a sharp exchange of words between the Opposition and BJP members. BJP’s Nishikant Dubey complained that TMC’s Mahua Moitra called him “Bihari goonda”, or hoodlum.

29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM to roll out academic credit bank||On the first anniversary of the National Education Policy (NEP) on Thursday, the Centre plans to officially roll out some initiatives promised in the policy, such as a credit transfer system that will allow multiple entry and exit options in higher education, as well as engineering programmes in regional languages. However, other promised reforms such as the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), the four-year undergraduate degree, and the common university entrance test, are not ready yet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address policy makers as well as students and teachers in a video-conference event on Thursday to mark the anniversary, according to an Education Ministry statement. The initiatives he is expected to announce will improve the government’s report card on the policy’s implementation, which has also been slowed by COVID-19 disruptions. The Academic Bank of Credit will be rolled out on Thursday for students in over 290 top institutions from the current academic year 2021-22 onwards. All institutions in the top 100 of the National Institutional Ranking Framework as well as those who have achieved an A grade under the National Assessment and Accreditation Council will be allowed to participate in the credit transfer system, which will also allow multiple entry and exit options for students, according to senior Education Ministry officials. However, the proposal for four-year undergraduate degrees has run into some opposition, especially from faculty at the premier University of Delhi, and will also have to wait for the National Higher Education Curricular Framework, which is still being prepared, they said. A mix of subjects Multidisciplinarity is also being encouraged with guidelines to be issued on Thursday to allow the merger of institutes as well as to give students the choice of taking subjects such as social sciences, music and sports while getting engineering degrees, or even get a minor degree in emerging areas while majoring in a different subject. Although premier institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology have balked at the idea of introducing courses in Indian languages, Mr. Modi will announce the launch of engineering degrees in regional languages in about 14 smaller institutions. He will also announce the establishment of the National Digital Education Architecture and National Education Technology Forum. “On the positive side, COVID has led to a vast increase in online education. Although it was envisaged in the NEP, no one thought digital education would pick up so quickly. On the other hand, there are of course some constraints [in NEP implementation] because there has been little physical interaction for over a year,” said Higher Education Secretary Amit Khare, commenting on the pandemic’s impact. He noted that while the government has made all preparations to roll out a common entrance test for all Central Universities, as promised under the NEP, it was postponed in order not to put students under further stress given all the other COVID-19 disruptions they have already faced this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-to-roll-out-academic-credit-bank/article35597966.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Blinken’s comments on ‘shared values’ rile China||American Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasising the “shared values” of India and the United States as two democracies, during his visit to India on Wednesday, brought a sharp response from Beijing. Mr. Blinken, at his meeting with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, said: “There is greater imperative than ever on cooperation, coordination, collaboration among countries, especially among countries who share basic perspectives, basic values, and basic interests. “And that is certainly the case with the United States and India,” he said. A question from an American media outlet during a daily press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, about Mr. Blinken speaking of two of the world’s democracies standing in support of shared ideals at the time of a rising global threat to democracy even if he did not directly name China, brought a long and sharp response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “I want to stress that democracy is a common value shared by all, not a patent owned by any country,” said Mr. Zhao. “To achieve democracy, there are various ways rather than a fixed formula or a standard answer. ‘One-man, one-vote’ and a multi-party system is not the sole form of democracy. Democracy should not be used as a label or tool to belittle or smear other countries or stoke confrontations. Which country is a democracy and which an autocracy should not be determined by a very small number of countries. Debasing others while elevating oneself in itself is not democratic at all.” “Some self-proclaimed democracies are deeply troubled at home by wealth disparity, social division, racial divide and political polarisation,” he said, referring to themes often mentioned in the Chinese official media’s critical coverage of the U.S. “In some countries, it is ‘no money, no vote’ and partisan interests above public interests. Is that democratic politics or money politics? Some countries blatantly meddle in other countries’ domestic affairs, shift blames and suppress and contain other countries’ development.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/blinkens-comments-on-shared-values-rile-china/article35597977.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. studying evidence on vaccine booster doses||Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Bharati Pravin Pawar has stated that the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID (NEGVAC) are deliberating and considering scientific evidence related to booster doses. “So far, no specific recommendation regarding COVID-19 vaccine booster dose has been made by NTAGI or NEGVAC. There are at present no recommendations on booster dose from the World Health Organization,” she said in the Rajya Sabha earlier this week. The vaccines have been developed very recently and, therefore, scientific evidence was still evolving globally on the duration of protection. Dr. Pawar said that the current isolation, quarantine, treatment, and other public health measures remained valid in case of reinfection too. The currently available information on COVID-19 was not adequate enough to tell the difference between persistent virus shedding and reinfection, and testing positive more than once does not necessarily indicate reinfection, the Health Ministry said in response to a question. Dr. Pawar noted that there were cases of reinfection. She pointed out that studies on SARS-CoV-2 reinfection had been published in the journal of Epidemiology and Infection . “The study has concluded that while COVID-19 reinfection is still rarely reported, nonetheless, immunity should not be assumed and public health measures such as physical distancing, hand hygiene and use of masks should be followed after recovery from the first event of infection,” she asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-studying-evidence-on-vaccine-booster-doses/article35597992.ece
29 July 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Asthana’s ascent to Delhi Police chief||Just four days before his superannuation (July 31), the Union government on Tuesday gave a plum assignment to Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Police Commissioner of New Delhi, with a year’s extension in service. On July 27, the 1984-batch officer was also granted deputation from the Gujarat cadre to the Union Territory cadre to enable him to head the Delhi police force that reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Mr. Asthana was knocked out of the race to be CBI Director when the Chief Justice of India (CJI), in a high-power committee meeting with the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, cited six months’ residual service for those to be considered for the post. The CJI’s insistence on the Supreme Court-laid rule of six months’ remainder service rendered Mr. Asthana and another top contender, Y.C. Modi, ineligible to head the country’s most high-profile agency that investigates graft and political cases. Mr. Asthana has had fairly long stints with the CBI at different levels, including as its officiating director for a few months and then as special director in 2018, when he was unceremoniously removed after a major fight with then CBI Director Alok Verma when the agency hit the headlines for its internal war that divided the top agency into two camps. Obstacle course Both Mr. Verma and Mr. Asthana were shunted out overnight as the government acted on the order of the Chief Vigilance Commissioner after Mr. Verma booked Mr. Asthana in an alleged bribery case, in which he was cleared later. Subsequently, Mr. Asthana was made Director-General of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. In August 2020, he was appointed Director-General of the Border Security Force (BSF). As BSF chief, he also had additional charge as Director General of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which cracked down on Bollywood personalities for alleged use of drugs after the suicide of Sushant Singh Rajput. Prior to his Central deputation, Mr. Asthana held prime posts in Gujarat, including as Police Commissioner of Vadodara and Surat, and also headed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed the Godhra train burning case. It was his investigation in the Godhra case that earned him proximity to the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi, whose trust Mr. Asthana enjoys even today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/asthanas-ascent-to-delhi-police-chief/article35598000.ece
29 July 2021||New Delhi,||Not going anywhere until Pegasus is discussed: Rahul||Asserting that the allegations of snooping using the Pegasus spyware were not about privacy but an “anti-national act and treason”, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said “a united Opposition was not going anywhere” until the government agreed to discuss the issue in Parliament. The Opposition hardened its stance after leaders of 14 parties met at the office of the Rajya Sabha’s Leader of the Opposition, Mallikarjun Kharge, in the morning to discuss a joint strategy against the Narendra Modi government. Mr. Gandhi was among those who attended the meeting. Several of them, in a calibrated manner, had demanded an adjournment motion to discuss the snooping issue after suspending regular business. “The Opposition is united for a discussion on the Pegasus issue... We are not going anywhere till it is discussed in Parliament,” Mr. Gandhi said in a joint Opposition press conference. The Opposition’s aggressive stance also came after what Mr. Gandhi claimed was “the government’s refusal to have any discussion on the issue in Parliament”. “Has the Government of India bought Pegasus?... Did the government use the Pegasus weapon on its own people?” he asked. Rejecting the government’s allegations that the Opposition was disrupting Parliament, Mr. Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of “attacking the soul of India’s democracy”. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP T.R. Baalu said the government had given an impression that the Opposition parties were against holding discussions in Parliament. “It’s not so. We wanted a discussion from day one. We are giving notices every day, but the government is not coming forward for a discussion... Democracy is in peril,” he said. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut said the Opposition was united over the farm laws and Pegasus spyware, and accused the government of “backstabbing and attacking with this weapon”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/not-going-anywhere-until-pegasus-is-discussed-rahul/article35597981.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI switches to Telugu to ensure peace between couple||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Wednesday switched to his mother tongue Telugu to pave the way for peace between a couple locked in a 20-year-old case. Supreme Court judges usually resort to Hindi when they learn that litigants, mostly petitioners-in-person, are unable to speak or understand English. An interaction in a regional language between the Bench and a litigant has rarely been witnessed in the apex court. Wednesday saw the Bench of Chief Justice Ramana and Justice Surya Kant make an effort to ensure that language barriers do not come in the way of access to justice in a country known for its linguistic diversity. Recent times have seen the Supreme Court translate its judgments from English to various regional languages. The objective is to help litigants and the public read the verdicts themselves and fully understand the law. Events began to unfold in the virtual court hearing when the Bench noticed that the woman litigant, hailing from Andhra Pradesh, was finding it difficult to express herself freely in English. On enquiring about it, the woman told the Bench that she was neither fluent in English nor Hindi. The Chief Justice consulted Justice Kant about interacting with the litigant in Telugu. The CJI said he would translate for Justice Kant, who readily agreed. The case concerned a harassment complaint filed by the woman against her husband under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code in 2001. The trial court had convicted the man and sentenced him to undergo one year of imprisonment and Rs. 1,000 in fine. The High Court confirmed the conviction, but reduced his prison sentence to the period already undergone. The woman had approached the apex court against the reduction in sentence. The court referred the case for mediation in Hyderabad in 2012, but the efforts for reaching a settlement had failed. On Wednesday, the interaction with the CJI saw both sides agree to work towards an amicable settlement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cji-switches-to-telugu-to-ensure-peace-between-couple/article35597954.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Terrorism is the most serious threat to global peace: Rajnath||Stating that the geo-strategic location of India makes it both a Eurasian land power as well as a stakeholder in the Indo-Pacific, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday termed terrorism the most serious threat to international peace and security, while also cautioning against non-traditional security threats against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Any act of terror and support to such acts, including cross-border terrorism, committed by whomsoever, wherever and for whatever motives, is a crime against humanity,” Mr. Singh said addressing the Defence Ministers’ meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) at Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Through 1990s and later, Tajik people made great sacrifices to defeat fundamentalism within its territory and to uphold peace and stability in the region, Mr. Singh said. It must be recognised that “without those sacrifices and without constructive efforts by Central Asian Republics with support from the Russian Federation, situation here could have been very different... Such recognition is all the more important, as instability and violent extremism threaten us all over again in the region.” The pandemic had affected nations, civil societies and citizens in multiple ways, Mr. Singh said. This was a warning sign of how non-traditional security challenges like pandemics, climate change, food security, water security and associated societal disruptions could impact national and international landscape. “Non-traditional threats and a new technology have combined to form a whole new spectrum of sub-conventional security issues,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/terrorism-is-the-most-serious-threat-rajnath/article35597963.ece
29 July 2021||New Delhi,||COVID-19 guidelines extended to August 31||The Union Home Ministry on Wednesday extended the implementation of guidelines for the management of COVID-19, in accordance with the Health Ministry’s order dated June 28, up to August 31. The States and the Union Territories have been asked to strictly enforce the norms in view of the upcoming festivals. Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, in a letter to the States and the Union Territories, said there should be continuous focus on the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour. Strict directions should be issued to the districts and all other local authorities concerned to take necessary measures. The officers concerned should be made personally responsible for any laxity in strict enforcement, Mr. Bhalla said. Stating that there was no room for complacency, the Home Secretary said the process of relaxing restrictions should be carefully calibrated. The reproduction number of the virus was hovering “just below one” but was high in some States. Strictest possible measures should be taken in the districts showing high positivity rates, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-guidelines-extended-to-august-31/article35597985.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Democratic values bind U.S. and India: Blinken||Mr. Jaishankar said he had responded to the U.S. concerns on the issues with a number of points, making it clear that the “quest” for a more perfect democracy applied to both the U.S. and India. He said the Modi government’s policies “of the last few years” had been done to “right wrongs done historically”, and that while freedoms are important, they should not be “equated with the lack of governance”. In response to international criticism of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the government’s moves on Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the External Affairs Minister has in the past referred to the burden of “accumulated problems” of history, and has defended Internet restrictions as required for maintaining law and order. On Afghanistan, Mr. Blinken and Mr. Jaishankar agreed that there was no “military solution” to the conflict, and that taking over the country by force would not help the Taliban gain the “international recognition” or “legitimacy” it desires, including the lifting of sanctions and travel bans against the Taliban leadership. In a reference to Pakistan, Mr. Jaishankar said one neighbour of Afghanistan was an “exception” to the consensus for a peaceful political settlement. Ahead of the talks, MEA sources had said India would raise the need for “sustained pressure” on Pakistan on terror financing and safe havens. An Afghanistan that did not respect the rights of its people, and an Afghanistan that committed atrocities against its own people would not be part of the global community, Mr. Blinken said. Both the dignitaries also highlighted cooperation in the Indo-Pacific as part of the ‘Quad’ with Japan and Australia, which Mr. Blinken said was “not a military alliance” at all. The two sides also spoke about the Quad’s initiative to provide Indian-made vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region. Mr. Blinken announced a $25-million grant for India’s vaccine programme, and promised to strengthen vaccine supply chains to enhance production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/democratic-values-bind-us-and-india-blinken/article35597955.ece

And flash floods triggered by incessant rain in the past 24 hours damaged civilian property and government infrastructure in parts of J&K and Ladakh. “Seven bodies have been recovered from Honsar village in Dacchan tehsil so far. A total of 17 people were rescued. Of which, five were critically injured. A rescue operation is on,” Inspector General of Police Mukesh Singh told The Hindu . Initial reports suggested that 19 residential houses and 21 cowsheds were damaged by flash floods triggered by the cloudburst that took place in the intervening night of July 27-28. For many hours, rescue teams could not reach the village due to the weather. The district administration, accompanied by the members of the State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF), and the police rushed multiple teams to the area to rescue around 35 missing locals, including members of the Bakerwal community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/7-killed-5-injured-as-flash-floods-hit-jk-ladakh/article35597968.ece

Movement of vehicles along other routes connecting Mizoram and Assam have also been blocked inside Assam,” it said. “...the State-sponsored economic blockade was earlier imposed by Assam for a long period lasting from October 17, 2020, to November 11, 2020. That blockade had seriously affected the livelihood of the people of Mizoram, resulting in various hardships,” said the letter. The State expressed concern that “Assam has been indulging in the practice of imposing economic blockade merely because of the fact the main supply routes are passing through the State. ”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mizoram-and-assam-to-solve-row-amicably/article35598189.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||No immunity for acts of vandalism in House: SC||The court explained that the purpose of bestowing privileges and immunities to elected members of the legislature was to enable them to perform their “essential functions” without hindrance, fear or favour. The ‘essential’ function of the House is collective deliberation and decision-making. “These privileges bear a functional relationship to the discharge of the functions of a legislator. They are not a mark of status which makes legislators stand on an unequal pedestal,” the court observed. The Constitution only grants the members the freedom of speech that is necessary for their active participation in meaningful deliberation without any fear of prosecution. Focusing solely on the right to free speech, privileges and immunities of legislators without paying attention to their duties is like “missing the wood for the trees,” Justice Chandrachud said. The judgment referred to the “growing recognition and consensus” in the Parliament and the Supreme Court for zero tolerance towards destruction of public and private property in the name of protests. “Incidentally, the Kerala Legislative Assembly also enacted the Kerala Prevention of Damage to Private Property and Payment of Compensation Act 2019 to complement the Central legislation, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act 1984, with a special focus on private property,” Justice Chandrachud addressed the Kerala government in his judgment. The court held that withdrawal of prosecution in a case in which chargesheet has already been filed and cognisance taken by the trial court would amount to an “interference with the normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons.” The top court upheld the decision of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, to decline the Public Prosecutor’s application to withdraw the criminal case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-immunity-for-acts-of-vandalism-in-house-sc/article35597972.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||United Oppn. can make a difference: Mamata||Ms. Banerjee said, “Khela hobe (the game is on, the Trinamool Congress slogan for the West Bengal election) will ring through the nation.” “What happened in 1977? Indira Gandhi was voted out. Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost his popularity within a year. There are many such precedents in our democracy.” “If you [the Opposition] are serious, all you need is six months,” she added. Ms. Banerjee evaded questions on the contours of such a unified Opposition and who would lead it. “I am not a political astrologer. It depends on the situation. I have no problem if someone else leads,” she said. Ms. Banerjee met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi at the latter’s residence in the evening. She asserted that talks should begin after the monsoon session of Parliament. She refused to answer questions on the role the Congress would play in a unified Opposition. “Congress president Sonia Gandhi too wants to have an united Opposition,” Ms. Banerjee said. So far, Naveen Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal and Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSR Congress have maintained a distance from the Opposition bloc in Parliament. On whether talks were on to bring them on board, Ms. Banerjee said, “I maintain good relations with both Mr. Patnaik and Mr. Reddy. Today, they may not be with us but who can say that this will not change tomorrow.” “When a political storm blows, it’s very difficult to contain,” she added. Ms. Banerjee dodged questions on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who returned to the National Democratic Alliance in 2017, and the Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, saying it was a question for them to answer. “If the Opposition parties in U.P. want to stop the BJP, then they will have to work together,” she said. “I want to help all regional and national parties bell the cat,” Ms. Banerjee added, in an apparent reference to the BJP. “If the leaders come together, workers too shall unite.” Quoting the example of Uttar Pradesh, which will go to the polls early next year, she asked if people could forget the visuals of bodies floating in the Ganga, or instances when “family members of COVID-19 victims had to run around for cremation”. “Those who couldn’t give a proper funeral to their loved ones, can they vote for Modi? They may have been his supporters yesterday, but will they remain his supporters today?” she said.  She refused to reply to questions over speculation that her political strategist Prashant Kishor was joining the Congress, saying he was capable of fielding such questions himself. “He [Mr. Kishor] has freedom of choice to decide where to go and where to work,” Ms. Banerjee said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/united-oppn-can-make-a-difference-mamata/article35597973.ece

Ramani issued a bulletin on Wednesday, saying that as the resignation of Congress MLA Govindas Konthoujam has been accepted, the Bishnupur constituency is vacant. There are 60 seats in the Assembly. The other vacant seats in the Assembly are Andro, Lamalai, Naoriya Pakhanglakpa, Kumbi, Tamenglong, Henglep and Bishnupur. In the case of Wangkhei, the Supreme Court has ordered that Y. Erabot is the MLA. Okram Henry, who had been the MLA in this constituency had resigned to become a Minister in the BJP-led coalition government. However, as no election was held within the mandatory six months, he was unseated. Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee interim president N. Loken said, “I have been trying all these days to talk with Mr. Konthoujam over the phone since his whereabouts are not known. But all the three phones are switched off. He had stated that he was resigning for personal reasons”. Referring to social media reports that about seven Congress MLAs may follow Mr. Konthoujam, he stated that they had no basis. Speculations are that there may be a reshuffle of the Ministry to accommodate some of those who had resigned from the Congress. Besides, the Supreme Court is likely to declare its verdict on August 3 when the hearing on the 12 parliamentary secretary cases resume.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-mla-quits-in-manipur/article35597993.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||In praise of Hanuman||Valmiki Ramayana has six kandas, but not one of them is named after the hero or heroine. In fact, no kanda is named after any character in the epic, except Sundara Kanda. Sundara was the name of Hanuman. Thus Hanuman is the only one after whom a kanda takes its name in the Ramayana, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. It was Hanuman who found and consoled Sita, and brought back to Rama the glad tidings that he had found Sita. Thus he brought joy to both the hero and the heroine of the epic. When the time came for Rama to end His avatara, Hanuman refused to go to Sri Vaikuntha, but chose to stay back on Earth. He had a reason for this. In Sri Vaikuntha, the Lord is not worshipped as Rama, but Hanuman’s heart was full of love for Rama. Although Rama was none other than the Supreme One, Hanuman still wanted to see Him as Rama, and he wanted to hear Rama’s name being chanted. That is why wherever the Ramayana is narrated, a special seat is provided, for it is believed that Hanuman will be present there to listen to Rama’s story being told. There is a sloka about Hanuman which says: Goshpadi krita vaareesam masaki krita rakshasam Ramayana mahaa maalaa ratnam vande anilatmajam . Here the Ramayana is spoken of as a garland, and the ratnam (gem) that adds to the splendour of this garland is anilatmajam — the son of anila, that is Vayu. He crossed the ocean easily, as if it were nothing more than the water contained in an animal’s hoof. He crushed demons as if they were mosquitoes. Salutations are offered to Hanuman, as the one whose face is red and who is seated under the Parijatha tree. Another sloka says Hanuman narrated the Ramayana to Rama, Sita, and Rama’s brothers, and that Rama explained Ramayana tattva.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-praise-of-hanuman/article35597986.ece

The Chandrayaan-2 mission, launched in July 2019, was scheduled to be an effort aimed at landing a rover on the Lunar South Pole.

We stick the certificate with the donor’s name in front of the cage and allow the individual to visit the animal once in 15 days,” said Vijay Barabde, Range Forest Officer (RFO), Lion Safari Park, SGNP. “This year, the number of individuals coming forward for adoption has reduced. We suspect that a reason could be the pandemic. As a result, we are now appealing to the public to come forward,” he added. A number of celebrities such as former cricket player Sandip Patil, and actors Raveena Tondon and Sumit Raghvan are among the few who have come forward to adopt the animals. The amount to be paid for a year is Rs. 3.10 lakh for a tiger, Rs. 3 lakh for a lion, Rs. 1.20 lakh for a leopard, Rs. 50,000 for a rusty spotted cat, Rs. 30,000 for a blue bull or a nilgai, Rs. 20,000 for a spotted deer and Rs. 10,000 for a barking deer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sgnp-authorities-seek-individuals-to-adopt-animals/article35597958.ece

29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Drain network being extended in Ambattur||In about six months, more streets in added areas falling under Ambattur zone will have a sewer network, a long-pending demand of residents. The Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) is carrying out work to lay pipelines and provide connections at a cost of Rs. 20 crore. While welcoming the scheme that materialised after nearly two decades, residents want the road-cutting charges to be waived. Work is on to lay sewer pipelines in wards covering areas such as Oragadam, Venkatapuram, Kallikuppam in Ambattur and Korattur. Sources in the CMWSSB said of the 250 streets identified for the sewer network, work had been completed in 150 streets that had been left out. Similarly, the water board is implementing work in TASS Avenue in Ambattur Industrial Estate for a distance of 2 km. A detailed project report has been prepared to provide underground drainage system for 2 km in Pattaravakkam. These schemes were expected to reduce the flow of sewage in the canals that feed Ambattur and Korattur lakes, the officials said. Some areas in Anna Nagar West Extension that often face sewage overflow or obstructions may soon have get relief. Sewage spillover often reached the floodwater channels through the stormwater drains. Now, the old sewer lines are being replaced for a kilometre on East Avenue Main Road with larger size, from existing 250 mm diameter to 350 mm diameter. A project report has been prepared for a sewer network on 150 more streets in Madhanangkuppam in wards 82 and 83 for schemes funded by the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust. Moreover, new water lines have been laid in 80 of the proposed 110 streets. CMWSSB had started issuing notices to households that were provided drainage connection under the Azhaithal Inaippu and Ilanthorum Inaippu schemes. Bills were raised after the connections became functional. Road-cutting charges Residents said the road-cutting charges levied were exorbitant. For instance, T. Gunaseelan said people in GNG Colony had to pay road-cutting charges ranging between Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 1 lakh. The underground drainage scheme was chalked out in 2000 and several residents had paid about Rs. 9,000 as deposit to the erstwhile Ambattur municipality. “Many residents, who are affected by the pandemic, may find it difficult to pay the huge road-cutting charges. The State government must reduce or waive these charges,” he said. Sources in the CMWSSB said the connection charges of Rs. 7,500 would be reduced in the bill if they had already been remitted as deposit. Road-cutting charges had already been reduced by 5%-10%, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drain-network-being-extended-in-ambattur/article35598298.ece

29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Screening, vaccination mark World Hepatitis Day||Screening and vaccination of healthcare workers against hepatitis B at government and private hospitals marked World Hepatitis Day on Wednesday. “Hepatitis Can’t Wait” is the theme this year. With healthcare workers at high risk of contracting the infection, two government hospitals — Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate — kick-started an initiative to screen and vaccinate them. Ninety-two staff nurses, hospital workers and technicians were screened for hepatitis B at RGGGH. This included 57 staff nurses and 15 hospital workers. HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) test was done for them. “Staff nurses handle intravenous lines while hospital workers handle biomedical waste. There are chances of transmission of infection. So, it is important for healthcare workers to be careful and get screened. All of them tested negative and we are planning to vaccinate them against hepatitis B,” E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said. At the Government Medical College and Hospital, Omandurar, more than 50 healthcare workers were administered hepatitis B vaccine in the first phase of the initiative. “Hepatitis B and C are viral infections that could lead to chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. This is transmissible through blood, sexual contact or needle stick injuries. Hepatitis B is vaccine preventable, and now, we have anti-viral drugs that pave the way for almost 100% cure,” R. Jayanthi, Dean of the hospital, said. At Gleneagles Global Health City, a workshop for patients and their families to spread awareness on hepatitis B was held. A team of specialists highlighted the necessity for emotional and psychological support for patients as well as their caregivers. The interactive sessions covered aspects such as medical management for hepatitis, treatment for liver cancer due to hepatitis and tips on how to manage at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/world-hepatitis-day-observed/article35598306.ece
29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation plans three bridges in congested areas||The Greater Chennai Corporation plans to construct three new bridges in the city. The bridges department, which had executed only a handful of projects in the last 10 years under the AIADMK government, has proposed to build bridges which had been pending for a long time to ease traffic congestion. A senior official said as the city had expanded, more bridges were needed in congested old areas. Bridges were planned to be built at the Ganesapuram subway and the crowded Otteri junction. Plans were on to extend the flyover on Usman Road to be linked to Anna Salai. The civic body has done an initial study and has found the need for the flyover at Usman Road to be extended till Anna Salai as the T. Nagar junction had been witnessing heavy traffic. Since T. Nagar had transformed into shopping hub from a residential locality, the South Usman Road was becoming congested due to the presence of several textile showrooms. Also, the location of the T. Nagar bus terminus near the junction added to the problems. Despite the flyover South Usman Road, traffic jams occurred on Madley Road, CIT Nagar 1st Main Road, and CIT Nagar 4th Main Road. The civic body had designed a new flyover to link the ramp portion of the existing flyover on South Usman Road, which is 747 m long and 11 m wide, and proceeded above the CIT Nagar 1st and 4th Main Road junctions. Also provision for two ramps was to be made for motorists to have smooth access to the Burkit Road junction. The civic body plans to build two-lane carriageways at Konnur High Road and Strahans Road junction to ease traffic congestion on Strahans Road, Brickiln Road and Cooks Road. The proposed flyover would be 540 m long and would have a service road and pavement on both sides. Similarly, the residents of Perambur and Vyasarpadi had been demanding a bridge to replace the Ganesapuram subway, which got waterlogged during heavy rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-plans-three-bridges-in-congested-areas/article35598310.ece

Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Karti Chidambaram for the assessment year 2014-15. Justice S.M. Subramaniam quashed the orders after expressing displeasure over the officials having passed the assessment orders within 10 days after he dismissed previous writ petitions filed by the couple challenging the show cause notices issued with respect to the same issue. Non-adherence “I have passed numerous orders directing you to complete the assessment proceedings, have you shown the same urgency in all those cases?” the judge asked the Income Tax department after senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal complained about the non-adherence to the principles of natural justice. Finding force in their submissions, the judge remitted the matter to the Income Tax authorities with a direction to provide adequate opportunity to the couple to defend themselves through examination or cross examination of witnesses.  The judge pointed out that the authorities had reopened the old assessment proceedings against the couple pursuant to recovery of certain materials during a search and seizure operation on the premises of Agni Estates. Based on such seizure, the department had accused the couple of accepting part payment for sale of their property at Muttukadu near here in cash from Agni Estates and not disclosing such receipt in their IT returns filed in 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-quashes-income-tax-proceedings-against-karti-chidambaram/article35598312.ece
29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A tablet to keep his archival skills going||For any news relating to the Tamil Nadu police, Mubarak Ali is the department’s ready reckoner. The police constable (grade-II) has an archive of all news items on police subjects published in newspapers since 2017. Mr. Mubarak has now made news after State Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu wrote to him appreciating his good work. The day starts at 6 a.m. for Mr. Mubarak who starts reading e-papers of at least five major newspapers. By 10 a.m. he would have compiled all news items relating to the police department and an hour later the news files would be on social media groups connecting police personnel across the State. As the word spread, the then Superintendent of Police, Ramanathapuram, Varun Kumar, identified the newsgathering talent of the police constable and encouraged him to update his skills on social media platforms. On his suggestion, the DGPs roped in the expertise of Mr. Mubarak. Pleasant surprise Earlier this month, he got a call from SP (Organised Crime Intelligence Unit) S. Saravanan, seeking details of a case published in a newspaper some three years ago. Mr. Mubarak informed the officer that he would be able to access the information only the next day since his mobile phone screen got damaged after a fall. On Bakrid Day, he got a call from Mr. Saravanan’s office, saying a parcel had been dispatched to him. “It was a pleasant surprise to me… SP Sir remembered my damaged mobile phone and sent me a tablet. Now I am able to read and store e-paper of all newspapers on a bigger screen,” he said. This is not all. On Wednesday, Mr. Mubarak received a letter from Mr. Sylendra Babu appreciating his newsgathering skills. “I am happy to know that you have been in the habit of systematically collecting department-related news appearing in newspapers for the past three years. Your good work is highly appreciated. Keep on doing it and be helpful to the department,” the DGP wrote. Mr. Mubarak said some of the best practices of police in cities/districts were published in local editions of newspapers, which readers in other places would not know. “I share the e-paper clipping of such news items on social media groups, which would help police personnel in other cities/districts to emulate the same model. Many police personnel across the State told me that the news files I shared during the pandemic lockdown were very useful since newspapers were not accessible to all.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-tablet-to-keep-his-archival-skills-going/article35598331.ece
29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Storage comfortable in major reservoirs||Tamil Nadu received nearly 10 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) of Cauvery water in the third week of July, marking the most beneficial period for the State in the current water year (June-May). For the week ending on July 25, the State got about 9.4 tmc ft, taking the overall realisation to 15.13 tmc ft for July. This was attributed to the revival of southwest monsoon. However, the State suffered a shortfall of 11.6 tmc ft in realisation between June 1 and July 25 as it received 22.8 tmc ft, according to the readings of the Central Water Commission, which measures Cauvery water flow at Biligundlu on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. On Wednesday morning, the Mettur dam, the primary point of Cauvery water storage for the State, received 29,666 cubic feet per second (cusecs). About 10,000 cusecs was released for irrigation in the Cauvery delta. Of the two reservoirs of Karnataka, whose outflows through the river essentially benefit Tamil Nadu, Kabini was inching to the brim with its storage (17.24 tmc ft) being 88% of the capacity (19.516 tmc ft). On Tuesday, it received 27,280 cusecs and let out 25,000 cusecs through the river. Krishnarajasagar had about 34 tmc ft against the capacity of 49.45 tmc ft. While it received around 26,800 cusecs, it let out 9,650 cusecs through the river. Tamil Nadu’s other two reservoirs in the Cauvery basin, Bhavanisagar and Amaravathi, had an extremely comfortable storage. On Wednesday morning, Bhavanisagar’s level stood at 100 feet, five feet short of the full level. Its storage was 28.726 tmc ft against the capacity of 32.8 tmc ft. Amaravathi was almost full with its level and storage being 88.69 feet and 3.928 tmc ft respectively, against 90 feet and 4.047 tmc ft. The level of the Mullaperiyar crossed the 136 foot-mark, once the maximum permissible level. It stood at 136.45 feet with the storage of 6.231 tmc ft. The dam can store water up to 142 feet and 7.67 tmc ft. Most of the inflow (2,009 cusecs) was being drawn through a tunnel, which has the capacity to draw 2,300 cusecs. At present, nearly 1,870 cusecs was being issued through the tunnel. Initially, the water was being used for power generation and then let into the Vaigai. The level of the Vaigai dam was being kept at 2 feet below the full level of 71 feet. All its inflow of 1,868 cusecs was being discharged. Among the Parambikulam group of reservoirs, only the Sholayar dam was full. Its storage was around 5.17 tmc ft. Parambikulam and Aliyar had about 75% of their capacity (13.41 tmc ft and 3.87 tmc ft respectively), while Thirumurthy’s storage was around 60% of the capacity (1.74 tmc ft).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/storage-comfortable-in-major-reservoirs/article35598335.ece
29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refrains from passing interim orders in quota case||The Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to pass any kind of interim order on the basis of oral submissions that the State government was gearing up to implement the 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniakula Kshatriya community in medical and engineering college admissions. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy told advocate A. Rajini that they could not take cognisance of the issue on the basis of oral submissions. They, however, decided to hear in the second week of August all cases filed against the internal reservation law. Advocate-General (A-G) R. Shunmugasundaram informed the judges that so far, 23 writ petitions had been filed in the principal seat of the High Court, five at the Madurai Bench and four more in the Supreme Court challenging the reservation law passed this February. Stating that the Supreme Court had refused to pass any kind of interim order on those cases, and had expressed its mind that they should be heard first by the High Court, the A-G said he was ready to argue the matter whenever the court would deem it fit to take up the cases. The A-G also told the judges that an oral mentioning had been made before them due to a government order (G.O.) issued on Monday. The G.O. does nothing but fix the roster system to be followed by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC). It is a regular development, Mr. Shunmugasundaram said. The court was informed that the Tamil Nadu Special Reservation of seats in Educational Institutions including Private Educational Institutions and of appointments or posts in the services under the State within the Reservation for the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities Act of 2021 had already come into force. 28 pending petitions Mr. Shunmugasundaram said the law got implemented in April, with the Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University following it to make admissions to law courses. He urged the court to take up all 28 petitions pending before it for hearing anytime. The law passed by the Assembly, minutes before the model code of conduct came into force for the election this year, provides 10.5% reservation for Vanniakula Kshatriyas (including Vanniyar, Vanniya, Vannia Gounder, Gounder or Kander, Padayachi, Palli and Agnikula Kshatriya) within the 20% reserved for MBCs & DNCs. It categorises a host of other MBC and DNC castes into two categories. The first category was given 7% reservation and the second the rest of the 2.5% quota in education and public employment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refrains-from-passing-interim-orders-in-quota-case/article35598338.ece

According to hospital authorities, the department of paediatric gastroenterology is the first of its kind centre for children in the State. Hospital founder C. Palanivelu said the country was witnessing a growing burden of digestive disorders in children. “It can affect a child’s growth, mental development and overall immunity because 70% of the immune system lies within the gastrointestinal tract. Many children swallow foreign bodies which may be dangerous and life-threatening and need a specialised centre to remove them.” According to the WHO, 10% of children had gastrointestinal problems that led to multiple mental and social issues during the growing stages. According to the hospital’s chief executive officer S. Asokan, the centre is equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and the equipment include facilities for paediatric liver transplant, 24x7 gastrointestinal bleed and foreign bodies removal centre, paediatric endoscopy services, integrated paediatric and child counselling care for all paediatric disorders. “Dedicated evaluation and treatment is provided for jaundice in infants and children,” he said. The hospital launched powered spiral enteroscopy, an advanced method in treating gastrointestinal bleeding. Hospital director P. Senthilnathan said around 5% of gastrointestinal bleeding occurred from the small bowel. The spiral enteroscopy allowed for the small bowel to be examined in less than an hour and made possible therapeutic interventions, he said. Head of the department of medical gastroenterology Vinoth Kumar said the power spiral was the world’s first motorised endoscope.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gem-hospital-opens-paediatric-gastroenterology-department/article35598342.ece

The movement urged the Higher Education Department to abide by the UGC guidelines. Also, colleges and universities had been appointing retired professors to tide over the shortage of faculty. This had resulted in new posts being created, and it was also detrimental to the reservation policy, it pointed out. Mr. Karupiah urged the government to refrain from making such appointments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/regularise-guest-lecturers/article35598452.ece

To a question on recent trips of billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos to space during an online talk organised by the U.S. Consulate-General Chennai as part of its “Diaspora Diplomacy” series on Wednesday, Ms. Swati compared the recent events with the nascent stages in the evolution of air travel. She said while air travel remained accessible to only a few people in the early days, the subsequent growth in the industry and technology made it an integral part of travel for most people. “I would love to see space tourism doing the same for space travel,” she said and added that it could accelerate technological advancements, thereby making exploration of space not limited to a few but an activity that many could participate in. “It is something to see the world from outside of it. It changes our perspective. The more we have that change across society, the more it will help us to take care of our planet better,” she said. Judith Ravin, U.S. Consul-General, Chennai, spoke on the Indian diaspora and the key role played by Indians in many fields in the U.S.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/space-travel-should-be-accessible-to-more-people/article35598341.ece

29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC finds legal infirmities in election petitions against OPS, Udhayanidhi||The Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to order notices to Bodinayakanur MLA O. Panneerselvam of the AIADMK and Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin of the DMK on two different election petitions challenging their victory this year. Justice V. Bharathidasan, however, granted time till August 9 to the petitioners to convince the court that both the pleas were fit enough to be entertained. He pointed out various legal infirmities and asked the petitioners’ counsel to address them. The judge said M.L. Ravi of the Desiya Makkal Sakthi Katchi had filed two election petitions challenging the victory of his rival candidate Mr. Stalin on similar grounds. While one petition was listed for deciding its maintainability, the other was numbered by the Registry on compliance of all rules. The reason for the issue of maintainability being raised in one petition was that the petitioner had failed to make a security deposit of Rs. 2,000, as required under Section 117 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. HC can dismiss petition Section 86 of the Act requires the High Court to dismiss petitions in which the deposit has not been made. Such dismissals will amount to dismissal on merits, and consequently, the petitioner will not be able to file a second election petition on the same grounds, the judge said. Stating that a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court had aslo recently delivered a judgment on the issue, the judge asked petitioner’s counsel T. Sivagnanasambandam to go through that verdict before making his submissions on August 9. As far as the election petition filed against Mr. Panneerselvam was concerned, the judge said the petitioner had accused the former Chief Minister of not disclosing the assets owned by his wife accurately. However, the petitioner failed to substantiate the allegation with sufficient proof. The case was filed by P. Milany, a voter from Bodinayakanur constituency. The judge asked his counsel C. Vinayagamoorthy, too, to get back on August 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-finds-legal-infirmities-in-election-petitions-against-ops-udhayanidhi/article35598456.ece
29 July 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||16 colleges not to take part in TNEA counselling||At least 16 colleges will not take part in the counselling for admission to the engineering courses this year. While nine colleges have sought zero intake (indicating that they do not want to admit students this year), seven others have not even applied for affiliation, sources said.  According to P. Selvaraj, secretary of the Consortium of Self-Financing Professional, Arts and Science Colleges, the decision of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) not to allow new courses in colleges that were unable to fill 50% of the seats in the existing courses last year was the reason. “We met the AICTE Chairman in Delhi and asked him to allow us to introduce new courses as students are not interested in pursuing mechanical and civil engineering. But the AICTE did not comply,” he said. The number of colleges participating in the counselling has been falling for the past four years. In 2018, 509 colleges participated in it; in 2019, the number fell to 479; and in 2020, only 461 colleges participated in the single-window counselling conducted by the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) committee. The number of sanctioned seats also fell from 1,77,117 in 2018 to 1,57,689 last year. Engineering educators, however, attribute the dip to the low interest in engineering as a profession. On Wednesday, 57,513 applications were registered as of 5.30 p.m. So far, 33,552 people have made payments and 22,960 candidates have uploaded their certificates. Classes from Aug. 18 Anna University has released the odd semester schedule. It will begin on August 18. The last working day is November 30. The end-semester theory examinations will start on December 13.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam ordered that the assets disclosed by the officials in their service records must be cross-checked with assets that are now owned by them and their family members and those who had amassed wealth must be prosecuted. The judge also directed the Commercial Taxes and Registration Department Secretary to conduct periodical raids in the offices of subordinate officials through the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) sleuths. The judge further ordered departmental action against officials who either do not collect revenue due to the State on time or intentionally delay the proceedings for extraneous considerations. They must be punished for dereliction of duty, the judge said. “A decent salary is being paid to government officials. Their salary is undoubtedly more competitive than that of private organisations. By virtue of government appointment, the officials are holding a status in society. Therefore, they are bound to act in the interest of people at large,” the judge observed. The judgment was passed while allowing an old case, in which there had been a huge delay in recovering sales tax dues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crack-down-on-corrupt-commercial-tax-dept-officials-hc-tells-govt/article35598779.ece

MEPZ Special Economic Zone Development Commissioner M.K. Shanmuga Sundaram, who is an IAS officer of the 1997 batch belonging to the Uttar Pradesh cadre, has made a compilation of the personality tests of 61 civil servants in his book,Interviews Redefined. The compilation contains the experiences of civil servants during the interviews held at the time of the UPSC selection process. Speaking at the launch of the book at Shankar IAS Academy in Chennai on Wednesday, Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram said the civil services personality test, often referred to as interview, maintains its basic framework of making the aspirants comfortable and help them express themselves. “There are also more technical or in-depth questions being asked nowadays. In a purposeful conversation, the special traits of the candidates are given more focus so that their attitude, competency levels and their empathy with different people in society are expressed in no uncertain terms. As more and more aspirants are coming with specialised knowledge and work experience, the interviewers do ask about happenings in those fields,” he said. Stressing the need for research on personality tests, Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram said it would be difficult to compile every civil servant’s interview. “Someone can take this up as a research topic and compile them and study them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ias-officer-publishes-book-on-upscs-personality-test/article35598343.ece

29 July 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||TNAU showcases drone technology for pesticide application||Soon farmers in Tamil Nadu could be using drones to spray pesticides or apply fertilizers or nutrients to crops. And, this could be in the near future as the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is ready with the technology and standard operating procedure, crop-wise. Minister for Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare M.R.K. Panneerselvam in the presence of Agriculture Production Commissioner C. Samayamoorthy, senior officials and Vice-Chancellor N. Kumar, viewed the demonstration at the university on Wednesday. The university said the Department of Remote Sensing and GIS' study since 2018 on the use of drones had helped it identify the right type of drone, the concentration of pesticide, herbicide, nutrient, etc., standardise the spray volume and speed for paddy maize, pulses, sugarcane, tomato, tapioca, vegetables and a few other crops. It had conducted field trials in Coimbatore, Perambalur, Tiruvannamalai, Salem and a few other districts to arrive at the standard operating procedure. The drones that it had ordered after customisation ran on petrol, had the capacity to carry up to 16 litres of pesticide and could fly non-stop for three hours. The study had revealed that the drone could accomplish in a few hours the task that two labourers required a day to do – spray pesticides or apply fertilizers on a hectare, the university said. The advantages identified during the field trials were that the farmers could use the drones for localised application of pesticides or fertilizers for effective crop management and they could do it within a very short time. Early application of the pesticides or fertilisers would help the farmers save crops. If they were to depend on labourers for the same it could take time and the time difference could prove critical in saving crops. As for using the drones on coconut, arecanut or other plantation crops, the university officials said it was in the pipeline. At present the university was engaged in standardising the drone application on a few more crops and thereafter it would concentrate on plantation crops. The farmers could hire the drones to spray pesticides or apply fertilisers but it was for the Agriculture Department to take a call. At the university, Mr. Panneerselvam viewed the use of drone on a mango orchard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnau-showcases-drone-technology-for-pesticide-application/article35598362.ece

Water was released into the canal on August 21 for carrying out farming in 15,743 acres (6,374 hectare) of land spread across Erode, Modakkurichi and Kodumudi taluks. While turmeric is cultivated in over 60% of the ayacut areas, sugarcane is cultivated in 30% of land and banana in the rest of the land. The canal passes through the city at Vairapalayam and Karungalpalayam where farmers started preparing the land for cultivating paddy. While a few farmers started sowing paddy seeds in nurseries, others were ploughing and preparing the land for cultivation. The canal runs for 91.10 km from Kalingarayanpalayam anicut in Bhavani and finally joins Noyyal River at Avadaparai near Salai Pudur. On Wednesday, the water crossed Panjalingapuram village in Modakkurichi Taluk thus covering over 30 km in the past one week. K.M. Krishnamurthy, secretary of the Kalingarayan Pasana Sabai told The Hindu that due to renovation works in the canal, movement of water was hindered at many places and hence it would take over a week for the water to reach the tail-end farmers. He wanted the replacement of sluices in the canal to be completed at the earliest so that water supply to farmers is not hindered. Farmers said that turmeric is the most preferred crop in Modakkurichi and Kodumudi areas for the current season and they expect improvement in price in the market.

29 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Inspector booked for extortion, cheating||Inspector of Police Vasanthi of Nagamalai Pudukottai under Madurai Rural District Police has been booked for extortion of Rs. 10 lakh from a tailor. After Madurai District Crime Branch registered a first information report against five persons, including the Inspector, on Tuesday, DIG (Madurai Range) N. Kamini placed her under suspension, according to Superintendent of Police V. Baskaran. The tailor, K. Asrath, 33, of Sivaganga district lodged a complaint with the SP recently about snatching of a bag containing Rs. 10 lakh from a lodge in Nagamalai Pudukottai on July 5. Additional Superintendent of Police (Crime against Women and Children Wing) Chandramouli investigated the complaint and submitted a report to the SP. “Based on the ADSP’s report, the DCB has registered a case,” Mr. Baskaran said. Vasanthi, K. Palpandi and Kundupandi of Theni district and Ukkirapandi and Karthik of Silaman were booked under different sections of the IPC for extortion, cheating, criminal breach of trust by public servant and criminal intimidation. Loan amount The complainant, who worked as a tailor in a company in Madurai, raised a loan of Rs. 10 lakh to set up a tailoring unit at Ilayangudi. While waiting at the lodge to raise more money through his brother, some of the accused men left him with a promise of bringing money. However, when Karthik and Pandi returned, a police vehicle arrived at the spot. Karthik took Asrath’s bag containing the cash and handed it over to Inspector Vasanthi. When Asrath asked the Inspector to return his money, she reportedly threatened him saying that she would book him for ganja selling or gold smuggling. After taking all the three in her jeep, the Inspector dropped the tailor after travelling 500 metres. She took the other two with her. She asked Asrath to come to the police station the next day, when he asked about his money. Later, he was asked over phone to come to Tallakulam. “She then told him that there was no money, but only some notebooks. She threatened to put me behind bars for ganja selling,” Asrath said in his complaint.

29 July 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Right to Privacy: advocates assist High Court on plea by acquitted man||Advocates assisted the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in a case in which a man acquitted of all charges sought to redact his name from the court order to protect his Right to Privacy. The deliberations went on for over five hours on Wednesday. During the course of the previous hearing in the case, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh said he would hear members of the Bar and understand various ramifications before writing a detailed judgment in the case. High Court advocates from Madurai and Chennai assisted the court. The court was hearing a petition filed by a man, who was acquitted of charges of rape and cheating. He said that though he was acquitted, whenever he looked for his name on search engines, the judgment and case details got reflected. It caused an impact on his reputation. When the case was heard on Wednesday, counsel representing the petitioner said his client was acquitted of all charges. He was now married and had children. Hence, the name of his client should be concealed as it affected his reputation. Advocates, who assisted the court on the issue, highlighted various rulings pronounced by courts across the globe. The Concept of Right to Erasure or Right to be Forgotten was discussed during the course of the hearing. The judge asked whether a common order could be passed with a direction to search engines to redact the names in cases of acquittal or whether it would be better to decide on a case-to-case basis. The court could be flooded with such petitions seeking to redact names, he said. When the High Court Registry was asked its opinion, it said it would abide by the direction of the court. Some advocates said that to redact the names from the court copies was not needed as it was proof of acquittal in the case. Justice Anand Venkatesh referred to the landmark Supreme Court judgment in Puttaswamy vs Union of India on the Right to Privacy and observed that there was a prima facie case made out by the petitioner and he was entitled to redacting his name from the judgment. The judge, taking note of the fact that the Centre was finalising the Data Protection Bill, 2019, observed that when enacted, it would effectively protect the data and privacy of a person. It was informed to the court that the Right to be Forgotten was sought to be included in the list of rights.

29 July 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Need to focus on alcoholic hepatitis, say medical experts||While governments across the globe, particularly in South-East Asia, are intensifying their action plans to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, gastroenterologists have called for equal attention to alcoholic hepatitis. On the occasion of World Hepatitis Day (July 28), doctors have reiterated that public awareness of the different causes of liver inflammation is still low. In most cases, the liver infection lies dormant for years to manifest as a disease beyond cure. In India, chronic viral hepatitis B is the most common cause of primary liver cancer. And, therefore, this year’s theme for the day — Can’t Wait — should educate people to get themselves tested for the viruses like they do for blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar levels. But a major area of neglect is alcoholic hepatitis, says P.L Alagammai, Consultant Medical Gastroenterology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Centre. Based on her clinical experience, the incidence of viral hepatitis is less than alcohol-induced hepatiis to the ratio of 1:6. Males between 35 to 45 years are affected severely as most of them pick up alcohol addiction in their 20s and do not realise what damage the toxin is doing to the liver, Dr. Alagammai said. The symptoms manifest at a very late stage causing cirrhosis. Doctors advise people to get self-tested for viral hepatitis that can be transmitted through blood or unprotected sex. Hepatitis C is curable with early anti-viral therapy, while Hepatitis B with early intervention can be treated to avoid further complications and check the progression of cirrhosis and liver cancer, Dr. Alagammai adds. According to her, only those who come for annual master health check-up, pre-employment medical test or as part of hospital procedure for other surgeries get detected.

29 July 2021||MALAPPURAM,TAMIL NADU||21-year-old on bicycle journey to Kashmir||A young woman from Thachanna near Areekode in Kerala’s Malappuram district has set out on a bicycle journey to Kashmir. Giving her company are two friends with good cycling experience from Areekode. It was a long-cherished desire for 21-year-old Sahla, daughter of Sakeer Hussain and Hafsath, to traverse the country on a bicycle and enjoy the beauty of the countryside. A student of journalism, Sahla bought a bicycle with the money she saved during her studies. She has set out on the adventurous trip along with Mohammed Shamil and Mashhoor Shan. Laijumon C.V., inspector of Areekode police station, flagged off the journey in front of the police station on Sunday. Sahla was excited about the trip. “It’s been a dream for me to go up to Kashmir on a bicycle. Now that we are starting our journey, my excitement has reached its zenith,” she said. Changing with the times Sahla’s parents said her bicycle journey along with two men symbolised the society and the community changing with the times. According to Sahla, gone are the days when girls were asked not to venture out of their homes after sunset. “My parents are my biggest encouragement,” she said. According to Sahla’s father, Sakeer, boys and girls should be given the freedom they seek for the fulfilment of their dreams. “Their confidence and courage will be of little use if we restrain them,” he said. Sahla has criss-crossed the State on bicycle several times in recent years. A student of Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh, Sahla is yet to see the campus of her alma mater. “COVID-19 made everything online. I hope to visit my campus during the journey if possible,” she said. The journey is expected to take three months. Shamil, secretary of a cycling collective named Eranad Pedallers, had reached Kashmir on bicycle in 2018. He said he was craving for yet another journey to Kashmir. Mashhoor Shan, an ITI teacher, too had covered several States on bicycle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/21-year-old-on-bicycle-journey-to-kashmir/article35598015.ece
29 July 2021||NAGAPATTINAM,TAMIL NADU||Doctor from Vedaranyam scores 16th rank in INI CET||A doctor hailing from Vedaranyam has secured the all-India 16th rank in the Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test (INI CET). The examination is an entrance to secure admission at AIIMS, JIPMER, PGIMER and NIMHANS. The doctor, R. Rajarethinam, stands second in the OBC category at the national level. Hailing from Ayakkaranpulam near Vedaranyan, he was a student of the Kilpauk Medical College. After completing his MBBS in 2020, he spent time preparing for INI CET and began working at the Nagapattinam District Headquarters Hospital three months ago. A son of a pharmacist, he always wanted to become a doctor, he said. ‘I used to go to the Vedaranyam GH, where my father works and observe things in awe. My parents used to tell me that I would become a doctor too,’ he said. He was on COVID-19 duty at the GH and the practical knowledge gave him an edge over the others, he believes. Seeing patients and managing them is an important part of the questions asked in the examination. ‘Since COVID-19 is an important part of medicine now, I knew that a large part of the questions would come with regard to it. The information I picked up while on duty helped me,’ he said. It was, therefore, not difficult to balance work and preparation for the examination. ‘Work was also preparation in a way,’ he added. Dr. Rajarethinam studied up to Class 10 at the Government Higher Secondary School, Ayakkaranpulam, and finished Class 11 and 12 at a private school in Pudukottai. ‘My parents have been a guiding light throughout. They are the reason for what I am today,’ he said proudly. The COVID-19 pandemic created a sense of uniformity amongst students, Dr. Rajarethinam said. "Whether the student is attempting the examination from a big metro city or from a village, the preparations were all online. It has proven that we can achieve what we want despite all these hurdles," he said. He wishes to study Internal medicine at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctor-from-vedaranyam-scores-16th-rank-in-ini-cet/article35598443.ece
29 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry government revives plan to expand runway||The government has revived its plan to expand the runway of Puducherry airport with a few modifications in the land plan. As per the new plan for expansion, the runway would be extended from its present length of 1500 metre to 3300 metre by acquiring 170 acres of land in the first phase. The earlier plan was to expand the runway by acquiring around 400 acres of land, a large stretch falling in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. In the last few days, Minister for Public Works K. Lakshminarayanan, who also holds the Civil Aviation portfolio, held discussions with senior officials and Director of Puducherry Airport Vijaya Upadhyay. Mr. Lakshminarayanan also visited the airport on Wednesday to discuss the new plan. The Minister told The Hindu that the expansion would be done in a phased manner with limited land available. “We cannot acquire a vast stretch given our resource constraints and other difficulties involved. So, we have limited the area for expansion and the new land plan is ready,” he added. Mr. Lakshminarayanan said he had already set in motion the process to hand over the land available with the Public Works Department to Airports Authority of India and also to acquire the land available here. “Our preliminary assessment is that around 70 acres will be available on our side and the remaining 100 acres we will have to get from Tamil Nadu,” he said. The government would be soon approaching the Villupuram District administration for the purpose, he also added. Expansion to 3300 metre Mr. Upadhyay said the expansion of runway from its present capacity to 3300 metre would enable wide-bodied aircrafts to operate from here. Recently, Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan had, on a call with the Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, taken up the issue of resuming flights to Puducherry and runway expansion to accommodate ART/Bombardier Q 400 type aircraft with 90-seater capacity, without any load penalty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-government-revives-plan-to-expand-runway/article35598770.ece

29 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry’s pristine beach reappears after 32 years||It was from 1989 when Puducherry's pristine beach that extended into the sea started disappearing due to rampant sea erosion. The trigger was the port constructed in 1989 that disrupted the littoral drift and resulted in accumulation of sand on the southern side and erosion on the northern side. The construction of the new harbour, with its wall projecting into the sea, blocked the movement of sand from the south towards the north. Though a sand bypassing system was provided at the harbour to regularly shift the sand from the south to the north, this was not done properly. The harbour had already eroded an estimated 10 km of beach sand and continues to erode the beaches along the Tamil Nadu coastline. New project Thirty-two years later, in July 2021, the beach has now returned on the southern side. The beachfront on the Promenade, the most frequented place in the coastal town for locals and tourists alike has extended in size, two months after the Port Department launched the beach nourishment project recommended by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT). According to official sources, for the beach nourishment project, over 5.10 lakh cubic tonnes of sand has to be dredged from the mouth of the Thengaithittu fishing harbour, transported, and deposited via pipelines 3-4 km away near the old pier. The Port Department has already dredged one lakh cubic metres of sand and once the exercise is over, a beach will be formed. The Port has engaged a hi-tech cutter suction dredger to deepen the sea mouth and restore the sandy beach. According to Probir Banerjee of PondyCan, a non-governmental organisation, "Puducherry's famous beach is coming back and this is a moment of joy and celebration. If the government continues to do the dredging, the whole beach will get restored." According to M.V. Ramana Murthy, Director of National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), "Basically, the beach has formed. The accumulated sand in the harbour is being bypassed to the north and the width of the beach now has extended to 60 metres while it is slightly lower on the northern side.” Sandy beach soon “Once the quantity of sand deposited is increased the sandy beach could be realised and the northern part would be more stabilised,” he said. According to Aurofilio Schiavina, an expert on Coastal management and a member of PondyCan, "The sand that is dredged from the sea mouth is fed to a booster pump located near the La Marina. The booster pump then deposits the sand all the way to the south of the promenade where the sand is being used for nourishment." "This new input of sand is making the beaches grow and is making the sea recede. The widest beach can be seen near Hotel Ajantha and the bypassed sand has now reached all the way to the Gandhi statue. In the next few weeks, the sand will move to the south with the waves and the currents and it will start to cause widening of beaches near the northern submerged reef," the expert added. Without the southern reef in place, the beaches to the south may be unstable and may disappear once the nourishment is terminated. For this reason, regular beach nourishment has to be undertaken, he said. This should not be difficult because at the same time regular dredging is also needed at the harbour mouth. But if the dredging is going to be irregular then the southern reef would help to stabilise the beaches on the southern part of the promenade, Mr. Schiavina added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherrys-pristine-beach-reappears-after-32-years/article35598449.ece

29 July 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Expedite land acquisition for rail line, Railways tells Tamil Nadu||The Railways has requested the Tamil Nadu Government to expedite land acquisition for the proposed rail line from Karaikal to Peralam, Union Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Parliament on Wednesday. Replying to an unstarred question raised by MP V. Vaithilingam, Mr. Vaishnaw stated that Karaikal was already connected with the Railway network, including with Peralam via Nagappattinam, Tiruvarur. To provide additional direct connectivity from Karaikal to Peralam, a 23-km new line work was sanctioned as material modification to Tiurchchirapalli - Thanjavur - Nagore - Karaikal gauge conversion project at a cost of Rs. 177.69 crore in January 2019. Land acquisition proposals for 3.20 ha of land have been submitted to the State Government of Tamil Nadu in September 2019. “The Government of Tamil Nadu has been requested to expedite land acquisition. However, work has been taken up on available land,” the Railway Minister said. Mr. Vaithilingam had sought details on the current status of the rail link from Karaikal to Peralam linking the Southern part of the State and the time by which the work on the said railway line is likely to be completed. On the second part of the question, the Minister responded that a fixed completion time of the project could not be ascertained at this stage. This was because the completion of a Railway project hinged on various factors such as expeditious land acquisition by State Government, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of the area, and number of working months in a year for a particular project site. “All these factors affect the completion time of the project. As such, confirm completion time of the project cannot be ascertained at this stage,” the Minister stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-land-acquisition-for-rail-line-railways-tells-tn/article35598775.ece

Mr. Palaniswami and cadres of the AIADMK staged a protest in front of his residence here on Tuesday, accusing the State government of not fulfilling the promises made during the Assembly elections. Mr. Palaniswami told presspersons that the DMK government had not made any announcements on fulfilling major poll promises. The promise to reduce the price of petrol by Rs. 5 a litre and that of diesel by Rs. 4 had not been kept either. Mr.Palaniswami alleged that people were affected by the anomalies in the calculation of power consumption charges. The AIADMK government had ensured there was no power cut, so that the people in general and the industries and farmers were not affected. The DMK government should take steps to ensure there was no power cut across the State. In order to divert the attention of the people from its failure to deliver on its promises, the DMK government was registering false cases on former ministers and AIADMK functionaries, he said. Mr.Palaniswami said he was glad that the State government was not planning to reintroduce lottery, and wanted it to remain firm on this stand. On the COVID-19 situation, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK government was only continuing with what the previous regime had done; it had not done anything new. On the special quota for Vanniyars, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government had provided such a quota for a majority community considering their request. He demanded that the State government implement caste-based census so that reservation could be provided for all castes based on their population  Erode Staff Reporter adds:  In Erode, the demonstration was held at Veerappanchatiram.

29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||SC verdict puts Kerala govt. in a spot||The Supreme Court judgment denying reprieve without trial for Left Democratic Front (LDF) leaders accused of creating disorder and destroying public property in the Assembly in 2015 appeared to have plunged the Kerala government and the ruling coalition into an awkward situation. The apex court’s damning order is being perceived as a setback for the LDF and a moral win for the United Democratic Front. (Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala had doggedly opposed the government’s move to set aside the case against the LDF leaders at multiple levels of the judiciary). The UDF has weaponised the Supreme Court order against the LDF government. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has sought the resignation of General Education Minister V. Sivankutty. The issue is likely to figure in the House prominently. Protests today KPCC president K. Sudhakaran has announced sit-in demonstrations at district headquarters across the State on Thursday to press for the Minister’s resignation. Congress leader V.M. Sudheeran has demanded a public apology from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He asked Mr. Vijayan to reimburse the substantial legal fee drawn from the public exchequer. Kerala Congress (M) leader, Jose. K. Mani, an LDF ally and K.M. Mani’s political heir, was guarded in his response. The government would follow the law, he said. Mr. Sivankutty said he saw no reason to resign and would face trial. The verdict has also reportedly set off a blame game in the LDF. Some LDF partners had warned the government against the move to withdraw the case against the advice of the Deputy Director, Prosecutions. They reportedly felt the government had magnified the issue and unnecessarily drawn national attention to the episode by fighting the case at the Supreme Court level. By one account, the CPI(M) was unlikely to budge from its earlier stance that the further prosecution of the LDF leaders would be tantamount to double jeopardy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sc-verdict-puts-kerala-govt-in-a-spot/article35598010.ece
29 July 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||GHs to get oxygen generators shortly||Collector K. Senthil Raj has said that Government Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital and Kovilpatti Government Hospital would soon get oxygen generators, each at the cost of Rs. 1 crore, to supply the life-saving gas to 200 beds. While the work would be completed in GTMCH within three weeks, the Government Hospital at Kovilpatti would get the facility within a week as the district administration is working on creating medical facilities to face the speculated third wave of COVID-19. “In GTMCH, the oxygen-supported beds will be created in the paediatric ward as it is being predicted that the third wave of COVID-19 would badly hit the children who are yet to be vaccinated,” Dr. Senthil Raj said after inaugurating the testing of pregnant women for Hepatitis B or C at Government Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital here on Wednesday in the wake of ‘World Liver Cirrhosis Awareness Day’. Inaugurating the event, Dr. Senthil Raj said the district administration had roped in private firms to sponsor power generators to GTMCH and the Kovilpatti Government Hospital under their Corporate Social Responsibility Fund so that uninterrupted oxygen supply could be ensured to the patients even during unexpected and scheduled power shutdowns. “We are keen on neutralizing the speculated third wave of COVID-19 and hence creating the medical infrastructure required,” said Dr. Senthil Raj, who also inspected the spot where the oxygen generator is to be installed. The Collector said testing of pregnant women for liver cirrhosis and creating awareness among the women of the disease caused by Hepatitis B / C virus were being conducted in connection with World Liver Cirrhosis Awareness Day. Moreover, they were being vaccinated against these dreaded viral infections. The viral infection that could spread through unhygienic food, contaminated water, using syringes for multiple times, transfusion of infected blood etc. would cause serious ailments. Hence, the blood banks used to test the bloods for 5 viruses whenever it was collected from the donors, said the Collector. Dean, Nehru, Vice-Principal Kalaivani, Resident Medical Officer Silas Jayamani and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ghs-to-get-oxygen-generators-shortly/article35598469.ece

29 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||MSME sector looks for early fructification of defence corridor||The MSME sector in Tiruchi region has sought pro-active roles by the Central and State governments for timely fructification of Defence Corridor Project. A report of the Ministry of Defence states that the best bet for success of ‘Make in India’ initiative in the sector is to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers by way of developing an innovative and agile supply chain around the system integrators with active contributions from the SMEs. Against this backdrop, offices must ideally be established in all the five nodes of the Tamil Nadu Defence Industrial Corridor: Chennai, Coimbatore, Hosur, Salem and Tiruchi, N. Kanagasabapathi, Chairman of Tiruchi Trade Centre, said. At the time of inauguration of TNDIC during January, 2019, it was announced that defence public sector undertakings and private defence products manufacturers will together make investments to the tune of Rs. 3,100 crore. After the inauguration, there has not been any visible progress in the project, a promoter of a fabrication unit in Tiruchi intending to manufacture components for defence products, said. The Central government had then asked the State to form defence clusters in nodal cities to attract investments along the corridor. The initiative could be given a push if offices are established in Tiruchi and four other nodes, for facilitating MSME units to manufacture components for defence products to be manufactured by the DPSUs, Mr. Kanagasabapathi said. Last August, Ministry of Defence notified a ‘First Positive Indigenisation list’ of 101 items, and earlier this year, on May 31, the Ministry released the second Positive Indigenisation list’ of 108 items. It implies that there will be an embargo on import of these products beyond specified timelines. These lists include some high technology weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, corvettes, sonar systems, transport aircraft, light combat helicopters (LCHs), radars, wheeled armoured platform, rockets, bombs, armoured command post vehicle, and armoured dozor. The Ministry had launched SRIJAN portal to promote indigenisation on 14 Aug 2020. As on date 10,940 items, which were earlier imported, have been displayed on the portal for indigenisation. The Indian industry has shown interest for indigenization of 2,880 displayed items so far, according to a reply in Parliament by the Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt to a question raised by A. Vijayakumar, Rajya Sabha MP. There are six ordnance factories and one manufacturing unit of BEL in Tamil Nadu at present. Moreover, there are 35 major private companies which manufacture products for defence. These are supported by MSMEs, numbering about 250. After announcement of defence corridor in Tamil Nadu, about 30 more companies have expressed their intentions to set up/expand manufacturing units, the reply states.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/msme-sector-looks-for-early-fructification-of-defence-corridor/article35598450.ece
29 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bus services continue to stay off EB Road||There had been many instances of intervention by the district administration and Regional Transport Office authorities on resuming bus services on East Boulevard Road in the city. But it is still elusive. Unlike West Boulevard Road, a parallel road in the city, East Boulevard Road is surrounded by thickly populated residential colonies and urban slums. According to a rough estimate, nearly one-tenth of the city population lives along both sides of East Boulevard Road.  A large number of people commute to various places from the habitations along EB Road. It has been a centre of lorry booking offices to transport various items booked by the people and traders to different parts of the country. According to sources, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) has to operate 15 services and the private operators 33 services a day on East Boulevard Road. But, none of them operate on the designated route. Instead, they regularly operate on West Boulevard Road. In the absence of bus services, residents have been left with the options of travelling in their own vehicles or walk. For the residents, who want to go to Central Bus Stand or Railway Junction, they need to walk for two to three km to board buses on West Boulevard Road. If they want to travel towards Srirangam, they need to walk more to catch buses on Madurai Road. It has been an ordeal for the people for many years. It is not that the officials have not taken steps to operate bus services on the road. Most of the Collectors of Tiruchi district had intervened in the recent past to resume bus services. Whenever pressure mounts on resuming bus services, Collector convenes a meeting of Regional Transport authorities, Tiruchi Corporation, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), TNSTC, and other stakeholders and subsequently buses would ply for some days. Once the officials shift their attention on other issues, buses would skip the route only to operate via West Boulevard Road. The transport operators cite poor collection and patronage the reasons for skipping the route. Attempts were made in 2016, 2018,2019 and 2020 to operate bus services on the route. Collector S. Sivarasu too intervened to make the operation of buses on the route regular. Upon his direction, buses were operated for some days. “Skipping the designated route is a case of clear violation. If the bus operators are reluctant to operate buses on East Boulevard Road, the permit should be cancelled so as to take alternative steps,” says N. Jamaludeen, a consumer activist. He said that the East Boulevard Road had ample space for operating bus services. Hassle-free movement of vehicles was possible if the encroachments were cleared. If the services were operated continuously the patronage would pick up surely within a few months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-services-continue-to-stay-off-eb-road/article35598431.ece
29 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||IIIT-Tiruchi to offer two PG programmes||Indian Institute of Information Technology - Tiruchi (III-T) will offer M.Tech. programmes in VLSI Designs and Computer Science Engineering from the coming academic year. It had already launched Ph.D. programme last year, besides the two B.Tech. programmes. The scope for offering more programmes with IT infusion will be considered in the coming years. It has been mandated to increase student intake to 1,200 over a five-year period after moving to the new campus, Director of IIIT-Tiruchi N.S.V.N. Sarma told media persons on Wednesday. The IIIT-Tiruchi will offer certificate, diploma and degree programmes in online mode. The student strength for the first three batches had to be kept minimal due to infrastructure constraints. The IIIT-Tiruchi initially functioned out of the BIT (Bharathidasan Institute of Technology) campus of Anna University and subsequently shifted to the premises of National Institute of Technology - Tiruchi (NIT-T), the mentor institution, before moving out to rented buildings a year back. It could speed up the work on establishing the permanent campus on the 56-acre land at Sethurapatti even during the COVID pandemic owing to the grant of permission by the BoG for pre-fabricated construction. The work on administrative block and boys’ hostel was nearing completion. Infosys will be constructing the girls hostel and an academic block will be constructed. The Central and State governments have, so far, sanctioned more than 70 % of their shares of funding for the Rs. 128 crore project being undertaken under the Public-Private Partnership mode. The Central Government has a 50 % share, and the State Government contributes 35 % while industry partners in the IT sector have provided the remaining 15 % share. The III-T will conduct its third convocation for third batch of graduands at its new campus at Sethurapatti on July 31. Forty six graduands - 25 of Computer Science Engineering and 21 of Electronics and Communication Engineering - will receive their degrees at the ceremony to be conducted in online mode. Sixty three % of these students have been placed with packages ranging between Rs. 3.36 lakh and Rs. 19.5 lakh per annum, he said. Co-founder of Infosys and Founder and Chairman of Axilor Ventures Padma Bhushan Senapathy Kris Gopalakrishnan will be the chief guest for the convocation that will be attended by Chief Secretary, V. Irai Anbu, who is the Chairman of the Board of Governors for IIIT-Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iiit-tiruchi-to-offer-two-pg-programmes/article35598439.ece

Hepatitis is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by the hepatitis virus (HBV). Hepatitis B and C viruses spread by coming in contact with infected blood. Hepatitis B, in addition, can be sexually transmitted or passed on from mother to her child. Hepatitis A and E spread through contaminated food and water. Dean K. Vanitha said that awareness of the vaccination was necessary. A special screening camp was conducted for children at the GH. Meanwhile, healthcare workers were encouraged to take the booster dose as a precautionary measure. ‘They come in contact with blood on a daily basis so it is for their safety,’ she said.

Laying of road along the stretch is part of the construction of the barrage across the Kollidam. While the construction of barrage structure is nearing completion, the PWD is yet to form the road apparently due to the claim of the Forest Department that there is a reserve forest boundary along the proposed road. He visited the spot along with the officials of Revenue, PWD and the Forest. While the PWD was represented by Geetha, Executive Engineer, Special Projects, S.Sambathkumar, Assistant Conservator of Forest, participated on behalf of the Forest Department.

29 July 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Desist from booking false cases’||Cadre of the AIADMK staged demonstrations at various places in Tiruchi and other districts on Wednesday condemning the DMK government for not implementing its poll promises. Former Member of Parliament P. Kumar who is the party’s south district secretary led the demonstration organised at Sakthi Nagar near Tiruverumbur. He said the DMK had given 505 poll promises besides giving assurances district-wise in the run up to the Assembly elections. However, the party had failed to deliver on the promises it had made. The DMK government had failed to withdraw NEET as promised. The DMK government had betrayed the people by not reducing the prices of petrol and diesel. The prices of petrol and diesel had only increased after the elections. The party members raised slogans condemning the DMK government for displaying vengeful attitude against the AIADMK members and demanded the government not to book false cases. The demonstration at the AIADMK party office at Thennur here was headed by former Minister and the party’s Tiruchi urban district secretary Vellamandi Natarjan. The stir at Thillai Nagar in Tiruchi was headed by former Minister and the party’s north district secretary M. Paranjothi. Police sources said AIADMK members expressed their opposition against the DMK by holding placards at various places in Tiruchi city. Demonstrations were also held at various places in Perambalur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur and Ariyalur districts. Meanwhile, AIADMK deputy coordinator and Orathanadu MLA R. Vaithilingam on Wednesday said that his party would stage a demonstration against the Centre if it failed to prevent the construction of a dam at Mekedatu. Speaking to reporters at Thanjavur after heading a demonstration against the DMK government, Mr. Vaithilingam said the ruling DMK government should reduce the prices of petrol and diesel as promised and desist from booking false cases against AIADMK members. The DMK government should take steps to cancel NEET and immediately provide a monthly honorarium of Rs. 1,000 to housewives as promised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/desist-from-booking-false-cases/article35598445.ece

Party’s district secretary N. Ganesa Raja, who led the agitation held in front of his house in Thatchanallur here, raised slogans along with the party cadres. They raised slogans demanding the cutting down of fuel price, abolition of NEET, steps to reduce inflation, etc. Former Minister and Kovilpatti MLA Kadambur C. Raju, who staged a demonstration in front of his house at Chidambarapuram near Kadambur along with the party cadres, said Tamil Nadu, which was registering its “stupendous performance” in all departments and the ‘power surplus State’, was trailing behind in all fronts after the DMK came to power. The party, which promised in its manifesto of abolishment of NEET for medicine for the sake of winning the polls, had asked the students to get ready for this test in the eleventh hour, leaving the students in a confusion. “The DMK, which was desperately running behind the voters to return to power, had given false and impossible promises in its manifesto. Now, it is unable to fulfill those poll promises, leaving the people in trouble,” Mr. Raju said. The cadres organised similar agitations in front of their houses in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-cadre-stage-demo/article35598816.ece
29 July 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Fire in garbage yard||Fire that broke out in the Corporation’s garbage yard at Ramaiyanpatti on the city outskirts on Tuesday night was ravaging the dump till Wednesday evening with the westerly wind lashing this region. After the fire broke out in the garbage dump on Tuesday night for reasons yet to be ascertained, fire-tenders from Palayamkottai and Pettai Fire Stations rushed to the spot to start the firefighting operations. Though the timely operation contained the massive spread of the fire, the westerly wind blowing during this season every year made the task more challenging for the firefighters. Even as firefighting started, earthmovers were also roped in to search for the embers deep inside the garbage heaped all around. “Though the flame could be controlled, the task of searching for the embers continue and the exercise is likely to get wrapped on Thursday,” said the firefighters involved in the operation. Personnel attached to the Fire and Rescue Services prescribe that the Corporation should put in place the firefighting equipment at the garbage yard so that the steps to extinguish the fire could be taken instantly once the flame in the yard is spotted. “Whenever the westerly wind lashes this region fire breaks out in the Ramaiyanpatti garbage yard every year during this season to cause health hazards to the residents living nearby. The Corporation treats the sewage water and the treated water could be stored there to be used instantly for firefighting exercise by installing reasonably powerful motors. Moreover, fire retardants can be kept ready there. Since the fire-tenders either from Palayamkottai or Pettai would require at least 20 minutes to reach the garbage yard, the instant firefighting operation by the Corporation personnel will make the operation very effective,” said the firefighters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fire-breaks-out-in-garbage-yard/article35598472.ece
29 July 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Man held for murder||Moolaikkaraipatti police have arrested a youth for allegedly murdering his friend and relative by pushing him into the well in an inebriated condition. Police said construction worker A. Ramar, 36, of Munanjipatti under Moolaikkarai police station limits and his relative Sudalai, 41, of the same area were consuming liquor while sitting near a well close to the Pechi Amman Temple in the village on Tuesday night. When an altercation broke out between them, Sudalai allegedly pushed Ramar into the well. As the people in the vicinity informed the police and the Nanguneri Fire Station about the incident, police from Moolaikkaraipatti arrived at the spot and searched for the body of Ramar, which got trapped in the submerged stones. After the fire and rescue services personnel arrived at the place, steps to pump out the water from the well started after the midnight and the body was retrieved from well in the early hours of Wednesday. Since a grievous injury could be seen on the head of the deceased, the police suspect that Ramar, on being pushed into the well, could have hit the submerged stones inside the well. When Sudalai was picked up by the police, he reportedly confessed to have pushed his friend and relative into the well. The body was sent to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for a post-mortem. Further investigations are on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-held-for-murder/article35598473.ece

The protesting employees and the officials of BSNL said the Union Government should start the service immediately by providing all the equipment required for it. Moreover, steps should be taken to start the 5G services also as the private players were working aggressively on this cutting-edge technology to woo the subscribers. The Union Government, besides giving the arrears of Rs. 39,000 crore to be given to the BSNL, should disburse the salary to its employees and the officials on the last day of every month. Instead of selling the mobile phone signal transmission towers, the Union Government should take steps for maintaining and upgrading the towers, the protestors said.

29 July 2021||TIRUPATTUR,TAMIL NADU||Massive tree planting drive launched in Tirupattur district||Keeping in mind the onset of the northeast monsoon in the next few months, the Tirupattur administration has kick-started a massive tree planting drive. It plans to plant at least one crore saplings before the monsoon sets in, covering key areas like Ambur, Jolarpet and Vaniyambadi. A beginning to the green drive was made on Tuesday by planting 25,000 saplings in the towns. Along with local non-profit organisations like the Seed Birds Youth Club and the APJ Abdul Kalam Nature Retrieval Trust, the district administration has been spearheading the green campaign in all 195 villages. Separate teams have been formed by the Rural Development Department to monitor the planting drive. “Soil tests are conducted before planting these saplings in each area to suit the local weather conditions. Also, we wanted to have a data bank on the number of trees that will grow around the newly planted saplings in the next two years. This will help us determine the tree density that we are able to create over the next two years,” said Tirupattur Collector Amar Kushwaha. Plant varieties like ‘vaagai’ (Albizia lebbeck), ‘vembu’ (Azadirachta indica), ‘mantharai’ (Bauhinia purpurea), ‘punnai’ (Calophyllum inophyllum), ‘kalyana murungai’ (Erythrina variegata) and ‘arasamaram’ (Ficus religiosa) were among those planted as part of the drive. Volunteers roped in Plant species like guava, rose wood, ‘naval’ tree, ‘izhupai’ tree, mango and gooseberry were also planted. Each sapling was planted at a gap of 5-6 m to ensure that the roots were not affected. Volunteers have been roped in to water the plants twice a week for a period of one year. Tree guards, which would be removed after two years, were provided to shield the saplings from damage. Along with Jolarpet MLA K. Devaraji and Project Director (RD) Mahesh Babu, Mr. Kushwaha, planted saplings in Jolarpet and Vaniyambadi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/massive-tree-planting-drive-launched-in-tirupattur-district/article35598765.ece
29 July 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||BJP stages road blockade alleging vaccine shortage||Members of the BJP organised a road blockade near Veerapandi in Tiruppur alleging lack of adequate COVID-19 vaccine doses for the residents of Bharathi Nagar on Wednesday. R. Panneerselvam, district secretary of BJP IT Wing who organised the road blockade, claimed that Bharathi Nagar had over 5,700 registered voters but only around 360 residents had been administered the vaccine doses. Despite multiple representations to the district administration and the Corporation, the vaccination coverage had not improved in the past two months, he alleged. The BJP members and a few residents staged the road blockade on Palladam Main Road at around 8.30 a.m. According to the Tiruppur City Police, the Veerapandi police held talks with the 15 protesters assuring them of vaccination in the coming days and the blockade ended in 30 minutes. An official from the Tiruppur Corporation said that suitable action will be initiated in the issue after assessing their demands. No vaccination camps were held in the Corporation limits on Wednesday due to lack of vaccine stocks, he said. Meanwhile, the BJP members also submitted a petition to District Collector S. Vineeth on Wednesday seeking the organisation of special COVID-19 vaccination camps for migrant workers in Tiruppur.

More than 2.2 lakh plants and 150 varieties of flowers will be planted for the second season, officials said. Dahlias, marigolds, begonias and other varieties of flowering plants will be grown at the garden over the next few months. The Horticulture Department had grown around 5 lakhs plants for the summer festival season, and the 124th annual flower show this year, which had to be cancelled due to the pandemic. M. Radhakrishnan, Assistant Director of Horticulture, the Nilgiris, said with the ease in lockdown restrictions, almost all staff working for the department were now back at work. Previously, only staff members who lived close by to the garden were able to report for routine maintenance work. Officials said the pandemic had led to the cancellation of the flower show for two consecutive years, which had hit tourism in the Nilgiris. The Government Botanical Garden remains closed to tourists, but officials hope that with the number of daily reported COVID-19 cases declining across the State, that tourists could soon be allowed inside parks and gardens in the district. “Every day, around 200-300 tourists queue outside the garden hoping to be let inside. We hope that things improve in the coming weeks and the tourist spots across the district can be reopened,” said another official from the Horticulture Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/planting-begins-for-second-season-in-the-nilgiris/article35598477.ece

29 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘BJP has set situation right by appointing Bommai’||It is true that Veerashaiva Lingayats were upset at the removal of B.S. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister. However, the BJP national leadership has set the situation right by appointing Basavaraj Bommai, another Veerashaiva Lingayat leader, Sri Prasanna Renuka Veerasomeshwar Shivacharya Swamiji of Rambhapuri Peetha said in Belagavi on Wednesday. “The Veerashaiva Lingayat community, which forms a majority of the population, was unhappy that a much-loved Chief Minister was removed. But now, the BJP has corrected its mistake by appointing another leader from the same community,’’ he said. He was speaking at the Hukkeri Mutt in Belagavi. Mr. Basavraj Bommai is educated and has wide experience in different departments. There are no allegations against him and he has proven to be a good administrator and a wise politician, the seer said. There were three-four candidates for the post of Chief Minister. But the BJP chose Mr. Bommai. In choosing him, the BJP has proven that it is a party with a long-term vision, he said. It is also significant that the new Chief Minister was chosen unanimously, the seer said. “The new Chief Minister called me to seek my blessings. I hope that he strives for the all-round development of the State. He should implement the long-term plans that were drawn up by Mr. Yediyurappa and develop all parts of the State in a balanced manner,” he said. He demanded that the government shift offices to the Suvarna Soudha and hold the Assembly session in Belagavi. He urged MLAs from North Karnataka to support the new Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-has-set-situation-right-by-appointing-bommai/article35598501.ece
29 July 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Case under POCSO Act registered against 20-year-old and 13-year-old||The Belagavi police have registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act following allegations that a three-year-old was raped by two of her relatives in the city a few days ago. A case has been registered against a 20-year-old and his 13-year-old nephew. The victim’s relatives have complained to the police that the accused had sexually assaulted the child around a week ago. They said that a doctor suspected rape after screening the child who was experiencing some difficulties. The victim’s family members also allegedly assaulted the accused. The victim and the accused are now in the district hospital undergoing treatment. Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amathe said that a team headed by Assistant Commissioner of Police M. Chandrappa will investigate the issue. Police sources said that two women from Mumbai, who are related to the accused, gave a letter to the city police saying that the charges were false and that the accused were being targeted without reason. Meanwhile on Wednesday, members of women’s organisations appealed to the police that the accused be punished without trial. Traders of Bapat Galli went on a snap strike in protest against the alleged crime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/case-under-pocso-act-registered-against-20-year-old-and-13-year-old/article35598509.ece
29 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||A tightrope walk lies ahead for Bommai||Though Karnataka’s Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai is known as an able administrator and an affable politician, it is going to be a tightrope walk for him in the coming days as he needs to set the house in order by taking the rival factions within the BJP together. “There is no doubt that Mr. Bommai has a grip over administration and has a vision for development. But he needs the freedom to implement them. This would mean that he needs to be independent of his mentor B.S. Yediyurappa. But it is a difficult task that has to be done carefully,” observed a senior leader in the party State unit. Breaking walls The issue is not simple as Mr. Yediyurappa has a considerable hold on the Lingayat community which is the main support base of the party. Mr. Bommai needs to overshadow such issues by his performance. While there was a trust deficit between the Yediyurappa camp and the party old-timers, Mr. Bommai would now have to demolish the wall between them. “He has the shrewdness and acumen to do that. But he has to do that quickly as less than two years are left for the next Assembly polls,” observed another leader. The first challenge for Mr. Bommai would start soon as he needs to pick up his ministerial team. The composition of the Ministry was in fact one of the reasons for the rebellion during Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure as a sizeable chunk of ministerial posts had been occupied by “outsiders” who joined the party through ‘Operation Kamala’. This had made the party old-timers to feel that they have been left out. It remains to be seen how Mr. Bommai would handle this challenge as maintaining the status quo would hurt party old-timers. But any efforts to drastically change the pattern may put him at odds with Mr. Yediyurappa. This was evident when he announced the continuation of the Advocate-General appointed by his predecessor. Party insiders feel that many more such challenges are bound to surface, for instance when he transfers bureaucrats from the posts in which they were appointed during Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure. Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp may also not take kindly to any attempt to reduce funds for their constituencies. “While Mr. Bommai may not want to antagonise Mr. Yediyurappa so soon, indications of being a status quoist would dash the hopes of party old-timers. Also, it appears that the party high command too would want him to be independent of Mr. Yediyurappa, but without damaging the party’s electoral prospects,” said a former Minister. Defectors mill around The pressure on Mr. Bommai was visible within minutes of taking oath as Chief Minister as the MLAs who came from other parties to help the BJP form its governmentsurrounded him wherever he went in an obvious effort to lobby for themselves ahead of ministerial expansion. Some of the leaders recollect that the then Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda too faced a similar situation which finally paved the way for a friction between him and the Yediyurappa camp. On his part, Mr. Bommai has sought to clarify that Mr. Yediyurappa commands respect due to the hard work done by him to build the party that is what he referred to when he said he would follow in the elder leader’s footsteps. But the question is whether Mr. Bommai, who is known for political manoeuvring, will be able to emerge out of the shadow and find solutions to piquant situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-tightrope-walk-lies-ahead-for-bommai/article35598287.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||14-year-old girl recovers from cerebral mucormycosis||A 14-year-old girl from Ballari, one of the two children infected with cerebral mucormycosis in Karnataka, has recovered after nearly a two-month long battle against the post-COVID-19 infection. She was discharged on Wednesday from the State-run Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, where she was admitted on May 29. The girl, along with a 11-year-old boy from Challakere in Chitradurga district, are the first paediatric mucormycosis cases in the State. The boy, who subsequently developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), succumbed to post-COVID-19 complications on July 7. Both children had Type 1 diabetes that was diagnosed late. The infection had spread to the brain and eyes in both cases. Both had lost vision in one eye, said Chikkanarasa Reddy, professor of paediatrics at Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute. The girl, who was admitted for COVID-19 at Ballari district hospital, developed pain in the eyes at the time of discharge. Doctors, who suspected fungal infection, had referred her to Bowring hospital on May 29, Dr. Reddy said. He said the girl underwent five major surgeries – neuro (drainage of brain abscess), ENT, ophthalmology, dental, and plastic surgeries. “She has to undergo two more procedures for palate reconstruction and prosthetic rehabilitation. A prosthetic eye will be placed to create a balanced facial appearance and increase comfort in the eye socket where her eye is missing,” he explained. Dr. Reddy said these procedures will be done free of cost after three months. “I have attached her to the nearest centre in Ballari for regular follow up and have also arranged for free-of-cost follow up treatment, if required, with two friends who are private doctors. We will review her after one-and-a-half months in Bowring hospital,” he said. “We are happy that she has recovered. As per available literature, cerebral mucormycosis has 100% mortality rate,” the doctor added. R. Kayappa, the girl’s father, said he is indebted to the doctors at Bowring hospital for the care and treatment. “Dr. Reddy not only took good care and provided free treatment but also gave us post-discharge medicines. The doctors arranged for a farewell at the hospital and cut a cake to celebrate my daughter’s recovery,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/14-year-old-girl-recovers-from-cerebral-mucormycosis/article35598265.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Groundwater overexploited in four taluks in district: Study||Overexploitation of groundwater, a problem raised several times before, has once again found mention in the Department of Water Resources (DOWR), Government of India, Aquifer Mapping and Ground Water Management Plan. According to the plan, in the four taluks in Bengaluru Urban district [Bengaluru East, Bengaluru South, Bengaluru North, and Anekal] groundwater is overexploited. In 36% of the district, coming under city limits, water quality issues abound owing to pollution, apart from poor recharge. In the remaining 56%, the overexploitation is owing to the complete dependency on groundwater and unmindful drilling of borewells. J. Manjunath, Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru (Urban) district, told The Hindu that as per the DOWR study, the issues were different in urban and peripheral areas. In urban areas, apart from the demand and supply gap, urbanisation hindering recharge of ground water, the other issues were leakage of pipes and mining/theft/ pollution of groundwater. In peripheral areas, the problems were pertaining to the increase and deepening of borewells and drying up of the Arkavathy, the Kumudvathi, and the Hesaraghatta reservoir. “There were some recommendations for tackling each of these issues, which include dual piping for potable and non-potable water, reuse of grey water, adopting scientific augmentation of groundwater recharge, reduction of unaccounted for water to less than 20%, and other measures in line with order of the National Green Tribunal to prevent pollution of waterbodies,” he said. Other recommendations included extending the Cauvery water supply to peripheral areas, using grey water for irrigation, and involving citizens’ groups and local communities in rejuvenation of rivers and waterbodies. The district administration had also taken up various activities, such as safeguarding waterbodies and restoring the original drain network by clearing encroachments, preventing sewage and effluents from entering the drains and water bodies, and filling up tanks and lakes with treated water. “A survey of 837 lakes in the district has been taken up and an encroachment clearance drive to restore the original drain network is also under way. We are adopting a multi-pronged approach to improve percolation and recharge ground water levels,” he said. Water experts, however, pointed out that though several reports and studies had pointed out to the issues mentioned by the DOWR, precious little had been done on the ground. S. Vishwanath, water conservationist, said that as per rules the Karnataka Ground Water Authority should devise a water management plan. However, the authority is woefully understaffed. “Apart from regulating permissions for drilling borewells, the authority should also ensure the borewells are metered. This will help understand how much water is being drawn, how many borewells have failed,” he said and added that as per estimates, there were over four lakh borewells in the city, of which a mere fraction were probably registered and far lesser metered. Rules also stipulated that every borewell have a recharge structure. But, in reality, very few borewells that are drilled have such a feature. This, he said, was one of the main reasons for the overexploitation of groundwater. With silt accumulated in many water bodies, there is no chance for groundwater recharge. The waterbodies had not even been measured for the recharge rate, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/groundwater-overexploited-in-four-taluks-in-district-study/article35598246.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||It was a 15-minute simple ceremony||The swearing-in ceremony of Shiggaon Basavaraj Bommai at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday marked the end of weeks of confusion and firmly put in place the 30th Chief Minister of the State. He has about 22 months of the remaining term in the 15th Legislative Assembly. The ceremony was completed in less than 15 minutes. The 61-year-old leader, son of the former Chief Minister and Union Minister late S.R. Bommai, was a unanimous choice for the post at the BJP Legislature Party meeting held here on Tuesday. Mr. Bommai was administered the oath of office at a simple ceremony held at the Glass House on the sprawling Raj Bhavan premises by Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot. Clad in a kurtha-pyjama and a saffron shawl, Mr. Bommai took oath in the name of God amid slogan shouting of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”. His family members, including wife, Channamma, and children Bharath and Aditi, were present.Mr. Bommai became the second political leader to occupy the chair once held by his father in 1988. The other leader to have been successful in emulating his father is Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy whose father, H.D. Deve Gowda, was the Chief Minister of the State between 1994 and 1996. In a cheerful mood, the outgoing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was among those who made it to the venue early, and posed for photographs with Mr. Bommai, and the former Minister Murugesh Nirani, who too was a strong contender for the post before the name was finalised. Among those present were Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and BJP general secretary in charge of Karnataka Arun Singh and a host of former Cabinet colleagues of Mr. Yediyurappa and party legislators hopeful of making it to the Cabinet. BJP State vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra, the younger son of Mr. Yediyurappa, who had been in the eye of a storm over allegations of corruption during his father’s tenure, was also present. Skip the event Two former Chief Ministers H.D. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah, representing the Opposition parties, did not turn up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/it-was-a-15-minute-simple-ceremony/article35598290.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||IISc. developed oxygen generation system installed||An oxygen generation system based on technology developed at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) was installed at the Pobbathi Medical Centre here. The system has been designed based on a multi-species gas separation process for hydrogen production. It was inaugurated by Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), on Tuesday. The installation was carried out by Electrowing Technologies, a Bengaluru-based company, and supported by the Give India Foundation in association with Zerodha. According to a release, the team conceptualised and developed an oxygen generation system based on a swing adsorption process, which uses low power and meets the specifications defined by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), last year. “The process involves drawing ambient air through a compressor along with a conditioning system to remove any contaminants before separating oxygen. The separation happens within a twin-bed Swing Adsorption system integrated with small storage and discharge vessels and various safety systems. The oxygen produced fulfils the quality requirements prescribed by Indian Pharmacopeia and can be used in ICUs/CCUs/OTs and other clinical wards,” the IISc. release explained To cater to the pressing oxygen need in India, the team developed an open-source design for a 50 LPM medical oxygen plant and has also signed technology transfer agreements with four agencies from across the country for installing oxygen generation systems at various capacities (50 LPM-1000 LPM) to meet the requirements of hospitals. The system installed at Pobbathi Medical Centre, which is the first unit based on this technology, is designed for generating medical-grade oxygen at 50 LPM with oxygen purity around 93%. “It is IoT-enabled for continuous and remote monitoring from any location having a mobile signal. This would allow stakeholders to assess the health of the oxygen generator and enable timely service intervention, thereby enhancing the reliability of the system,” the release added. The IISc. team is also seeking support for implementing oxygen generation systems at smaller 50-bed hospitals in a mission mode, using the process developed at the institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/iisc-developed-oxygen-generation-system-installed/article35598269.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Can ideological ambivalence prove to be a strength for him?||Basavaraj Bommai is the first BJP Chief Minister in the State to come from outside of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) stables. Strategists say this, in fact, may push him to prove his “ideological commitment” to the party more strongly. In keeping with the tradition followed by Sangh Parivar leaders in the past,Mr. Bommai too visited Keshava Krupa, the RSS headquarters in the State, just after staking claim with the Governor to form the government. Mr. Bommai’s father, late S. R. Bommai, a senior socialist from the Janata Parivar, was influenced by Marxist thinker M.N. Roy’s Radical Humanism. Junior Bommai also started his career with the Janata Dal and joined the BJP only in 2008. “From our experience of working with him, he is not stuck to his socialist roots. He has not only made his peace with liberalisation of the economy, but has also evidently grown more comfortable with the party’s ideology and the RSS,” said a senior BJP leader. His decision to not follow B.S. Yediyurappa to the Karnataka Janata Party in 2012 was also a big step in proving his credentials to the party, and played a key role in his elevation despite not being from the RSS stables, sources said. Over the last two years when he held key portfolios of Home and Law, he was increasingly seen as a vocal supporter of key ideological issues that emerged during the time — NRC-CAA, law on cow slaughter ban, and the “love jihad” law. Police crackdown on anti-CAA protests in Mangaluru that ended in firing on protesters and his dealing with D.J. Halli violence have also been noted favourably by the party. However, a senior RSS leader said while he made all the right noises on ideological issues over the last two years, he did not act decisively, indicating his recent ideological tilt may also be a “strategy to endear himself to the party”. Just like Mr. Yediyurappa, Mr. Bommai is not “instinctively communal” and his frame of thinking is not Hindutva, but like the former, he is unlikely to prove a hurdle to any ideological agenda of the Sangh Parivar, a senior bureaucrat who has earlier worked closely with both said. But being known to be not a hardliner will help him reach out to a larger section of society and also across party lines, the bureaucrat added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/can-ideological-ambivalence-prove-to-be-a-strength-for-him/article35598275.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BMTC to receive prototype of electric bus by August 10||The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is likely to receive a prototype of an electric bus (e-bus) by August 10. Prior to the second wave of COVID-19, the corporation had selected NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd. as an operator to run 90 non-AC e-buses under the Bengaluru smart city project. Due to the pandemic, the operator could not provide the e-buses. Officials now say that by August 10, a prototype of the e-bus, as per the specifications mentioned in the tender, will be provided by the operator. The prototype will be operated on the city’s roads. “The operator is supplying a nine-metre-long 31-seater e-bus. It will be operated on the city’s roads to assess whether the vehicle has been built as per specifications. If approved, the operator will provide the rest of the e-buses in batches. The corporation is likely to get all the 90 e-buses in six months,” said an official. The BMTC will operate the e-buses on Gross Cost Contract basis. The corporation will pay Rs. 51 per kilometre as operational cost to the operator, including for power consumption. FAME scheme In addition to the smart city project, the corporation also plans to operate e-buses under FAME II scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India). Though, a tender was floated earlier, it was cancelled as the operational cost quoted by bidders was not feasible for BMTC. The corporation had plans to operate 300 AC e-buses under FAME II. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, a majority of the AC e-buses remained off the roads, forcing the BMTC to change the plan and float a tender for operating 300 non-AC e-buses. Officials said that tender evaluation is in progress. The pandemic has also hit the plan of operating 1,500 diesel buses through a private operator. Though the tender was floated in March 2021, it is said that the date for bid submission has been pushed back citing COVID-19. Leasing of buses from private operators is being opposed by employees’ unions, who accused the State government of laying the foundation for privatisation of the road transport corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmtc-to-receive-prototype-of-electric-bus-by-august-10/article35598247.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Justice for Stan Swamy: Candlelight march held||Demanding justice for the late Fr. Stan Swamy and all unjustly accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, the faculty and students of various institutions and representatives of civil societies observed a silent candlelight march on Museum Road on Wednesday. According to a release, the participants urged the Centre to free human rights defenders and undertrial prisoners languishing in jails in appalling conditions. Organised by the Jesuit Provincial of South Asia, the National Justice Day event was held to urge the government to defend democracy, to repeal Sedition Law, Unlawful Atrocities (Prevention) Act, and repressive State laws, and to restore citizens’ right to dissent. The march was preceded with a keynote address by social activist Shiv Sundar at St Joseph’s Boys High School auditorium. Mr. Sundar emphasised that the ideals of democracy are crumbling in the country. Pointing to the death of Fr. Stan, he said the country can speak of democracy only during elections. All the accused in the Bhima Koregaon case are falsely accused as they were fighting for the welfare of the tribals much against the interest of the corporates. He also added that all governments be it UPA or NDA have only served the interests of the corporates, the release said. The programme was presided over by Fr. Dionysius Vaz SJ, provincial of Karnataka Jesuit Province. Fr. Vaz said: “Fr. Stan Swamy’s death is not an end; it is yet another moment of awakening in our journey to affirm our faith in the Constitution of our country. Amidst growing inequalities, violence, atrocities, discrimination and exclusion in our country, ‘not to be a silent spectator’ is the message that Fr. Stan Swamy left for us. He inspired us to spread the values of the Preamble to the Constitution of our country, as the caged bird can still sing and sing in chorus.” He urged the participants to carry forward the legacy of Fr. Stan Swamy by showing solidarity with the voiceless and the marginalied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/justice-for-stan-swamy-candlelight-march-held/article35598249.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Extended Purple Line will begin operations in Aug.’||Will commercial operations on the extended Purple Line of Namma Metro on Mysuru Road, which was initially slated for a 2020 opening, finally begin in August? Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) managing director Anjum Parwez has expressed confidence that the line will be opened for commercial operations by next month. Officials are waiting for a date for safety inspections to be conducted on the 7-km line from Mysuru Road station to Kengeri. Documents submitted “Documents required by the office of the Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety (CMRS) have been submitted. Once we get the safety clearance, commercial operations will start by August,” said Mr. Parwez, who visited the metro stations of the extended line along with other senior officials on Tuesday.

29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ED attaches assets worth Rs. 4.9 crore||Enforcement Directorate officials on Wednesday provisionally attached assets worth Rs. 4.98 crore in connection with its probe into the SyndicateBank fraud case. The fraud dates back to November 2019 when the police arrested bank employee and alleged mastermind, Vijay Akash, and two of his relatives for allegedly diverting Rs. 50 crore belonging to the Karnataka State Agricultural Marketing Board (KSAMB), which was transferred to the bank as a fixed deposit. The Central agency said it took up the probe based on an FIR filed by the Commercial Street police against Akash, Mohamed Musthafa, M.D. Jairam (then Assistant Branch Manager of SyndicateBank, Uttarahalli Branch Bengaluru), and others. The investigation revealed that Akash along with other accused opened a fake current account in SyndicateBank in the name of KSAMB. It was operated by Musthafa, who impersonated the account officer of KSAMB, based on fabricated documents such as board resolution, ID card, and the KSAMB letterhead. The accused, using fraudulent means, succeeded in transferring Rs. 50 crore to the fake current account, ED said in a release. After the money was transferred to the account, Musthafa with the help of Jairam and others subsequently transferred Rs. 47,16,62,500 into various bank accounts belonging entities, persons etc.. “The bank accounts of each of those entities/persons were used to withdraw money in the form of cash and to buy jewellery and land by the accused and their accomplices. Accordingly, identified assets in the form of the balances in the bank accounts used for money laundering, jewellery and land to the tune of Rs. 4.98 crore in the form of movable and immovable properties have been provisionally attached under the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act. Further investigation is under progress,” said ED.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-49-cr-in-bank-fraud-case/article35598255.ece
29 July 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Message against family politics and corruption’||Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, BJP MLA, who had raised the banner of revolt against the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, on Wednesday said the change of guard was a message by the party high command that it would not tolerate nepotism and corruption. “By executing such a big task, the BJP high command has sent a strong message against family politics and corruption,” he told reporters in Bengaluru soon after Basavaraj Bommai took oath as Chief Minister. He claimed that the high command had also sent a message to the new Chief Minister that there should not be interference by family members in administration, or any sort of corruption. When asked if Mr. Bommai would become a shadow Chief Minister under his mentor Mr. Yediyurappa, Mr. Yatnal said such a possibility was ruled out as Mr. Bommai was an able leader. Mr. Yatnal said he would join the ministry if the high command directs him to do so. “I will happily work as a party MLA if they do not want me to be a Minister,” he said. Mr. Yatnal had taken a vow not to shave his beard till Mr. Yediyurappa is removed from the post. He attended Mr. Bommai’s swearing-in ceremony with a clean-shaven face.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/message-against-family-politics-and-corruption/article35598283.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Nobody is an outsider’||BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi said on Wednesday that once a leader joins them, they cannot be seen as an “outsider” any more. Anointing Himanta Biswa Sarma, a former Congressman, and Mr. Bommai, a former Janata Parivar leader, as Chief Ministers in Assam and Karnataka, respectively, was proof of that, he argued. A senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader said, “S. Bangarappa who joined the party in 2004 and quit two years later, charged us of following a ‘garbhagudi samskruti’, not allowing outsiders into the sanctum sanctorum . However, after that too the party has welcomed many leaders and with the elevation of Mr. Bommai as Chief Minister, this accusation has finally been proved wrong.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nobody-is-an-outsider/article35598291.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru among ‘top 11 cycling pioneers’||Bengaluru is among the cities that was awarded the title, ‘India’s top 11 cycling pioneers’, by the Centre as part of the India Cycles4Change Challenge. The selected cities will receive Rs. 1 crore each to scale up their cycling initiatives. In 2020, with public transport hamstrung by the spread of COVID-19, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry had invited cities to come up with quick solutions to promote cycling. As many as 107 cities came together to test, learn, and scale up different cycling-friendly initiatives, kickstarting India’s cycling revolution, said the MoHUA in a release. Twenty-five cities had been shortlisted earlier this year, following which a jury comprising national and international transport experts selected the 11 cities. Other metros to make it to the list include Bhuvaneshwar, Chandigarh, Nagpur and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra, and three cities from Gujarat--Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Bengaluru is the only large city to be selected in the top 11. “That’s because we have agencies like the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT), which have prioritised sustainable mobility and public transport for years. It is one of the few cities where permanent infrastructure has been put in place. That was a plus which worked to our benefit, and Bengaluru Smart City Limited stepped up,” said Bengaluru’s Bicycle Mayor, Sathya Sankaran. As part of the plan for the challenge, Bengaluru built on the idea of pop-up cycle lanes and launched a platform, the Sustainability Mobility Accord, to crowd-source and create cycling neighbourhoods. “When we met last August to discuss the challenge, we had started the pop-up bicycle lane. Smart City decided to extend the pop-up bicycle lanes.” Second phase So what’s next? In the second phase, all cities will be encouraged to expand their initiatives. Mr. Sankaran pointed out that Bengaluru has a long way to go before it is cycle friendly. “We can’t rest on our laurels. We need to push for more infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists. We should target cycle lanes on at least 2,000 km of roads within BBMP limits. Funding, from the Centre and the State, will go a long way in making this a reality. The Comprehensive Mobility Plan accounts for 600 km of cycle tracks; let’s begin with that,” said Mr. Sankaran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-among-top-11-cycling-pioneers/article35598260.ece
29 July 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Has govt. fixed timeline to vaccinate entire population?’||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday asked the State government whether it has fixed a timeline to vaccinate the entire population of eligible group with COVID-19 vaccines. The court also asked the government to explain the claim that children would be given routine immunisation in anganwadis and schools when the institutes are closed. A Special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the direction while hearing PIL petitions on issues related to the pandemic. The government told the court that “routine immunisation at schools had resumed, and children up to the age of 5 are being vaccinated in anganwadis, while children between the ages of 10 and 16 are being vaccinated at schools.” On the availability of vaccines, the government told the Bench that around 55.06 lakh doses (42.6 lakh doses under government quota and 12.45 lakh doses under private hospitals quota) for Covishield and 8.06 lakh doses (6.12 lakh doses for government quota and 1.93 lakh doses for private hospital quota) of Covaxin would be made available by the Central government for August.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/has-govt-fixed-timeline-to-vaccinate-entire-population/article35598263.ece

I had worked as a Minister under him earlier, so I had no issues. But Mr. Bommai worked in my Cabinet as a Minister and it won’t be nice for me to work in his Cabinet. So I have opted out.” He added that he would work for the party organisation.

In a press release, BIAL, the operator of the airport, said it had developed 315 rainwater recharging pits on KIA campus. Drains were built to direct excess water to Bettakote lake, a water body located adjacent to the airport. In another initiative, rainwater from the terminal rooftop was collected and stored in harvesting sumps, while a 2.5 million litres per day capacity sewage treatment plant was developed to recycle water. This is now used for landscape irrigation, ventilation and air conditioning, and firefighting requirements. “With a large number of passengers arriving and departing every day, KIA requires millions of litres of water for maintenance of infrastructure and operations. Instead of relying on municipal water supply, BIAL initiated a series of initiatives aimed at improving water resources,” stated the release. BIAL also installed rooftop rainwater harvesting units in five villages to provide safe drinking water. KIA had achieved net energy neutral status in 2020-21. With this, it has been able to save nearly 22 lakh units, enough to power nearly 9,000 houses a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kia-achieves-100-water-positive-target/article35598253.ece

Despite his rise to high positions in politics, he is still the same Basu or Basanna for his childhood friends,” recalled several of Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s classmates in Hubballi on Wednesday. Basavaraj Bommai’s friends and classmates Rajanikanth Mahajan, Meghasham Ladhad, Murugesh Bendigeri, Ashwin Shangvi, Gautam Burat, Pankaj Thakkar, Raja Desai and Mahendra Singhi assembled at their school, Rotary English Medium School, in Hubballi on Wednesday to celebrate their classmate’s elevation to the Chief Minister’s post. Recalling playing gunda (or goli gundu), a traditional game played with marble or small glass balls, in which Bommai was an expert, his classmate Ashwin Shangvi remembered how Basu used to win all the time and he would lose. “He would win all my marbles and would return none even if I pleaded. But he is gem of a friend. For him, politics is not a profession but a service to people. I am confident that he will win the hearts of all by his good work,” Ashwin Shangvi said. Another classmate Gautum Burat recalled how Bommai heeded his request of helping a girl, their classmate, in the examination. He also recalled how even today Bommai recalls him taking his (Gautam’s) bicycle for a ride. His plus point is his friendly nature, he said. Rajanikanth Mahajan recalled Bommai’s love for cricket. “Weekend meant cricket; we would play cricket for hours together,” he said. His junior and schoolmate Mahendra Singhi, a Congress leader, said that Bommai stood above petty politics. “He is very friendly and a connoisseur of Hindi shayari and cultural programmes. He would attend cultural programmes such as Dandia and Garba till 4 a.m. at times,” Mahendra Singhi said. His friend, political opponent and secretary of NLE Society (which runs Rotary School) Raja Desai recalled his first election, with Basavaraj Bommai. “In 1994, I contested against Bommai (Janata Dal) as a Congress candidate and Jagadish Shettar was the BJP candidate. There was no political rivalry. In fact, on the day of results, Bommai picked me from my home to the counting centre,” he recalled. Despite his high position, Bommai loves to interact in singular terms with old friends, he said. Assembling at their school, these friends recalled various anecdotes related to Bommai and expressed the confidence that their friend would do good work for the State, particularly North Karnataka to which he belongs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bommais-classmates-recall-his-simplicity-hope-he-will-do-good/article35598507.ece
29 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Panchamashali seer reminds Bommai of quota deadline||Basavaraj Bommai, then Home Minister, was part of a ministerial delegation that met the Panchamashali community protesters who were demanding reservation under 2A category earlier this year, and assured that a decision would be taken by September-end. “Now that Mr. Bommai is the Chief Minister, we hope that a decision is taken before the September deadline. If not, then the community will resume its indefinite agitation from October 1,” said Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami of Lingayat Panchamashali Peetha of Kudalasangama. The community had pushed for a man from their subsect to be appointed to the Chief Minister’s post. However, they find some consolation in a Lingayat (Mr. Bommai is from Sadar subsect) being sworn in as the Chief Minister, replacing B.S. Yediyurappa. Names of two leaders from Panchamashali subsect — Murugesh Nirani and Arvind Bellad — were also doing the rounds as probables. “But we are happy that Mr. Bommai, a Lingayat, has been chosen. Mr. Bommai was one among the Cabinet Ministers of the BJP government who extended support and cooperation to the mega Panchamasali padayatra to Bengaluru to demand 2A reservation. We welcome his appointment as Chief Minister,” he said. The seer said the Panchamashali community was still hopeful that a suitable political representation would be given. “Through the Panchamashali padayatra the whole country has seen the strength of the community. We are hopeful that the BJP leadership will consider the significance of the community’s support in the government formation,” the seer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panchamashali-seer-reminds-bommai-of-quota-deadline/article35598279.ece
29 July 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||NK throws special challenges for new CM||As north Karnataka rejoices over the elevation of a man from the region to the Chief Minister’s post, there are expectations galore from people who often say they receive “stepmotherly treatment” from those in power. Basavaraj Bommai, who took oath as the 30th Chief Minister of Karnataka on Wednesday, is the eighth leader from the region to occupy the post. And he is the second leader from north Karnataka after Jagadish Shettar to hold the Chief Minister’s post within the last decade. But unlike Mr. Shettar and his father late S.R. Bommai (1988-89) who got just over nine months at the helm of affairs, Mr. Bommai is likely to have a longer tenure of 22 months. The fact that Mr. Bommai knows the problems of the region right from his father’s days as Chief Minister and that he himself was part of various movements that highlighted the regional imbalance have only increased his responsibilities. As a Chief Minister from north Karnataka, the first and foremost issue that would haunt Mr. Bommai is the long-pending issue of sharing Mahadayi river waters, which is still caught in the legal wrangles despite a verdict from the tribunal. He once led a mammoth ‘padayatra’ on the Mahadayi issue. Mismatch The other big challenge is the Upper Krishna Project (UKP), for which, despite tall claims about larger allocation, Karnataka is yet to come up with projects for full utilisation of the allocated share of waters from the basin. There is a mismatch between the fiscal and physical progress in the UKP which needs urgent attention and mobilising huge funds for the project and rehabilitation is yet another challenge. Also, despite a lot of talk about addressing regional imbalance based on recommendations of D.M. Nanjundappa committee, the issue still requires a focussed approach from the government. A study from Dharwad-based Centre for Multi Disciplinary Research has found that there has been no significant development in the backward taluks identified by the committee. While Mr. Bommai has managed to emerge as a consensual candidate for the post, there are several hurdles on his path, particularly concerning the place he hails from.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nk-throws-special-challenges-for-new-cm/article35598281.ece

Shivakumar, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah, Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council S.R. Patil, and other senior leaders will participate. The meeting is being held keeping in mind the forthcoming elections to zilla panchayats, municipal corporation, and Assembly bypolls. “This is the second in the series of organisational meeting . The first one was held in Tumakuru and the next one will be in Mysuru,” he said. He said that those office-bearers, who were not active, will be replaced with active members and those who were active will be promoted to senior positions. Mr. Saleem Ahmed said that former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa should clarify the reason for his tears on the day of his resignation. “Whether he was made to step down forcefully or for corruption charges, should be clarified by the BJP leaders,” he demanded. Clarifying that the row over next chief ministerial candidate of Congress was a closed chapter now , he said that the party high command had asked the leaders to face election on mass leadership.

Ms. Navvya, who has been with the PHC since August last year, said that their visits to the hamlet with three families came after 27 persons tested positive for COVID-19. “Like in other rural areas, people from the hamlet too were diffident to come to the PHC for tests. We had to reach their houses to collect samples,” she said. After going a distance in a four-wheeler, Ms. Navvya and her colleagues had to walk across the stream to reach the hamlet. With telecommunication network signals being poor, Ms. Navvya said that they had to search for vantage points in the hamlet for uploading from their smartphone data about samples collected. These samples are coded at the PHC and then sent for tests at the KVG Medical College in Sullia. “We are happy over the words of encouragement from the Health Minister,” said Ms. Navvya, who has been serving as lab technician for four years now.

29 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Will Mysuru region now get representation in Ministry?||The proposed reconstitution of the Ministry under new Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has once again revived hopes of representation for Mysuru and adjoining districts of Chamarajanagar and Kodagu in the government. The three districts went without any representationduring the last two years of BJP rule under B.S. Yediyurappa. The BJP has three MLAs in Mysuru district including S.A. Ramdas, who had served as Minister for Medical Education in the erstwhile BJP government, two in Kodagu district and one in Chamarajanagar. Yet, the region received no representation. While adjoining Hassan district too went without any representation, Mandya district, however, received representation when K.C. Narayana Gowda, who was among the 17 MLAs from other parties to join the BJP, won from K.R. Pet Assembly constituency and became a Minister in the Yediyurappa government. Mysuru district had MLAs from Bengaluru – V. Somanna and S.T. Somashekar – as the district-in-charge Ministers since the Yediyurappa government came to power two years ago. Barring Mr. Ramdas, three out of the four BJP MLAs in Mysuru and Chamajaranagar district are first-time MLAs - Nagendra representing Chamaraja, Harshavardhan representing Nanjangud,and Niranjan Kumar from Gundlupet. However, neighbouring Kodagu district is represented by two veteran BJP politicians in the Assembly – former Speaker K.G. Bopaiah and five-time MLA Appachu Ranjan. While Mr. Ramdas has articulated his aspiration for a ministerial berth several times in the past by citing the need for regional representation from the perspective of regional development, Nanjangud MLA Harshavardhan is also hopeful of securing a berth. Mr. Harshavardhan, who is also the son-in-law of former Minister and veteran Dalit leader V. Srinivas Prasad, hopes to make it to the Ministry if the party leadership decides to ask senior leaders to make way for new faces. However, political circles are agog with discussions on how the ruling party faces the same political compulsions that Mr. Yediyurappa had to encounter during his regime. The issue of regional representation may have to be sacrificed yet again at the altar of political exigencies that includes priority to accommodate the new entrants from other parties, who had facilitated the formation of the party government two years ago, said a BJP leader on condition of anonymity. “The pact new-comers had with Mr. Yediyurappa will continue in the Ministry to be formed by Mr. Bommai”. BJP leaders argued that the political exigencies and caste calculations may outweigh regional representation again. However, BJP’s Mysuru City spokesperson Mohan M.A. said the party was hopeful of securing representation in the proposed Ministry under Mr. Bommai.

29 July 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Post-lockdown, ‘Ambari’ may hit the road from August 1||With the sharp drop in COVID-19 cases and reopening of many popular tourist sites in and around Mysuru and also in neighbouring districts, the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) is considering resuming its Ambari open-roof bus tours in Mysuru from August 1. The initiative became a reality after a long wait in March this year. However, the buses were taken off the road after the pandemic situation worsened and a lockdown was announced. With the lockdown curbs eased and the stakeholders hoping for revival of tourism, the KSTDC is hoping to attract visitors once again with Ambari. When launched, the double-decker buses were the newest attraction for tourists in Mysuru as the bus tour assisted them experience the city which is known for magnificent palaces and buildings with architectural marvels. The launch planned in 2020 was delayed owing to the pandemic, and for technical reasons. Out of six open-roof buses, four had been allotted to Mysuru and two to Hampi, which is a world heritage site. The launch in Hampi is expected soon. Inspired by London’s Big Bus Tours, the KSTDC came up with the idea of Ambari and the buses were flagged off by the then Tourism Minister C.P. Yogeshwar in the presence of stakeholders of the tourism industry. Sources in the KSTDC told The Hindu that preparations were on for resuming Ambari from August 1. Tourists can buy tickets at the KSTDC office on JLB Road as online sales are yet to be made available. The ticket has been priced at Rs. 250 per person. The 40-seater bus, with lower and upper decks, was built in Bengaluru. The body wrapping of the bus was done keeping in view the State’s art forms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations. “KSTDC is gradually resuming its tours and packages seeing the public response. We have resumed the Tirupati package from Bengaluru. Likewise, the Ambari tour is also expected to be resumed with the pandemic situation coming under control. Taking all necessary precautions, the service will be restarted,” the sources add. It’s a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to glimpse the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. The bus route covers Hotel Mayura KSTDC office, Deputy Commissioner’s office, Crawford Hall, Kukkarahalli Lake, University of Mysore, Folklore Museum, Ramaswamy Circle, Palace Karikallu Thotti, Jayamarthanda Gate of the palace, zoo, Karanji Lake, Jockey Quarters’ Circle, Snow City, Chamundi Vihar Stadium, St. Philomena’s Church, Bannimantap, and City Railway Station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/post-lockdown-ambari-may-hit-the-road-from-august-1/article35598728.ece
29 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||CM urged to announce SAP for sugarcane||The State Sugarcane Cultivators Association has urged the new Chief Minister, Basavaraj Bommai, to focus on the problems being faced by farmers and help them tide over the financial crisis. Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the association, said that the State Advisory Price (SAP) for sugarcane for 2021-22 was yet to be fixed though the sugar mills have started procuring and crushing cane. He said as per the Sugar Control Act 1966, the mills are supposed to complete the payment to farmers within 14 days of procuring the crop from them. But the government was yet to announce the SAP and hence the farmers are in dire straits. He lashed out at the Centre and said that it has only raised the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) by Rs. 10 to Rs. 2,850 per tonne for 2020-21 which did not even cover the input costs while claiming all the while that the government wants to double farmers’ income by 2022. The cost of cultivation varies from around Rs. 3,200 to Rs. 3,500 per tonne. Hence Mr. Shanthakumar urged Mr. Bommai to announce the State’s own SAP for sugarcane. The Association demanded that the cost of transportation of sugarcane from fields to crushing units should be borne by the mills. The association also reiterated its demand of making it mandatory for all mills to share the profits accruing out of the sale of sugarcane byproducts such as ethanol and bagasse. None of the mills have done so though the law provides for it. Though the Centre claims that the subsidy towards fertilizers, drip irrigation, insecticides etc., was around Rs. 70,000 crore, the State government has imposed GST which varied from 5 per cent to 18 per cent. It should be brought down to 1 per cent. Compensation for crop loss due to floods, drought etc is not extended to sugarcane and farmers did not have a safety net. The government should bring sugarcane under Fasal Bima Yojane and provide relief to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-urged-to-announce-sap-for-sugarcane/article35598722.ece

Students must work hard to become successful. The facilities for the present generation students are plentiful and online education has come as a benefit for them to get educated sitting at home.” Mr. Chethan told students to become determined and set a goal for themselves so that they could achieve it without any hurdles. “When I was a PU student, I used to catch an early morning train to Tumakuru from Arsikere to attend CET coaching classes. I used to get up at 3.30 a.m. and catch the train at 4.30 a.m. Despite the hurdles, I was determined to achieve my goal,” the SP said.

The coaching is free for government PU college students who can enrol by getting a letter from the principals of the respective colleges, he said. Prof. Sathyanarayana Gowda said the CET coaching was planned for the first time since this year’s admission to professional courses was based on the marks obtained by the students in the CET. It is crucial now since marks in second PU won’t be considered for admissions as announced by the government. A nominal sum of Rs. 1,000 is being charged for the course. “Our effort is expected to help the poor and students from rural areas,” he said, thanking Prof .Vdyashankar for agreeing to start the course.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ksou-offers-cet-coaching-for-rural-students/article35598726.ece

29 July 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||As chicken prices cross Rs. 260 per kg, poultry industry seeks import of soybean||Concerned over the surge in prices of soybean, a chief constituent of poultry feed, the Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Breeders’ Association (KPFBA) has urged the Centre to allow the import of soybean meal. Attributing the rise in retail price of chicken beyond Rs. 260 per kg to the shortage of poultry feed, KPFBA president Sushanth Rai said the cost of production of chicken almost doubled in less than a year, mainly on account of the surge in poultry feed cost. The price of soya, which was Rs. 35 per kg last year, was now Rs. 80 per kg. The price of maize had increased from Rs. 15 per kg to Rs. 25 per kg, making it difficult for poultry farmers to source quality feed. “The cost of production of chicken had increased from Rs. 70 per kg to Rs. 120 per kg,” Mr. Rai said in the statement. Hence, immediate remedial measures were necessary to help poultry farmers, whose troubles worsened owing to the pandemic. Mr. Rai urged the Union government to allow duty-free import of 12 lakh tonnes of soybean meal to overcome the crisis. “Also, the government should take strict action against traders hoarding soybean meal, resulting in a shortage and a rise in prices,” he said, pointing out that many poultry farmers were quitting the business. He urged the government to also look at the issue from the health perspective and claimed that chicken had been endorsed by the WHO as an immunity-booster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/poultry-industry-seeks-import-of-soybean/article35598508.ece

Bekal DySP Sunil Kumar, who headed the team that rescued Anwar, said they were able to track down the four abductors and carry out the rescue operation with the help of the Karnataka police. He said Anwar had come to Uduma with his boss, Nazar, a resident of Karipur, who runs a fertilizer company. They had been collecting hair from barbershops in the district for use as raw material. They were staying in a lodge at Uduma. Believing that they had a lot of money with them, a helper at the lodge informed the abductors, said Mr. Kumar. When the gang tried to abduct Nazar, he managed to escape but Anwar was caught by the gang. When they realised that he had no money, they demanded Rs. 2 lakh as ransom to free him. “We were able to track and identify their movements and we continued to chase them and inform the Mangaluru police about their locations,” he said. The Manguluru police tried to stop the gang but they gave them the slip after crashing through the barricades at many places along the way. The car used by the gang was finally stopped by the police after they barricaded the road using a truck. The abductors managed to escape while Anwar was rescued from the vehicle and the car seized.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hostage-rescued-in-joint-ops-by-kerala-karnataka-police/article35598568.ece
29 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Ten establishments found discharging sewage into river||Ten establishments, including high-rises and vehicle service stations, have been found discharging wastewater into the Konothupuzha in violation of the norms, according to the findings by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The agency has issued closure notices to two vehicle service stations in Thripunithura found discharging wastewater into the river without installing proper effluent treatment plants. Four apartments were found operating the sewage treatment plants without the permission of the board while the system in one apartment was found faulty. An apartment was pulled up for not having a sewage treatment plant to treat the wastewater as per the norms prescribed by the board. A letter has been issued to the secretary of the residents’ association to ensure immediate compliance. The lapses in the sewage management system were evident as the water samples taken from three points along the river near Irumpanam bridge, Kolenchery bridge, and Andhakarathodu revealed higher levels of total coliform count, indicating faecal contamination. The total coliform count in these three points were 5,400 cfu/100 ml (colony forming unit, cfu for short, is a unit for estimating the number of bacteria or other micro-organisms in a sample); 7,000 cfu/100 ml; and 70,000 cfu/100 ml respectively. The coliform count at the collection point in Andhakarathodu was 28 times higher than the maximum permissible limit. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the maximum permissible limit of faecal coliform in water used for organised outdoor bathing is 2,500 cfu/100 ml, while the desirable value is only 500 cfu/100 ml. The Konothupuzha lies between the Champakkara canal and the Vembanad lake and runs through Thripunithura municipality and Chottanikkara, Mulanthuruthy, Udayamperoor, and Amballoor grama panchayats. The National Green Tribunal had asked the board to submit the status of implementation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, in these local bodies located along the river. A report submitted by the board last week pointed out that Thripunithura municipality was yet to submit the request for authorisation required to manage waste as per the rules. Illegal dumping of waste in open places was also found in the region. The secretary of the municipality informed the board that steps were taken to remove the illegal outlets from commercial establishments and high-rises into the Konothupuzha river, besides initiating measures to install surveillance cameras along the riverside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ten-establishments-found-discharging-sewage-into-river/article35598615.ece

29 July 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kerala clinical team accomplishes home-based intervention for patients||A Kerala-based medical experiment of Virtual COVID In-Patient Care (VCIP), which is a home-based interventional model of treating COVID patients, has found a great degree of success, according to the medical team that led the experiment. The VCIP care follows evidence-based recommendations on evaluation and treatment of COVID-19, but it enables patients to treat themselves or with the help of their family members, at home. A detailed account of the protocol, methodology and outcome of the model tried out by the Jothydev’s Diabetes Research Centre (JDC) has been published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews , an Elsevier journal, recently. In this protocol, the patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 are provided with home monitoring devices such as blood pressure apparatus, glucometers and thermometer. The VCIP team comprises doctors, nurses, diabetes educators, dietitians and psychologists. The nurses train the patients or their caretakers at home by way of video consultations to use the devices themselves, especially the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices. Lab investigations are also carried out whenever required and samples are collected at home itself. Dr. Jothydev Kesavadev, chairman and managing director of JDC, said all the 220 patients, who availed themselves of the VCIP facility, recovered. There were two hospitalisations -- one, due to an impending fear of death and the other, due to intolerance to oral corticosteroids. In contrast to the conventional domiciliary care for COVID-19, in VCIP, corticosteroids, oral anticoagulants, injectable medications such as Low Molecular Weight Heparin were given at home itself by training the patients via WhatsApp video/ Zoom video consultations. “This model is extremely cheap and economic, when compared to hospitalisation and can be remotely managed with a small team of experts who can take care of hundreds of patients. However, this model can be executed only in those patients who have sufficient literacy and motivation, to monitor all the five vital parameters in their houses such as pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and blood glucose,” Dr. Kesavadev said. An international team of experts, including Dr. Hari Parameswaran from Wisconsin, and Dr. Rebecca Vitale from Boston, both in the U.S., were involved in conceptualising the treatment.

29 July 2021||Kochi,KERALA||SIT formed to probe fake currency racket case||District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik has formed a special investigation squad headed by Puthencruz DySP to probe into the fake currency racket that was busted at Elanji near Koothattukulam on Tuesday. In a joint operation, the Ernakulam Rural police and Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) had arrested seven persons and seized fake currency bills of Rs. 500 valued at over Rs. 7.57 lakh and printing equipment. The accused have since been remanded in judicial custody and the police are about to file a plea for their custodial interrogation to find out among other things whether more people were involved. The gang had been staying at the place for over eight months and successfully managed to operate without raising any suspicion in the neighbourhood. They claimed to be into event management and local people probably linked the activities to something associated with their profession, police sources said. The raid was conducted on the basis of a tip-off received by the ATS. It is suspected that they could have printed more bills and even circulated it. “However, they made sure not to circulate them in the immediate neighbourhood for fear that it may raise alert,” said a senior official associated with the probe. Five printers, a photostat machine, a screen printing machine, a currency counting machine, ink, and papers were also seized from the building. All the materials were procured from within the State and none had any standout features, said the official. A case has been registered against the accused under IPC Sections 489A (counterfeiting currency notes or bank-notes) 489C (possession of forged or counterfeit currency notes or bank notes), 489D (making or possessing instruments or materials for forging or counterfeiting currency notes or bank notes), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (acts done by several people in furtherance of common intention). Central agencies are also reportedly looking into the case considering its serious nature with implications for national interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sit-formed-to-probe-fake-currency-racket-case/article35598607.ece

Sajikumar, junior health inspector in the Thrikkakara Municipality, who is an accused in a case relating to the alleged mass killing of stray dogs, on Wednesday approached the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail in the case. In his petition, he said that the dogs were killed as per a decision taken at the meeting of the Chairperson, the Secretary, and Chairman of the Standing Committee for Health of the municipality. The prosecution case was that over 100 stray dogs were poisoned to death and dumped into the waste yard of the municipality by a four-member gang allegedly on the orders of the municipality. The petitioner submitted that he had no connection with the alleged incident. In fact, false allegations were levelled against the petitioner to divert the investigation and exonerate the Chairperson and others. He had no role either in taking the decision to kill the dogs or in the execution of the decision. It was only to help the Chairperson and others of the municipality escape from the case that the other accused had given a statement against him. A junior health inspector could not take such a decision on his own, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/junior-health-inspector-moves-hc-for-anticipatory-bail/article35598602.ece
29 July 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Controversy over OFC posts refuses to die down in corpn.||The controversy over erecting posts along city streets for laying optical fibre cable (OFC) refuses to die down. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took up the issue on Wednesday by taking out a protest march and organising a public meeting in this regard. BJP leaders alleged that the deal was mired in corruption, and the civic authorities cleared the proposal from three telecom companies with undue haste. One of the telecom companies, which came forward for the project, owed the Kochi Corporation a significant amount. When the issue of permitting the companies to erect posts came up at the Steering Committee meeting of the Kochi Corporation, the BJP had demanded that permission be issued only after clearing dues, said Priya Prasanth, a BJP leader in the council. The Mayor cleared the project next day by using his powers to give anticipatory permission, she alleged. Ms. Prasanth also alleged that the corporation was clueless about the number of poles that would be erected in the city, which could cause financial loss to the civic body. Mayor’s stance Responding to the developments, Mayor M. Anilkumar said the project was cleared in a transparent manner, and care would be taken to prevent any possible loss of revenue. The dues were also collected from the company concerned, he said. Besides discussing the proposal in the Steering Committee meeting of the Kochi Corporation, which had representatives of the LDF, UDF, and BJP in it, the issue was also discussed with the UDF leader in the council and the Standing Committee concerned. The civic body has fixed a higher rate for erecting poles than prescribed by the Kerala government. Moreover, an annual increase of 5% has been fixed on the rental, which would be beneficial to the civic body, he said. On the number of poles, Mr. Anilkumar said clearance was issued based on the proposal submitted by the companies. The actual number of poles erected would be known only when the project is completed. The civic body has put in place a mechanism to count the number of poles erected by the companies, he said. The permission issued for the erection of poles has brought in a revenue of Rs. 15 crore for the corporation, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/controversy-over-ofc-posts-refuses-to-die-down-in-corpn/article35598608.ece

They will also claim remuneration for every animal that is gunned down. Last year, 173 wild boars were thus killed in the State with the highest number being recorded in Kozhikode (70 animals), followed by Thiruvananthapuram. The killing of the crop-raiding boars will be carried out under the existing provisions of law. The State had earlier issued orders for killing the species, which posed threat to agriculture and human life, said Bennichan Thomas, chief wildlife warden (CWW), Kerala. The State government had earlier delegated the powers of the CWW to divisional forest officers to order killing of the species. The officials were also asked to decide on complaints of crop-raiding boars within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint. While ordering the killing of wild boars that pose threat to human life and property, the department insists that such animals shall not be brought down by poisoning, electric shock or by deploying explosives. The CWW could also order its killing in identified areas where the animals cause widespread crop loss and other damage. The free availability of food waste and reduced number of its predators have been attributed as the important reasons for the increase in the population of the species. Rise in numbers However, barring the steep hike in its numbers in 2002, the number of wild boars seemed to have remained more or less constant in the State, according to a data published on the website of the department. The government order permits killing of only those wild boars which enter the farmlands. They cannot be chased and hunted down in forest areas. The carcass of the animals thus killed will have to be burned using kerosene for preventing the consumption of meat. The government has also specified that the responsibility of any loss to human life or destruction of property during the process of killing the wild boar shall solely be on the persons who are engaged in the process, according to government officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/licensed-gunners-to-hunt-for-crop-raiding-wild-boars/article35598617.ece

The online council meeting on Tuesday accorded sanction for the project, which is estimated to cost about Rs. 27.80 lakh. Municipal chairperson Ajitha Thankappan said the municipality planned to open a fair price shop to sell provisions, vegetables and fruits ahead of the Onam season. She said the normal offline meeting of the council could not be held as COVID-19 test positivity rate ranged around 11% in the municipal area.

The facility will come up at the old complex of the cooperative hospital near the District Collectorate. Opposition Left Democratic Front boycotted the online council meeting demanding that an offline meet be held to decide on crucial projects in the municipality. P.C. Manoop, an independent councillor, who is now aligned with the LDF said that the decisions were taken while the opposition boycotted the council meeting. The council meeting was held in the midst of allegations that the municipal authorities had sanctioned the killing of dogs to contain the canine population on the streets even as the Infopark police have arrested four persons in connection with the incident. Twenty-five dog carcasses were recovered from a municipal dumping yard. The dogs were killed at the behest of the municipal authorities, alleged T.K.

Xavier Rojan, 33, of Thoppumpady, has been booked under the relevant provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. Formalities are being completed for recording his arrest after which he will be produced before the court. The father and daughter were living alone in the rented house at Polakkandam in Thoppumpady. The accused had got separated from his wife a couple of years ago, the police said. The little girl’s plight came to light after the neighbours alerted the Childline authorities on Tuesday evening about hearing her cry often and shared doubts about whether she was being beaten up. Following this, the Childline authorities rushed to the home and moved the girl to a nearby shelter home under the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) after giving her medical care. “As per the child's statement to the police, she was beaten up by her father using a stick for not studying. Her body bore marks of past beatings,” said the police. CWC authorities spoke with the child as well as her father over videoconferencing. The accused is learnt to have confessed to beating up his daughter for not studying. The child was being taught first-standard lessons though she was into the second standard, and the reasons for that were not immediately known. “The incident amounts to cruelty to child, and she will be taken care of by the CWC,” said CWC chairperson Bitty Joseph. Meanwhile, steps are being taken to give the child counselling and other emotional support before pursuing legal measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/father-booked-for-beating-up-six-year-old-daughter/article35598609.ece

The vessels were launched by Rameetha K., scientist at the Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory and wife of Madhu S. Nair, chairman and managing director of Cochin Shipyard. “The three FBOPs are important for the nation as they act as strategic base stations at the borders. We are proud to build these vessels indigenously for the safety of the country. JSW vessels, meanwhile, will be a boost for the business through coastal and inland waterways. We are glad to associate with JSW, who have set in motion the most ambitious coastal and inland transportation systems in the country” Mr. Nair said. Mukesh Tyagi, DIG of BSF, said the FBOPs would significantly strengthen the BSF’s water wing deployed on the eastern and western borders. The three FBOPs, each with a length of 46 metre, are part of a series of nine vessels being built for the BSF. These vessels are designed in-house by CSL and classed by the Indian Register of Shipping. Each FBOP is designed with stowage arrangements for four fast patrol boats which can be launched and hoisted using its own davit system. The vessels will act as a floating base for the flotilla of fast patrol boats and will supply petrol, fresh water, and provisions to the smaller boats and are to be deployed on India’s eastern and western borders. The mini general cargo ships are part of a series of four similar ships being built for the JSW Group.

Ranganathan on Wednesday said the CII had undertaken a survey among existing entrepreneurs in the State to assess their plans on further investments and around 15 companies have shown interest in a total investment worth Rs. 1,500 crore. He said the State was investment-friendly and was constantly trying to improve the climate for enterprises. He was addressing mediapersons in Kochi at a virtual meeting and said the CII initiative was part of a slew of measures being undertaken by the industry body to tap the positive industrial climate prevailing in the State. The CII welcomed the State government initiatives to turn Kerala into an investment-friendly State. The industries association was constantly in touch with the government and it was responsive to the requirements of the investors. Mr. Ranganathan said the north Kerala region would be given special focus to bridge the urban-rural divide in the industrial sphere. The CII was associating with the State government for demand aggregation and creating employment opportunities for five lakh youths in the next five years. The proposals include establishing an industry-facilitation cell, facilitating digital transformation of skilling and employment, building capacity of existing resources such as Kudumbashree and the Additional Skills Acquisition Programme (ASAP). Mr. Ranganathan said no controversy was a testament against the positive industrial climate prevailing in the State. The single window clearance in the State was one of the best in the country. Now trade unions were listening to the industry and businesses. The CII would work with the State government to attract investments for the proposed FMCG, Ayurveda and medical equipment parks in the State, he said. He also thanked the State government for accepting its recommendations and coming up with a centralised inspection mechanism, a statutory grievance redressal cell and a uniform land policy to enhance the investment climate of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-is-investment-friendly-cii/article35598619.ece

Apart from optimising the quality of the yield, the practice will encourage eco-friendly agriculture by protecting, soil, water and other bio-resources. In the first stage of the project, soil will be analysed before starting cultivation to find if it is suited to the crops. If not, micronutrients will be added to ensure a good harvest. In the method, more attention will be given to the nutritional needs of the crop along with other accepted principles of on-farm production that also include various aspects of food safety. Fertilizers and micronutrients will be used in different stages of growth and mostly organic fertilizers and pesticides will be opted. A total of 300 farmers from the district were given training in the method as part of the project. Loans provided They were also provided loans with low interest rates through Kerala Bank to cultivate plantains, tubers and vegetables. Pathanapuram-based Palaruvy Farmers Producer Company will be in charge of implementing the project in Kollam. “The project, that offers financial assistance to produce safe and quality crops, has been getting great response from farmers,”said chairman Biju K.Mathew. A high-level delegation from NABARD visited the district on Wednesday to interact with the farmers. They visited the farms in Inchakkad, Pandithitta, Thalavoor and Manjakkala and briefed the framers on various projects being implemented by NABARD. “This project is the first step towards our goal of bringing all farmers in the district under sustainable farming practices,” said NABARD general manager R.Shankar Narayan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-to-ensure-indgap-norms/article35598663.ece

29 July 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Coop. bank to pep up tapioca farming||As the State government announced recently its decision to include dried tapioca in the monthly food kits, the occasion also marked the successful culmination of a campaign of the Kanamala Service Cooperative Bank in Kottayam. The bank, located in Erumely grama panchayat, kick-started a campaign to include dried tapioca - a staple for hundreds of families in Central Travancore - in the monthly ration in view of the struggles faced by tapioca farmers in the aftermath of COVID-19. Lockdown While area under the crop had increased considerably during the lockdown period, the bumper harvest led to a sharp fall in prices from Rs. 20 to Rs. 7 per kg. The bank, which recently initiated tapioca farming in over 16 acres, drew on its first-hand experience to launch the campaign. Binoy Jose, president of the bank, submitted a memorandum in this regard to the State government through Cooperation Minister V.N.Vasavan and the attempt has now reaped rich dividends . Having included half a kg of dried tapioca in every kit from July on a trial basis, the government has now approached the bank through the cooperative society registrar seeking suggestions on implementing the project. Accordingly, it has now carried out a detailed study of the tapioca farming in Kerala and submitted a project report to the official. “In terms of income, tapioca is the third largest crop to be cultivated in the State. As per agriculture statistics of 2018-19, tapioca is planted in 61,874 hectares across Kerala and brings an income of Rs. 4,086.22 crore every year,” pointed out Mr.Jose The idea of procuring the processed tapioca through the cooperative societies and distributing it through the Civil Supplies Department was developed during an interaction with James Vadakkan, a former banker who has done extensive research in the subject, he added. The procurement plan proposed by the institution also envisages implementation of about 6,500 twin-dryer machines and processing of at least 6,458 tonnes of tapioca on a daily basis throughout the 180-day harvest season. Launched in Feb. The campaign, launched in February this year, received wide support from the tapioca farmers in the region. “This is the last resort for farmers as cultivation of tapioca has become a loss-making proposition. The production of dried tapioca involves some costs, and the government should account these while fixing the base price for the product,” said Palakuzhiyil Prasad, a tapioca farmer in Pampavalley, Kottayam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coop-banks-drive-gives-boost-to-tapioca-farming/article35598654.ece

29 July 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Low COVID fatality in Gulf offers a ray of hope to Keralites||Multiple proactive measures such as ban on travel, suspension of flights, prohibiting religious activities, mass testing, and vaccination helped the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations keep their COVID-19 case fatality rate low. With a speedy recovery rate and low fatalities, the Gulf region has gradually started opening up. According to the latest figures, the total number deaths recorded in the GCC is 18,165. This gives a glimmer of hope to Keralites with Gulf residency visa stranded in the State who wish to return to their destinations. Figures issued by the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority showed that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was closer to reaching recovery as well as acquiring herd immunity through the vaccination drive. It said that 77.91% of the population in the UAE received at least one dose of vaccination, and that 69.35% had been fully vaccinated. The UAE conducted 64,715,985 tests, and it had 674,724 cases. The number of deaths was 1,929, and active cases stood at 20,615. Meanwhile, Dubai is gearing up to host Expo 2020 from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Originally scheduled from October 20, 2020 to April 10, 2021, the event was postponed due to the pandemic. As of now, several stranded UAE residents in India have been flying to other countries, including Armenia and Uzbekistan, to spend 14 days there, before hopping on to a flight to the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, nearly 20% of the population have been fully vaccinated, while 53.8% received the first dose. The kingdom recorded 8,167 deaths, and nearly 5 lakh people recovered from the disease. Saudi Arabia has also announced that citizens who travel to red-list countries will be slapped with a three-year international travel ban. The Kuwait authorities said only citizens who had been vaccinated would be allowed to travel abroad from August 1. Qatar is also way ahead in vaccination. Nearly 60% of the country’s population have been fully vaccinated, and 70% have received the first jab. The tiny emirate, which is an hour-long flight away from the UAE, recently reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists. After it announced changes to its travel and quarantine policy, UAE residents have been increasingly looking at this option. In the case of Bahrain, 63.7% of the population have been fully vaccinated, and 67.2% got the first dose. Around 35% of the population received at least one dose of vaccination against COVID-19 in Kuwait. Nearly 22% of the population have received both the doses. Now, only citizens who have been vaccinated for the coronavirus will be allowed to travel abroad starting on August 1. Only 6.8% of the population have been fully vaccinated in the Sultanate of Oman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/low-covid-fatality-in-gulf-offers-a-ray-of-hope-to-keralites/article35598582.ece
29 July 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Traders now resort to ‘TPR challenge’ to prove their point||Traders in Peruvayal grama panchayat in Kozhikode district have resorted to what they term as ‘TPR challenge’ to tell the State government that the ongoing restrictions on social life based on the test positivity rate of COVID-19 is unscientific. Panchayat-level functionaries of the Kerala Vyapari Vyvasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES) told The Hindu on July 28 that sheer desperation forced them to launch the initiative. “For the past three weeks, a triple lockdown is in force in Peruvayal, which has a population of around 55,000, because of high TPR. It falls in the ‘D’ category where TPR is above 15%. However, nearby panchayats, which are bigger in terms of population and number of patients, are in ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories where there are very few restrictions,” KVVES leader Mamukutty Vellakkattu said. As a result, traders are in crisis, as the authorities are not allowing them to open shops. The grama panchayat is planning to hold mega testing camps under the aegis of the primary health centre at Beeline Public School, Kuttikkattoor, on Thursday; St. Xavier’s Upper Primary School, Peruvayal, on Friday; Government Lower Primary School, Velipparamba, on Saturday, and AMLP School, Poovattuparamba, on Monday. The KVVES functionaries will offer prizes through draw of lots to those who attend the camps. “The first prize winner will take home Rs. 5,001. Two second prize winners will get one biryani pot each. Two third prize winners will get one pressure cooker each. Ten others will get consolation prizes as well,” Mr. Vellakkattu said. The grama panchayat functionaries have echoed their concerns though they have not declared any official support. On June 19, the panchayat had passed a resolution demanding that the government change the TPR-based restrictions, as they are unscientific. The rate of infection should be determined not in terms of the tests conducted, but in terms of the number of patients per population. Though the number of infected persons had been declining in Peruvayal, the authorities have imposed restrictions here, said the resolution moved by P.K. Sharafudeen, chairman, standing committee on welfare. Other grama panchayats which had more patients in terms of population are being opened up as well. Opening shops just for a day increases the rush of people, the resolution pointed out. Mr. Sharafudeen said instead of the current system, micro-containment zones should be determined based on the number of patients, and restrictions should be imposed there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-now-resort-to-tpr-challenge-to-prove-their-point/article35598584.ece

M.K. Raghavan, MP, who met Ved Parkash Dudeja, Vice Chairman, Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), in New Delhi on Wednesday said the team would reach here in the second week of August to oversee the preparation of blueprint for the Rs. 200-crore project. Quoting Minister of Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw’s statement in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Raghavan said a consultant had already been appointed to study the technical and economic feasibility of the project. Apart from examining its viability, Mr. Vaishnaw said the consultant would prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and a comprehensive master plan for the railway station. The ambitious project has been hanging fire for over a decade. The station is among the 23 facilities chosen for redevelopment in the country and the only one in Kerala to be renovated under the Swiss Challenge Method. A fortnight ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the first airport-style revamped Gandhinagar station that was conceived under the Swiss Challenge Method. The initial proposal was to redevelop the Kozhikode station at a cost of Rs. 75 crore after leasing out four sites, measuring 4.4 acres, to a successful bidder for 45 years. The project estimate was later revised to Rs. 200 crore. Besides, it was taken up by the RLDA. The project had initially faced stiff resistance from various trade unions following the decision to execute it in the public-private partnership (PPP) mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/railway-station-redevelopment-project-to-be-speeded-up/article35598564.ece

29 July 2021||THIRUANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Athletes speak their minds at conclave||Candid views were expressed and ideas were put forth by some of the biggest names in Indian sport at Hotel SP Grand Days here on Wednesday. Listening to them eagerly was the Sports Minister. The Sportstar Kerala Sports Conclave was a resounding success. Organised by The Hindu ’s publication Sportstar , the event featured outstanding athletes from varied disciplines. All of them had a lot to talk about their respective sports and gave suggestions the government could work on. Minister V. Abdurahiman, who stayed on till the end of the programme, ensured that the points would be taken note of. P.T. Usha, one of India’s greatest track-and-field athletes, stressed on the need for the development of sporting skills from a young age. “Our school meets should not be just about manufacturing champions,” she said. More tournaments Former Indian football captain I.M. Vijayan said the State needed to have multiple tournaments. “There are no opportunities for talented footballers who are employed by various departments,” he said. His former Indian teammate Jo Paul Ancheri pointed out there were six departmental teams in Thiruvananthapuram alone. “They train the whole year for just one tournament,” he said. Former boxing world champion K.C. Lekha said athletes employed by the government, like her, should be allowed to give something back to the sport, rather than be made to work. “I can’t do anything related with sport now,” she said. Former national table tennis champion Ambika Radhika said steps should be taken to promote her sport in rural areas. Shooter Elizabeth Susan Koshy invited the Minister’s attention to the under-utilised shooting range at Vattiyoorkavu in the capital. “It is world class, but it is tough to get permission from the authorities to train there,” she said. Mayookha Johny, who holds the national record for women’s triple jump, said there should be affordable sports medicine in the State. “With better sports medicine, I could have been able to manage my injury better,” she said. “We also need to respect and reward our sports stars.” Footballer C.K. Vineeth said parents needed to be educated about sport. Former track-and-field athletes P. Ramachandran and Jincy Philip were also among the speakers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/athletes-speak-their-minds-at-conclave/article35598570.ece

As many as 10,164 advice memos were issued for the LD clerk post, in which 468 vacancies are still remaining. After the current rank list was extended by six months on February 5 this year, 1,632 people were issued advice memos. Extension period In the last grade servant category, 6,984 people were given advice memos, while 486 vacancies are remaining. In the six month extension period, 1,109 people were given advice memos for this post. For the post of staff nurse in the Health Department, 2,455 advice memos were issued across all districts, out of which 414 were issued after February 5. In the salesman post in the Civil Supplies Department, 2,428 advice memos were given, out of which 525 were given after February 5. As many as 702 advice memos were issued across the State for the women civil police officer post, out of which 206 were made after February 5. For the police constable (telecommunication) post, 219 advice memos were given. Steps have been taken to expedite recruitments from rank lists expiring on August 4, said PSC officials. With the validity of 493 rank lists of the Public Service Commission (PSC) set to expire on August 4, aspirants for various posts are yet again on the warpath demanding that the State government extend the validity further, at least till the publication of the next rank list. Prominent among the various rank holders' associations leading the protests are the All Kerala Teachers' Rank Holders Association, the Women Civil Police Officer Rank Holders' Association, the Kerala Higher Secondary Teachers' Union and the LGS Rank Holders' Association, who are all now sitting on protest in front of the Secretariat. Ahead of the Assembly elections earlier this year, the State Cabinet had on February 3 decided to extend the validity of rank lists by six months, till August 4. As the date of expiry of the list neared, demands were raised from various quarters for further extension, as the next rank list, after the completion of the newly introduced two phase examinations is expected to come into force only after a few months. However, earlier this week, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the Assembly that the government saw no reason to extend the validity of PSC rank lists beyond August 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nearly-25000-get-job-memos/article35598577.ece
29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||LDF govt. protects criminal gangs: UDF||Members of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition walked out of the Assembly on Wednesday denouncing the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government for ‘‘allowing political criminals beholden to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] to operate with impunity” from inside the Kannur central prison. The UDF was angered that Speaker M.B. Rajesh had denied Congress legislator Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan leave to move an adjournment motion to discuss the ruling party’s alleged criminal nexus withgold smugglers against the backdrop of the recent murder of suspected carrier and Kannur resident Rameez. Mr. Radhakrishnan said Rameez had died in a “dubious” hit-and-run incident hours before he was supposed to depose to the Customs, Preventive, against his CPI(M) handlers, particularly Arjun Ayenki. He said the nexus was clear. Ayenki, a CPI(M) sympathiser in Kannur and accused in the Karipur gold smuggling case, had till recently hosted a trendy pro-CPI(M) ‘fan page’ on social media, possibly to attract impressionable local youth as potential recruits for ‘illegal purposes.’ Partners in crime Democratic Youth Federation of India leader Satheesh Chembalottu, S.P. Shuhaib murder case accused Akash Thillankeri and Revolutionary Marxist Party leader T. P. Chandrasekharan’s assassins ‘Kodi’ Suni and others were Ayenki’s partners in crime, he alleged. He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was afraid to mention even their names in the Assembly lest the accused revealed everything about the party’s involvement in political murders, hawala deals and gold smuggling. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the CPI(M) ‘hit teams’ controlled gold smuggling and hawala operations inside the Kannur prison. They plotted murders, planned ambushes and highway robberies and ordered hits from the Central Prison, Kannur. The prison provided the mafia with a perfect alibi for their crimes. Jailers ensured Kodi Suni and the CPI(M) gang had access to mobile phones, hotel food, liquor, friends and relatives. CM’s reply Mr. Vijayan said border enforcement was a Central subject. The State had no jurisdiction over the Customs or airport security. Nevertheless, the police had cracked down hard on the spillover effect of gold smuggling, such as violent gang feuds, street crime, highway ambushes and waylaying of cash and gold carriers. He said the police had concluded prima facie that Rameez's murder was an accident. The UDF had attempted to scandalise the government without a shred of evidence, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-govt-protects-criminal-gangs-udf/article35598628.ece
29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Long-term plan for development of sports in State: Minister||Sports Minister V. Abdurahiman on Wednesday said the government had envisaged a long-term plan for development of sports in the State. Speaking at the Sportstar Kerala Sports Conclave, the Minister said the new sports policy would give primacy to sportspersons and that sports would be made part of the curriculum. Kerala Sports Limited Mr. Abdurahiman said the government would launch Kerala Sports Limited, a public sector company, next month. The company would manage events, promote indigenous sports and also oversee the maintenance of stadiums. The Minister also said he was of opinion that only sports meets should be conducted in stadiums and shouldn’t be given for other purposes. Olympian Mercy Kuttan, president of the Kerala State Sports Council, lamented that the shortage of funds was crippling various schemes run by the body. She also said that the lack of systematic training and unscientific coaching methods were killing young talent in the State. She said that the sports hostels should provide state-of-the-art facilities to lure parents to send their wards to these centres. G.Kishore, SAI Kerala Director, said the SAI through its various schemes had played a big role in promoting sports in the State. He said Olympians Bhavani Devi, K.T. Irfan, K.M. Beenamol were SAI trainees. Team spirit Tom Joseph, Director, New Initiatives, Jain Deemed-To-Be-University, said sports helped in promoting team spirit and sharing responsibility. He said his institution had been promoting sports and recalled the past association with ISL team Kerala Blasters. Col. Rajeev Mannali, CMO of SUT Hospitals, Pattom, stressed the importance of sports medicine and advised the government to take steps to open a sports medicine centre in all district hospitals.

29 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Research, outreach need of the hour: expert||Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organization (WHO), has underscored the importance of sustained investment in R&D in health and the need to make sure that credible information is available to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Swaminathan was addressing the 8th and 9th joint convocation of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Thiruvananthapuram, in virtual mode on Wednesday. Sustained investment Sustained investment in R&D would eventually pay off, she said. Investment in the mRNA technology over the last three decades had resulted in the development of the highly successful mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. “Some of the other vaccine technologies also have proven to be effective and very safe. But this doesn’t happen overnight. The mRNA technology is one game-changing technology that has proven itself and has come of age and everybody of course wants access,” she said. The WHO was working to establish mRNA Technology Transfer Hubs and the first would come up in South Africa, she said. Dr. Swaminathan said the WHO’s ‘living’ approach to guidelines, where guidelines and recommendations were constantly updated based on the latest data and evidence, had been particularly relevant during the pandemic. The WHO hoped to extend this approach to other health areas as well. The spread of wrong information and the anti-science, anti-vaccine campaigns during the pandemic had served to confuse the people. The pandemic had forced scientists to communicate in a way people could understand, she said. “The lesson for us is that if scientists do not communicate, we will be in a situation where people will only be getting the wrong information,” she said. Touching upon health research, she stressed the need to shift the focus to middle and low-income countries. Much of the research at present was carried out in the high and upper middle-income countries. Consequently, the fruits of the research also were going into those countries, she pointed out. Further, the pandemic had emphasised the importance of the study of social and behavioural sciences in ‘nudging’ people to make healthier choices, she said. “Knowledge or information does not translate into behavioural change (in people), you need very specialised techniques to understand how people think, what are the levers and triggers that could change behaviour.” A total of 292 BS-MS students, 39 PhD students, and seven Integrated PhD students, who completed their studies in 2020 and 2021 graduated on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/research-outreach-need-of-the-hour-expert/article35598798.ece
29 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||HC order a relief for many||The Kerala High Court order permitting APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) to continue the ongoing examinations in offline mode has come as a relief for large sections of the academic community. In the wake of the order, the university has decided to conduct the exams in accordance with the schedule from Thursday. The revised date of the exams postponed on Wednesday will be announced later. Tuesday’s single bench order to cancel the examinations appeared to push the odd-semester exams into uncertainty after reaching the halfway stage. Notably, the disruption came after the BTech exams witnessed an average attendance of around 92%, except on the day of a Statewide agitation by the Kerala Students Union, when participation was 73%. Fewer than 100 students from faraway places, including Jammu and Kashmir and the North-East, had expressed their inability to appear for the exams, official sources said, adding that all pandemic norms had been adhered to at the exam centres. Chances for malpractice While the petitioners insisted in the court on holding the exams online, several teachers expressed doubts over the efficacy of the assessment mode in the absence of online remote invigilation. Recounting his experience during the final-year exams held recently and last year, a professor said instances of mass copying were rife. “Very often, several students huddled together at one house to answer the questions sent through WhatsApp or email. While 32 appeared for a paper, we found 28 answer scripts to be similar in all respects, except handwriting,” he said. Official sources said the recent final year exams recorded a pass percentage of 96%, an unusual increase from the average figure of nearly 46%. The order to nullify the exams came as a surprise for those who clamoured for a deferral of the exams or holding them online. A third-semester Electronics and Communications Engineering student of the LBS College of Engineering, Kasaragod, said the cancellation of the exams conducted would have been disappointing.  In online mode, teachers express doubts over efficacy of assessment in the absence of remote invigilation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-order-a-relief-for-many/article35598633.ece
29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Panel orders payment of wages to dead boy’s kin||The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has directed that the wages of children working in an establishment subject to the provisions of the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, cannot be blocked citing some misdeed committed by them. Acting on a petition from Premkumar, a resident of Muttil, Wayanad, the commission, comprising members K. Nazeer and B. Babitha, also directed the Labour Secretary and the Labour Commissioner to issue orders asking employers to follow the panel’s directions strictly. The petitioner had said that owing to financial difficulties experienced by him, his 18-year-old elder son had sought work in a footwear shop at Kambalakkad. Worked for 6 days He had worked there for six days and the petitioner’s younger son, aged 16, for two days. His younger son had taken a pair of shoes from the shop, and owing to mental anguish over the store owner telling the elder brother about the act, the younger one had committed suicide. Alleging that mental harassment by the store owner led to his younger son’s suicide, Premkumar had sought an investigation by the commission and legal action on its basis. The District Police Chief of Wayanad, in his report to the commission, said a case had been registered at the Kalpetta police station in connection with the suicide and an investigation was conducted. During the inquest, 17 witnesses, including the doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination and the relatives of the deceased, were questioned. From their statements, it became clear that the younger boy had taken a pair of shoes from the shop where he worked without the owner’s knowledge. When the older son came to the shop seeking payment of dues for having worked there earlier, the owner told him about the shoes being lifted. As the shoes taken belonged to two pairs for the same leg, he had effectively lost two pairs, the owner said, deducting Rs. 1,500 from the money due to the elder son. In anguish over his brother and colleagues coming to know about the incident and his brother informing his father, the younger son committed suicide. The report also said that no evidence had been found that the store owner had mentally harassed the boy in any manner or to suspect that this led him to commit suicide. As it was made clear that the store owner did not prompt the boy’s death, the commission did not make any recommendations on the matter. Children, it said, could be engaged in work only as per the provisions of the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. When children were employed in legally allowed work, payment of their wages could not be denied on the grounds that they had committed some undesirable actions, the commission said, directing the District Labour Officer to take steps to recover the pending dues from the owner of the shop where the child worked and hand it over to the family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-orders-payment-of-wages-to-dead-boys-kin/article35598576.ece

29 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Madrasa teachers not on State payroll: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the Assembly on Wednesday that the State government is not spending anything from its coffers to pay salaries or other benefits to madrasa teachers. A welfare fund has been set up for them, to which each madrasa teacher and the respective madrasa committee make monthly contributions of Rs. 50 each. The welfare fund currently has 23,809 madrasa teachers as members. The government has only allocated a corpus fund for the running of the fund. “Attempts are being made to create a false narrative and paint the Muslim community of gaining undeserved benefits from the government. The Sangh Parivar is also part of the forces creating such a narrative. Communal forces will come in several forms, even under fake names of other communities. In Kerala, the majority of people from all religions hold secular values,” Mr. Vijayan said. Earlier this year, a message had gone viral across social media platforms claiming that the State government is spending a large amount of money on salaries and other benefits of madrasa teachers. The message, shared by a large number of people from outside the State, claimed that more than Rs. 600 crore is being spent on salaries and pensions to them. Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MLA Najeeb Kanthapuram said the Chief Minister's reply disproved this propaganda. IUML member Manjalamkuzhi Ali said the United Democratic Front government had during its tenure of 2011-16 provided grants for the running of the welfare fund, however, the Left Democratc Front government had not taken any such steps. Mr. Vijayan said the government would extend all help required when there was any difficulty in the running of the fund. Currently, there is no such situation. IUML leader P.K. Kunhalikutty said the welfare fund governing board had too many members, for whom salaries and benefits were being paid from the contributions. Mr. Vijayan said this could be looked into.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/madrasa-teachers-not-on-state-payroll-cm/article35598621.ece
29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Govt. increases Plus One seats||The government has decided to increase the Plus One higher secondary seats in districts from Palakkad to Kasaragod by 20% and those from Thiruvananthapuram to Thrissur by 10%. Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty on Wednesday said 4,19,651 students had passed the SSLC examinations this year. However, the number of existing Plus One seats was 3,61,307. There were 33,000 seats in the Vocal Higher Secondary Education sector and 49,140 seats in ITIs, and 19,080 in polytechnics. In all, the number of seats came to 4,62,527. In the government and aided sector alone, there were 3,06,150 seats. With an increase in seats, the number of Plus One seats this year would come to 4,00,899. Care would be taken to ensure that like last year, some subjects were not left with vacant seats. If some issues still remained, these would be addressed. General Education Principal Secretary A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish said if any seat shortage arose despite the additional seats sanctioned, the government would intervene. Admissions in Aug. Director of General Education (DGE) Jeevan Babu K. said Plus One admissions would begin in the first week of August. Mr. Hanish said online education would get under way with the vocational higher secondary classes in the first week of August. The arrangements for this were under way in 34 VHSE schools.  Referring to trolls on the high pass percentage in the SSLC examinations, Mr. Sivankutty said students in the State had studied, appeared for the exams, and secured good results. However, they were being trolled. This would cause students mental stress and destroy their confidence. A number of students had called him and other Education Department officials asking why they were being trolled when they had studied hard to secure good grades. Not everyone agreed with these trolls. Only those who were behind them might enjoy them. Cracking jokes was fine, but insulting children was out of bounds, Mr. Sivankutty said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-increases-plus-one-seats/article35598632.ece

29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||IMA moots reopening of educational institutions||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan that since it is very clear that the pandemic is going to be around for another year or two, the State should now be looking at returning to normality, even while living with COVID-19. As a first step, the State should think about reopening educational institutions which have been closed for the past one-and-a half years, in a very controlled manner, with a lot of preparatory work and the strictest of protocols and monitoring in place, the IMA suggested. As vaccination has been found to be quite effective in reducing the severity of the disease, ’ reopening of educational institutions can be thought of after ensuring that all teaching and ancillary staff associated with every institution is vaccinated. As all above 18 years are currently being vaccinated in the State, educational institutions which cater to those above 18 years – degree courses upwards in colleges and professional colleges - should be the first to reopen. To enable this, a special vaccination drive should be conducted. As it is no longer feasible to have all students at once in classrooms, classes should be conducted in shifts and separate batches in accordance with COVID protocols and after creating awareness among college students. As enhancing the pace of vaccination is the only way to move towards normality, the IMA volunteered to help the government conduct special camps to vaccinate as many people as possible in the shortest time. The IMA pointed out that the government needed to make vaccine distribution more efficient in the State and remove the hurdles in conducting vaccination in the private sector. Vaccine distribution should be done only through healthcare workers, while local bodies should only be the facilitators. The IMA offered to help the government conduct a detailed sero prevalence study in the State with a larger sample. It also emphasised that contact tracing and testing be given more prominence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ima-for-reopening-of-educational-institutions/article35598583.ece
29 July 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Mangala begins rewilding lessons today||With bad hindlimbs and cloudy eyes, she was too feeble when found abandoned by her mother near a forest temple on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border last year. From that frail 60-day-old tiger cub, Mangala is now ready to learn the basics of survival and hunting skills in the sprawling Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), located in the Western Ghats. When International Tiger Day falls on Thursday (July 29), a group of forest personnel, under the aegis of PTR deputy director Sunil Babu, would begin the rewilding process of the female tiger cub in the reserve forest, spread over 777 sq km. The reserve, currently, has 42 tigers. Watchful eyes The nearly nine-month-old animal, reared in these months under the watchful eyes of the forest officials, would be given training to go back to her wild habitate as per the protocol of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Mr. Babu said. “Rewilding is a process to familiarise the animal with the environment of a natural forest. It will learn hunting and other survival skills as part of the procedure under our observation,” he told PTI. According to the NTCA protocol, the tiger cub should be reared in an in situ enclosure for a minimum of two years. “Normally, the animal would be released in the original forest after two years of rewilding. Here, we will decide about its release after observing the nature and health condition of the animal,” he said. The process As part of the rewilding process, the baby big cat would be shifted to a ‘cage’ which is spread on a nearly half-hectares forestland inside the PTR. Though the animal would be given some feed like domestic animals such as goat in the initial period, it is expected to learn hunting down prey in the later days. “To give maximum feel of its natural habitat, there will be no human presence in the enclosure in the later months,” the official said. Though it is an expensive procedure, the exact cost is yet to be estimated, he added. The tiger cub was suspected to have been abandoned by its mother, but officials spotted the tigress lurking around the Mangaladevi temple nearly a week after it was rescued on November 21 last year. Officials believed the cub was left alone in the wild when the tigress was engaged in a fierce internecine combat of tigers in the forest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mangala-begins-rewilding-lessons-today/article35598656.ece

Balagopal on Wednesday urged the Opposition United Democratic Front not to use isolated incidents to attack the cooperative sector of the State. In his reply to the debate on the Demand for Grants pertaining to GST, agricultural income tax, and sales tax in the Assembly, Mr. Balagopal requested the Opposition to refrain from taking a stand that would help “vultures” who had their eyes on the huge deposits in cooperative sector banks. Responding to the Opposition’s charges regarding the Karuvannur service cooperative bank loan scam, he said none responsible would be spared. Financial status On the financial status of the State, Mr. Balagopal called for a concerted effort to counter the Centre’s approach of attempting to use the treasury to control the States’ powers. The State’s tax revenue also plummeted. Tax devolution to the States from the Central pool has dipped considerably. If Kerala were to get a share of the cess collected in this manner by the Centre, it would receive roughly Rs. 8,000 crore. Although a little over Rs. 4,000 crore had been released as GST dues, Rs. 3,107 crore was still pending from the Centre, Mr. Balagopal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/balagopal-cautions-opposition/article35598634.ece

He said that the apex court had rightly observed that starvation and livelihood destruction forced many to seek alms from strangers to stave off hunger. People did not willingly resort to begging, the Chief Minister said. Desperate act It was extreme poverty nudged people into the desperate act of seeking alms.

The State government would mitigate their deprivation, offer them hope and a chance to reintegrate into mainstream society. Mr. Vijayan said.

29 July 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bommai sworn in as Karnataka CM||Basavaraj Bommai, who was sworn in on Wednesday as the the 30th Chief Minister of Karnataka, sought to project a welfare-orientated vision by kickstarting his tenure by announcing a scholarship scheme for farmers’ children and hiking pensions for senior citizens, widows, and the disabled. Sending simultaneously a signal of administrative control, he also warned the bureaucracy to shun the “chalta hai” attitude and directed them to work on micro-management for the successful implementation of schemes. He also ordered a file-clearance drive within 15 days and said department heads would be held accountable for time-bound implementation of welfare schemes and programmes. The one-man Cabinet meeting and another with bureaucrats came hours after Mr. Bommai took oath of office and secrecy in the name of God at the Raj Bhavan. He was sworn in by Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and the event was attended by his family members, former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and other party leaders. Emulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Bommai bowed at the portals of the entrance of the Vidhana Soudha before entering it for the first time as Chief Minister. After the Cabinet meeting, he announced a new scholarship for farmers’ children for which Rs. 1,000 crore will be set aside. He hiked pensions which will incur an additional expenditure of Rs. 1,367.52 crore and benefit 56.89 lakh people. He called them “investments on human power” in troubled times. To cut expenditure Assuming power amidst a lagging economy hit by the pandemic, Mr. Bommai directed all departments to aim for cutting at least 5% of “unwanted expenditure” by March 2022, without affecting the implementation of the government’s programmes. The new Chief Minister said handling of floods, management of COVID-19 pandemic, and administering vaccines to all were his top priorities. The new Chief Minister tried to assert himself and answer criticism that he may remain in the “shadow of Mr. Yediyurappa”. Answering critics who have dubbed him as a “rubber stamp” Chief Minister, Mr. Bommai said he would work to ensure his government got a “pro-people stamp.” Asked whether there would be a power centre outside the government, Mr. Bommai said he was only the first among equals and the power centre would lie with the entire team. Clarifying what he meant when he said he would work with the guidance of Mr. Yediyurappa, Mr. Bommai said he would be guided by the tough decisions taken by the veteran leader, his style of functioning, objectives, and the policies and programmes announced in the Budget.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bommai-sworn-in-as-karnataka-cm/article35598007.ece

29 July 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP: sack Yemmiganur MLA K. Chennakesava Reddy||Bharatiya Janata Party State general secretary A. Suryanarayana Raju on Wednesday demanded that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy sack the ruling YSR Congress Party MLA from Yemmiganur K. Chennakesava Reddy for his reported remarks in support of cow slaughter. Leading a protest in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here, he said the MLA had no moral right to continue in the post after allegedly justifying cow slaughter much against the spirit of the Constitution, which had provisions to nurture cow as it was integral part of the Indian way of life and rural economy. A high drama was witnessed as the BJP activists, who came with a cow to the protest venue, offered stiff resistance to the police who used mild force to disperse them and restore order. It was unfortunate that the Chief Minister was “silent” when many YSRCP leaders allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Hindus, said BJP district president S.Srinivas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-sack-yemmiganur-mla-k-chennakesava-reddy/article35598208.ece

With the testing increasing by nearly 50,000 samples, the test positivity rate (TPR) showed a dip at 11.2%. The State’s active cases rose to 1,49,534 on Wednesday. The official cumulative COVID-19 case fatality stood at 16,457, after adding 131 recent deaths. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals with COVID rose from 2,351 on Tuesday to 3,125 on Wednesday.

As disease transmission continued, the Centre advised all States to conduct State-specific seroprevalence surveys to generate district-level data. The data would help formulate objective, transparent and evidence-based and local-level public health responses to COVID-19, the Union Health Secretary said in a letter to Kerala. Though the national sero-survey by ICMR reported a seroprevalence of 42.7% for Kerala, this survey did not reflect the heterogeneity of seroprevalence between districts and even between States. The States could consult ICMR on the seroprevalence study so that a standardised protocol was followed.

29 July 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||Women doctors to attend to female patients at Amara Hospital||Tirupati-based Amara Hospital has engaged more female doctors to attend to the women patients arriving for diagnosis, treatment and counselling. The move, what the hospital calls a ‘pro-women approach’, will let the patients shed their inhibitions and divulge more details to the specialists, said hospital’s Managing Director Ramadevi Gourineni on Tuesday. A neurology and sleep medicine expert, Dr. Ramadevi introduced a team of specialists comprising Shalini (gynaecology), Harshita Reddy (general medicine), Anusha (dermatology), Sunitha (dental), Anupama (psychology), Swetha and Shama (paediatrics), Bindu (physiotherapy) and Vaishnavi (diet counselling). The move is projected as a vital step in removing the ‘invisible barrier’ between patients and doctors. “Women, especially from rural backgrounds, are reluctant to disclose personal details more so about the family situation and marital life that usually lead to stress and psychological issues. With the new system, the patients now will feel more comfortable,” said Dr. Ramadevi. The move by the hospital belonging to the Amara Raja Group is also seen as a sign of women empowerment, with more female doctors occupying the prime positions. Chief Administrative Officer D. Venugopal said that educating a woman would help an entire family fall in line and stay disciplined in all respects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-doctors-to-attend-to-female-patients-at-amara-hospital/article35598212.ece

29 July 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP is to blame for much of State’s financial woes: Duvvuri||Reiterating that much of the State’s financial woes were the result of “fiscal profligacy” of the previous Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government, Krishna Duvvuri, Special Secretary to Chief Minister (finance and economic affairs), asserted on Wednesday that bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) had caused severe distress on account of a debt of Rs. 97,123 crore assigned at that time, which increased to Rs. 1,20,556 crore due to the sharing of public account, and the overall debt ballooning to Rs. 2,68,225 crore since 2015-16. Mr. Krishna claimed that the per capita revenue of Telangana was Rs. 15,454 at the time of bifurcation against A.P.’s Rs. 8,979. This largely reflected the miserable situation in which the State was mired right from the day of becoming the “successor State of A.P.,” Mr. Krishna said while addressing the media here. Mr. Krishna said the outstanding payables as on March 31, 2019, were Rs. 39,000 crore and the off-budget borrowings stood at Rs. 58,000 crore, up from Rs. 14,028 crore at the time of bifurcation. The debt on the books of power utilities increased from Rs. 33,587.98 crore to Rs. 70,254 crore between 2014 and 2019. Spike in Centre’s debt Mr. Krishna affirmed that the heavy borrowings being “blown out of proportion by a section of the media” had taken place at a time when the Government of India itself had witnessed a sharp spike in its debt at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.78% in 2014-19. The A.P. government’s debt increased at a CAGR of 17.33% during the same period, he added. “During every year of the TDP term, the borrowings were over and above what had been permitted by the Central government. As a consequence, the present government is bogged down by a massive debt burden,” Mr. Krishna said. The entire country was in the grip of a cyclical slowdown in 2019-20. The growth in union tax revenue recorded that year was the lowest in the last two decades, he asserted. Mr. Krishna said the State government had to give a boost to the public consumption expenditure, which had nosedived during the pandemic, by putting money in the hands of people through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), which was an effective way to prop the sagging economy. “In spite of the severely constrained fiscal space, the present government did everything in a transparent manner to support the people. The fact to be underlined is that still, the CAGR of the State debt during these two financial years is lower than that of the Central government,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-blamed-for-aps-financial-woes/article35598542.ece

Narasimha Rao in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday on the status of the petrochemical complex in Andhra Pradesh, said the State government should take a decision on the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) in the context of its appeal to the Centre to foot the bill. Mr. Rameswar stated that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had conveyed to the Government of A.P. that the proposed refinery and petrochemical project was capital-intensive and required huge investments. It was also mentioned that the project would have a direct and indirect impact on the economy of the State, and hence the State government should take an appropriate decision on the issue. The Union Minister also said the State government, the GAIL and the HPCL had signed a MoU on January 27, 2017, in Visakhapatnam for the development of the petrochemical complex at an estimated cost of Rs. 32,901 crore in Kakinada. A feasibility study was done. The oil PSUs had indicated to the State government that VGF was essential to make the project viable. The oil PSUs had sought Rs. 948 crore per year as interest loan, or Rs. 5,615 crore for making the project viable. MP blames Jagan, Naidu In a message posted on Twitter, Mr. Narasimha Rao said, “The short-sightedness of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and N. Chandrababu Naidu has deprived A.P. of the huge petrochemical complex and its concomitant benefits to the State.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-leaves-decision-on-vgf-to-state/article35598751.ece

29 July 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Teachers’ protest today seeking fair deal||Leaders of the Andhra Pradesh Teachers’ Federation are on a warpath over what they call “utter neglect” of the key issues that are directly related to the welfare of the teaching fraternity in the State. To build pressure on the government for a solution to their long-pending issues, the federation has called for State-wide protests on July 29. In a statement, the federation president K. Bhanu Murthy and general secretary P. Panduranga Varaprasadarao said dharnas would be staged at the taluk offices by teachers seeking immediate redressal of their problems. They alleged that even as the problems were piling up, the government looked the other way. The demand for repeal of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) and bringing back the old pension scheme was still hanging fire and even after three years, the PRC was not yet implemented. It was a long wait for teachers to receive the payment of the arrears of six phases of Dearness Allowances, they pointed out, complaining that the Government, instead, was focussed on merger of the Classes 3, 4 and 5 into High Schools without having a coherent plan in place. Citing the challenges ahead, they said the classrooms used in the past would not be sufficient to accommodate all students in view of the social distancing norms. There was a need to recruit at least 20,000 more teachers to cater to the small divided classrooms. Every school needed additional classrooms but the authorities concerned were silent on the issue. The job calendar had no mention of the DSC, they said, adding that though the government had been talking about an additional 6 lakh admissions in the State-run schools this academic year, it had not spelt out its stand on the additional facilities needed. Seeking to draw the authorities’ attention to the plight of some of the teaches who had not received their salaries in last six months after their transfers, they said due to non-implementation of the service rules, hundreds of posts of Mandal Education Officers, Deputy Education Officers and DIET lecturers were lying vacant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/teachers-protest-today-seeking-fair-deal/article35598839.ece

29 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VMRDA should cater to needs of all sections, say CPI(M) and FDNA||The CPI(M) and the Forum for Development of North Andhra (FDNA) have sought that the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) extend the date for submission of suggestions on draft Master Plan till September 30. In separate statements, CPI(M) District Committee secretary K. Lokanadham and FDNA general secretary A. Aja Sarma said the main objective of the VMRDA was to provide affordable housing to all sections. It was side-tracked once the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) had started auction of plots during the 1990s, they said. The purview of the VMRDA has been extended from Payakaraopeta in Visakhapatnam district to Gajapathinagaram and Poosapatirega in Vizianagaram district, increasing the area from a mere 1,721 sq. km to 4,873 sq. km. This could result in more problems to the people of far-flung villages as they have to approach VMRDA for various permissions, they said. VMRDA, in its earlier avatar as VUDA and the Town Planning Trust (TPT), had developed many colonies with constructed houses or plots at affordable prices on ‘allotment basis’ in Visakhapatnam city and Vizianagaram apart from developing parks for the benefit of the general public in the city. But later this social concern paved the way for VUDA turning into a commercial organisation, the leaders said. The very concept of the VUDA has changed it and was turned into a commercial organisation. The draft report was also prepared under this commercial background only. This was evident from the fact that out of 1.051 layouts approved by VUDA, only 49 are VUDA’s own layouts while the remaining were fully or partially private, where a low or a middle income group person has no place, they said. They alleged that the VUDA was acting like an agent for private corporate real estate developers for making huge profits. The very policy of VUDA was turned into aggravating the housing problem instead of easing it. If the master plan really wants to address this issue, the present policy should be changed completely, they said. In the entire draft, there was no mention about allotment of plots or flats to common people at affordable prices. They suggested among other things stopping of the acquisition of lands from the poor and farmers in the name of development of roads and infrastructure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vmrda-should-cater-to-needs-of-all-sections-say-cpim-and-fdna/article35598785.ece
29 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||First day of Maoist Martyrs’ Week passes off peacefully||The first day of the Maoist Martyrs’ Week passed with no untoward incident being reported from the mandals in Visakha Agency affected by the Left Wing Extremism (LWE). The Maoists have been observing the martyrs’ week ever since Charu Majumdar, founder of the Naxal movement in the country, died in police custody in West Bengal on July 28, 1972. The week is observed between July 28 and August 3. The Maoists organise mass public meetings. However, many incidents of violence such as targetting vital installations, blasting landmines, attacks on security forces and killing tribals after labelling them as informers have also been reported during the period. In 2019, a few days before the martyrs’ week, the Maoists killed Pangi Sattibabu and Gemmili Bhaskara Rao at Veeravaram village, Chintapalli mandal, after labelling them as police informers. However, the event has been a low key affair since 2020. Senior police officers who engaged in anti-Maoist operations said the Maoists may not resort to violence or even hold meetings this time as they are on the run. After the Teegalametta encounter in Koyyuru Mandal in June and the recent one reported from G.K. Veedhi, it is learnt that the Maoists, barely around 20 in number, are trying to find a safe haven. Meanwhile, the police have intensified combing operations in the interior pockets of the Agency. “The strength of the force has been increased in sensitive areas,” said Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao. Rallying behind peace Meanwhile, taking a cue from the Maoists, the tribals have erected makeshift peace stupas in villages such as Bongaram in Pedabayalu mandal and Kumada in Munchingput mandal. Unlike the Maoist stupas that are red in colour, the ones erected by tribals are painted in green and white, signifying peaceful living and an end to killings of tribal people. They even inscribed the names of the tribals killed in the recent past by the Maoists on the stupas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/first-day-of-maoist-martyrs-week-passes-off-peacefully/article35598272.ece
29 July 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tiger roar gets louder in State||The tigers have come roaring back in Andhra Pradesh, according to the latest assessment done by the A.P. Forest Department. There has been a consistent rise in the number of tigers at the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR), the largest such reserve in the country. Speaking to The Hindu ahead of the Global Tiger Day (July 29), Rahul Pandey, Chief Conservator of Forest (wildlife), said, “As many as 63 tiger images have been captured in camera traps during 2020-21, indicating the minimum number of tigers present in the vast reserve forest area.” The first assessment done by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2019 after the State’s bifurcation had put the number of tigers in Andhra Pradesh at 48. The NSTR is spread over 3,728 sq. km, covering Kurnool, Prakasam, Kadapa and Chittoor districts in Andhra Pradesh. Its unique geographical expanse includes the pristine Nallamala and Seshachalam hill ranges with a vast and continuous forest patch. Conservation measures Terming it as a heartening news, Mr. Pandey said the key measures undertaken towards tiger conservation included active surveillance by using sensor-based camera traps, 24 X 7 patrolling by the personnel, and engaging the local community. The established protocols for monitoring tigers include foot patrols, vehicular patrols, night surveillance, grid surveys, camera traps in grids, collection of pugmark signs, monitoring for indirect evidences of tiger presence and tracking of trails where frequent movement or presence is observed. “The camera trap is placed at every two sq. km-area. Around 1,200 cameras are used in the exercise that begins in October every year post monsoon and goes up to May. We get about 1,000 pictures of tigers, which are then assessed through statistical tool to gauge the overall number,” said Mr. Pandey. The entire landscape is divided into 550 grids. Each grid is surveyed for field signs of tiger presence. Camera trap is fixed in each grid to get a visual image of the tiger, or prey base. For 45 days duration, the camera trap images are collected and scientific assessment is done on day-to-day data received during the period. The stripe pattern is unique to each tiger, and each tiger is coded by specific ID. Role for Chenchu tribe The lifeline of the tiger conservation measures set up by the Forest Department is the involvement of the Chenchu tribe (a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group). “We have about 400 people from the tribe associated with us. They are protection watchers and assist the forest staff in patrolling. They are an integral part of the conservation and anti-poaching measures,” said Mr. Pandey. As part of the conservation measures, 67 base camps (semi-permanent structures) are set up across the NSTR. A group of five Chenchus man each of the base camps. They move throughout the treacherous terrains of the forests from dawn every day, digitally capture the pugmarks and other remnants left by the big cats, and monitor the camera traps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tiger-roar-gets-louder-in-state/article35598760.ece

It may be recalled that former Joint Director of CBI V.V. Lakshminarayana had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the High Court challenging the decision of the Centre on sale of the VSP. The Centre maintained that Mr. Lakshminarayana had contested the general elections and had political reasons for filing the PIL and hence it could not be entertained by the HC. The Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee has announced its decision to stage a protest opposite the Administration Building in the VSP on Thursday. CPI(M) City Committee secretary B. Ganga Rao has condemned the stand taken by the Centre on the issue. It reflects the attitude of the Union government towards employees, he said. The CPI(M) leader alleged that the Centre was planning to hand over national assets to corporate groups. He sought immediate recall of the decision to privatise the VSP and allocation of captive mines to the plant. He also appealed to the Chief Minister to write a letter to the Centre to oppose the counter affidavit filed by it in the High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/trade-unions-criticise-centres-stand-on-privatisation-of-vsp/article35598859.ece

29 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Stop all political and religious gatherings, scientists urge govts||Distinguished scientist and chairman of National Academy of Sciences-India, Hyderabad chapter, Ch. Mohan Rao on Wednesday urged governments to put a halt to all kind of political, religious and other ‘non-productive’ gatherings along with keeping the cinema halls and clubs shut to prevent any further outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic. More mutations “Most certainly the third wave will come, if we invite it. We must be careful to see that cases due to people gathering do not rise any further because it will only lead to more mutations in the virus,” he warned, opening the webinar on COVID-19 pandemic in which top scientists from across the country participated. Dr. Rao, also a former CSIR-CCMB director, said any COVID variant can cause harm “only if it enters the body”, therefore the simple solution is to stop that is by wearing face masks properly, maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently. “This has been the effective norm since 1911. We have handled pandemics before and have so far done fairly well. We will eventually come out of it. Our medical understanding of the pathology, making of diagnostic kits quickly and the vaccines has been good,” he observed. While most of the indigenous work has been based on available scientific material, the scientist felt that there was a good scope for innovation in testing and diagnostic equipment like a quicker test akin to a breath analyser. ‘Social vaccine is key’ Former ICMR director general V.M.Katoch said vaccines alone will not end the pandemic but with social vaccine, testing and isolation of positive cases. Standard operating protocols for treatment, offices and schools was the need of the hour. ICMR-NIN’s Bhanuprakash Reddy said infection and malnutrition go together and that diet of cereals, pulses, milk products, fruits and vegetables was essential.

29 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||After 13 years, Srisailam gates lifted in July to discharge flood||Spillway discharge of flood at Srisaialm dam, the common reservoir for the two Telugu States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, commenced on Wednesday evening as the project authorities operated two crest gates and lifted them for 10-foot height each to let 53,600 cusecs of water fall majestically into the bucket and rebound into the air before falling into the river course. The engineers of the project performed a ritual (puja) before switching on the motors to operate the gates after 6.30 p.m. as the water storage in the reservoir crossed 200 tmc ft against its capacity of 215.8 tmc ft and water level crossed 882 feet against the full reservoir level of 885 ft. Along with the spillway discharge, another 65,000 cusecs water was also being let into the river with power generation in the left bank power house of Telangana and right bank power house of Andhra Pradesh. According to the dam authorities, the spillway discharge in July this year has taken place for the first time after 2007 due to flood reaching from the second week of June. Last year, the spillway discharge of flood could begin on August 19 and on August 9 a year before that (2019). The dam was getting over 4.16 lakh cusecs flood being released at Jurala and Tungabhadra dams in the upstream. Power generation “But for the release of nearly 50 tmcft of water with power generation by Telangana so far this water year (from June 1), Srisailam dam would have become surplus much earlier. Telangana has taken up power generation by operating one unit of the 6×150 megawatt power house initially, in the first week of June,” a senior engineer at the dam site told The Hindu . After July 19, the generation has been in two to five units. About 55.3 million units of energy was generated in the left bank power house during June and another 226.37 MU this month, till July 27. Hydel generation in the right bank power house commenced on July 27 as AP was opposing generation by Telangana till the last week. As of Wednesday evening, the upstream reservoirs from where Srisailam is getting flood were all getting sizeable volume of water. Almatti was getting 4.14 lakh cusecs and discharging 3.8 lakh cusecs. Similarly, it was 4 lakh cusecs n 3.87 lakh cusecs at Narayanpur, 3.82 lakh cusecs and 3.85 lakh cusecs at Jurala and 81,000 cusecs and 50,000 cusecs at Tungabhadra, respectively. In the Godavari Basin, Sriramsagar was getting 12,800 cusecs inflow and Yellampally was getting 16,200 cusecs. Singur (1,750), Nizamsagar (679), Lower Manair (3,800), Kaddam (1,300 cusecs) were also getting inflows in a small measure. In the downstream, Medigadda Barrage was getting 1.43 lakh cusecs flood and discharging 1.46 lakh cusecs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/after-13-years-srisailam-gates-lifted-in-july-to-discharge-flood/article35598546.ece
29 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Three decades of Roots replete with milestones||A young engineer from the CBIT with passion for entrepreneurship and a desire to give back to the society launched his institution when his friends opted for greener pastures abroad. Three decades later, the institution — Roots Collegium — has earned a name for itself in the niche areas of education in the city and is making waves, offering its students numerous opportunities in the emerging areas. “When Hyderabad had fewer private institutions of quality in the higher education sector, it was my desire to give quality education. Thus, started this journey,” recalls B.P. Padala, chairman, Roots Collegium. What started as a junior college has grown into a sought-after brand with four campuses under its wing, offering 23 innovative courses in Business Administration, Commerce, Film Making, Mass Communication and Hotel Management apart from conventional courses. The biggest satisfaction for him is that Roots is now counted among the top ones. “Industry-ready candidates is what headhunters are seeking now and we fulfil that need,” says Mr. Padala, who hails from a small village in the combined Warangal district. When there were few people in the IIT-JEE coaching in the 90s in the city Mr. Padala began his journey ensuring 120 students realise the dream of all Indians — getting into an IIT. “The new millennium introduced opportunities for liberal arts and the immense potential had to be exploited for the students. So we set up new institutions in non-medical and non-engineering streams. The institutions were envisioned to set new benchmarks with top notch infrastructure, international ambience, activities, experiential learning and industry focussed courses,” he says. He started engaging companies and MNCs for partnerships to ensure a hands-on learning approach, with case studies and industrial visits for better learning and a deeper understanding of concepts. “Students had to acquire the right skills and business acumen to compete in the global market and we provided that academic environment,” he adds. An executive BBA programme with CAT coaching was started for those looking for placement in top colleges, Mr. Padala says adding that an incubation centre was also started to mentor budding entrepreneurs and next generation family business scions. Following in his footsteps around 20 degree students have set up their startups with funding support and guidance. Realising the huge potential for opportunities for mass communication students in the ever growing digital media field, the institute also offers varied arts and media related programmes. “We believe that design and communication are an extension of creativity. The courses are designed to groom students to become change makers and future media leaders,” explains Roots Degree College principal Swathi. Recent addition has been the hotel management course. “Students are mentored by experts with rich experience and through Internships with reputed hotel chains in the country” adds Ms. Swathi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/three-decades-of-roots-collegium-replete-with-milestones/article35598537.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy directed the officers concerned to file status reports on the matter within four weeks. The Bench took up a newspaper story as PIL petition. Observing that “it was not an adversarial litigation”, the CJ said it was a golden opportunity for both the governments to showcase the temple before the world. The Bench made it clear that officers of different departments of both governments have to make concerted efforts for the purpose. “You never work in tandem… It is a national monument...You have to give it your best shots..” the Chief Justice said. Referring to the World Heritage Committee’s recommendation seeking a conservation and management plan for Ramappa temple, the Bench told the authorities that they “should not miss the opportunity”. It instructed the Archaeological Survey of India, State Archaeological department, department of Heritage and Mulugu District Collector to nominate officers of senior rank to coordinate with the project. They should prepare the plan within the framework of World Heritage Committee. “Time started running...Work with alacrity...You are under the lens of the entire country,” the Bench remarked, referring to the officials. It ordered that ASI’s superintending archaeologist at Hyderabad should chair a committee of officials to prepare the conservation and management plan.

29 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Pro-farmer measures led to steep fall in suicides: Agriculture Minister||Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy has asserted that welfare schemes like Rythu Bandhu have increased the confidence level among farmers and thereby, resulted in steep decline in farmers’ suicides. The statistics presented by the Central government in Parliament on farmers’ suicides were indicative of the proactive steps taken by the State government in making agriculture sector a profitable one. Rythu Bandhu in particular was launched after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao conducted brain storming sessions for six long months to evolve the modalities for the scheme. The scheme subsequently became a role model for other States to emulate and this reflected the foresightedness of Mr. KCR. The Minister, who responded to the Central government’s reply in Parliament, said the government was of the firm belief that improving the rural economy would be possible only through strengthening the agriculture sector. The government had accorded priority to the farm sector employing over 60% of the population and introduced several measures like Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Beema, free power and irrigation water to farms besides providing support price to farmers’ produce. The measures were conceived after the previous governments neglected the farm sector leading to distress among ryots. Implementation of Rythu Bandhu from 2018 resulted in steep decline in farmers’ suicides and this was pointed out by the Centre in its reply. The scheme had reduced the dependence of farmers in banks and private moneylenders and ensured that their confidence levels were significantly enhanced. The pro-farmer policies as well as the steps taken to create new ayacut ensured that farmers continued their profession while those who left it started returning to fields. In spite of the impact of COVID pandemic, the State registered 17 per cent growth in the primary sector and 20% in agriculture sector in particular. People and parties that were criticizing the Rythu Bandhu scheme should conduct an introspection in view of the Centre’s response to the schemes. The Minister exuded confidence that the Dalit Bandhu scheme would yield similar results in empowerment of Dalits and thereby, improve their living standards significantly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pro-farmer-measures-led-to-steep-fall-in-suicides-agriculture-minister/article35598550.ece
29 July 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Jaipal Reddy architect of TS formation, says Revanth||Telangana Congress president A. Revanth Reddy termed the late S. Jaipal Reddy as the architect of Telangana formation, who impressed upon Sonia Gandhi the need to fulfil the promise made to the people. ‘It was Mr. Jaipal Reddy who played a crucial role in ensuring that Hyderabad and its resources remained with Telangana when the new State was being carved out. He is a gentleman who never claimed his contribution, but political circles realise how important his role was,” Mr. Revanth Reddy said after visiting Jaipal Reddy’s memorial, marking second death anniversary. Mr. Jaipal Reddy’s name definitely figures in the great political figures of Telangana after P.V. Narasimha Rao, he said, recalling in his 50-year political career he was never tainted with any corruption charges despite holding high offices in the country. Hyderabad Metro Rail was his contribution to the city and the Kalwakurthy project. Political leaders cutting across party lines visited the memorial and paid their respects. These included senior Congress leaders Jana Reddy, Madhu Yaskhi Goud, Ponnam Prabhakar, Anjan Kumar Yadav, Mahesh Kumar Goud, Shabbir Ali, TRS Leader Gutha Sukhender Reddy, who recalled his contribution and their fond association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jaipal-reddy-architect-of-ts-formation-says-revanth/article35598552.ece
29 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Possible to avert third wave, even end pandemic: CCMB adviser||We can not only avert a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also put an end to it by the end of the year if we adhere to face masks, ensure there is no clustering of people in closed spaces, increase the pace of vaccination besides taking up large scale testing, tracing and isolation of positive cases, said former director of CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) and now adviser Rakesh Mishra on Wednesday. “No variant can spread without people’s cooperation. It cannot break through a properly worn mask covering the nose and mouth. It is uncivil not to wear a mask in public as you may spread the virus to your own family and friends. No one predict the third wave but we can tilt this in our favour if we can do these things,” he asserted. Making a presentation on ‘COVID variants & the pandemic’ in a webinar organised by The National Academy of Sciences-India: Hyderabad chapter, he said there could be a need for a booster vaccine dose and that there was a greater likelihood of virus outbreaks in smaller towns and not on a nationwide scale in future. Sero-positivity “There could be a significant number of sero-positive people. However, we do not know how long this will last so we need to adhere to the social vaccine of physical distancing, masks and hand washing along with vaccination. There are no black and white solutions,” affirmed Dr. Mishra. Delta variant enveloped the entire country within six months from January 2021, and research showed that it has a viral load 1,000 times higher among the infected persons when compared to the original coronavirus strain with incubation period shortened to four days. “Vaccination is more important than ever in view of the Delta variant as the collaborative research with AIG Hospitals had showed disease severity to be significantly low among vaccinated people despite co-morbidities and higher age. Two doses (both Covaxin and Covishield are effective) lower the mortality rate by 50%,” said the top scientist. Risky spaces While the outdoors is largely free of virus, airborne transmission of virus through an infected person is not detected when properly masked but rooms with poor ventilation showed presence of viral particles even two hours after the infected person exited upon spending considerable time inside. Infection possibility is also high when an infected person nearby is speaking on the phone, he said. With offices and possibly educational institutions opening up, Dr. Mishra has called for mandatory face masks, cross ventilation, use of germicidal UV lamps in AC units or near ceilings, conducting gatherings in open and well-ventilated spaces, eating in isolation and in open spaces. Regular screening helps in identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers and isolate them timely. Formation of national genome sequencing consortium or INSACOG has helped scale up the exercise of sequencing up to 50,000 samples and identify the Kappa and Delta variants when compared to just 8,000 samples done through individual efforts by various labs last year, said director of CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology Anurag Agrawal.  Vaccination is more important than ever in view of the Delta variant.

29 July 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Central Waqf Council flays TSWB over ‘mismanagement’||The Cental Waqf Council (CWC) on Wednesday minced no words in criticising the Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) for ‘mismanagement’ of endowed properties. “In fact, as far as the Telangana State and Hyderabad city are concerned, with respect to Waqf properties, a number of cases of mismanagement have come up, and that is a fact. Nobody can deny this,” said CWC member Naushad. CWC members Munawari Begum, Haneef Ali, Darakhshan Andrabi, Wasim Rahatali Khan, and Mohammed Harun met TSWB chairman Mohammed Saleem, and later spoke to the media. Reacting to the TSWB cancelling around 500 illegal registrations of Waqf properties, Mr. Naushad said that while this was a good initiative and may be treated as a ‘first step’, it does not mean that the Muslim endowments’ body has done ‘everything’. Taking questions from the media on the unavailability of a full-time chief executive officer (CEO), Mr. Naushad said that TSWB should not be held accountable for this. It is the State government which has to appoint the officer. Similarly, the appointment of a Survey Commissioner was the responsibility of the State government, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/central-waqf-council-flays-tswb-over-mismanagement/article35598556.ece

Ltd., a city-based electric vehicles startup, has received a design patent for its unique design among all e-bikes across the country like having a sportier riding posture, shape of the 14-litre tank and naked body structure.

29 July 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Cong. MLA taken into custody||Several Congress leaders, including Munugode legislator Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy, were taken into preventive custody at various places, in the wake of coinciding developments planned at the Munugode constituency headquarters on Wednesday. The Congress leader had given a call to his cadre to come out in large numbers to protest and demand implementation of the proposed Dalit Bandhu scheme in Munugode along with Huzurabad, where the government intends to launch on a pilot-basis. Distribution of new ration cards was also planned at Munugode, where Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy was the chief guest. Mr. Rajagopal Reddy was taken into custody on the outskirts of Hyderabad, local arrests were made in Nalgonda and Munugode, and the programme venue and the mandal headquarters were fortified with police. The preventive arrests to maintain law and order assumed attention in view of the on-stage spat between Congress and TRS leaders in Choutuppal on Monday, following which the Choutuppal police had booked cases against Congress leaders. According to Mr. Rajagopal Reddy, who later spoke to the media, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, under the guise of Dalit empowerment, was using Dalits for Huzurabad by-poll. He demanded that the scheme be implemented across the State at the same time. Meanwhile, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy condemned the arrests. Mr. Jagadish Reddy, however, affirmed that development in Munugode, along with the State, was being carried out irrespective of constituency leaders and party affiliation. He said Mission Bhagiratha was ideated because of drinking water issue and fluorosis in Munugode, and the Yadadri Mega Power Plant and Green Industrial Park at Malkapur were also indices of development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-mla-taken-into-custody/article35598544.ece

The district has around 130 illegal structures spread across 500 acre PLPA notified land. The announcement came in the wake of the Supreme Court observation on July 23 in a matter pertaining to Khori Basti demolition that “the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception”. Holding a joint press conference with the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the District Forest Department, Deputy Commissioner Yashpal Yadav said that notices would be served to the owners of the illegal structures to remove the encroachment and the demolition would be carried out in case they don’t adhere to the directions within four days.

He said the notices would be served soon on the encroachers. MCF Commissioner Garima Mittal said all logistical support would be extended to the forest department for the removal of encroachment on PLPA land belonging to the municipal body.

Paediatrician Balraj Yadav from Mohanpur village said the pregnant and lactating women were reluctant to get vaccinated despite the approval from the authorities that vaccination was safe for them. Therefore, he decided to take an initiative to hold a special camp for them in his village. “I discussed the idea with the local health officials and they readily agreed to it. Around 70 vaccination doses were administered during the drive held last Sunday,” said Mr. Yadav, who runs a clinic in Gurugram. The drive was called “Roko and Toko Abhiyan”, and a separate pink vaccination centre was set up for the women of the village. “We made an announcement in the village a day before the scheduled drive. The response was overwhelming. We registered around 150 people, but could vaccinate only 70 as per the availability of the doses. Besides the pregnant and lactating women, the men and women of all ages above 18 years were also administered the vaccine,” said Dr. Yadav. The beneficiaries were also handed over a kit containing a mask, a soap and sanitiser to emphasise the need to adhere to COVID-appropriate behaviour even after the vaccination. “The drive was called so to send across a message that people need to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour to stop the prevention of the infection and also nag others to adhere to it,” said Dr. Yadav. Rewari Immunisation Officer Ashok Kumar said the District Health Department was vaccinating the pregnant and lactating women on priority and aimed at 100% coverage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/60-expecting-mothers-vaccinated-in-mohanpur/article35598408.ece

29 July 2021||Nainital,||Uttarakhand govt. pulled up for SOP violation||The Uttarakhand High Court on Wednesday pulled up the State government for the violation of COVID-19 SOPs in tourist places and extended the stay on the Char Dham Yatra until the matter pending in the Supreme Court is decided. Observing that 75% of the tourists coming to Nainital were not following the COVID-19 SOPs, contributing to a rise in positive cases last week, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice R.S. Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma expressed concern over the increasing crowds at tourist places on weekends and inquired about the steps taken to control them. The High Court had put a stay on the Char Dham Yatra on June 28 in view of the risks involved in conducting the pilgrimage amid the pandemic after which the State government had approached the Supreme Court. However, the apex court is yet to hear the matter. During the hearing on a bunch of PILs related to the State government’s preparations for the yatra amid the pandemic, advocate Shiv Bhatt said the SLP presented by the government has not yet been heard in the Supreme Court, so the order banning Char Dham Yatra should be taken forward. Since the stay issued by the High Court was to expire on Wednesday, it was extended till the next date of hearing, which is August 18, or till the Supreme Court decides the matter. Reply on health facilities The court directed the State to file a detailed reply on a slew of issues related to the COVID-19 situation and health facilities by August 18. The court asked the district authorities about how they planned to control crowds at tourists spots. The court observed that in Nainital itself, 75% of tourists are not following the SOPs, while no one is following social distancing. Due to this, 10 Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Nainital last week, it said. The court asked as to how many cases have been registered against people disobeying COVID-19 SOPs. The court also asked the State government about the number of vacancies of doctors, nurses and technical staff in government hospitals and about the steps taken to fill them. The High Court asked the district hospitals to submit the actual status of ambulances. It asked for a detailed report on the number of ambulances in district hospitals, their condition and the requirement for new ones. Health Secretary Amit Negi apprised the court that there are 95 blocks in the State. The State has 54 ambulances of 108 service and 41 more ambulances are required to provide one ambulance in each block. For this, an application has been sent to the Union Ministry of Health. Vaccination centres The court also directed the officials responsible for the ongoing vaccination in the State to personally monitor it. The court said that the number of vaccination centres that have been set up is not sufficient and asked as to what was the government doing to provide vaccination to the disabled people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-pulls-up-uttarakhand-govt-for-violation-of-sops/article35598376.ece

On the first day, the House is scheduled to move and pass a resolution to recommend the conferment of the Bharat Ratna on environmentalist and Chipko Movement leader Sunderlal Bahuguna. Cornering AAP On its part, the 8-member BJP opposition will seek to corner the AAP Delhi government on its alleged failure during the second wave of the pandemic, besides other issues like public transport infrastructure and the quality and supply of potable water. The AAP, on the first day, will initiate a discussion on the alleged failure of the Capital’s BJP-run civic bodies in relation to waterlogging issues followed by a discussion on the appointment of the Delhi Police Commissioner in alleged violation of the Supreme Court guidelines. Conversely, the BJP Opposition will seek to initiate a discussion on the alleged failure of the Delhi government to open a new schools or colleges as well as the alleged shortage of teachers in government schools. Assembly gherao Meanwhile, BJP Delhi president Adesh Gupta and Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri will lead the party in a gherao of the Assembly on Thursday in protest of multiple alleged scams in Delhi government departments. BJP MLA Abhay Verma has also given a contempt notice to a reply by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot to a discussion on calling attention motion under Rule 54 by BJP MLA Vijender Gupta on March 11 in the Assembly. According to the BJP, the Transport Minister had stated: “Whatever our low-floor buses are, the maintenance is not done by DTC staff themselves, it is all outsourced and there are about 71 items that are not covered by the warranty.” In this regard, Mr. Verma said the Transport Minister informed the House that there were 71 items of purchase and maintenance of buses that are not covered under warranty. These will be included under maintenance. “He had said that these 71 items are neither mentioned in the tender document nor in the work order issued. There isn’t any such list. Prima facie there is a case of contempt of the House against him,” he said. “The Speaker should take cognisance and take action against the Transport Minister as per rules,” Mr. Verma added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/monsoon-session-of-assembly-likely-to-run-into-rough-weather/article35598415.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||What is ‘contingent worker’, HC asks Twitter||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday expressed reservations about Twitter changing the status of its recently appointed chief compliance officer (CCO) from “interim” to “contingent” in its latest affidavit. Justice Rekha Palli remarked that the rules mandated the appointment of a senior employee as CCO, but Twitter, according to its affidavit, had appointed a “contingent worker” through a third party contractor. “What is this contingent worker? I don’t know what it would mean. I have a problem with the word,” the court said. It gave the micro-blogging site a week’s time to submit a fresh affidavit. “File a better affidavit. This is not acceptable. I’m giving you a long rope but don’t expect the court to do it on and on. Disclose the name of the third party contractor and explain ‘contingent’.” Hearing on Aug. 6 The High Court directed Twitter to also disclose details of the Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) and Nodal Contact Person. It will hear the case again on August 6. Twitter, in its affidavit, stated that Vinay Prakash had been appointed as COO and RGO as contingent worker through third party contractor. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, said the CCO had undertaken to perform all functions and responsibilities under the IT Rules, even though he was a contingent worker and appointed through third party contractor. “I don’t know what you want to do,” the court remarked. “If you want to [comply with the rules], do it whole-heartedly.” Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Centre, said Twitter was acting in “abject non-compliance of rules” as the CCO could not be a contingent worker. “It has been months. You can’t have it so easy. We hold our hands because we are before your lordship,” the ASG said. Earlier, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had stated that despite all Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) having been granted three months’ time to comply with the Information Technology Rules, 2021, Twitter had failed to fully comply. In India, Section 79 of the IT Act shields social media platforms or intermediaries such as Twitter from liability for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by it in certain cases. The Ministry said when an intermediary fails to observe the IT Rules, it could be liable for any punishment under any law for the time being in force in respect of the offending content. The Ministry’s affidavit came in response to a petition by advocate Amit Acharya seeking the appointment of a Resident Grievance Officer under Rule 4 of the IT Rules 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/what-is-contingent-worker-hc-asks-twitter/article35598424.ece
29 July 2021||New Delhi,||Petition claims new excise policy aims to lower drinking age||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi government to respond to a petition challenging a provision in the new Excise Policy, claiming it seeks to reduce the age of consumption of liquor from 25 to 21. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Jyoti Singh issued notice on the petition, which has also sought to quash a provision in the new Excise Policy that there shall be no government-owned liquor vends and only privately-owned vends. Vulnerable strata NGO All India Bhrashtachar Virodhi Morcha, in its plea, said there is an opinion among a lot of people that reducing the age of consumption of liquor will increase alcoholism amongst students and younger generation of the society, leading to other consequent problems and the decision to close government vends is not in public interest. The minimum age of consumption of liquor in Delhi is 25 years, but in the neighbouring States of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, it is 25 and 21 respectively. The plea claimed that the Delhi government is effectively seeking to reduce the minimum age of consumption of liquor from 25 to 21 years, as is the case in neighbouring State of Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner said Article 47 of the Constitution states that the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption of intoxicating drinks, except for medicinal purposes, which are injurious to health.  It said the consumers of liquor will also be affected as they are assured about the quality of alcohol when they purchase it from the government vends and this assurance would not be there in case of private vends. Several petitions have been filed in the High Court challenging the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 alleging that it was illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/petition-claims-new-excise-policy-aims-to-lower-drinking-age/article35598406.ece

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||China Foreign Minister hosts Taliban, calls it a ‘pivotal force’||China on Wednesday hosted a rare nine-member Taliban delegation amid its recent ascendancy in Afghanistan, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi describing the group as “a pivotal military and political force” in the country. The delegation, led by Abdul Ghani Baradar who heads the Taliban’s political office in Doha, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other officials in Tianjin, a port city around 100 km southeast of Beijing. The visit to China is the first from the group in the wake of its gaining key ground in Afghanistan, including in Badakshan province which borders China’s western Xinjiang region. It isn’t, however, the first such Taliban visit to China and caps years of careful outreach from Beijing to the group, on occasion mediated by Pakistan, China’s “all-weather” ally. A delegation was hosted in Beijing in 2019, while in 2015, China had hosted negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan officials in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang’s provincial capital, in a meeting facilitated by Pakistan. The Taliban delegation’s visit also comes days after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met with Mr. Wang in the Chinese city of Chengdu. Both sides on Saturday said they had agreed on “joint actions” to more closely work together in Afghanistan amid the changing situation in the country. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, in a statement on Wednesday, said Mr. Wang had called on the Taliban “to draw a line” between the group and terror organisations, specifically the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which has carried out attacks in Xinjiang. He described the Taliban as “a pivotal military and political force in Afghanistan” and said it was “expected to play an important role in the process of peace, reconciliation and reconstruction”. He said China hoped the group would “resolutely and effectively combat” the ETIM. Mr. Wang also hit out at the U.S., telling the delegation that “the hasty withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan marks the failure of the U.S. policy toward Afghanistan”. The head of the Taliban delegation, the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said, committed that the group “will not allow any force to use Afghan territory to do anything harmful to China”. He was also quoted as saying the Taliban “hoped China will participate more in the peace and reconstruction process and play a greater role in the future reconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-foreign-minister-hosts-taliban-calls-them-pivotal-force/article35597949.ece
29 July 2021||COLOMBO,||In Sri Lanka, teachers resist Bill ‘militarising’ education||Academics from Sri Lanka’s state universities on Wednesday withdrew from online teaching and administrative duties in resistance to a government Bill that, they say, threatens to “militarise” education. University teachers also held a silent protest across campuses on the island, according to Harshana Rambukwella, a spokesman for the Federation of University Teachers Associations’ (FUTA) campaign against the General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University (or KDU) Bill. “The FUTA’s main demand is that the government keep military and civilian education separate,” Prof. Rambukwella said. “This Bill is not just about one university, it is essentially a model of private education, subsidised by the government and run by the military. It is an assault on the country’s public education system,” he said. The KDU Bill, scheduled for parliamentary debate on August 6, seeks to change the governance structure of the University that was set up in 1980 as an Academy exclusively for the tri-forces, and named after Sri Lanka’s former Prime Minister. The proposed changes could pave way for a greater military role in education policy and administration, academics warn. With their symbolic action, the university teachers joined other teacher and student groups calling for withdrawal of the controversial Bill. The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU), a body of school teachers across the country, and the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF), one of the largest student bodies in Sri Lanka, are also opposing the Bill. Earlier this month, dozens, including CTU general secretary Joseph Stalin, were arrested during a protest against the Bill, on charges of violating “health regulations”. They were forcibly quarantined for a week. Following wide condemnation of the arrest, including by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, they were released. “Discussions with the government have been very disappointing so far, we will continue our strike action,” Mr. Stalin told The Hindu , of the CTU’s ongoing protests against both, the KDU Bill and for a “long-pending” salary hike. ‘Growing militarisation’ Concerns over militarisation in Sri Lanka grew following the election of ex-military officer Gotabaya Rajapaksa as President in November 2019. In her report in January this year, UN Human Rights Chief Michelle Bachelet referred to “the accelerating militarisation of civilian governmental functions”, citing the appointment of at least 28 serving or former military and intelligence personnel to key administrative posts. For a decade now, the Tamil people living in the north and east, who have faced the brunt of post-war militarisation, have repeatedly objected to the visible presence and participation of the army in civilian activities, including agriculture. The growing momentum and media coverage of the ongoing protests against the KDU Bill lately have put militarisation in the spotlight in the country’s Sinhala-majority south. Those slamming the Bill are flagging the possibility of a military-run, parallel structure of higher education, with provisions to quell students’ right to free expression and dissent. In a recent Oped article, Opposition legislator and former professor Harini Amasuriya wrote: “The proposed KDU Bill offers a privatised, military model of higher education, which will take Sri Lanka on a trajectory towards militarisation of society as a whole.” President Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the politically influential Maha Sangha [Buddhist clergy] recently that the “obstacles” in the “University Grants Commission Act” would be removed, and the KDU would be brought under its purview. “It is a mistaken reference to Sri Lanka’s Universities Act, as there is no UGC Act,” Prof. Rambukwella said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-sri-lanka-teachers-resist-bill-militarising-education/article35597946.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. man jailed for leaking documents||A U.S. federal court in Virginia sentenced a former intelligence contractor and member of the U.S. Air Force, Daniel Hale, to almost four years in prison for leaking documents on the U.S.’s drone programme to a news outlet in 2014. The move was sharply criticised by freedom of press and civil liberties advocates as damaging to press freedoms and human rights. Mr. Hale, 33, who helped organise drone attacks from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, was sentenced by a federal court in Virginia to 45 months in prison for leaking the documents to The Intercept . Mr. Hale was charged in 2019 under the Espionage Act and pleaded guilty earlier this year. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Hale rather than contribute to a debate on drone warfare, aided terror groups, the Associated Press reported. Non-government estimates of drone strikes during the Obama administration have exceeded official counts for this period . The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported at least 325 drone strikes while the official tally was just 64, according to the Washington Post . “At the press of a button from thousands of miles away, two hellfire missiles screeched out of the sky, followed by two more. Showing no signs of remorse, I, and those around me, clapped and cheered triumphantly,” Mr. Hale wrote to the judge, parts of which were published by The Intercept. “I believe that it is wrong to kill, but it is especially wrong to kill the defenseless,” Mr. Hale said. The Judge, Liam O’ Grady, said he was not sentencing Mr. Hale for his “ courageous and principled” position on drone warfare but on his leaking of documents. He said Mr. Hale could have resigned from the military or refused to participate in drone attacks. “You could have been a whistleblower... without taking any of these documents,” he said as per a report in the Washington Post . The Post also reported that the leaked documents had revealed that 90% of those killed were not the intended targets in an Afghanistan operation. “The court did reject the prosecution’s extreme demands, but Hale’s prison sentence is nonetheless another tragic example of how the government misuses the Espionage Act to punish alleged journalistic sources as spies, a practice that damages human rights, press freedom and democracy,” editor of The Intercept, Betsy Reed, said. The Intercept has not confirmed that Mr. Hale was its source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-man-jailed-for-leaking-documents/article35597947.ece

Ennahdha is the dominant party in Parliament, whose activities were suspended this week by President Kais Saied. Tunisia’s leader also fired the Prime Minister and key Cabinet members, saying it was necessary to stabilise a country in economic and health crisis. But Ennahdha and other critics accused him of overstepping his power and threatening Tunisia’s democracy. The spokesperson for the financial prosecutor’s office, Mohsen Daly, said that the investigations were opened in mid-July. He also announced investigations were opened earlier this month into the country’s national anti-corruption agency — suspected itself of corruption — and into Tunisia’s Truth and Dignity Commission created to confront abuses during Tunisia’s decades of autocratic rule.

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A judgment that must be taken in the right spirit||A constitutional amendment is a rare event. There have only been 104 such cases of those in the 71 years since the Constitution came into being. Rarer still is when a court strikes down a constitutional amendment, an event which has occurred only seven times before last week. But such a moment has come to pass once again as Union of India vs Rajendra N. Shah , a judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of India on July 20, 2021. The 97th Constitutional Amendment was struck down, albeit in a limited manner. The background The 97th Constitutional Amendment came into effect from February 15 2012 (https://bit.ly/3xa0MOH), and brought about many changes to the legal regime of cooperative societies. The amendment added “cooperative societies” to the protected forms of association under Article 19(1)(c), elevating it to a fundamental right. It also inserted Part IXB in the Constitution which laid down the terms by which cooperative societies would be governed, in more granular detail than was palatable. The Constitution can be amended only by the procedure provided in Article 368. The amendment procedure requires a majority of the total strength of each of the Houses of Parliament and two-thirds majority of those present and voting. A proviso to the Article lists out some articles and chapters of the Constitution, which can be amended only by a special procedure. The special procedure requires that the amendment will also have to be ratified by the legislatures of half of the States. It is precisely on the grounds of violation of this additional requirement that the 97th Constitutional Amendment was challenged. It is important to locate this amendment in context. The idea that the cooperative sector ought to be controlled at the State level and not at the central or Union level goes back all the way to the Government of India Act, 1919 which placed cooperatives in the provincial list. This scheme carried forward into the Constitution with Entry 32 of the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution conferring power on the State legislatures to make laws pertaining to incorporation, regulation and the winding up of cooperative societies. Central control But the Union government has been acquiring incrementally greater control of cooperative societies over the years. Cooperative banks have been brought under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India. The political intent of the Union Government for more active involvement in the cooperative sector is also apparent from the recently established Union Ministry for Cooperation. The statement of objects and reasons of the amendment Bill, which resulted in the amendment in question, cites the need for greater independence and transparency in the functioning of the cooperatives and inserted a number of provisions which provided for the regulation of cooperative societies. The Gujarat High Court struck down the amendment in 2013 on the grounds that it had failed to comply with the requirements under Article 368(2) by virtue of not having been ratified by the States and had also given an additional finding that the 97th Amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Union Government challenged the Gujarat High Court judgment before the Supreme Court, arguing that the amendment neither directly nor effectively changed the scheme of distribution of powers between the Centre and the States. The parties which had challenged the amendment in the High Court argued that Part IXB, inserted by the 97th Amendment impinged upon the legislative power of the States by casting mandatory obligations upon the State legislatures to legislate in a particular way in areas in which they ought to have had freedom. Some clauses of the newly inserted part of the Constitution would also override some existing State legislations. The court took the example of the 73rd and 74th Amendments which introduced the chapters on panchayats and municipalities, respectively. Those amendments, similar in impact on the legislative power of the States, had been passed by the special procedure involving ratification by State legislatures. The court noted that the procedure had not been followed in this case but clarified that the judgment is confined to the procedural lacuna and does not go into the question of the amendment being violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. Making a distinction Having found this lapse in procedure, the judgment makes a distinction between cooperative societies operating in one State and multi-State cooperative societies and holds that while a ratification by half the State legislatures would have been necessary insofar as it applies to cooperative societies in one State, they chose not to go deeper into the question of whether the amendment also required ratification in respect of application to multi-State cooperative societies. The minority opinion considered that the provisions of the newly added part which pertain to multi-State cooperative societies could not exist independently of the parts which pertain to cooperative societies, and hence the whole amendment should be struck down. This now brings us to the question – can the Government get over this decision? In theory it would seem simple enough. The amendment has only been struck down on account of the right procedure not having been followed and another amendment can be brought, but this time, going through the rigour of ratification by State legislatures. The National Democratic Alliance has a majority in 18 out of 28 State legislatures. The amendment which has now been struck down was an amendment of the United Progressive Alliance era, so it is not clear as to whether there will be any significant political opposition to the amendment if it is brought again. A sector best left alone Which brings us to the next question – should they? The cooperative sector has always been in the domain of the States or provinces. The organising principles and mechanism of these cooperatives differ from area to area and depend on the industry or crop which forms the fulcrum of the cooperative. Homogeneity in this area would only result in the creation of round holes in which square pegs no longer fit. They also would not really serve to break the control some political interests have taken over cooperatives. It is best that the Government takes this judgment in the right spirit and stays away from further meddling in the cooperative sector, notwithstanding the creation of the new Ministry.

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||No need for a drastic population policy||Population policy is suddenly in the news in India with Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States such as Assam and Uttar Pradesh proposing to bring in or bringing in draft legislation aimed at controlling their populations. The Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill of 2021 promotes a two-child policy, according to which those people having more than two children will be barred from contesting local body elections and become ineligible to apply for State government jobs. A similar law has also been proposed in Assam, where the Chief Minister has even announced a ‘population army’ to curb the birth rate in Muslim-dominated areas in lower Assam. The U.P. Chief Minister has said that the aim of the policy is to reduce the total fertility rate in his State. The Chief Ministers of these States don’t seem to have read the document on population projection, published by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2019. According to this document, U.P. will reach a replacement rate (the rate at which women give birth to enough babies to sustain population levels) of 2.1 by 2025, and Assam by 2020. If the replacement fertility rate has already been achieved in Assam and will be achieved by 2025 in U.P., what is the need for any drastic population policy? Decreasing fertility rates The need arises because population policy is an important weapon in the arsenal of the Hindutva brigade to attack the Muslim population in the country. The Assam Chief Minister’s ‘population army’ in Muslim areas and the U.P. Chief Minister’s many utterances prove this. However, even on this score, their policy framework is wrong. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-2 data, the total fertility rate (TFR), which is the average number of children that women of reproductive age group have had in their lifetime, in 1998-99 in U.P. was 3.87 for Hindus and 4.76 for Muslims. In 2015-16, it decreased to 2.67 for Hindus and 3.1 for Muslims. This means that the TFR declined by 1.2 for Hindus and by 1.66 for Muslims, which is higher. The NFHS-5 data for 2019-20 for U.P. have not been published. When it is published, data will show that the fertility rate for both Hindus and Muslims has declined even further. The fertility trend for Assam is even starker. According to NFHS data, Assam had a TFR of 3.5 in 1992-93, which decreased to 1.9 in 2019-20. Even after such a drastic decline in TFR, the Chief Minister’s enthusiasm to decrease it even further has no merit other than scoring political points based on a distorted notion of religious demography. In 1998-99, the TFR for Hindus in Assam was 2.0, which declined to 1.59 in 2019-20. For Muslims, it declined from 3.05 to 2.38 in the same period. While the fertility rate of Hindus is less than the replacement level, the fertility rate of Muslims is near that level and will reach there in the near future without any policy intervention. The point is that fertility rate does not depend on religion. It depends on socio-economic characteristics like education, income, maternal and child health conditions, and other associated factors. The graphs above show this in a concise manner. We have taken the district-wise fertility rates for Hindus and Muslims in four States: U.P., Assam, West Bengal and Bihar (calculated from NFHS-4 2015-16 data). The horizontal axis shows the fertility rate for Hindus and the vertical axis shows the fertility rate for Muslims. It is clear from the graphs that there is a positive relationship between the fertility rates of Hindus and Muslims. In other words, in districts where Hindus have a high fertility rate, the fertility rate of Muslims is also high. This cannot be explained by religion but by socio-economic factors in these districts. It is also clear that there are districts in these four States where the fertility rate for Hindus is actually higher than that of Muslims. The fertility rate of Hindus is greater than Muslims in four districts of Assam, 11 districts of Bihar, 22 of U.P. and three of West Bengal. Therefore, to stigmatise Muslims in terms of population growth and breeding more children is a figment of the right-wing imagination and not supported by facts. Preference for a male child The preceding discussion pointed out that the population control policy of imposing a two-child norm is not supported by data. However, it can have other unintended consequences. Generally, any discussion on fertility focuses on policy recommendations regarding increasing female education, which is no doubt important. However, a single-minded focus on this policy instrument ignores the issue of a preference for male children, which is dominant in the country. An earlier study of women’s fertility in Hindi heartland States showed that the proportion of graduate women who had two living daughters but still wanted another child was 23.7% in Bihar, 27.3% in U.P. and 28.3% in Rajasthan. This is nothing but an indicator of a preference for sons in a patriarchal and caste-dominated society. Given such a preference for male children, the two-child norm will only increase sex-selective abortions of girl children, and female infanticide, since couples will want to maintain both the two-child norm as proposed to be enacted by the government as well as their preference for sons. Problem of ageing The experience of China also shows that if the state imposes its decision on families’ fertility choices, such a decision is bound to fail. With the one-child policy, the proportion of the aged population is increasing in China. Fewer younger workers are available, which might result in a slowdown of economic growth. As a result, the government has been forced to relax the one-child policy and adopt a three-child policy. In India too, as per the population projection report, the proportion of people aged 60 years and above will increase from 13.8% in 2011 to 23.1% in 2036. The two-child norm will only further aggravate the problem of ageing. The lesson to be drawn is that the decision on children is best made by the family, which can be nudged towards making choices that ensure a stable population growth. As a famous demographer argued, the fertility behaviour of a couple is a “calculus of conscious choice”. India’s decades-old population policy has achieved replacement level fertility in the country without taking any coercive measures. Governments should have faith in these time-tested policies and respect the choices of people rather than impose warped and motivated ideas regarding demography on the people.

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Japanese education spells holistic development||Investment in education yields both private and social returns. Private returns, like wages, accrue to individuals. Social returns accrue to society. Textbook economics suggests that private returns rise with one’s level of education, but social returns peak at the elementary levels. For when educated people follow rules such as queuing, using washrooms, washing hands, protecting public property, etc. the collective returns from such actions generate a huge social value such as cleaner, healthier and disciplined societies. Education is everything that expands our capabilities — as individuals and as society. The novel coronavirus pandemic has given us an opportunity to re-evaluate how our schools should expand our capabilities. While academic prowess in math, science and language is essential, what about the issue of household chores? Or connecting with the community or nature? Does learning household chores expand one’s capabilities? For if people do not know how to keep their spaces clean, cook their own food, do their laundry, it just needs a shock like a COVID-19 pandemic to occur and for a society dependent on the labour of others to feel incredibly disrupted. Add to it shortages of essential supplies and overstretched public resources, and social disruption is inevitable. So, how can we prepare for the future? The answer: through our elementary schools. Can we learn from another country? Yes. Probably, Japan. In 2011, pictures from tsunami-hit Japan went viral, with locals patiently queuing up for rations amidst massive devastation. Throughout the novel coronavirus pandemic, schools and public spaces have remained fairly open in Japan due to people’s responsible behaviour. As India prepares to re-open its schools along with the newly adopted New Education Policy, we can borrow some insights from the Japanese system. Non-cognitive elements Japan ranks among the top in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) which evaluates students on their prowess in core academic subjects. However, another important aspect of the Japanese curriculum is its emphasis on non-cognitive elements. Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) explains ‘Chi-Toku-Tai’ as the defining features of Japanese schooling. Chi, which translates to ‘know’ lay an emphasis on building strong academic abilities. Toku, translates to ‘virtue’ and refers to mindfulness, self-discipline, and cooperative abilities. And last, Tai, translates to ‘body, and refers to physical and mental well-being. The Japanese education philosophy transitioned from an extremely examination-focused, rote memorisation-based approach to the ‘Chi-Toku-Tai’ approach in the 1970s. The elementary school curriculum was later supplemented with subjects, namely moral education, integrated studies and special activities. Together, seen as a ‘zest for life’ approach, this philosophy focuses on holistic ability extending beyond academic prowess to include ‘kansei’ which roughly translates to ‘sensitivity’. This approach aims at developing a knowledgeable mind which can appreciate beauty and nature, hold a sense of justice, and respect life and labour. Shaping social behaviour Moral education includes norms that define socially responsible and considerate behaviour towards everyone including nature. For example, as a summer project, students venture out in nature observing beetles, cicadas, crickets and sketching or noting their characteristics in their ‘insect diary’. Students as young as first graders take turns to clean their classrooms, washrooms, serve school lunches, and water the plants at school. When students cross a pedestrian crossing while making a driver wait, they bow in a ‘thank you’ to express gratitude. While these are some examples, the essence is that elementary school curriculum can play a tremendous role in building courteous and mindful societies. Such a system reaps several benefits. As students do various chores, it builds respect for labour and humility at a young age. It trains them to undertake routine jobs in an efficient manner and encourages responsible and mindful behaviour towards the community. Think of how the Japanese fans celebrated their victory in the 2018 football World Cup opening match against Colombia — by cleaning up their rows in the stadium in Russia. Finding solutions Integrated studies encompasses experiential learning and independent thinking where students identify problems in their local communities and think of solutions. For example, children may create a disaster preparedness map based on their own research. Seniors from the community are invited to share insights about the community’s history. Activities such as these integrate schools with the community. If we can train our children in identifying problems in their local communities such as health ailments, pollution, waste disposal, etc. and coach them in developing solution road maps, the gains to both sides can be immense. The special activities hour encourages students to consider the school as a “society”. These include activities such as organising events, maintaining the library, etc. After task completion, students are made to reflect on the problems they experienced in the process such as wastage, conflict, etc. and the ways to resolve them. This inculcates the practise of ‘kaizen’ — the Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement. Finally, another notable aspect that defines Japanese society and education system is ‘collectivism’. Unlike the West, Japan is a collectivist society. Working as a group and group harmony is fundamental to this society. While this has its own limitations, the general belief that one wins only when the group wins, generates equitable and united societies. It’s about unity For us, volunteering for a treasure hunt activity involving third graders in Tokyo gave us an interesting insight into collectivism. Teams had to find the hidden treasure; however, the primary target was not the treasure but to keep the unit together. Teams could only move forward when all its members were together and agreed on the next strategy. So, if there were students on wheelchairs or slow otherwise, the group respectfully waited for them to arrive. Finally, the teachers had to pick one student per group to go to the stage to display the ‘treasure’ and receive the audience’s applause. Surprisingly, they picked the ones who were usually lagging. Every third grader felt included and valued. The real treasure had been found. Amazing, isn’t it?

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Spotlight on the triangle||The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened divisions within and among countries. Nationalism continues to stir India, with the re-election of Narendra Modi in 2019, and the U.S., despite the defeat of Donald Trump in 2020. The pandemic and the expansionism of China have led India and the U.S. to put their relationship in the spotlight, writes the author in a revised edition of Open Embrace: India-US Ties in a Divided World. An excerpt:  While the pandemic turned out to be yet another occasion for China to claim superiority of its economic and political model, it also exposed the weaknesses of the American political and economic system. COVID-19 triggered a fresh round of debate on liberalism. As for India, 2020 was a year of reckoning in its relations with China. In a first in 45 years, both sides lost soldiers in a border clash. At least 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese died in Ladakh in June 2020 leading to massive mobilisation of forces by both sides. The Chinese factor The aftermath of the pandemic fuelled more nationalism in politics in many parts of the world, certainly in China, India and the U.S. Even in his defeat, Donald Trump so sharply put the spotlight on China as the key challenger of the U.S. in the 21st century that Joe Biden and the Democrats have agreed to broadly follow that line. The Chinese action of occupying disputed territories so damaged the bilateral relationship that it is now at its ‘most difficult phase’ in the last 34 years, according to S. Jaishankar, India’s External Affairs Minister. The Chinese action remained inexplicable. China gave India ‘five differing explanations’ and ‘literally brought tens of thousands of soldiers in full military preparation mode right to the LAC in Ladakh’. Ashley Tellis has linked the Chinese action to India’s decision in August 2019 to carve out Ladakh as a federally administered territory, along with the ending of the special constitutional status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. In the last seven decades of America’s strategy in South Asia, there has been one constant, and that is Pakistan and its military — as a partner in propping up jihadis, then fighting them and now being found out as playing both sides. Also noteworthy is the fact that the U.S.’s entanglement with Pakistan and China is inseparable from one another. Pakistan had aided U.S.-China ties in the 1970s; and today, Pakistan does not fight shy of its loyalty and admiration for China. In January 2021, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said the Chinese model of development was something that his country would want to emulate. ‘I think Pakistan is going to help us out to extricate ourselves (from Afghanistan),’ Trump said in July 2019. In January 2018, he had said, ‘They have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.’ Trump’s contradictory, strident remarks are unusual for a president, but these are instructive. General Lloyd Austin, appointed Defense Secretary by Biden, said during his confirmation hearing that Pakistan had taken ‘constructive steps’ in the Afghanistan peace process. For all the strategic clarity that the U.S. is supposed to possess, it cannot decide for sure whether Pakistan is an ally or an enemy. Much in the same manner as ties with China, the U.S. relationship with Pakistan remains an unsettled question. Pakistan’s constant refrain has been that the route to ‘peace in Afghanistan is through Kashmir’, the argument being that unless America forces India to make concessions in Kashmir, no progress was possible in Afghanistan — making both Kashmir and Afghanistan part of the same continuum of transnational Islamist politics. American presidents until Barack Obama were sympathetic to this position, though nobody stated it in obvious terms. India’s resistance to the American view of seeing Kashmir and Afghanistan as components of the same puzzle predates Modi’s Hindutva doctrine. While opposing any link between Kashmir and Afghanistan, the Prime Ministers before Modi were willing to separately engage with Kashmiri separatists and Pakistan on the issue. Since 2014, the country’s position has become more strident and combative. The BJP and the PDP had a common minimum programme that left negotiations with the separatists solely with the PDP and in Srinagar, and the Central government showed little interest in addressing insurgency in the State other than by military force. In late 2017, the Modi government appointed Dineshwar Sharma as interlocutor for Kashmir, whose failure was foretold. In June 2018, the BJP ended its alliance with the PDP, and in August 2019, the special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir was rescinded. While Pakistan has been pleading with America to be more interventionist in Kashmir, India has resisted all such moves.

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Oxygen for fiscal federalism||James Madison, who created the basic framework for the U.S. Constitution, once said, “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.” But Indian federalism is very different. The British lawyer and academic, Sir Ivor Jennings, was of the view that India has a federation with a strong centralising policy. Nonetheless, India maintained its limited federal characteristics for a fairly long time. Those characteristics are now disappearing in the Modi era. Disregarding an obligation At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law assured States a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to July 1, 2020). But the Union government has deviated from the statutory promise and has been insisting that States avail themselves of loans. Kerala is entitled to a GST compensation of Rs. 4,041 crore for the financial year 2020-21. But the Union government has been disregarding this obligation. The future interest liability of these loans should not be placed on the shoulders of the States. Moreover, the borrowing limit of States, as per the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, should not be built into these loans. This policy needs clarity. Last year, the Union government increased the borrowing ceiling of the States from 3% to 5% for FY 2020-21. But conditions are attached to 1.5% of the 2% of increased ceiling. It is the States which have to bear the burden of welfare and relief measures during the pandemic. Attaching conditions for expenditure out of the borrowed amount would clip the wings of the States and goes against the principle of cooperative federalism. The Fifteenth Finance Commission had recommended Rs. 2,412 crore as a sector-specific grant and Rs. 1,100 crore as a State-specific grant for Kerala. But the Union government has not taken any steps to release these amounts. The expenditure rules attached to the Disaster Management Fund are unviable. The rules could be amended to ease expenditure. The Corporate Social Responsibility Fund could be remitted to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. As per the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, compensation on account of the implementation of GST will be available for a period of five years. Compensation beyond five years requires a constitutional amendment. The GST Act says it is a law to provide for compensation to the States for the loss of revenue arising on account of the implementation of the GST for a period of five years or for such period as may be prescribed on the recommendation of the GST Council. Urgent measures The present compensation period will end in 2021-22. Beyond this period, it is going to be very difficult to convince the Union government to provide compensation as there is no constitutional obligation to do so to the States. This will create serious financial stress to the States, especially to those which require higher compensation. As per Section 4(f) of Article 279A, the Union government can consider introducing any special rate to raise additional resources during the pandemic (any natural calamity or disaster). Section 4(f) says: “The Goods and Services Tax Council shall make recommendations to the Union and the States on — Any special rate or rates for a specified period, to raise additional resources during any natural calamity or disaster”. Article 279A was inserted through the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act. Hence, a special rate could be levied for a specified period in order to raise additional resources to meet the challenges posed by COVID-19 with the approval of the GST Council. These are some urgent necessary measures that are to be taken for pumping oxygen to fiscal federalism in India.

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Virulence and variance||The IMF’s latest update to its World Economic Outlook spotlights the starkly widening variance in the global recovery from the economic strains caused by the pandemic. And the primary fault line precipitating the divergence of the world’s economies into two blocs — those that are normalising activities from the COVID-19-induced curbs and those that are still struggling — is vaccine access and the pace of vaccination coverage. Three months since its April forecast, the IMF projects the global economy to expand at an unchanged pace of 6% this year. But it sees the world’s advanced economies registering faster growth than forecast earlier, while emerging markets and developing economies are expected to post appreciably slower recoveries. The IMF projects Advanced Economies to grow by 5.6% in 2021, 0.5 percentage point quicker than forecast in April. Undergirding this anticipated acceleration, the U.S. economy is seen expanding by 7% — a 0.6 percentage point upgrade — on the back of an expansive vaccine roll-out that has helped enable substantial normalisation in activity, and expectations of additional fiscal support. Emerging market and developing economies on the other hand are seen expanding by 6.3%, 0.4 percentage point slower than projected in April. India is seen as the largest drag, with the Fund cutting its growth forecast for South Asia’s largest economy by 3 percentage points to 9.5%. Citing the impact of the ‘severe second wave’ and expected ‘slow recovery in confidence’ as a reason for its downgrade, the IMF has warned that “countries lagging in vaccination, such as India and Indonesia, would suffer the most among G20 economies” in the event of the emergence of a super-contagious virus variant. With just a little over 7% of the population fully vaccinated, India significantly lags the estimated global average of almost 14%, Brazil’s 18% and is way behind the 50% and 55% coverage achieved in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively. The Fund was effusive in its praise for India’s ‘decisive action’ in January, when it forecast 11.5% growth for the fiscal year ending in March 2022, before raising that projection to 12.5% in April, after the economy appeared to rebound well in the January-March quarter. That it has now downgraded its outlook so substantially reflects the extent to which the second wave has severely impaired momentum. With inflation looming as a visceral threat, demand yet to regain traction and political appetite in government for more fiscal support negligible, India’s policymakers have little option but to hasten the vaccine roll-out on a war footing. Failure to expedite the coverage could cost the country dearly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/virulence-and-variance/article35597928.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Probing Pegasus||The institution of a judicial probe by the West Bengal government into allegations of surveillance using advanced spyware on potential Indian targets marks a significant political and legal pushback against the Union government’s attempts to deny the global media revelations and diminish the potent threat such practices pose to democracy. Given Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s penchant for the dramatic and her endless run-ins with the Centre, it may be easy to dismiss the act of a State government ordering an inquiry into what could be a large-scale intelligence-gathering programme of a state actor as mere political chutzpah. However, in the context of the Centre and the ruling BJP’s aggressive refusal to cede any ground on the growing demand for a credible probe into the use and misuse of Pegasus spyware, the West Bengal inquiry acquires both legal and political salience. The Union government claims that illegal surveillance is not possible in India and has not specifically admitted or denied the use of Pegasus, the spyware supplied by Israel’s NSO Group. Ms. Banerjee has rightly invoked the possible grave implications for democracy, public order, the independence of the judiciary and the autonomy of legislators while ordering an inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act. Media reports suggest that those likely targeted included Prashant Kishor, the Trinamool Congress’s strategist during the recent Assembly polls, and Abhishek Banerjee, Ms. Banerjee’s nephew. Regardless of which agency or government was behind it, there are grounds to believe that part of the surveillance covered the State government’s territory, bringing into play its legitimate right to order an investigation. It is entirely a different matter that the two-member Commission, comprising Justice Madan B. Lokur, former judge of the Supreme Court, and Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, former Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, may face severe constraints. For one thing, only some of the potential targets may testify and seek the Commission’s aid in getting their phones forensically examined for evidence of infection by Pegasus. Central agencies may not readily offer their cooperation. The Intelligence Bureau may not be permitted to join the probe, and even if it did, it may claim privilege over documents and records relating to its legitimate interception orders, citing national security and operational sensitivity. In a country where there is no parliamentary oversight over its intelligence agencies, it is unclear how far these agencies and its personnel would cooperate with a probe ordered by a State government. There have been instances — the Jain and Verma Commissions come to mind — of intelligence files being made available to judicial panels. Therefore, it will be both desirable and appropriate if the Centre itself ordered a wide-ranging judicial inquiry into the Pegasus scandal so that the nation has an opportunity to get at the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/probing-pegasus/article35597929.ece

India had made its position very clear to the U.N.

Mr. Swaran Singh told the House that the U.N. Secretary-General had not suggested the convening of a meeting of the Secretary Council formally or informally to consider the Bangla Desh situation. He also denied that the Secretary-General had tried to equate India and Pakistan on the issue. “Any such equation is opposed to facts and we have rejected it totally,” he added. What was needed now, he said, was that attention should be diverted and concentrated in creating conditions in Bangla Desh which should stop the refugees from coming to India and enable those who were in India to go back in safety and security. He said the Government of India had also made its position very clear that any suggestion to post additional U.N. observers in India and Pakistan was “an entirely wrong approach to the problem.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/we-wont-fall-into-trap-swaran-singh/article35597937.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Deposits up to Rs. 5 lakh in ailing banks to be repaid in 90 days’||Depositors in ailing banks such as PMC Bank may get some relief soon, with the Cabinet on Wednesday clearing amendments to the deposit insurance law to return up to Rs. 5 lakh of savings within 90 days of the RBI’s imposition of a moratorium on a bank’s operations. “The Deposit Insurance Credit Guarantee Corporation Bill 2021 has been cleared by the Cabinet today,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a briefing on Wednesday, adding that the Bill would be tabled in Parliament in the ongoing session. “Accessing depositors money has been an issue of when it will be allowed and under what conditionalities. Normally, it takes about 8-10 years, after complete liquidation of the bank. Now, what we are saying is even if there’s a moratorium, this (90-day) measure will set in,” Ms. Sitharaman said. As per the proposed process, a bank under moratorium would have to collect all the account details and balances and share it with the Deposit Insurance Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) within 45 days. The DICGC would get another 45 days to check the details and process the claims. ‘Larger safety net’ “Each depositor’s balance of Rs. 5 lakh is guaranteed for both principal and interest,” the minister said, adding this would provide a significantly larger safety net for India’s bank customers. “With the deposit insurance increased from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh, it will cover 98.3% of all deposit accounts and 50.9% of all deposits’ value. Just compare this with what prevails outside — only 80% of deposits are insured, with 20%-30% of deposit value globally,” she asserted. The premium paid by banks to the DICGC would also be raised, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/deposits-up-to-rs-5-lakh-in-ailing-banks-to-be-repaid-in-90-days/article35597911.ece
29 July 2021||MUMBAI,||Tyagi laments lack of disclosures by listed firms||Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairman Ajay Tyagi stressed that companies must ensure disclosure of material events as per regulations ‘not just in letter but also in spirit.’ “Listed companies must have two sets of disclosures: firstly, periodic disclosures where formats have been prescribed and secondly, disclosures of material events,” he said, speaking at a FICCI event. “On both these aspects disclosures by many companies are lacking. On periodic disclosures such as annual reports, while all the fields are being filled in, in many cases, they appear more like a check-box exercise. This is not acceptable,” he added. He also said many new- age firms were posting rapid growth, leading them to opt for an IPO at an early stage. “While many of the IPOs years back used to be for project financing, we rarely now see IPOs being used specifically to finance projects. In terms of value, the proportion of IPOs being used to give exit to existing investors is higher than the proportion being used for raising funds,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tyagi-laments-lack-of-disclosures-by-listed-firms/article35597906.ece
29 July 2021||CHENNAI,||Sundaram Home Fin plans to raise Rs. 2,500 cr.||Sundaram Home Finance Ltd. plans to raise Rs. 2,500 crore via debt and from banks this year for funding its growth plans. The home finance subsidiary of Sundaram Finance Ltd. reported an 18% increase in net profit for Q1 FY22 at Rs. 40 crore. It disbursed Rs. 249.27 crore against Rs. 99.98 crore in the year-earlier period, it said. “The second wave of COVID led to uncertainty during the quarter, but relaxation of lockdown in most States in June led to a partial bounce back in demand in the real estate space towards the end of Q1,” said managing director Lakshminarayanan Duraiswamy. “The disbursements in Q1 were driven by mid-market segments, especially the salaried class, in tier 2 and 3 towns,” he added. “While the longer term outlook remains strong with the demand for housing expected to grow in the coming years, we are cautiously optimistic on the growth prospects for the rest of the year and believe that the worst is behind us,” remarked Mr. Duraiswamy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sundaram-home-fin-plans-to-raise-rs-2500-cr/article35597908.ece
29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maruti Suzuki posts Q1 net profit of Rs. 440.8 crore||India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki on Wednesday said it registered a net profit of Rs. 440.8 crore for the first quarter ended June, impacted by lower sales volumes. The firm said while all parameters during the quarter under review were substantially better than April-June 2020, a comparison was not meaningful because there was a much higher degree of disruption on account of the pandemic during the first quarter of the last fiscal.  Maruti had posted a loss of Rs. 249.4 crore in Q1 FY21, the firms’ first quarterly loss since its listing in July 2003. First-quarter net sales stood at Rs. 16,798.7 crore (Rs. 3,677.5 crore). “The second wave of the pandemic adversely impacted Q1 production and sales,” the company said. “The profit for Q1 FY2021-22 was primarily impacted by lower sales volumes. Commodity prices increased steeply but the company continued to make efforts to reduce costs,” it added. The carmaker noted that sales during the first quarter of FY22 remained ‘far below’ the previous high in April-June 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/maruti-suzuki-posts-q1-net-profit-of-rs-4408-crore/article35597917.ece

There is a wide variation between auction and retail prices, said Prashant Bhansali, president, UPASI. The Tea Board says its order will make the auction system robust and bring stability to prices. But, tea auctions in India have a finite load-handling capacity as is evident from the recent steep fall in prices, Mr. Bhansali added. UPASI said the mode of sale should be left to the choice of the producers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/upasi-chafes-at-mandatory-tea-auctions/article35597909.ece

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Sindhu storms into elimination round||World champion P.V. Sindhu produced another fine performance to beat Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi 21-9, 21-16 and enter the elimination round of the Olympic Games on Wednesday. The 39-minute victory saw Sindhu top Group ‘J’ and set up a meeting with World No. 12 Denmark’s Mia Blichfeldt, winner of Group ‘I’, on Thursday. The seventh-ranked Sindhu enjoys a 4-1 advantage over Mia, but it is 1-1 this year, with the Indian winning the last encounter. Taking control Sindhu took on Cheung, ranked 34th, for the first time since posting a fifth consecutive win over her in 2017. Realising that the challenges are going to get progressively tougher, the Indian settled down quickly and took control of the first game. With deft cross-court placements and the occasional smashes, Sindhu kept the 28-year-old Hong Kong player guessing. That Sindhu led 10-3 and 15-8 aptly reflected her domination. She dropped just one more point before racing away with the next six to close out the game. In the second, Sindhu, quite surprisingly, opted not to toss the shuttle deep into the court. Instead, she was happy to make Cheung move on both flanks, close to the net. Any loose response was met with a firm smash. It was to Cheung’s credit that she caught Sindhu on the forehand court with well-placed smashes. This also helped her stay in step with Sindhu during the first half of the game and she even led 11-10 at the mid-game break. From 14-14, Sindhu raised the bar, reeling off six straight points and move within a point of victory. Cheung saved two match-points before Sindhu sealed the contest with a powerful smash from close to the net. Sai Praneeth loses Later in the day, B. Sai Praneeth lost 14-21, 14-21 to Dutchman Mark Caljouw in an inconsequential Group D contest. The result helped Caljouw, a semifinalist at this year’s All England championship, make it to the knockout phase at the expense of Israel’s Misha Zilberman, the Russia-born shuttler who had handed out a stunning 2-0 defeat to the Indian. In a major upset, men’s World No. 1 Kento Momota crashed out, losing to South Korea’s Heo Kwang-hee 15-21, 19-21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-storms-into-elimination-round/article35598026.ece
29 July 2021||TOKYO,||Milak underlines his class in 200m butterfly||Hungarian Kristof Milak powered to the men’s 200m butterfly gold medal, despite sporting torn trunks which he claimed cost him a world record, at the Olympic Games here on Thursday. Milak, who crushed Michael Phelps’ world record in 2019, hit the wall in a new Olympic record of 1:51.25. “They split 10 minutes before I entered the pool and in that moment I knew the world record was gone,” he told reporters after the race, angrily throwing the torn togs at a table. “I lost my focus and knew I couldn’t do it.” Dressel pulls out The chances of US superstar Caeleb Dressel winning a much-touted seven gold medals in Tokyo vanished when he opted out of the 4x200m relay squad that finished fourth behind winner Great Britain. Led off by Tom Dean and brought home by Duncan Scott, Great Britain touched in 6:58.58sec, just outside the 6:58.55 world record held by the United States. In the women’s events, an electric Ariarne Titmus dethroned Katie Ledecky to become the 200m freestyle champion, only for the gutsy American great to bounce back and clinch the first-ever women’s Olympic 1500m freestyle title. Australian Titmus now has two golds, both at Ledecky’s expense after upsetting her arch-rival to win the 400m free on Monday.  Titmus powered through the field from third at 150m to touch in a new Olympic record time of 1min 53.50sec, with a sluggish Ledecky fifth. “Bloody exhausted, that was tough one,” said Titmus. “Honestly, it’s not the time that I thought I could do this morning but it’s the Olympics and there’s a lot of other things going on. So it’s just about winning here and I’m very happy.” Despite the crushing loss of two titles, Ledecky was back in the pool barely 75 minutes later for a brutal 1500m, one of three new swim events on the programme this year. The world record-holder is dominant in the event and didn’t disappoint, producing a commanding swim to claim gold in 15:37.34. “It means a lot. I think people maybe feel bad for me because I’m not winning everything and whatever but I want people to be more concerned about other things in the world, people who are truly suffering.” Japan’s Yui Ohashi, produced a strong freestyle leg to touch in 2:08.52 and take the 200m individual medley title, making it a Tokyo double after her earlier triumph in the 400m medley.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/milak-underlines-his-class-in-200m-butterfly/article35598228.ece
29 July 2021||Mumbai,||Badminton great Natekar passes away||Nandu Natekar, one of the superstars in Indian badminton history, passed away in Pune due to prolonged illness. He was 88. “With deepest sorrow, we would like to inform you that our beloved father Nandu Natekar passed away on July 28,” said a joint statement by his family. “Keeping in mind the COVID-19 guidelines, we will not be having a condolence meeting. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers.” Natekar is survived by son Gaurav, a former international tennis player, and daughters Sangeeta Welinkar and Nishigandha Mathur. In the 1950s and 1960s, Natekar was a household name all over India, thanks to his exploits on the court across the globe. The first Indian shuttler to win a tournament overseas — the Selangor International crown in Kuala Lumpur in 1956, Natekar was among the first batch of the Arjuna Award recipients in 1961 when the awards were introduced. His international achievements included making it to the All England Championship quarterfinals in 1954 and representing India in the Commonwealth Games in Jamaica in 1966. Spellbinding Moreover, in an era when domestic sports circuit would see spectator galleries overflowing, Natekar was a crowd-puller. He bagged six singles, six doubles and five mixed doubles National titles during his glorious career. His footwork was often compared to that of a ballet dancer while his deceptive wrist-work left his opponents and connoisseurs spellbound. Interestingly, it was another racquet sport — tennis — that was his first love. He excelled in tennis as much as badminton, losing to the legendary Ramanathan Krishnan in the 1951 National junior championship final. After dominating the indoor courts for a decade and half, he resumed his love affair with tennis, being a regular on the veterans’ tennis circuit for many years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/badminton-great-natekar-passes-away/article35597920.ece
29 July 2021||COLOMBO,||Bowlers, Dhananjaya help Sri Lanka take series to the decider||A depleted Indian team, hit by COVID-19, struggled for momentum against the Sri Lankan spinners on a sluggish track and managed just 132 for five in the second T20I here on Wednesday. Debutant Devdutt Padikkal, in his brief innings, provided glimpses of a bright future. 42 dot balls The degree of difficulty could be gauged by the fact that only seven boundaries and a six were hit in 20 overs and there were as many as 42 dot balls in the visitors’ innings. Looking at the pitch, India wouldn’t be too unhappy with the score. Skipper Shikhar Dhawan (40, 42b, 5x4), aware of the lack of experience in the batting line-up, batted cautiously on a track where the ball did not come on to the bat. With heavy rain slowing down the outfield, run-making became an ordeal, but the young Padikkal (29, 23b, 1x4, 1x6) was elegant as usual before indiscretion did him in. The other highly anticipated debut of Ruturaj Gaikwad (21, 18b, 1x4) ended in a whimper when Sri Lankan captain Dasun Shanaka’s short ball climbed on to Ruturaj and he got himself in a tangle while playing a pull shot. The ball spooned straight up for wicketkeeper Minod Bhanuka to complete the formalities. Knowing that only five batsmen had reported for duty, Dhawan had to cut down on risky shots even though a cover drive, an on-drive and a slog-pull behind square embellished his innings before off-spinner Akila Dananjaya de Silva (two for 29) nailed him while he went for a slog-sweep. But the batsman who impressed the most was Padikkal, who slog-swept Dhanajaya for a six, ran well between the wickets during his 32-run stand with skipper Dhawan and a brief assocation with Sanju Samson. Padikkal also reverse-swept Wanindu Hasaranga (one for 30) for a boundary before a slog-sweep brought about his downfall. During his innings, the Bengaluru boy showed that he has the temperament required for the highest level. The player who once again blew away an opportunity was Sanju Samson (7, 13b). He was hoodwinked by a leg-break from Akila and was bowled. Samson has failed to utilise the chances that have come his way in T20Is.   Sri Lanka 99 for five  Sri Lanka was 99 for five in 16 overs with Dhananjaya (22) and Ramesh Mendis (1) batting||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhawan-and-padikkal-chip-in-with-useful-contributions-as-india-makes-132/article35598021.ece
29 July 2021||TOKYO,||Indian women suffer third loss||The Indian women’s hockey team slumped to its third successive defeat, losing 1-4 to defending champion Great Britain in their Pool A game, on Wednesday. India needed at least a point to boost its chances of progressing to the quarterfinals, but the reverse means that it is now all or nothing for Sjoerd Marijne’s team. It has to win the remaining matches against Ireland and South Africa and can finish fourth if Ireland doesn’t beat Great Britain in the final group game. The top four from each group advance to the last-eight stage. Great Britain got off to a dream start as Hannah Martin scored just 73 seconds into the game. The early setback served as a rude jolt for the Indians. With a watertight defence, Great Britain offered the Indians no room. Playing an aggressive high press, they choked Rani Rampal’s side for space and shut out chances in the penalty circle. Martin struck again in the 19th minute, warding off a challenge from a defender before twisting and squeezing her shot home. The Indians responded sharply four minutes later when Gurjit Kaur’s drag-flick off a penalty corner was turned in by Sharmila Devi.  Marijne’s pep-talk during the break seemed to have made an impression as the Indians seized control in the opening minutes of the third quarter. They won three successive penalty corners but couldn’t find a way through to goal. Instead, it was Lily Owsley who restored Great Britain’s two-goal cushion in the 41st minute, scooping the ball past Savita Punia. Grace Balsdon converted a penalty stroke, three minutes from time, to complete the rout. The Indians face Ireland on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-suffer-third-loss/article35598181.ece
29 July 2021||Chennai,||Jagadeesan, Harish and Sasidev do it for Super Gillies||TNPL has this knack of throwing up unexpected heroes. For these fresh-faced cricketers, the competition is the launching pad. S. Harish Kumar, after scalping two with his medium-pace, delivered the big blows — he smashed a whirlwind 14-ball unbeaten 27 — when it mattered most in a high pressure situation. His effort powered Chepauk Super Gillies, chasing 143, to a four-wicket win in this pulsating TNPL game at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday. Engrossing duel There were several twists in this engrossing duel. N. Jagadeesan (52 off 40), after slog-sweeping leg-spinner Murugan Ashwin for a six, was picked up at point. Super Gillies were 103 for five and it was still anybody’s game. Jagadeesan had struck the ball with tremendous force and his was a big wicket. The match swung again after Harish walked in. He put away a short ball from Vijay Shakar for a six. And he launched into slinger Periasamy with a huge blow over mid-wicket. Then, there was more drama. Vijay Shankar castled the fighting U. Sasidev (42). The left-handed Sasidev was fluent, pierced and cleared the field. But then, Harish kept finding the boundaries to seal the duel. Horror start Super Gillies had a horror start. Skipper Kaushik Gandhi was done in by Ganesh Moorthi’s change of pace. And Periasamy struck twice in his first over, consuming S. Sujay with a slower one and trapping S. Radhakrishnan leg-before with a pacey off-cutter. Super Gillies were tottering at 26 four in the seventh over. This was the day Super Gillies found the right answers. At the end of it all, Harish was the toast. Earlier, after Super Gillies elected to field, Sonu Yadav found rhythm, generated some pace and found some movement in the back end of the innings. During his influential three for 21, he broke the fourth-wicket partnership of 56 between Vijay Shankar (32) and Spartans skipper Daryl Ferrario (39). Ferrario inside-edged a Sonu delivery that cramped him for room from seamer Harish for 39. Stung by these reverses, Spartans finished at just 142 for seven. At the start, K.H. Gopinath sparkled with a 24-ball 33 with some lovely off-side strokes.  The scores: Salem Spartans 142 for seven in 20 overs (K.H. Gopinath 33, Vijay Shankar 32, Daryl Ferrario 39, Sonu Yadav three for 21, S. Harish Kumar two for 39) lost to Chepauk Super Gillies 145 for six in 18.5 overs (N. Jagadeesan 52, U. Sasidev 42, S. Harish Kumar 27 n.o., G. Periasamy two for 28, Murugan Ashwin two for 26).   Tuesday’s match: Ruby Trichy Warriors 145/5 in 20 overs (Nidhish Rajagopal 45, Muhammed Adnan Khan 26, Gurjapneet Singh 2/24) lost to Dindigul Dragons 149/5 in 19.2 overs (R.S. Mokit Hariharan 41 n.o., C. Hari Nishaanth 38, M. Poiyamozhi 2/24, Rahil Shah 2/25).   Kovai Kings beat Madurai Panthers In the second match of the day, Lyca Kovai Kings (172/5) defeated Siechem Madurai Panthers (153/8). Sai Sudharsan (61) and Shahrukh Khan (58 n.o.) shone with the bat for the winner||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jagadeesan-harish-and-sasidev-do-it-for-super-gillies/article35598428.ece
29 July 2021||Chennai,||Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh call the shots for Kovai Kings||The surfaces at Chepauk had bounce, carry and movement in this edition’s earlier TNPL games. But then, with so many matches being played, the pitches are beginning to become slower and a tad double-paced in nature. The challenges, thus, before the cricketers are like a revolving door — they keep changing. It meant the in-form Sai Sudharsan, who had struck the ball like a dream in the earlier matches, had to apply himself for a 52-ball 61 for Lyca Kovai Kings against Siechem Madurai Panthers at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday. In the end, Lyca, holding its nerve defending 172, was home by 19 runs. The decisive innings of the match came from Lyca skipper Shahrukh Khan (58 not out off 30). Overcoming the challenges posed by the surface, he struck the ball with brutal force to power Lyca to 172 for five. Abhishek Tanwar’s 22 from 10 and then tidy seam bowling underlined his value. N.S. Chaturved, with his cuts and punches, was the key man on the chase for the Madurai side. Eventually Ajith took out Chaturved (39 off 26) on the sweep. The versatile Kousik, (29 off 15), struck the ball ferociously but was brilliantly held by Ashwin Venkataraman at deep cover off Tanwar. This ended Madurai’s challenge. Big blows In the day’s earlier contest S. Harish Kumar, after scalping two with his medium-pace, delivered the big blows — he smashed a whirlwind 14-ball unbeaten 27 — in a high pressure situation. His effort powered Chepauk Super Gillies, chasing 143, to a four-wicket win over Salem Spartans. Heavy-hitter N. Jagadeesan (52 off 40) and the fleet-footed southpaw, U. Sasidev (42 off 30), both finding the gaps and clearing the field, kept Super Gillies in the hunt The two batsmen fell as tension mounted but Harish got the job done. He put away a short ball from Vijay Shakar for a six. And he launched into slinger Periasamy with a huge blow over mid-wicket. Horror start Earlier, Super Gillies was dramatically reduced to 26 for four in a horror start. Periyasamy fired out S. Sujay and S. Radhakrishnan, left-arm spinner Ganesh Moorthi took out Kaushik Gandhi with a change in trajectory and M. Ashwin had R. Sathish taken at slip. In the first half of the match, Sonu Yadav found rhythm, generated lively pace and found some movement after Super Gillies elected to field. During his influential three for 21, he broke the fourth-wicket stand of 56 between Vijay Shankar (32) and Spartans skipper Daryl Ferrario (39). At the start, K.H. Gopinath sparkled with a 24-ball 33 dotted with some lovely off-side strokes.  The scores:   Lyca Kovai Kings 172 for five in 20 overs (Sai Sudharsan 61, Shahrukh Khan 58 n.o., Abhishek Tanwar 22) bt Seichem Madurai Panthers 153 for eight in 20 overs (Arun Karthik 21, N.S. Chaturved 39, J. Kousik 29, Tanwar two for 43, Ajith Ram three for 24, R. Diwakar three for 18).   Salem Spartans 142 for seven in 20 overs (K.H. Gopinath 33, Vijay Shankar 32, Daryl Ferrario 39, Sonu Yadav three for 21, S. Harish Kumar two for 39) lost to Chepauk Super Gillies 145 for six in 18.5 overs (N. Jagadeesan 52, U. Sasidev 42, S. Harish Kumar 27 n.o., G. Periyasamy two for 28, M. Ashwin two for 26).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sai-sudharsan-and-shahrukh-khan-call-the-shots-for-kovai-kings/article35598294.ece
29 July 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||The way forward for Kerala sport||With not a single Kerala woman in the Indian team at the Tokyo Olympics, the Kerala Sports Conclave, organised by Sportstar here on Wednesday, offered a wonderful opportunity to discuss the issue. “This is a time when we need to reflect on what happened to Kerala sports,” said V. Abdurahiman, Kerala Sports Minister. “We need to bring back the time when we had stars like P.T. Usha, Shiny Abraham and M.D. Valsamma.” Kerala is working on a new sports policy and a unique Sports Kerala Limited (SKL), a PSU exclusively for sport, which the Sports Minister hopes will be a game-changer. “We believe that Sports Kerala Ltd. will bring about massive changes on how stadiums are utilised. The government also plans to conduct tournaments jointly with sports associations,” said Abdurahiman. This answered football greats I.M. Vijayan and Jo Paul Ancheri’s worry that the lack of tournaments was stopping talent from coming to the fore and the institutional football teams had virtually nothing to play for despite year-round training. “This is only the beginning,” said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a statement, about the changes coming in. “With proper training and facilities, outstanding athletes will emerge from here.” Usha spoke about the need to find out why athletes achieve qualification standards but were unable to repeat it at major events like the Olympics and Worlds. “We also need guidance from sports science experts on how to handle injury rehab, and how to strengthen the athletes after injury,” she said. International shooter Elizabeth Susan Koshy was keen that the shooting range in Thiruvananthapuram be converted into a full-fledged academy with the right people managing things. “We have a world-class range but there are a lot of formalities when one wants to use it. We should also make the academy affordable since shooting is already an expensive sport. We need to have more centres too,” said Elizabeth, a multiple National champion. Sports stars Ambika Radhika, Mayookha Johny, P. Ramachandran, Jincy Philip, K.C. Lekha, C.K. Vineeth, Mercy Kuttan (also the Kerala Sports Council president) and sports administrators Geromic George (Director-Sports, Kerala), Jayesh George (BCCI joint secretary), Sreejith Nair (KCA secretary), G. Kishore (Director SAI-Kerala) and MLA M. Mukesh also spoke on the occasion. Ayon Sengupta, Editor, Sportstar , explained the theme of the Conclave and K.C. Vijaya Kumar, The Hindu 's Sports Editor, assured that a white paper would be presented to the Sports Minister on the way forward for Kerala sport. The event was anchored by A. Vinod, The Hindu ’s Kerala sports bureau chief. Jain University was the presenting sponsor, while the event, powered by SUT Pattom, had NECC and LIC as associate sponsors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-way-forward-for-kerala-sport/article35597925.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Clinical Deepika remains in contention; Tarundeep and Pravin crash out||Even as the windy conditions affected several archers, World No. 1 Deepika Kumari kept her focus to win two matches and reach the third round of the women’s individual event at the Tokyo Olympics on Wednesday. Tarundeep Rai and Pravin Jadhav, the two Indians in action in the men’s individual event, got past the first hurdle before bowing out in the second round. Deepika recorded a comprehensive 6-0 (26-23, 26-23, 27-24) victory over Bhutan’s Karma in the first round. The Indian mostly scored 8s and 9s, apart from a 10 in the final set, to cruise into the second round. The 27-year-old Deepika, competing in her third Olympics, used all her experience and skill to overcome the challenge of 18-year-old American Jeniffer Mucino-Fernandez 6-4 (25-26, 28-25, 27-25, 24-25, 26-25). Nailing 10s Deepika shot with precision to nail 10s on her last two shots of the second set and drew parity. Even as Mucino-Fernandez’s performance fluctuated, Deepika remained consistent and went up 4-2 by taking the third set. However, a 6 in the fourth set saw Mucino-Fernandez pull level at 4. In the decider, Deepika scored 9, 9 and 8. The American, who had two 8s, needed a 10 to force a shoot-off, but managed only 9 to lose the contest. Finding his rhythm Tarundeep, figuring in his third Olympics, found his rhythm late in the contest to pip Ukrainian Oleksii Hunbin 6-4 in the first round. He, however, lost the shoot-off to Israel’s Itay Shanny 6-5 in the next. With the scores tied at 5, the Indian shot a 9 while Shanny produced a 10. Pravin shocked World No. 2 Galsan Bazarzhapov of Russia 6-0 before losing 0-6 to World No. 1 Brady Ellison of the USA. He dealt only with 9s and 10s despite the tough weather conditions to tame the Russian in straight sets. Against Ellison, the World champion and Olympic medallist, the Indian lost the first two sets by a point before slipping in the third and bowing out of contention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/clinical-deepika-remains-in-contention-tarundeep-and-pravin-crash-out/article35598030.ece
29 July 2021||TOKYO,||Biles withdraws from all-around competition||Defending champion Simone Biles has withdrawn from the final of the Olympic individual all-around gymnastics competition due to ongoing concerns over her mental health, USA Gymnastics confirmed on Wednesday. Jade Carey will will replace Biles in the all-around final. The US federation said a decision on whether Biles would compete in individual event finals would be taken following daily evaluation. “Simone will continue to be evaluated daily to determine whether or not to participate in next week’s individual event finals,” USAG added. “We wholeheartedly support Simone’s decision and applaud her bravery in prioritising her well-being,” the statement said. “Her courage shows, yet again, why she is a role model for so many.” Biles’ decision to pull out of the all-around comes after her stunning withdrawal early in Tuesday’s team final in Tokyo. The 24-year-old superstar — one of the faces of the Olympics — abruptly scratched from the competition after one rotation citing mental health concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/biles-withdraws-from-all-around-competition/article35598225.ece

Pooja will take on Olympic bronze medallist and former World champion Li Qian of China in the last eight. Pooja is the second Indian boxer after Lovlina Borgohain to make the quarterfinals of the Games. The experienced boxer from Bhiwani (Haryana) used her right jabs and follow up left punches well to stay ahead of the Algerian, who delivered some well-directed shots on her opponent. The 30-year-old Pooja bobbed and weaved smartly to avoid Ichrak’s blows. She employed her right-left combinations, interspersed with double right-lefts, to get 5-0 verdicts in the first two rounds. The Algerian, 10 years younger than the Indian, went all out in the final round, but Pooja relied on her footwork and surprise left hooks to seal the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pooja-too-hot-for-ichrak/article35598028.ece

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Style and grace came naturally to Nandu’||Nandu came one generation before me. I’ve seen him play during the later stages of his career. He was one of the most stylish badminton players in the world, alongside Suresh Goel and Trilok Nath Seth. Pioneer In his era — 50s and 60s — the focus was on style and grace, not power. Style and grace came naturally to Nandu. Players of my generation viewed Nandu as a pioneer. He had the best results for an Indian badminton player before I came in. His career was constrained by the fact that he did not get many opportunities to play international tournaments. In those days, badminton was not a popular sport. Nandu competed in only one or two All-England Championships. Nandu made a big mark, despite having limited opportunities. In those days, players looked forward to taking on the world’s best in invitational tournaments held in Bombay and Jabalpur. Nandu defeated some world-class players in those tournaments. Off the court, he was a thorough gentleman. After his retirement, he held a senior position in a Public Sector Unit (PSU). He was one of the few badminton players who did really well in post-retirement life.  Nandu was equally good at tennis. He played against Ramanathan Krishnan and other top Indian players of the time. He also spent a lot of time playing golf after settling in Pune. I met Nandu around 10-15 years ago at a friend’s house. He was in his 70s, and had just started learning how to sing classical music. He even joined a singing class, and would travel everywhere with his ‘Shruti box’. He was always happy to sing; he never turned down a song request from us.

29 July 2021||Tokyo,||Djokovic rolls, Medvedev battles the heat||Novak Djokovic set up a quarterfinal with Japan's Kei Nishikori at the Tokyo Olympics on Wednesday as gold medal rival Daniil Medvedev struggled with the heat, even asking the chair umpire who would be responsible if he died. World No. 1 Djokovic continued his bid for a calendar Golden Slam by defeating 34th-ranked Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain 6-3, 6-1 to extend his winning run to 21 matches. Medvedev stayed on course to meet Djokovic in the men's final as the Russian second seed overcame Italy's Fabio Fognini 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. But he again found the temperatures testing as the extreme weather policy was implemented, with the heat index topping out at 37 degrees Celsius. Asked by the umpire if he was OK during the second set, the Russian replied: "I can finish the match, but I can die. If I die, are you going to be responsible?" "I think it was the most humid day we had so far, maybe the hottest," added Medvedev.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-rolls-medvedev-battles-the-heat/article35598230.ece

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Little Amal is crossing the sea||Little Amal is looking for her mother. The nine-year-old is a Syrian refugee from Aleppo, who will walk from the Syrian-Turkey border to the UK, in search of her displaced family. Along the way, each village, town and city she visits, will welcome her with a slew of events ranging from performances to art installations. Amal might be a three-and-a-half metre tall puppet, carefully created by the Handspring Puppet Company in Cape Town, South Africa, but her journey encompasses the real tales of numerous young refugees and countless children who get torn away from their homes and separated from their families, not just in Turkey and Europe, but all over the world.  The Walk , as this production is called, is a travelling festival of art and hope by UK-based Good Chance Theatre — presented by its producers, Stephen Daldry, David Lan and Tracey Seaward — in association with Handspring Puppet Company. Little Amal is based on a character from Good Chance’s first production The Jungle , a play about the Calais migrant camp. Theatre writer and director Amir Nizar Zuabi joined the project as artistic director in 2020, developing hundreds of international collaborations across the route. At three-and-a-half metres, Amal appears taller than your average nine-year-old. The Handspring Puppet Company developed and crafted the physical form of the protagonist over a two-year period of workshops and testing. “She is made from robust, lightweight material like moulded cane and carbon fibre, to achieve a puppet that can be operated for long periods of time in varying conditions, to withstand rain and heat,” says the team at Good Chance, sharing information over email and a video call from the UK. Interestingly, there are three puppet Amals, in case a spare is required. She will also have a team of puppeteers and technicians who will look after her as she walks. Amal’s epic journey began on July 27 at Gaziantep, where an outdoor light installation featuring qandeel lanterns lit up one after the other to highlight a path that she can follow. Pieces of a story The 8,000-kilometre route will end in Manchester, in November, with around 250 partners and artists. “The route is the culmination of migration routes which have been used during the refugee crises of recent years,” says David Lan. The West Asian and African routes have been connected by passing through Italy. Specific cities of welcome have been chosen either because there was a willing partner located there, or because of cultural institutions of historical significance in those cities. Manchester International Festival invited Little Amal to Manchester, where she will start the next chapter of her life. “The city is one of many towns and cities in the UK that is doing a lot to welcome refugees, with Greater Manchester having the highest concentration of dispersed asylum seekers in the UK outside of London,” adds the team at Good Chance. The planning stages of this magnum opus production involved a huge number of conversations with potential collaborators across the route; artists and arts organisations, grassroots humanitarian organisations and major NGOs, representatives from civil society, and early funders who believed in the idea from the start. “Most importantly, there were conversations with people young and old living all along the route — people who had been there all their lives as well as more recently arrived refugees and asylum seekers — to explore whether the idea of Little Amal’s journey was one that would be welcomed. The response was overwhelmingly positive in all locations across Europe and in Turkey and Lebanon,” say the organisers. “Stopover destinations have been offered a simple idea: A nine-year-old girl who is coming through your community. How will you welcome her?,” explains Amir Nizar Zuabi. For example, in the Turkish coastal town of Cesme, Amal will follow a path of empty shoes that leads her to the beach. Created by K2 Contemporary Art Centre, this art setup represents the thousands of people who have lost their lives while crossing the treacherous sea. In the Italian city of Bari, she will be welcomed by a comforting large puppet of an Italian nonna (grandmother) who shares wisdom on how to overcome the obstacles she may face on her way; in Paris, an installation of a refugee camp will be created outside the Institut du Monde Arabe, where Amal will explore the rows of tents, hoping to find her mother. Meanwhile, Amal’s birthday celebrations are being planned in London, where she will turn 10 on October 24. The day begins with a dawn chorus performance at the Royal Opera House followed by a party at the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the finale, Amal will reunite with her mother in Manchester.

30 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Priyanka Chopra||Priyanka Chopra added gol gappas. Nick Jonas championed gajar halwa . Chef Hari Nayak pulled it all together, in an edgy, New York-inspired modern Indian menu. Recently launched Sona in Manhattan is already packed with enthusiastic diners, despite the lingering shadow of the pandemic. Or perhaps because of it, as people embrace the exuberance of dining out again after a year of takeaway. In keeping with the celebratory mood, the restaurant offers bright, imaginative interpretations of Indian food, with Udipi-born and New York-trained Nayak at the helm. The butter chicken, however, is all Priyanka Chopra. When David Rabin and Maneesh Goyal decided to create a uniquely New York restaurant with an Indian soul, they joined hands with the actor, who came on board as a creative collaborator. “My cooking style is more innovative and global in approach. During tasting sessions, it was Priyanka who kept the menu grounded. She kept reminding me: ‘Don’t forget the classics’,” says Nayak, over a call from New York. “We have been working on this restaurant for three years, and she has been a part of Sona right from the beginning,” he says, adding that the actor’s husband, singer-songwriter Nick Jonas also participated in tasting sessions when he was in town. “He loves Indian food. He loves paneer, and gajar halwa is one of his favourite things to eat.” Chef Nayak adds with a laugh, “If it wasn’t for Priyanka, I would never have added gol gappas to the menu. We have a clientele that is almost 90% non-desi, and seat about 300 every night. We need to teach them how to eat it...” Sona’s version of the popular Indian street food features avocado and spiced tequila. “Everybody orders it before the meal now. That’s how they get the party started!” Deliberately defying categorisations, the food is inspired by Indian flavours but hinges on locally sourced ingredients. “I use cooking techniques that are modern, and food that is in season,” says Chef Nayak. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America in 1998, he worked with influential chef Daniel Boulud at his 3 Michelin starred restaurant, Daniel. In 2007, he collaborated with chef Vikas Khanna to write Modern Indian Cooking (Silverback Books). Then launched restaurants in Kuwait, Riyadh, Dubai and Bangkok. His Indian homecoming was with Alchemy, at the Chancery Pavilion in Bengaluru, in 2018. Discussing how tough the pandemic was on the hospitality industry, and its impact on restaurant openings this year, he explains that Sona was reshaped by 2020. “We planned to open in the summer last year. Then the pandemic began, and we had this fully built restaurant that we couldn’t run. We kind of gave up then. But the landlord was supportive enough for us to get through, and the partners were strong enough to be able to wait.”  When they could finally open, a few months ago, they realised the approach needed to be different, given the impact of COVID-19 on New York, and the world. “It was more luxurious, finer and refined before. We made it a little more approachable, a little more homey, a little more comfortable... we made it into the kind of restaurant where you would want to come again and again.” Despite a rush of openings — Chef Nayak estimates there were about 80 New York restaurant launches last month — Sona has been packed, and received a flurry of rave reviews. Unconventionally Indian The Indians do not always approve, though. “Some of the worst reviews I get are from Indians — I sometimes get scared when I see them,” says Chef Nayak, adding, “I would not dare to open a Sona in India.” He explains that the restaurant veers away from tradition. For instance, butter garlic crab is served with caviar here; their Gruyere cheese dosa has an edamame arbi mash; and the tandoor roasted beets are paired with chaat masala hazelnuts. “The stereotypical notion is that Indian food is all curry and spice, so I am purposely trying to change that perception,” he says. “For example, right now plums are in season: perfect, juicy plums from local farms. We reduce them with a little sugar, into a sticky, sweet syrup with a little tartness, then dip jalebis in them, staining them with that red, berry colour. Is it Indian? That depends on what you expect from a jalebi.” While the food is sophisticated, Chef Nayak veers away from showy techniques, preferring instead to highlight great ingredients. “I’ve realised that as I mature as a chef, my cooking becomes simpler,” he says, adding, “I believe in the basics: more so after that crazy last year we’ve had!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/priyanka-chopra/article35598180.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Searching for answers||Amidst all the Glorious Purpose that is Disney’s Loki , is the grinning Alligator Loki. Director Kate Herron, laughs saying, “I have always wondered about his story.” Speaking from London over a video call, she says, “It is a tightrope — give people enough evidence that he could be a Loki, but also enough that he could just be an alligator, that they put horns on. I have been so intrigued by who Alligator could be. Hopefully it will be answered in the future.” While Herron is not directing Season Two, she has said she is eager to watch the show as a fan. Insisting she is definitely willing to speculate on the direction the show would take Herron says, “I hope all my speculations are wrong. That has been the fun of Season One. People thought they were getting one story but got something very different.” With Loki telling Sylvie in episode 3, Lamentis, that he is into princes and princesses, he confirms his bisexuality and becomes MCU’s first queer character. “I felt it was important to acknowledge his bisexuality. It opens the door for more stories.” Loki and Sylvie, who is Lady Loki, share a kiss which has also led to a great deal of speculation. Is it self-love, next-level narcissism or Loki being in touch with his feminine self? “I always read it as self-love,” the Sex Education director comments. “They are not exactly the same being, because they are from different timelines. They are the same person but from different realities. For Sylvie, the kiss is goodbye. She does care about him, but she has to do the mission. For Loki, it is pure love.” Working with Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki and was also one of the executive producers, was incredible, Herron says. “The main thing that comes across is that Tom really cares. He has been playing this character for 10 years. Every day he came to set, you know he is bringing his A game. He is bringing all this passion and excitement, so it called the rest of us to match that.” Apart from Loki’s bisexuality, the Lamentis episode, is also one of the most visually arresting episodes with Loki and Sylvie forming a tentative bond even as the moon they are on is being annihilated. “I loved directing that. It was the first thing that my DP, Autumn Durald, and I worked on together, in terms of conceptualizing it from Bisha’s (K Ali) script. Bisha had this amazing description of the planet cracking and a whole city going silent. I wanted to honour that.” Lokiis presently streaming on Disney+ Hotstar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/searching-for-answers/article35598140.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Straight from the heart||They represent two of India’s most progressive voices. Actors who are not afraid to use their celebrity status to influence a socio-political change or speak out against the establishment. Along the way, Siddharth and Parvathy Thiruvothu have established themselves as two of the finest actors in the industry today. Predominantly working in the South over the years, a collaboration between the duo was always on the cards. It is a surprise that it has taken this long. However, a quick conversation with them as they act alongside in Netflix’s upcoming anthology Navarasa , reveals an assurance we see them together in a full-fledged feature in the near future. Directed by Rathindran R Prasad, Siddharth, also the producer of this segment, and Parvathy will be seen in Inmai , exploring the emotion of bhaya (fear). Excerpts from an interview: Before coming on board for the anthology, what were your impressions of each other and has it changed now?  Parvathy: My earliest memory of Siddharth was watching him in Boys along with my classmates, and completely falling for him during the ‘Ale Ale’ song. Then, of course, I got into the film industry and all my balloons about it being a big, beautiful paradise burst. I kept bumping into Siddharth at awards functions, and was really impressed by his performance, charm and the fact that he is so opinionated. Rang De Basanti happened in the meantime, and I fangirled over him more, and people kept telling me I should work with him. Earlier, I had an experience with a star, a really good actor as well, that did not pan out well. So when the opportunity to work on Navarasa with Siddharth came, I wondered if he would live upto my incredible expectations of him. But guess what...the man’s the real deal! He blew me away with his presence and he is a fantastic actor, conversationalist and now, a friend.  Siddharth: I had seen Parvathy’s great acting work earlier. I knew she is a feminist who speaks her mind, which is something I relate to a lot. As an actor, I enjoy the preparation and rehearsals that happen before shoot, and Parvathy was really involved with Rathindran and me in all these discussions. The amount of detail that has gone into the making of this half-hour film speaks a lot about us as professionals. I particularly love the way Parvathy is on a film set. It felt like working with a thespian; someone who knows the rhythm and process of making films, and someone who respects everyone on the set equally. Why did you pick fear as your rasa ?  Parvathy: I was both excited and nervous as I had never internalised fear for my characters. In my previous films, the arc of my characters follows a conflict-resolution. My understanding of fear, in fact, is a little different from what we normally perceive. I don’t think it is fully negative. I’m a huge fan of horror films — from mind-bending thrillers to the gory, bloody stuff. I believe Inmai belongs to the former, it will get deeper into the skin of the people and mess with them.  Siddarth: It is a psychological thriller piece, yes. When we picked the rasas , I actually told them I didn’t want shringara (love) or bhaya (fear), but I ended up doing the latter. These are the two most manipulative rasas . But I do believe that by the time you finish watching Inmai , you will understand why we picked this emotion, and why fear is the main thing that drives this film. Which other segment in Navarasa are you most excited about and why?  Parvathy: I am definitely intrigued by all of them, but I really want to see how bheebhalsa (disgust) has panned out and been represented in the anthology. I can’t get my mind around how that rasa can be saturated into a story and events.  Siddarth: Raudra (anger) is something I am rooting for, as it is Arvind Swami’s directorial debut, and he is a fantastic thinker both on and off the set. Not only is he a dear friend, but his film also has some spectacular technical talent. Siddharth, as someone who has worked with both Mani Ratnam and Jayendra, was this a reunion of sorts? I always say that Jayendra sir is my mentor and Mani Ratnam sir is my guru . When Navarasa came my way, I understood it would be a tough job for everyone, but it would be the toughest for me since it is very difficult to get compliments from both these gentlemen. It was a homecoming for me! I always count my achievements based on where I came from 20 years ago. So this is indeed a special project. Navarasa will stream on Netflix from August 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/straight-from-the-heart/article35598144.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The Kanjeevaram legacy||B Krishnamoorthy was 15 years old, and had just passed Class X, when he became an apprentice to his father, master Kanjeevaram silk sari weaver K Balaraman, in 1975. After learning the basics of the loom, he was sent to another senior weaver to learn the nuances of unique techniques such as ada katradhu (or jala ). A solid grounding in drawing helped him with graph drawing, important in the process of creating designs. “As a third generation weaver, my intention was to learn and understand every aspect involved in the Kanjeevaram weaving tradition. I enjoy each and every process of silk sari weaving because of this knowledge I gained along the way,” says Krishanmoorthy.  He adds that the greatest moment in his life was when his work was selected for a National Award in 2010. “I had woven a Kanjeevaram silk inspired by the odiyanam (ornamental hip belt), and designed it thematically. When I received Rs. 1 lakh cash along with the award, that set me thinking about my responsibility as a weaver.” Even while working as a pattern maker and graph designer, Krishnamoorthy continued to weave silk saris and catalogue the designs that his father and grandfather had created. Between conducting seminars for textile and design students, he decided to document the samples he had created or safely preserved and put them together into a reference library for anyone interested in handloom. “My initial investment towards this goal was the National Award money. With that, I purchased the yarn and other things required and began to weave. I ended up with 5,015 basic designs, woven in 25-metre silk fabric with 60 inches height. I have identified the names of just about 150 designs so far,” he says. His efforts led him to weave another catalogue of 114 supporting designs (used in the pallav and borders). These include forgotten traditional designs in 5.5-metre width, 48-inch height silk fabric. “Some of us weavers ourselves do not know the names of the designs we weave. In ancient times, handloom weavers went by the instructions given by the loom owners or buyers,” he says. Krishanmoorthy explains how ‘MS Subbulakshmi saris’ were common reference points a generation ago. He adds that Kanjeevaram silks had just 15 basic colour combinations then. Designs were mostly inspired by the temples in and around Kanchipuram. “Now, due to the increasing market, we have introduced newer colours as well as geometrical and floral designs,” he says. He is supported in this endeavour by his wife K Jayanthi, also a National awardee (for her silk sari inspired by Kanchi Ekambareswarar Temple in 2014). His team of artisans also includes includes his wife, father, cousins and staff. Together, they have created masterpieces in the Kanjeevaram silk weaving tradition for the repository. A fine example is his six-metre high Indian animal wall hanging, with a thilagam (tear drop) motif made in the mirror image technique, using Ahimsa silk with natural dye and pure gold zari. Over a period of 40 years, this master weaver has carefully collected many such samples and graph designs along the way. Students from the National Institute of Fashion Technology, the College of Fine Arts in Egmore, Indian Institute of Handloom Technology in Salem, Stella Maris College in Chennai and Anna University regularly visit his loom in Kanchipuram. One-stop guide  Havingcreated most of the repository, his next challenge is preserving and managing it. He says, “I have begun to upload some of my work onto my computer. I used the lockdown to streamline my documentation processes. I hope to create a one-stop reference guide, a kind of library, which I would like to publish in a book format.” He says that apart from designs and patterns, he has also created 200 different motifs, and the collection is growing by the day. “Whatever I have created and documented can be replicated by weavers across the country in silk and in cotton, not just the kanjeevaram. ”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-kanjeevaram-legacy/article35598162.ece

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Dancing Rose and the special moves||It is 16-odd mins into Sarpatta Parambarai that we see Dancing Rose for the first time. A man with a peculiar gait and a lone curl plastered on his forehead, he is unmissable. Many minutes later, he catapults into the boxing ring with multiple flips and cartwheels to face Kabilan (played by Arya) and we instantly know we are in for a treat. Dancing Rose, oozing with confidence, grooves through the ring, teases his opponent, breaks into a wave and steals the show. What ensues after is being hailed as the best fight sequence in the recently-released Amazon Prime sports drama directed by Pa Ranjith, as the hashtag #DancingRose trends on Twitter. Some even wanted a standalone movie on Dancing Rose. But who is this artiste? Chennai-based actor and theatre practitioner Shabeer Kallarakkal chuckles through the interview; he is still taking it all in. It has been overwhelming, he adds. Shabeer made his debut as the lead with Nerungi Vaa Muthamidathe (2014) and has since been seen in supporting characters in movies such as Adanga Maru , Petta and Teddy . He has also been active in theatre since 2009.  Shabeer never sat down, even once, while filming the much-talked about boxing sequence between Dancing Rose and Kabilan. He recalls, “All that you see in the ring was what happened that day during the shoot... it wasn’t rehearsed. Of course, the boxing skills were something I learned but the style wasn’t rehearsed. I knew I had to be Dancing Rose and it worked! Maybe now if I do it again, it might be a different version.” It is the character that essentially translated to his physicality, he adds. “This character is surging with confidence. He has never lost a bout, he is retired... he is in that space. And, when he comes back, it is to just chill,” laughs the actor, who has been learning kaaladi kuthu varasai, a mix of silambam , kickboxing and muay thai. Pa Ranjith was particular about each of the actors’ boxing styles, giving them a reference point. Arya’s Kabilan was modelled after Muhammad Ali and Vembuli (played by John Kokken) was an ode to Mike Tyson. Dancing Rose was inspired from UK-based boxer Naseem Hameed, known for his fluid movements that almost mimic a dance form. “I only took it as reference, watched some videos and got a gist of it, and formulated my own style,” says Shabeer, who also took tips from older boxers of North Madras who were part of the large ensemble cast. The movie was shot through the pandemic and in between lockdowns which meant Shabeer had to be in shape and character throughout. An avid fitness enthusiast and a personal trainer himself, he worked out at home and added boxing to his parkour and other martial arts practice. These fitness skills helped him layer his character. “I would take elements from these skills and use it to make the character true to what I perceived Dancing Rose to be,” he says. Shabeer’s experience in theatre, especially while working with Chennai’s The Little Theatre as an actor and a hospital clown (a professionally trained clown who performs for patients at hospitals), helped him keep the audience moving during the fight sequence. He tried to elicit a response from those present as spectators. “The director and the fight choreographers, AnbAriv (duo), were quite open to ideas in terms of adding my own quirks. It was also very beautiful to experience the ’70s North Madras. Subconsciously, it also helped me get into the character,” says the actor, who has a couple of films in the pipeline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dancing-rose-and-the-special-moves/article35598148.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Treasure beneath the fortress||How did the British hide the gleaming white dome of the majestic Taj Mahal during the Second World War? What makes the towering gopurams of the Madurai Meenakshi temple so iconic? And, why does the Golconda Fort remain one of the most magnificent fortress complexes in India? A digital game developed by Team Yukthi of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Chennai turns the spotlight on Indian monuments, as it showcases history and traditions. The game has earned the team of first year engineering students — R Amrita Laasya, A Bhavika Taneja, A R Giris Teja and Kadambari Sree Rama Aditya — along with a third year student S Palaniappan a slot among winners at the recently organised Toycathon 2021, an inter-ministerial initiative of the Government of India. The event, held virtually on Toy Cloud digital platform, saw the participation of over one lakh students in 17,000 teams. From the shortlisted 1,500 teams, 117 teams emerged winners. “It was exciting to develop a game,” says Palaniappan. “Though we learn about developing software, this game was a great learning experience. It was challenging to design the board.” The digital board game, designed on the react.js Java platform, is a treasure hunt set in India where players criss-cross monuments along a path that promises to lead them to treasure. As players roll the dice and plan moves, a yaksha appears, posing a question about each monument. Every right answer is a key that takes them closer to the treasure. Once the player takes the 30-second quiz on the monument, he/she is redirected to blogs on the topic. Players can also take in a 3D view of the monument complete with a virtual tour guide. Says Bhavika, “We could improve upon the game based on inputs from the faculty. The judges liked our board design. The 3D views of the monuments are my favourite.”  “Why should history be restricted to textbooks?” asks Amrita, adding, “A game is a great way to highlight unknown facts about monuments, be it architecture, designs or heritage.” While they dug up the history of 100 monuments, from the Ajanta-Ellora caves to Jantar Mantar, the game currently features information on 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/treasure-beneath-the-fortress/article35598153.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Clubbed together for comfort||A cough. A sniffle. A bit of Prateek Kuhad can be heard in the background, amid an ongoing conversation about the new season of Rick and Morty . This is the scene in an unlabelled Clubhouse Room for people currently fighting COVID-19 and seeking virtual comfort. A week after Priyanka Gantala* tested positive for Coronavirus in the third week of July, she felt her spirits dampen with umpteen incoming texts and calls enquiring about her symptoms, medication, her pain and other depressing topics. “While I understood my friends are worried, I wanted to interact for a bit with people who could bring in some lighthearted banter but also know what it is like to be emotionally isolated,” she says over the phone from her home in Mumbai. So Priyanka and a friend of hers in Bengaluru, who also tested positive, got on a call. They enjoyed it so much, it lasted for four hours. “We had a bet (laughs), if we mention the words ‘COVID’ or ‘Corona’ or something along those lines, we had to do a dare assigned by the other person. But it never came to that; we were just happy to talk about anything else,” says Priyanka. A couple of days later, she was browsing the app Clubhouse, and saw how sessions of meditation and ambient noises offered a lot of comfort to many unconnected strangers around the world. She wanted to do the same, at least at a smaller scale. So on Sunday, July 25, Priyanka kicked off a random room with no Club assigned to it and invited a few people she knew had tested positive recently. “It started with just four people,” she recalls, “I had a few former college-mates living in Italy, Canada and Australia join. We talked about pop culture, travel plans and our childhoods. One person, a budding musician in Cape Town, played us their mixtape. Another then suggested a sing-along and realised it was a bad idea, given all our voices were terrible (laughs) from being ill.” In two hours, the group had gained 50-odd more people who were also ill. “Some had colds, not even COVID. But the concept still applied,” she says. Remarkably, the group had a more powerful impact when nothing was said at all. Maybe there was a cough or two, in the Room of then-70 people, but the silence was a special, comforting balm. “Some silences lasted for two to three hours,” she says, “and we welcomed that.” Did Priyanka consider making this an active Club with permanent members? She responds, “I wanted this to be a random set of Rooms because people are wary of their Clubhouse data showing that they’re a member of a Room for COVID-positive people. Plus, when people see a COVID type of Club on the app, it is assumed medical advice will be given and we do not do that. You don’t need a calendar invite, just a link which would have been shared through WhatsApp or other private message means.” “I am definitely not the first to do this,” she insists, adding she has since seen — thanks to her evolved Clubhouse algorithm — a few other unlabelled Rooms. And when she dropped in, she realised they were similar to the one she created. This was hardly a surprise. She says, “The loneliness during this time wreaks havoc on mental health. Sometimes, a stranger on the Internet can actually solve your problem!”  *name changed to protect identity||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/clubbed-together-for-comfort/article35598163.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A voice for the voiceless||The Tails of Boo-Boo & Cuddly Poo, a documentary on community cats and dogs, is laced with humour, style, colour and loads of the ‘aww’ factor. Shot by filmmaker Salil Jason Fernandez — who has worked on Khauff (2015) and The Mole (2008) — and Vandana Sethhi, founder of Water Communications and Earth Films, the film features actors Shraddha Kapoor, Jim Sarbh, Amrita Puri and Samir Kochhar, VJ Maria Goretti, musician Anushka Manchanda, musician-actor Shibani Dandekar, comedians Cyrus Broacha and Atul Khatri, hairstylist Sapna Bhavnani, author Shaheen Bhatt, and influencer Scherezade Shroff. They come together to give the world a message: ‘adopt, not shop’. Through the film, the makers want to show the plight of community animals with a focus on cruelty, abandonment, rescue and love. Salil Jason says it is a documentary that deals with animal cruelty. He explains, “We have made sure to make it appealing...I wanted to make a documentary that is stylish without losing the real essence for which the movie was conceptualised.” Shot entirely during the lockdown, the documentary involved 30 organisations including World For All (WFA), In Defense of Animals (IDA), Youth Organisation in Defense of Animals (YODA), Welfare of Stray Dogs (WSD), Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) and Thane Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (TSPCA). Actor Jim Sarbh says, “My life changed when Mimi walked into it; she’s been my reason for sanity during the lockdown. I think everyone should adopt an animal, give them love and a home, for the love you get back is manifold.” Having worked for many years with rescue organisations Salil says,“We would like to think ours is a first-of-its-kind documentary narrative with a unique approach that blends non-fiction with elements of fiction. The universal message of the documentary is about embracing these dogs and cats.” A collaborative message The documentary is currently travelling the international film festival circuit and is likely to appeal to millennials. “Millennials are different. Their thought process is influenced in a positive way with a lot of good content they get to see on social media. It is not always about taking a stray animal home. If that is not possible, feed them, educate the society about tolerance and sterilisation,” says Vandana Sethhi. Says Shraddha Kapoor, “I loved being part of the documentary and hope this brings awareness to the plight of community animals, especially since the monsoons are ongoing. Shylo is such an integral part of my life and I can’t imagine my life without him. I would want everyone to have that happiness.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-voice-for-the-voiceless/article35598151.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Rajasthani puppets learn Mozart||Young vocalist Maya Bajaj wants to show that kathputhli s (traditional Indian puppets) can be brought out of the boundaries of their art form and do justice to Western opera. Currently pursuing diploma studies in Chennai’s KM Music Conservatory, she is preparing for the online release of A Timeless Tale of the Turbulent Twosome , as part of her final year portfolio project. “Rajasthani puppets will act in a contemporary story, set to compositions by Mozart and Puccini. It brings ancient art forms from across the world on a shared stage,” says Maya. Besides being the voice artist for its lead characters Meena and Suman, Maya is the soprano for the 30-minute show, while Shashwat Vishwakarma is the baritone. Based in Delhi since the lockdowns began, she started Project Kalpana to support traditional puppeteers of city’s Kathputhli Colony via the Kayakalp Trust. Adds Ria Golecha, director of Kayakalp, “We wanted Indian puppetry to become more relevant and also help the artists of Kathputhli Colony (now relocated to a transit camp in Anand Parbat) to earn money. We got over 40 artists trained by veteran puppeteers such as Dadi Padamjee, Anupama Roy, Puran Bhaat and others from Sangeet Natak Akademi and National School of Drama.” “Since it is the first time we are working with the folk traditions of Europe and Rajasthan, we also faced several new challenges, such as making a making a full-fledged set for the puppets to act in,” says puppeteer Vinay Bhaat. The multilingual playlist was another hurdle. “The songs are in German, Italian and English, languages which we don’t really know. But Maya explained them to me in Hindi, which I further translated into our Rajasthani dialects, to understand the lyrics,” says Vinay. The biggest lesson was discovering the nuances of opera. “To me, opera was like yelling,” says Vinay, with a laugh, “Only after meeting Maya did we realise that this is an art form that has songs with meaningful lyrics that convey emotions.” The six compositions in the show include Irving Berlin’s show tune ‘Anything You Do I Can Do Better’, and the arias ‘O Mio Babbino Caro’ by Giacomo Puccini, ‘Deh Vieni Non Tardar’ by Mozart and ‘Chanson D’amour’ by Gabriel Faure. Says Pranav Nigam, the music producer, “We had to think of all the atmospheric sounds for the soundtrack to feel real. We had to find out the audio clips of ambient sounds like that of a shopping market and crowds on the Internet, or record them specifically for the play.” Maya says A Timeless Tale … is about the relationship between two spirited sisters. “We had to redo the story several times to ensure that it was universally appealing. Costumes and setting have been intentionally kept Indian, while the music is Western. It’s not an ‘East meets West’ kind of show; both cultures are represented equally.”  Visit @project.kalpana on Instagram for more details||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rajasthani-puppets-learn-mozart/article35598160.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Daily dose of flamenco||It is Day 489. ‘Brasilierinho’ by Waldir Azevedo fills the room as dulcet guitar tunes make way for more elements, in a mini concert. Eleven-year-old Joseph holds his guitar vertically over his head, in a pose he calls ‘the peekaboo’, as his fingers dextrously pick the strings. His brother, 10-year-old Noah, wears a sombre expression as he blends into the melody. Their parents, guitarist duo Jason and Elysa Hochman are in the backdrop, expertly guiding them along with their own sets. Quarantined Quartet is in action. Born out of the pandemic, the daily jam sessions by this talented New York-based family have been shared widely on social media. Fans include actor Pierce Brosnan. It all started on March 22, 2020 when the first video of them playing together went up on Instagram, with the label ‘#QuarantinedQuartet practice day 1’. Says Jason over a Zoom call from Manhattan, “On March 13, 2020, we had to close down our Manhattan studio from where Elysa and I run our academy (New York Guitar Academy). Joseph and Noah also had to shift to remote learning around the time.” Elysa adds, “We realised that we are all going to be together and wanted to do something we otherwise wouldn’t have, owing to our busy schedules.” Joseph says, “I have gotten better at playing with my family. We used to have only two songs we could play together, and those weren’t that good,” he chuckles, adding, “Now, we are tighter together as a quartet.” The 11-year-old has, over the days, developed signature moves, like the ‘peekaboo’. The focus is not on learning new songs everyday, but on sharing their journey and progression as a team, through these sessions. And for that, they have a roster of 35 to 40 songs they choose from. Their go-to song is ‘Las Olas’, says Noah. “It is a song that we created during quarantine. It is also one of our most popular ones,” adds Joseph. The fast-paced flamenco number reminds one of waves, as the title suggests. Who picks the song for each day? Jason pans the camera to a white board with a list of songs. Noah picks up a dart, aims at the board and shoots it across. This is how they choose. For this interview, the dart has landed on ‘When in Rome’, a piece composed by Jason — and a crowd favourite too. The family picks up their guitars, adjusts their Zoom camera, and plays the flamenco-inspired foot-tapping tune that invites one to groove along. At the time of going to press, they are on day 493. And far from done. “We are going to keep doing this as long as we are together,” says Jason.

On Anbe, the new vernacular dating app from Aisle, expect bios, topics and conversations related to all things Tamil. From Thala to Thalapathy, Thalapakatti biryani to Chettinad chicken. Anbe (meaning dear in Tamil), launched last week, focusses on the global Tamil community. It comes four months after Arike, the Malayalam dating app from the same brand. Though fairly new, “Anbe gets 800 users on a daily basis,” says Able Joseph, founder and CEO, Aisle. The majority of these users are from Chennai and Coimbatore for now, with a few in Singapore and Malaysia. There are those who log on  because they are currently living in a different state, or country, and miss the local lingo of Tamil Nadu. Zhulfia A, a retail professional, who lived in Chennai for nine years and is currently based in Bengaluru, says one of the reasons she signed up was, “I want to keep in touch with Chennai.” She says Anbe has got the essence right, with Tamil tags, slang and references. She is glad she gets to discuss such city-specific things with people who are either in Chennai or were part of the city. “Just the other day I was discussing Nungambakkam, Khader Nawaz Khan Road, Old Madras Baking Company and Junior Kuppanna biryani,” she laughs.  - Priyadarshini Paitandy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/thala-thalapathy-or-me/article35598171.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Little Amal is crossing the sea||Little Amal is looking for her mother. The nine-year-old is a Syrian refugee from Aleppo, who will walk from the Syrian-Turkey border to the UK, in search of her displaced family. Along the way, each village, town and city she visits, will welcome her with a slew of events ranging from performances to art installations. Amal might be a three-and-a-half metre tall puppet, carefully created by the Handspring Puppet Company in Cape Town, South Africa, but her journey encompasses the real tales of numerous young refugees and countless children who get torn away from their homes and separated from their families, not just in Turkey and Europe, but all over the world.  The Walk , as this production is called, is a travelling festival of art and hope by UK-based Good Chance Theatre — presented by its producers, Stephen Daldry, David Lan and Tracey Seaward — in association with Handspring Puppet Company. Little Amal is based on a character from Good Chance’s first production The Jungle , a play about the Calais migrant camp. Theatre writer and director Amir Nizar Zuabi joined the project as artistic director in 2020, developing hundreds of international collaborations across the route. At three-and-a-half metres, Amal appears taller than your average nine-year-old. The Handspring Puppet Company developed and crafted the physical form of the protagonist over a two-year period of workshops and testing. “She is made from robust, lightweight material like moulded cane and carbon fibre, to achieve a puppet that can be operated for long periods of time in varying conditions, to withstand rain and heat,” says the team at Good Chance, sharing information over email and a video call from the UK. Interestingly, there are three puppet Amals, in case a spare is required. She will also have a team of puppeteers and technicians who will look after her as she walks. Amal’s epic journey began on July 27 at Gaziantep, where an outdoor light installation featuring qandeel lanterns lit up one after the other to highlight a path that she can follow. Pieces of a story The 8,000-kilometre route will end in Manchester, in November, with around 250 partners and artists. “The route is the culmination of migration routes which have been used during the refugee crises of recent years,” says David Lan. The West Asian and African routes have been connected by passing through Italy. Specific cities of welcome have been chosen either because there was a willing partner located there, or because of cultural institutions of historical significance in those cities. Manchester International Festival invited Little Amal to Manchester, where she will start the next chapter of her life. “The city is one of many towns and cities in the UK that is doing a lot to welcome refugees, with Greater Manchester having the highest concentration of dispersed asylum seekers in the UK outside of London,” adds the team at Good Chance. The planning stages of this magnum opus production involved a huge number of conversations with potential collaborators across the route; artists and arts organisations, grassroots humanitarian organisations and major NGOs, representatives from civil society, and early funders who believed in the idea from the start. “Most importantly, there were conversations with people young and old living all along the route — people who had been there all their lives as well as more recently arrived refugees and asylum seekers — to explore whether the idea of Little Amal’s journey was one that would be welcomed. The response was overwhelmingly positive in all locations across Europe and in Turkey and Lebanon,” say the organisers. “Stopover destinations have been offered a simple idea: A nine-year-old girl who is coming through your community. How will you welcome her?,” explains Amir Nizar Zuabi. For example, in the Turkish coastal town of Cesme, Amal will follow a path of empty shoes that leads her to the beach. Created by K2 Contemporary Art Centre, this art setup represents the thousands of people who have lost their lives while crossing the treacherous sea. In the Italian city of Bari, she will be welcomed by a comforting large puppet of an Italian nonna (grandmother) who shares wisdom on how to overcome the obstacles she may face on her way; in Paris, an installation of a refugee camp will be created outside the Institut du Monde Arabe, where Amal will explore the rows of tents, hoping to find her mother. Meanwhile, Amal’s birthday celebrations are being planned in London, where she will turn 10 on October 24. The day begins with a dawn chorus performance at the Royal Opera House followed by a party at the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the finale, Amal will reunite with her mother in Manchester.

29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Priyanka Chopra||Priyanka Chopra added gol gappas. Nick Jonas championed gajar halwa . Chef Hari Nayak pulled it all together, in an edgy, New York-inspired modern Indian menu. Recently launched Sona in Manhattan is already packed with enthusiastic diners, despite the lingering shadow of the pandemic. Or perhaps because of it, as people embrace the exuberance of dining out again after a year of takeaway. In keeping with the celebratory mood, the restaurant offers bright, imaginative interpretations of Indian food, with Udipi-born and New York-trained Nayak at the helm. The butter chicken, however, is all Priyanka Chopra. When David Rabin and Maneesh Goyal decided to create a uniquely New York restaurant with an Indian soul, they joined hands with the actor, who came on board as a creative collaborator. “My cooking style is more innovative and global in approach. During tasting sessions, it was Priyanka who kept the menu grounded. She kept reminding me: ‘Don’t forget the classics’,” says Nayak, over a call from New York. “We have been working on this restaurant for three years, and she has been a part of Sona right from the beginning,” he says, adding that the actor’s husband, singer-songwriter Nick Jonas also participated in tasting sessions when he was in town. “He loves Indian food. He loves paneer, and gajar halwa is one of his favourite things to eat.” Chef Nayak adds with a laugh, “If it wasn’t for Priyanka, I would never have added gol gappas to the menu. We have a clientele that is almost 90% non-desi, and seat about 300 every night. We need to teach them how to eat it...” Sona’s version of the popular Indian street food features avocado and spiced tequila. “Everybody orders it before the meal now. That’s how they get the party started!” Deliberately defying categorisations, the food is inspired by Indian flavours but hinges on locally sourced ingredients. “I use cooking techniques that are modern, and food that is in season,” says chef Nayak. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America in 1998, he worked with influential chef Daniel Boulud at his 3 Michelin starred restaurant, Daniel. In 2007, he collaborated with chef Vikas Khanna to write Modern Indian Cooking (Silverback Books). Then launched restaurants in Kuwait, Riyadh, Dubai and Bangkok. His Indian homecoming was with Alchemy, at the Chancery Pavilion in Bengaluru, in 2018. Discussing how tough the pandemic was on the hospitality industry, and its impact on restaurant openings this year, he explains that Sona was reshaped by 2020. “We planned to open in the summer last year. Then the pandemic began, and we had this fully built restaurant that we couldn’t run. We kind of gave up then. But the landlord was supportive enough for us to get through, and the partners were strong enough to be able to wait.” When they could finally open, a few months ago, they realised the approach needed to be different, given the impact of COVID-19 on New York, and the world. “It was more luxurious, finer and refined before. We made it a little more approachable, a little more homey, a little more comfortable... we made it into the kind of restaurant where you would want to come again and again.” Despite a rush of openings — chef Nayak estimates there were about 80 New York restaurant launches last month — Sona has been packed, and received a flurry of rave reviews. Unconventionally Indian The Indians do not always approve, though. “Some of the worst reviews I get are from Indians — I sometimes get scared when I see them,” says chef Nayak, adding, “I would not dare to open a Sona in India.” He explains that the restaurant veers away from tradition. For instance, butter garlic crab is served with caviar here; their Gruyere cheese dosa has an edamame arbi mash; and the tandoor roasted beets are paired with chaat masala hazelnuts. “The stereotypical notion is that Indian food is all curry and spice, so I am purposely trying to change that perception,” he says. “For example, right now plums are in season: perfect, juicy plums from local farms. We reduce them with a little sugar, into a sticky, sweet syrup with a little tartness, then dip jalebis in them, staining them with that red, berry colour. Is it Indian? That depends on what you expect from a jalebi.” While the food is sophisticated, chef Nayak veers away from showy techniques, preferring instead to highlight great ingredients. “I’ve realised that as I mature as a chef, my cooking becomes simpler,” he says, adding, “I believe in the basics: more so after that crazy last year we’ve had!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/priyanka-chopra/article35598639.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The Kanjeevaram legacy||B Krishnamoorthy was 15 years old, and had just passed Class X, when he became an apprentice to his father, master Kanjeevaram silk sari weaver K Balaraman, in 1975. After learning the basics of the loom, he was sent to another senior weaver to learn the nuances of unique techniques such as ada katradhu (or jala ). A solid grounding in drawing helped him with graph drawing, important in the process of creating designs. “As a third generation weaver, my intention was to learn and understand every aspect involved in the Kanjeevaram weaving tradition. I enjoy each and every process of silk sari weaving because of this knowledge I gained along the way,” says Krishanmoorthy. He adds that the greatest moment in his life was when his work was selected for a National Award in 2010. “I had woven a Kanjeevaram silk inspired by the odiyanam (ornamental hip belt), and designed it thematically. When I received Rs. 1 lakh cash along with the award, that set me thinking about my responsibility as a weaver.” Even while working as a pattern maker and graph designer, Krishnamoorthy continued to weave silk saris and catalogue the designs that his father and grandfather had created. Between conducting seminars for textile and design students, he decided to document the samples he had created or safely preserved and put them together into a reference library for anyone interested in handloom. “My initial investment towards this goal was the National Award money. With that, I purchased the yarn and other things required and began to weave. I ended up with 5,015 basic designs, woven in 25-metre silk fabric with 60 inches height. I have identified the names of just about 150 designs so far,” he says. His efforts led him to weave another catalogue of 114 supporting designs (used in the pallav and borders). These include forgotten traditional designs in 5.5-metre width, 48-inch height silk fabric. “Some of us weavers ourselves do not know the names of the designs we weave. In ancient times, handloom weavers went by the instructions given by the loom owners or buyers,” he says. Krishanmoorthy explains how ‘MS Subbulakshmi saris’ were common reference points a generation ago. He adds that Kanjeevaram silks had just 15 basic colour combinations then. Designs were mostly inspired by the temples in and around Kanchipuram. “Now, due to the increasing market, we have introduced newer colours as well as geometrical and floral designs,” he says. He is supported in this endeavour by his wife K Jayanthi, also a National awardee ( for her silk sari inspired by Kanchi Ekambareswarar Temple in 2014. His team of artisans also includes includes his wife, father, cousins and staff. Together, they have created masterpieces in the Kanjeevaram silk weaving tradition for the repository. A fine example is his six-metre high Indian animal wall hanging, with a thilagam (tear drop) motif made in the mirror image technique, using Ahimsa silk with natural dye and pure gold zari. Over a period of 40 years, this master weaver has carefully collected many such samples and graph designs along the way. Students from the National Institute of Fashion Technology, the College of Fine Arts in Egmore, Indian Institute of Handloom Technology in Salem, Stella Maris College in Chennai and Anna University regularly visit his loom in Kanchipuram. One-stop guide Havingcreated most of the repository, his next challenge is preserving and managing it. He says, “I have begun to upload some of my work onto my computer. I used the lockdown to streamline my documentation processes. I hope to create a one-stop reference guide, a kind of library, which I would like to publish in a book format.” He says that apart from designs and patterns, he has also created 200 different motifs, and the collection is growing by the day. “Whatever I have created and documented can be replicated by weavers across the country in silk and in cotton, not just the kanjeevaram. ”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-kanjeevaram-legacy/article35598740.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Clubbed together for comfort||A cough. A sniffle. A bit of Prateek Kuhad can be heard in the background, amid an ongoing conversation about the new season of Rick and Morty . This is the scene in an unlabelled Clubhouse Room for people currently fighting COVID-19 and seeking virtual comfort. A week after Priyanka Gantala* tested positive for Coronavirus in the third week of July, she felt her spirits dampen with umpteen incoming texts and calls enquiring about her symptoms, medication, her pain and other depressing topics. “While I understood my friends are worried, I wanted to interact for a bit with people who could bring in some lighthearted banter but also know what it is like to be emotionally isolated,” she says over the phone from her home in Mumbai. So Priyanka and a friend of hers in Bengaluru, who also tested positive, got on a call. They enjoyed it so much, it lasted for four hours. “We had a bet (laughs), if we mention the words ‘COVID’ or ‘Corona’ or something along those lines, we had to do a dare assigned by the other person. But it never came to that; we were just happy to talk about anything else,” says Priyanka. A couple of days later, she was browsing the app Clubhouse, and saw how sessions of meditation and ambient noises offered a lot of comfort to many unconnected strangers around the world. She wanted to do the same, at least at a smaller scale. So on Sunday, July 25, Priyanka kicked off a random room with no Club assigned to it and invited a few people she knew had tested positive recently. “It started with just four people,” she recalls, “I had a few former college-mates living in Italy, Canada and Australia join. We talked about pop culture, travel plans and our childhoods. One person, a budding musician in Cape Town, played us their mixtape. Another then suggested a sing-along and realised it was a bad idea, given all our voices were terrible (laughs) from being ill.” In two hours, the group had gained 50-odd more people who were also ill. “Some had colds, not even COVID. But the concept still applied,” she says. Remarkably, the group had a more powerful impact when nothing was said at all. Maybe there was a cough or two, in the Room of then-70 people, but the silence was a special, comforting balm. “Some silences lasted for two to three hours,” she says, “and we welcomed that.” Did Priyanka consider making this an active Club with permanent members? She responds, “I wanted this to be a random set of Rooms because people are wary of their Clubhouse data showing that they’re a member of a Room for COVID-positive people. Plus, when people see a COVID type of Club on the app, it is assumed medical advice will be given and we do not do that. You don’t need a calendar invite, just a link which would have been shared through WhatsApp or other private message means.” “I am definitely not the first to do this,” she insists, adding she has since seen — thanks to her evolved Clubhouse algorithm — a few other unlabelled Rooms. And when she dropped in, she realised they were similar to the one she created. This was hardly a surprise. She says, “The loneliness during this time wreaks havoc on mental health. Sometimes, a stranger on the Internet can actually solve your problem!”  *name changed to protect identity||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/clubbed-together-for-comfort/article35598738.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Rajasthani puppets learn Mozart||Young vocalist Maya Bajaj wants to show that kathputhli s (traditional Indian puppets) can be brought out of the boundaries of their art form and do justice to Western opera. Currently pursuing diploma studies in Chennai’s KM Music Conservatory, she is preparing for the online release of A Timeless Tale of the Turbulent Twosome , as part of her final year portfolio project. “Rajasthani puppets will act in a contemporary story, set to compositions by Mozart and Puccini. It brings ancient art forms from across the world on a shared stage,” says Maya. Besides being the voice artist for its lead characters Meena and Suman, Maya is the soprano for the 30-minute show, while Shashwat Vishwakarma is the baritone. Based in Delhi since the lockdowns began, she started Project Kalpana to support traditional puppeteers of city’s Kathputhli Colony via the Kayakalp Trust. Adds Ria Golecha, director of Kayakalp, “We wanted Indian puppetry to become more relevant and also help the artists of Kathputhli Colony (now relocated to a transit camp in Anand Parbat) to earn money. We got over 40 artists trained by veteran puppeteers such as Dadi Padamjee, Anupama Roy, Puran Bhaat and others from Sangeet Natak Akademi and National School of Drama.” “Since it is the first time we are working with the folk traditions of Europe and Rajasthan, we also faced several new challenges, such as making a making a full-fledged set for the puppets to act in,” says puppeteer Vinay Bhaat. The multilingual playlist was another hurdle. “The songs are in German, Italian and English, languages which we don’t really know. But Maya explained them to me in Hindi, which I further translated into our Rajasthani dialects, to understand the lyrics,” says Vinay. The biggest lesson was discovering the nuances of opera. “To me, opera was like yelling,” says Vinay, with a laugh, “Only after meeting Maya did we realise that this is an art form that has songs with meaningful lyrics that convey emotions.” The six compositions in the show include Irving Berlin’s show tune ‘Anything You Do I Can Do Better’, and the arias ‘O Mio Babbino Caro’ by Giacomo Puccini, ‘Deh Vieni Non Tardar’ by Mozart and ‘Chanson D’amour’ by Gabriel Faure. Says Pranav Nigam, the music producer, “We had to think of all the atmospheric sounds for the soundtrack to feel real. We had to find out the audio clips of ambient sounds like that of a shopping market and crowds on the Internet, or record them specifically for the play.” Maya says A Timeless Tale … is about the relationship between two spirited sisters. “We had to redo the story several times to ensure that it was universally appealing. Costumes and setting have been intentionally kept Indian, while the music is Western. It’s not an ‘East meets West’ kind of show; both cultures are represented equally.”  Visit @project.kalpana on Instagram for more details||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rajasthani-puppets-learn-mozart/article35598739.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Daily dose of flamenco||It is Day 489. ‘Brasilierinho’ by Waldir Azevedo fills the room as dulcet guitar tunes make way for more elements, in a mini concert. Eleven-year-old Joseph holds his guitar vertically over his head, in a pose he calls ‘the peekaboo’, as his fingers dextrously pick the strings. His brother, 10-year-old Noah, wears a sombre expression as he blends into the melody. Their parents, guitarist duo Jason and Elysa Hochman are in the backdrop, expertly guiding them along with their own sets. Quarantined Quartet is in action. Born out of the pandemic, the daily jam sessions by this talented New York-based family have been shared widely on social media. Fans include actor Pierce Brosnan. It all started on March 22, 2020 when the first video of them playing together went up on Instagram, with the label ‘#QuarantinedQuartet practice day 1’. Says Jason over a Zoom call from Manhattan, “On March 13, 2020, we had to close down our Manhattan studio from where Elysa and I run our academy (New York Guitar Academy). Joseph and Noah also had to shift to remote learning around the time.” Elysa adds, “We realised that we are all going to be together and wanted to do something we otherwise wouldn’t have, owing to our busy schedules.” Joseph says, “I have gotten better at playing with my family. We used to have only two songs we could play together, and those weren’t that good,” he chuckles, adding, “Now, we are tighter together as a quartet.” The 11-year-old has, over the days, developed signature moves, like the ‘peekaboo’. The focus is not on learning new songs everyday, but on sharing their journey and progression as a team, through these sessions. And for that, they have a roster of 35 to 40 songs they choose from. Their go-to song is ‘Las Olas’, says Noah. “It is a song that we created during quarantine. It is also one of our most popular ones,” adds Joseph. The fast-paced flamenco number reminds one of waves, as the title suggests. Who picks the song for each day? Jason pans the camera to a white board with a list of songs. Noah picks up a dart, aims at the board and shoots it across. This is how they choose. For this interview, the dart has landed on ‘When in Rome’, a piece composed by Jason — and a crowd favourite too. The family picks up their guitars, adjusts their Zoom camera, and plays the flamenco-inspired foot-tapping tune that invites one to groove along. At the time of going to press, they are on day 493. And far from done. “We are going to keep doing this as long as we are together,” says Jason.

On Anbe, the new vernacular dating app from Aisle, expect bios, topics and conversations related to all things Tamil. From Thala to Thalapathy, Thalapakatti biryani to Chettinad chicken. Anbe (meaning dear in Tamil), launched last week, focusses on the global Tamil community. It comes four months after Arike, the Malayalam dating app from the same brand. Though fairly new, “Anbe gets 800 users on a daily basis,” says Able Joseph, founder and CEO, Aisle. The majority of these users are from Chennai and Coimbatore for now, with a few in Singapore and Malaysia. There are those who log on  because they are currently living in a different state, or country, and miss the local lingo of Tamil Nadu. Zhulfia A, a retail professional, who lived in Chennai for nine years and is currently based in Bengaluru, says one of the reasons she signed up was, “I want to keep in touch with Chennai.” She says Anbe has got the essence right, with Tamil tags, slang and references. She is glad she gets to discuss such city-specific things with people who are either in Chennai or were part of the city. “Just the other day I was discussing Nungambakkam, Khader Nawaz Khan Road, Old Madras Baking Company and Junior Kuppanna biryani,” she laughs.  - Priyadarshini Paitandy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/thala-thalapathy-or-me/article35598735.ece
29 July 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan reshuffle: Maken meets MLAs||Amid speculations of a Cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan, All India Congress Committee general secretary Ajay Maken met party MLAs and Independents supporting the Congress here on Wednesday to get their feedback on the functioning of the State government. Sources said the MLAs gave a mixed response to Mr. Maken’s queries. Mr. Maken interacted with 66 MLAs from the Jaipur, Kota and Bharatpur divisions in the State Assembly building till late in the evening. The one-on-one discussions with legislators will continue on Thursday, covering the remaining four divisions of Jodhpur, Ajmer, Bikaner and Udaipur. The AICC general secretary, who is in-charge of Rajasthan, held discussions with the MLAs on political appointments, performance of the Ministers in charge of their respective constituencies, progress of various welfare schemes, and the naming of the district and block presidents of the ruling party. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took strong exception to the State government’s decision to organise the interaction in the Assembly building. BJP State president Satish Poonia said the ruling party’s “plebiscite exercise” had lowered the dignity of the Assembly and it should have been held somewhere else. Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariawas, elected from Jaipur’s Civil Lines constituency, said the discussions were aimed at improving the State government’s performance, while the MLAs were provided with an opportunity to share their feedback and perspective in a “democratic manner”. Chaksu MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, considered a loyalist of former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, reportedly suggested that the Congress leadership should also get feedback from the party candidates who were defeated in the 2018 Assembly elections. Power-sharing setup Mr. Maken, accompanied by senior Congress leader K.C. Venugopal, had visited the State Capital last week to work out a power sharing arrangement between the ruling party’s rival factions supporting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Tonk MLA Mr. Pilot. The exercise for getting the opinion of all MLAs was planned for evolving a consensus on new appointments to the Council of Ministers. The Cabinet expansion and reshuffle, followed by appointments to various boards and corporations, may take place in the next few days, according to the party sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-reshuffle-maken-meets-mlas/article35598386.ece
29 July 2021||New Delhi,||Riots: HC issues notice on plea against cost for probe failure||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notice on the city police’s plea challenging a recent order of a local court here imposing a cost of Rs. 25,000 for “miserably” failing in its investigation into a case of a man, who received gunshot injuries in his left eye during the north-east Delhi riots last year. Justice Subromonim Prasad said there could not be a stay on the strictures made by the court against the Delhi police officers without hearing the case. He, however, said that the Delhi police need not deposit the Rs. 25,000 till the next date of hearing on September 13. Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju said the Delhi police’s grievance was mainly against the “cost and the strictures passed against the police officers”. He said the court had imposed the cost even before hearing the officers concerned. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, representing the victim (complainant), asked for a short date saying, “The complainant in this case is being threatened...We are under tremendous pressure to withdraw all these cases”. The court, in its July 13 order, censured the police for resisting registration of FIR based on the complaint of the victim, Mohammad Nasir, a resident of North Ghonda in Delhi. The court had directed the DCP (North-East) to deposit the cost money with the Delhi Legal Services Authority. It also said the amount should be recovered from the Station House Officer, Bhajanpura police station, and his supervising officers, “who have miserably failed in their statutory duties in this case after holding a due inquiry in this regard”. ‘Not given a chance’ In its petition challenging the July 13 order, Delhi Police said, the court “imposed cost to be deposited by the office of DCP North-East without giving any opportunity to the DCP to make his submissions, which is against the principle of natural justice”. The Delhi police also said that, “the imposition of such cost would seriously affect not only the career of the government officials but would certainly cause serious dent to the reputation of the officers”. “The court has made very serious remarks against the investigation even prior to the commencement of the trial which is contrary to the basic law that no finding should be given in the midst of trial,” the Delhi police’s plea stated. The court had concluded, “I have also applied my mind to the facts and circumstances of the case as also perused the case diaries in case FIR..., PS Bhajanpura, which reveals a very shocking state-of-affairs”. The court had also queried how the police was unable to trace any eyewitness in the case despite the MLC (medicolegal cases) of Mr. Nasir clearly showing his address.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-issues-notice-on-police-plea-challenging-rs-25000-fine/article35598405.ece
29 July 2021||July 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Treasure beneath the fortress||How did the British hide the gleaming white dome of the majestic Taj Mahal during the Second World War? What makes the towering gopurams of the Madurai Meenakshi temple so iconic? And, why does the Golconda Fort remain one of the most magnificent fortress complexes in India? A digital game developed by Team Yukthi of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Chennai turns the spotlight on Indian monuments, as it showcases history and traditions. The game has earned the team of first year engineering students — R Amrita Laasya, A Bhavika Taneja, A R Giris Teja and Kadambari Sree Rama Aditya — along with a third year student S Palaniappan a slot among winners at the recently organised Toycathon 2021, an inter-ministerial initiative of the Government of India. The event, held virtually on Toy Cloud digital platform, saw the participation of over one lakh students in 17,000 teams. From the shortlisted 1,500 teams, 117 teams emerged winners. “It was exciting to develop a game,” says Palaniappan. “Though we learn about developing software, this game was a great learning experience. It was challenging to design the board.” The digital board game, designed on the react.js Java platform, is a treasure hunt set in India where players criss-cross monuments along a path that promises to lead them to treasure. As players roll the dice and plan moves, a yaksha appears, posing a question about each monument. Every right answer is a key that takes them closer to the treasure. Once the player takes the 30-second quiz on the monument, he/she is redirected to blogs on the topic. Players can also take in a 3D view of the monument complete with a virtual tour guide. Says Bhavika, “We could improve upon the game based on inputs from the faculty. The judges liked our board design. The 3D views of the monuments are my favourite.”  “Why should history be restricted to textbooks?” asks Amrita, adding, “A game is a great way to highlight unknown facts about monuments, be it architecture, designs or heritage.” While they dug up the history of 100 monuments, from the Ajanta-Ellora caves to Jantar Mantar, the game currently features information on 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/treasure-beneath-the-fortress/article35598736.ece
29 July 2021||Agartala,||Trinamool shifting its focus to Tripura||The Trinamool Congress seems to have shifted its focus to Tripura with the party announcing the itinerary of its senior leaders, including national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. The announcement comes after the arrival of a delegation comprising two Ministers of the West Bengal government and a former Member of Parliament here on Wednesday amid allegations of confinement of 23 I-PAC employees at a hotel here. Mr. Banerjee will visit the State on Friday while the floor leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, and MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar are scheduled to reach tomorrow morning. ‘Oppressing the Oppn.’ Party sources said West Bengal Ministers Moloy Ghatak and Bratya Basu and former MP Ritabrata Banerjee will continue to stay in Tripura till the departure of Mr. Banerjee. A large number of party supporters assembled at the MBB airport to greet the leaders. Later, Mr. Basu and his colleagues addressed a press conference where they lashed out at the Tripura government for “oppressing the Opposition parties and muzzling the voices of dissent”. They criticised the ‘confinement’ of I-PAC team inside a hotel here and slapping Section 188 of the IPC against them. The Tripura police, however, denied the confinement charge and said they acted as per the provisions of the regulations imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I-PAC team members also underwent RT-PCR test. Despite the reports coming negative, the team was not allowed to move out by the security officers, the TMC alleged. It said I-PAC employees have been told to report to the east Agartala police station on August 1. Meanwhile, the ruling BJP has refuted charges that it had a role in the confinement of I-PAC employees. Party spokespersons Subrata Chakraborty and Nabendu Bhattacharjee addressed a press conference at the party office on Wednesday and blamed the TMC of trying to cultivate an administrative issue to extract political mileage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/trinamool-shifting-its-focus-to-tripura/article35598389.ece

29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rakesh Asthana takes charge as Delhi Police Commissioner||Rakesh Asthana, senior IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, took charge as the Commissioner of Delhi Police on Wednesday. He was accorded the ceremonial guard of honour by the police force upon his arrival at theDelhi Police headquarters at Jai Singh Marg. “I took charge as the Delhi Police Commissioner today. I believe in the basic concepts of policing, that is, maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime that is the basic thing which we are supposed to do. If these things are done properly, peace prevails in the society. There are certain specialised problems, for which there are separate SOPs. We will work accordingly,” he told reporters. Mr. Asthana also praised the city police for its past performances. “Delhi Police has a brilliant past. A lot of good work has been done by the force in the past. A lot of complicated situations have been handled by the Delhi police. I believe in teamwork and I hope withthis, we will be able to put the best foot forward for the betterment of society and prevalence of peace,” he said. Superannuation date In an order issued on Tuesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs had said that Mr. Asthana, who was serving as the Director General of the Border Security Force, would join as the Delhi Police Commissioner with immediate effect. His appointment came just days before his superannuation on July 31. He will have a tenure of one year. This is one of the very few instances when an IPS officer outside of the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre has been appointed as the Delhi police chief. A 1984-batch IPS officer, Mr. Asthana had earlier served as the special director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). During his stint in the CBI, he was engaged in an unsavoury spat with the then CBI director Alok Verma with both of them levelling allegations of corruption against each other. Senior IPS officer Balaji Srivastav was given the additional charge of police chief after the retirement of S.N.

29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sisodia seeks feedback on reopening schools||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday asked teachers, parents and students studying in educational institutions in the country to email their suggestions regarding reopening of schools to the Delhi government so that it may consult all stakeholders before arriving at a decision. Safety of students Mr. Sisodia said that over 5 lakh parents have met with teachers at the PTM organised for all Delhi government schools and many of them were eager to have schools reopened while some expressed mixed feelings as they feared for their safety of their children. Teachers, parents, and students can send their suggestions regarding the opening of educational institutions by emailing todelhischools21@gmail.comthe Minister said. He added that the Delhi government had closed schools and colleges keeping in mind the safety and security of children but now that schools have opened or are opening in many nearby States and the situation of COVID-19 in Delhi is under control, the government was reviewing the decision. “Approximately 70,000-75,000 COVID-19 tests are being conducted daily in Delhi, with only 40-50 COVID-positive people. Therefore, before making any decision to open institutions, the Delhi government wants to take their suggestions from parents, teachers, principals, and children as to when and how to open educational institutions. After the suggestions are received, the government will decide when and how to reopen the education system,” Mr. Sisodia said during a digital address. Several student groups have been pressing on the government to open educational institutions as they feel that they have been missing out on learning. Scientific considerations Ashok Agarwal, national president of the All India Parents’ Association, questioned why the Delhi government was asking for suggestions whether to open school or not as such a decision should be taken on scientific considerations. “When schools were closed, did Mr. Sisodia ask for suggestions from parents/students? Why are they asking for suggestions now? Is the Delhi government not capable to take decision on reopening of schools/colleges on its own? Parents/students are not experts. The decision required to be taken on scientific considerations,” he said. The Delhi government on Wednesday evening said that over 5,000 suggestions had already been received by the government within three hours of the announcement of the email address. Schools in the Capital were ordered to shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sisodia-seeks-feedback-on-reopening-schools/article35598401.ece
29 July 2021||New Delhi,||‘Asthana appointment breaches SC judgment’||The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana’s appointment as the Delhi Police Commissioner is a direct contravention of a Supreme Court judgement. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera asked if there was a “quid pro quo” and reminded the government that Chief Justice N.V. Ramana had rejected Mr. Asthana for the post of CBI director for having less than six months of retirement. Mr. Khera questioned the “special circumstances” because of which Mr. Asthana was appointed four days before his retirement. “Not just is it an issue of inter-cadre appointment; the issue expands to another instance of blatant disregard towards the Supreme Court of India and the laws of the land,” he alleged. While appointing Mr. Asthana, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also approved the inter-cadre deputation from Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre. Clear rules Mr. Khera argued that the landmark judgment in Prakash Singh and others versus Union of India and others, the Supreme Court had laid down clear rules. The appointment to the post of Director General of Police should be done by the Union Public Service Commission and preparation of panel should be purely on the basis of merit from officers who have at least six months or more to retire, he said. “With just four days left before the retirement of Rakesh Asthana, this notification by the Modi government issued under the seal of approval by [Home Minister] Amit Shah is downright illegal and in direct contravention of the judgment of the Supreme Court,” Mr. Khera said. “His appointment coming after his name was revealed among the list of those snooped upon using NSO’s Pegasus begs us to ask the question: Is there some quid pro quo?” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/asthana-appointment-breaches-sc-judgment/article35598393.ece

29 July 2021||NEW DELHI,||CM okays DoE proposal to take over pvt. school||The Directorate of Education (DoE) on Wednesday has decided to issue a show-cause notice for taking over the management of Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, after the school repeatedly failed to comply with multiple orders of the Delhi government asking it to rollback its fee hike. The Delhi government said that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal approved the proposal of the directorate to take over the management of the school and that the decision had been sent to the L-G. “The Kejriwal government will not let any kind of injustice prevail, we are with the parents. They should be assured that we will stand with them against such injustice,” Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said. The DoE said that it had conducted an inspection of the financial statement of the school for fiscal years 2012-2013 to 2018-2019. After a detailed inspection, the department found that the total funds for the year 2018-2019 amounted to Rs. 49.72 crore of which the expenditure was estimated to be Rs. 18.87 crore implying that there was a net surplus of Rs. 30.85 crore upon which the department concluded that the school had no actual need to increase the fees of the school. The government said that the directorate issued several notices to the school, asking them to stop charging the increased fee and submit a reply which the school did not.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-okays-doe-proposal-to-take-over-pvt-school/article35598396.ece
29 July 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Some officers obstructing my departmental work to please Chief Minister: Vij||Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Wednesday alleged that some officers in the government are obstructing his departmental work to “please” Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Dismissing reports suggesting differences between him and the Chief Minister, Mr. Vij said he and Mr. Khattar are good friends. He said the officers will have pay a heavy price for playing “dirty game”. In a statement issued here on Wednesday, Mr. Vij said, “Some officers are obstructing my departmental works to please the Honourable Chief Minister keeping in mind as if me (I) and CM are against each other. They are very badly mistaken. We are good friends. Officers playing this dirty game will have to suffer heavily for this.” The statement is being seen against the backdrop of a tussle between Mr. Vij and Mr. Khattar surrounding the extension of tenure of Director General of Police Manoj Yadava. While Mr. Vij wanted the DGP to be replaced on completion of his two-year term earlier this year, Mr. Lal was keen on retaining him, and eventually Mr. Yadava was granted a one-year extension by the Centre. Mr. Yadava, however, sought premature repatriation to the Intelligence Bureau last month. Differences between the two leaders had been brewing since Mr. Vij was given the crucial home portfolio after he won his seat for a sixth time in the 2019 State Assembly polls while most of the Ministers of the BJP government lost. The home portfolio was with Mr. Khattar during his first term in 2014-19.

29 July 2021||Kolkata,||Can’t force employees to donate for relief fund: HC||The teachers’ union constantly at loggerheads with the present administration at Visva-Bharati has claimed moral victory with the Calcutta High Court holding that the university should not have automatically deducted a day’s salary of employees for cyclone relief. After Cyclone Amphan battered parts of West Bengal in May 2020, Visva-Bharati had deducted a day’s salary of its employees to make a contribution to the relief fund. The decision was opposed by the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA), which said while it was all for contributions being made for relief work, such donation can only be voluntary and not binding on the staff. ‘No scope for refund’ “The employer neither has the power nor the authority to deduct salary or any portion thereof of an employee, unilaterally, in the garb of donation. A person cannot be forced to donate,” Justice Amrita Sinha said on Tuesday. The judge, however, observed that since the petition was filed one year after the deduction was made — a group of 23 teachers belonging to the VBUFA filed the petition in May 2021 — there was no scope for refund. When asked what took them so long to appeal in the court, a member of the VBUFA said the union was unable to garner sufficient support because of the pandemic and the lockdown. The VBUFA, according to the member, now plans to approach a Division Bench of the High Court to seek a refund (of the amount deducted) from the personal account of Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty and donate it to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. It also intends to file another petition against the forcible deduction of half-day’s salary of employees in October 2020 for the upkeep of the historic prayer hall at Santiniketan. According to the VBUFA, the prayer hall is the responsibility of the Santiniketan Trust and the Archaeological Survey of India and that the employees of Visva-Bharati, which has nothing to do with the structure, cannot be forced to pay for its maintenance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cant-force-employees-to-donate-for-relief-fund-hc/article35598390.ece

He has also asked the PSPCL to examine all the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janta Party government with various Independent Power Producers (IPPs), which were established basically to meet the power demands of the State, especially during paddy sowing and summer season. He has directed PSPCL to terminate or revisit all the lopsided PPAs that are not beneficial to the State. Notably, pressure from within the party had been mounting on Capt. Amarinder-led government to cancel the PPAs, which was a key election promise during the 2017 Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cancel-all-one-sided-ppas-punjab-cm-tells-pspcl/article35598381.ece
