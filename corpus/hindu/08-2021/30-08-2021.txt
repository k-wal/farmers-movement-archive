30 August 2021||Kabul,||As Biden warns of more attacks, U.S. destroys car bomb in Kabul||The U.S. said it destroyed an explosive-laden vehicle with an air strike in Kabul on Sunday, hours after President Joe Biden warned of another terror attack in the Afghanistan capital as a massive airlift of tens of thousands of Afghans entered its last days. A Taliban spokesman confirmed the incident, saying a car bomb destined for the airport had been destroyed — and that a possible second strike had hit a nearby house. The U.S. said it had only struck the vehicle but added that secondary blasts indicated “a substantial amount of explosive material”. Local media reported there may have been civilian casualties, which the U.S. said it was assessing. The strike comes after a suicide bomber from the Islamic State group on Thursday targeted U.S. troops stopping huge crowds of people from entering Kabul’s airport, from where about 1,14,000 people have been evacuated since August 15 when the Taliban swept back into power. More than 100 people died in the attack, including 13 U.S. service personnel, slowing down the airlift ahead of Mr. Biden’s deadline for evacuations to end by Tuesday. The operation is winding down despite Western powers saying thousands may be left behind. 300 Americans remain Secretary of State Antony Blinken said some 300 Americans still in Afghanistan were seeking to leave the country. “They are not going to be stuck,” he told ABC adding that the U.S. had “a mechanism to get them out”. The Pentagon said on Saturday retaliation drone strikes had killed two “high-level” IS jihadists in eastern Afghanistan, but Mr. Biden warned of more attacks from the group. “The situation on the ground continues to be extremely dangerous, and the threat of terrorist attacks on the airport remains high,” Mr. Biden said. “Our commanders informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours.” The IS attack has forced the U.S. military and the Taliban into a form of cooperation to ensure security at the airport that was unthinkable two weeks ago. On Saturday, Taliban fighters escorted a steady stream of Afghans from buses to the main passenger terminal, handing them over to U.S. forces for evacuation. The troops were seen throughout the civilian side of the airport grounds and annexe buildings, while the U.S. Marines peered at them from the passenger terminal roof. After a 20-year war, the foes were within open sight of each other, separated by just 30 metres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-biden-warns-of-more-attacks-us-destroys-car-bomb-in-kabul/article36173090.ece
30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||NITI bats for tax breaks to achieve monetisation goal||To make the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) a success, the government should give Income Tax breaks to attract retail investors into instruments such as Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), the NITI Aayog has recommended. The Centre’s think tank driving the NMP, estimated to raise almost Rs. 6 lakh crore for the exchequer over four years, has also called for bringing such trusts within the ambit of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to provide greater comfort to investors. Bringing in policy and regulatory changes to scale up monetisation instruments such as InvITs and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and expand their investor base have been identified as a critical element for the NMP. The government plans to use the InvIT and REIT route to monetise public assets such as highways, gas pipelines, railway tracks and power transmission lines. “More tax-efficient and user-friendly mechanisms like allowing tax benefits in InvITs as eligible security to invest under Section 54EC of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, are important starting points for initiating retail participation in the instruments,” the Aayog has said in its blueprint, indicating that further taxation-related tweaks may be needed along the way. Capital gains offset Section 54EC allows taxpayers to offset long-term capital gains from transactions in immoveable properties through investments in bonds issued by some government-backed infrastructure firms. “Though this will entail a cost in the form of loss of revenue for exchequer, the long-term benefits may outweigh the cost as linking investments in specified bonds with the capital gains exemption had proved to be success in the past,” Amit Singhania, partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., told The Hindu , adding that this will encourage retail investor participation in InvITs .  While InvIT structures have been used in India since 2014, the Aayog pointed out that such trusts are not considered a ‘legal person’ and cannot be brought under IBC proceedings, deterring lenders from participating. “Since the trusts are not considered as ‘legal person’ under the extant regulations, the IBC regulations are not applicable for InvIT loans,” the Aayog said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/niti-bats-for-tax-breaks-to-achieve-monetisation-goal/article36173092.ece
30 August 2021||MANGALURU,||TPR drops below 2% in Dakshina Kannada||With over 11,000 sample tests being done in the last three days in Dakshina Kannada, COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) dropped below 2% in the last two days in the district. In Udupi district, test positivity was at 0.92 % on Sunday. Test positivity rate, which is the number of persons testing positive for every 100 tests, was at 1.81% in Dakshina Kannada on Sunday. It was at 1.83% on Saturday. The positivity rate ranged between 3.46% and 2.07% between August 22 and August 27. A total of 81,055 tests were done in the period between August 22 and August 29 and 1,938 tested positive. On August 1,410 persons tested positive and the positivity rate was at a high of 6.05%. In the period between August 2 and August 7, the test positivity rate ranged between 3.66% and 3.79%. A total of 54,546 samples were tested and 2,376 were found positive in this period. Dakshina Kannada District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishor Kumar told The Hindu that effective ring surveillance, where an average of 20 persons are tested for one positive patient, has helped in bringing down the test positivity rate. Outstation students, who are quarantined in hostels after their recent return from their home town, and those who are regularly commuting to institutions in the district from Kerala are being regularly made to undergo RT-PCR tests. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that the Health Department staff did an exceptional work by ensuring collection of over 11,000 swabs in the last a few days, while keeping up the momentum of vaccination. The month of September will be challenging with the start of Pre University and other classes and also, with a host of festivals. “We have planned to keep up the momentum and try our best to keep COVID-19 under control in the district,” Dr. Rajendra said. A total of 15,34,674 have been vaccinated so far in Dakshina Kannada of which 11,54,479 have received the first dose and 3,80,195 their second. A record 47,175 people were vaccinated on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tpr-drops-below-2-in-dakshina-kannada/article36173449.ece
30 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Oil palm plan is a recipe for disaster’||Given the widespread destruction of rainforests and native biodiversity caused by oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, environmental experts and politicians are warning that the Union government’s move to promote their cultivation in the northeastern States and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands can be disastrous. Other concerns include the impact on community ownership of tribal lands, as well as the fact that the oil palm is a water-guzzling, monoculture crop with a long gestation period unsuitable for small farmers. However, the government says land productivity for palm oil is higher than that for oilseeds, with Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar giving an assurance that the land identified for oil palm plantations in the northeastern States is already cleared for cultivation. Letter to PM In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, soon after the launch of the Rs. 11,040 crore National Mission on Edible Oil-Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), Meghalaya MP Agatha Sangma warned that the focus areas were “biodiversity hotspots and ecologically fragile” and oil palm plantations would denude forest cover and destroy the habitat of endangered wildlife. It could also detach tribespeople from their identity linked with the community ownership of land and “wreak havoc on the social fabric”, said the National People’s Party leader. Congress leader and former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said proposals for large-scale oil palm cultivation had been studied and rejected as part of the technology mission on edible oils in the late 1980s as it was a “recipe for ecological disaster”. He alleged that “the present proposal of course is designed to benefit Patanjali and Adani”, both corporates with interests in edible oil expansion. “The palm is an invasive species. It is not a natural forest product of northeastern India and its impact on our biodiversity as well as on soil conditions has to be analysed even if it is grown in non-forest areas. Any kind of monoculture plantation is not desirable,” said Bibhab Talukdar, a biologist who heads the Guwahati-based conservation organisation Aaranyak, advising caution in introducing oil palm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/oil-palm-plan-is-a-recipe-for-disaster/article36173088.ece

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri inaugurated the extended line on Sunday and flagged off the train at Nayandahalli station. They rode on the train till Kengeri TTMC station. Starting Monday, services will be operated between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., and trains will run at a frequency of 10 minutes between Kengeri and Baiyappanahalli. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) had taken up work on the 7.5-km stretch in 2016 at a cost of Rs. 1,820 crore to build the elevated corridor and Rs. 181 crore for land acquisition. The Purple Line has been further extended up to a distance of 2 km till Challaghatta, and the BMRCL is hoping to start commercial operations on this stretch by March 2022. Mr. Puri said the total operational metro line in the country was 730 km in different cities. In Bengaluru, 56 km of Namma Metro lines with 51 stations are operational. The Minister commended the BMRCL for operating services with a punctuality rate of 99.8% Extension of services Mr. Bommai said there was a need to extend Namma Metro services till Ramanagaram, Rajanakunte, and Magadi. He said that instructions had already been given to officials to come up with plans for the same. Under Phase III of Namma Metro, the BMRCL plans to build a 32.16-km line from J.P. Nagar 4th Phase to Kempapura (western side of the Outer Ring Road), and another 12.82 km stretch from Magadi Road–Hosahalli station to Kadabagere (12.82 km). A detailed project report is under way.

He also questioned the Samyukt Kisan Morcha leadership for making Haryana the “epicentre of the movement” against the three contentious farm laws. Mr. Chautala, at a press conference in Chandigarh, said the Morcha leaders, mostly hailing from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, were causing turmoil in Haryana to disturb the peace in the State and derail its agrarian economy. “The SKM leadership should explain why there were no roadblocks in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh after the incident yesterday (Saturday). The 40 top leaders of SKM are mostly from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, but why is Haryana being made the epicentre? Haryana and its people are suffering, but the political parties in the poll-bound States will benefit,” Mr. Chautala said. He promised action against a Sub-Divisional Officer who was caught on camera asking police personnel to “break the heads” of farmers. “The video of a 2018-batch IAS officer has gone viral. Later there was a clarification that he had not slept for two days, but he probably doesn’t know that farmers too remain awake for 200 days in a year. What he said is condemnable and action will be taken for sure,” Mr. Chautala said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pained-by-farmer-police-clashes-chautala/article36173087.ece
30 August 2021||SIDDIPET,||Project oustee commits suicide||A Mallannasagar oustee of Etigaddakishtapur village committed suicide by drinking pesticide in the temporary accommodation they were provided at Sangapur on Sunday. This is the first suicide by an oustee after all of them were shifted from their villages to the alternative accommodation of double-bedroom houses. Sources said Nevuri Narasimha Reddy (45) committed suicide unable to come out of debt trap. About two acres of land belonging to him in Etigaddakishtapur of Toguta mandal was acquired by the government and he was paid compensation along with others. He reportedly established a washing centre and later a fast food centre, but the businesses were not much successful. He also performed the marriage of his daughter in 2019 incurring some expenditure. Reddy was reportedly a habitual drinker and is survived by wife Balamani, sons Srikanth, Shiva Kumar and daughter Sirisha. Some of his relatives said that Narasimha Reddy had opted for only a plot and not a constructed house as offered by the government. But he was yet to get a plot, unlike others, and this was also stated to be one of the reasons for his worry.

In his monthly radio broadcast programme, Mann ki Baat , Mr. Modi said space sector reforms had caught the people’s imagination, and expressed confidence that a large number of satellites in the coming days would be those on which youngsters from universities, labs and other sectors had worked upon. Indian traditions With the festival season coming up in the country, the Prime Minister said the world had been paying “heed to Indian spiritual traditions and philosophy”, adding that in this scenario, people also had a responsibility to carry forward these great traditions. “That which is temporary and has perished has to be left behind, but what is timeless has to be carried forward. Let us celebrate our festivals, understand their scientific meaning and the connotation behind them. There is an underlying message in every festival,” he said, wishing people a happy Janmashtami, which is celebrated on Monday. Noting that Vishwakarma Puja will be observed in the coming days, he said the festival was essentially an ancient Indian practice of paying tributes to different skills. Mr. Modi paid glowing tributes to hockey legend Dhyan Chand saying he conquered the world of hockey for the country. National Sports Day is celebrated every year on August 29 on the occasion of Dhyan Chand’s birth anniversary. Olympics gold Noting that India won an Olympic medal in men’s hockey after over four decades, he said the youth were now drawn towards sports and their parents were happy to back them. This itself was a great tribute to Dhyan Chand. Observing that the young population’s mindset had undergone a sweeping change, he said it was now keen on new destinations and new goals by taking new paths and having new aspirations.  Sanskrit promotion Mr. Modi mentioned a FM radio station at Kevadiya in Gujarat through which radio jockeys were working to promote Sanskrit. He said the ancient language, through its thoughts and medium of literary texts, nurtured knowledge and also strengthened national unity. The Prime Minister urged people to continue to maintain precautions against COVID-19. “More than 62 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the country but still we have to be careful, be vigilant,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/youth-breaking-the-mould-and-embracing-start-up-culture-pm/article36172877.ece
30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India silent on Taliban overture||South Block has maintained a studied silence in response to the comments from Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Stanekzai who on Saturday described India as “very important for the region”. Mr. Stanekzai’s comments were the first overt signal from the Taliban that it wishes to engage India which is currently the President of the UN Security Council and is set to preside over global deliberations on the current chaotic situation in Afghanistan. “India is very important for the region, and we want trade and economic relations with it. We expect the relationship will continue like before,” Mr. Stanekzai said in a video message. Mr Stanekzai has served as the leader of the political team of the Taliban that negotiated the Doha pact with the U.S. The overture from the Taliban for ties “like before” has come after months of speculation about India’s overt and covert diplomacy with various stakeholders about the Taliban. Mr. Stanekzai’s video statement has shown that some progress has been made in repairing India’s ties with the Taliban which have been weighed down by India’s misgivings about the outfit following the hijacking of an an Indian Airlines flight IC814 in December 1999 which led to the release of Jaish-e Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and other terrorists. Mr. Stanekzai’s ‘peace signal’ is being interpreted widely as Taliban’s changing stance towards India because the country holds the presidency of the UN Security Council. But diplomatic observers here have pointed out that the realism on both sides is tinted heavily with the U.S. role as the arbiter of a multilateral agenda at the Security Council where it is the “pen holder” on issues related to Afghanistan and terrorism. A statement from the Security Council issued a day after the fall of Kabul on August 15, mentioned “Taliban” unambiguously and urged it not to allow terrorists to operate from its soil. But another statement issued on August 27 removed Taliban from the text stating, “no Afghan group or individual should support terrorists..” The changing stance on Taliban and its allied partner, the Haqqani Network — currently in charge of capital Kabul’s security — has been highlighted by the suicide attacks at the Kabul airport that were blamed on the Islamic State fighters that are posing a threat to the Taliban in Afghan cities like Kabul and Jalalabad. Mr. Stanekzai’s realism regarding India is aimed to help brighten the chances of delisting of groups such as the Haqqani Network from the list of global terrorists. India has been an advocate of tough measures against the Haqqani Network. But of late, India’s statements at the UNSC and UN Human Rights Council were cautiously worded and avoided mention of the Taliban. Experts here say this display of caution shows New Delhi is “playing a role” within the framework defined by the Doha agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-silent-on-taliban-overture/article36172894.ece
30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘India Inc. not sanguine about growth’||Indian industry does not seem to share the optimism of the government and the Reserve Bank of India about this year’s growth prospects, according to a poll of CEOs conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Nearly two-thirds of CEOs of large corporates polled by the CII at its national council meeting earlier this month expect India’s GDP growth in 2021-22 to be 9% or less. The central bank has recently downgraded its GDP growth projection for the year to 9.5% from 10.5% earlier, while the Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian expects growth to be at 11% as estimated in the Economic Survey. Just 12% of the CEOs expect growth to be over 10%, while 20% expect GDP to grow at 8% or less than 8%. As many as 44% expect growth to be between 8% and 9%, while 23% expect it to hit the 9%-10% range. While policymakers have been stressing that inflation is a transient problem, industry captains coping with high commodity prices and transportation costs are not so sure. Just 33% of the CEOs expect average retail inflation during the year to cool from the present level (5.6% in July), while 67% expect it to be uncomfortably close to or beyond the RBI’s monetary policy tolerance threshold of 6%. As many as 30% of the CEOs polled by the CII, expect average inflation to go past 6% over the year. On the investment front, over half the CEOs attributed the lack of animal spirits and new investment plans to the fact that the ease of doing business remains cumbersome at the ground level. As many as 33% of the CEOs said fresh investments were not in the offing as current capacities exceed demand, while 32% blamed the high cost of doing business in the country, by which they did not refer to the cost of capital. Just 15% of CEOs said the cost of capital (read interest rates) is high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-inc-not-sanguine-about-growth/article36172917.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||‘U.S. will focus more on China now’||The Biden administration’s moves to pull out troops from Afghanistan and Iraq mean there will be more American focus on dealing with China, and India could benefit from U.S. investment that is leaving China if the Modi government becomes more transparent in policy-making and “open for business”, said Indo-U.S. trade body chief Mukesh Aghi. However, he said there is not as much interest in concluding an Indo-U.S. Free Trade Agreement as there was during the Trump administration and India must also put aside its hopes of having its “GSP status” restored, which was cancelled in 2019. Both sides must work on more deliverable goals. Bones of contention “If [India] makes GSP a central issue, and the U.S. side makes human rights, labour rights a central issue, then it’s a non-starter. Look at other bigger challenges we have,” Mr. Aghi, President and CEO of the Washington-based U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) told The Hindu in an interview. Last week, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said in a speech the U.S. had indicated it was “not looking” for a new trade agreement, but wanted to work on improving market access issues that have become a sore point. However, despite the cancellation of India’s GSP status, exports to the U.S. are the fastest rising than to any other country, indicating the GSP status, which New Delhi has been pushing for, may not have affected demand. Mr. Aghi was in Delhi for meetings with several Ministers including Mr. Goyal, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar who is a “Board Member Emeritus” of the USISPF, as well as Ministers of Information Technology (MEiTY), Civil Aviation, Sports, Health and Education ahead of a planned visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States in a few weeks. The USISPF has invited Mr. Modi to address a special annual meeting of its members in Washington, where President Biden is expected to hold the first in-person ‘Quad’ summit with the leaders of India, Australia and Japan. Economic cooperation The summit, which is yet to be confirmed by all the leaders, is likely to be held on September 26-27, a day after PM Modi delivers an address to the U.N. General Assembly. The four countries are likely to discuss economic cooperation on issues like critical and emerging technology, countering climate change and a COVID-19 vaccine partnership. The meeting will also be significant as it would come shortly after the U.S. completes its pull-out from Afghanistan. “I think pulling out from Afghanistan and Iraq will give resources to the strategists in the U.S. side and they will start looking at putting resources on dealing with China. So I think you will see Quad getting more stronger from that perspective, with more focus. And hopefully, it will go beyond the geopolitical to looking at the economic agenda,” Mr. Aghi said. Mr. Aghi also said with India-China tensions growing and the Modi government blocking Chinese FDI (foreign direct investment) proposals, India will need to depend on other countries like the U.S. to realise the PM’s hopes of a “5-trillion dollar economy”, as well as a possible economic trade agreement on the lines of the “Trans-Pacific Partnership.” Mr. Aghi said India still has a “communication problem” among U.S. businesses, as it is not seen as investor-friendly on issues like consultative policy making; legal protections like the indemnity issue holding up the import of U.S.-made vaccines and arbitration and dispute resolution, referring to the Cairn Energy dispute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-will-focus-more-on-china-now/article36172899.ece

30 August 2021||MOSCOW,||India, Russia to expand Central Asia ties: envoy||India and Russia are expecting to conclude the bilateral logistics agreement, Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), and a Navy-to- Navy cooperation memorandum of understanding (MoU) when Russian Defence Minister Gen. Sergei Shoigu visits India later this year. The two sides are also looking at expanding cooperation in Central Asia and the possibility of supplementing bilateral exercises with trilateral and multilateral ones, Indian Envoy in Russia D.B. Venkatesh Varma said. On the deal for S-400 air defence systems, the envoy, in an exclusive interview to The Hindu , said: “There are specific defence and national security considerations that led India to conclude the contract for the supply of S-400 systems. All I can say is that this contract will be implemented. We will do what we have to do and necessary for India to preserve and protect its national security interests.” Both countries are also scheduled to hold the maiden 2+2 ministerial dialogue during the visit of Gen. Shoigu. On the summit meeting, he said that dates were yet to be fixed, but was expected to take place towards the end of this year subject to the COVID situation. Mr. Varma said that both sides were also looking at how they could cooperate in using India as a production base for exporting to third countries of Russian-origin equipment and services and would add to the Make in India programme. “Russia will remain a key defence partner for India for decades to come,” he said. Afghanistan crisis The fast-changing developments in Afghanistan have of course taken everyone by surprise — unexpected as to their speed, as well as their consequences, Mr. Varma said, adding that it was imperative that India and Russia adapt their policies, whatever their policies were in the past. While a number of countries in the region and beyond are affected by the Afghan developments, India and Russia are, in essence, affected even more due to the rise of Islamic fundamentalist and radical groups and the sanctuary that could be claimed by terror groups, Mr. Varma said. This would impact both India and Russia and normal inter-State relations especially with respect to Central Asia, with additional threats emanating from drug trafficking, organized crime and the flow of refugees, he added. “This could potentially up-end the very foundations of inter-state relations in the broader region,” he stated. Mr. Varma, who will be retiring in two months, described the transformation in the India-Russia relationship in the last two years as a “quiet revolution.”  (Full interview on bit.ly/InterviewVenkateshVarma)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-russia-to-expand-central-asia-ties-envoy/article36172874.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Every party is buffeted by leadership tussles from time to time’||Talking about the leadership tussle in Punjab Congress, Lok Sabha member and senior party leader Manish Tewari said it was “a natural corollary of the politics of personality instead of ideology”. Excerpts:  Punjab is going to the polls in about six months, but the Congress seems to be imploding. The party is divided between Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and State Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. You too questioned Mr. Sidhu's advisers? The Indian National Congress [INC] in Punjab has been tempered in the fire of nationalism. It was the vanguard of the struggle against separatism, extremism and terrorism in Punjab. More than 30,000 Congressmen and women were martyred to protect, preserve and defend the unity and integrity of India between 1980 and 1995. The Congress, therefore, is a patriotic emotion in Punjab and not a political party in the conventional sense of the word. There is no division in the Congress in Punjab. There is, however, a difference of opinion on certain key fundamentals. The reason I had to call out one of the ‘so called’ advisors is that you cannot just go against the national consensus on Jammu & Kashmir [J&K] as articulated by two unanimous resolutions of Parliament in 1994 and 2012 respectively. The INC is against the dismemberment of J&K, it voted against the abrogation of Article 370 in Parliament but at no point in time has the INC or any of its responsible functionaries held or believed that J&K is not an integral part of India. Anyone who believes to the contrary is way out of line. Mr. Sidhu has talked about lack of freedom in decision-making and doesn’t want to become a showpiece in the party. In my four decade long active association with the INC what I have imbibed is that politics means ‘we’ and not ‘me’. The job of every leader is to carry people along. Try and create the widest consensus among your compatriots on issues and matters. Democracy isn’t a contest between personalities alone. It is rather a battlefield of ideas and visions. The litmus test being its acceptability by the people. Congress president Sonia Gandhi appointed Mr. Sidhu despite stiff opposition from party MPs and the Chief Minister. So, targeting him is seen as challenging her the leadership. It is the prerogative of the Hon’ble Congress president to appoint PCC [Pradesh Congress Committee] presidents. That prerogative has never been in question and that discretion is unfettered to say the least. However, where there is a stark aberration manifesting itself, as a third generation Congressman, I consider it my bounden duty to respectfully point it out. I do not think that in any way even remotely tantamounts to challenging the prerogative of the Congress president. All of us have also been appointed by her. She gave us ticket to come to Parliament. Incidentally, I was her very first political appointee when she became Congress president in 1998. She appointed me as the national president of the Indian Youth Congress. I respect her as much as I respect my late mother. Let they be Punjab, Chhattisgarh or Rajasthan, every Congress-ruled State is witnessing a leadership tussle. And the top leadership is unable to handle it well. Is it a sign of a leadership vacuum at the top? These turbulences are a part and parcel of politics. Every party is buffeted by them from time to time. Even the BJP has had to replace Chief Ministers in Uttarakhand and Karnataka. When politics departs from ideology and centres on personalities, such unrest is a natural corollary. We are passing through a peculiar phase of Indian politics where we are witnessing the death of ideology. Won’t the uncertainty about leadership within the Congress affect the prospects of Opposition unity in the run-up to the 2024 polls? Opposition unity against the current dispensation is a bottoms-up and not a top-down process. The reason why the Opposition is coming together is because people want it. They are tired of the constant lies, half truths, chest thumping braggadocio, economic mismanagement, criminal negligence in the handling of COVID-19, the undermining of each and every institution of our Republic and the constant assault on the idea of India. There is an intrinsic DNA of decency in every Indian that is now revolting against the current regime and its default reliance on the Hindu-Muslim binary of polarisation. A recent dinner hosted by Kapil Sibal was seen as a resurgence of the G-23 [Group of 23 dissenters]. More than a year after you all sought reforms, how far has the party travelled in terms of addressing these issues? G-23 is not a group of self-seekers. It is an emotion. A sentiment of those ordinary Congress workers who want to see the INC return to pinnacle of its heyday. Those who seek ideological clarity, organisational robustness, political sagacity and an alternative narrative to the bigotry of the ruling NDA/ BJP dispensation identify with this feeling. Unfortunately there are ‘certain people’ who want to convince the leadership that ‘these’ people are challenging your paramountcy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that we lost 2014 and 2019 general elections fairly badly. The fact is that in the last round of Assembly elections we did not fare well. The fact is that young people, as opposed to us grizzled veterans, are leaving the party looking for greener pastures. The fact is this nation requires a rejuvenated Congress as never before. Unfortunately, our intent and endeavour has been deliberately misrepresented by ‘certain interests’. Finally, yours is a border State and has tremendous security implications given what is happening in Afghanistan and the State's own history. What are your thoughts on this? The victory of the Taliban in Afghanistan represents a huge triumph for the Pakistani deep state. It has emboldened every extremist/terrorist organisation in the wider Middle East and South Asia from the Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad. The narrative that the Mujahideen/ Taliban vanquished the Soviet Union — a superpower then, in the penultimate decade of the 20th century and U.S. the only remaining hyperpower in the second decade of the 21st century has huge resonance in the so-called axis of resistance. The implications in J&K and Punjab would be portentous in the days to come.  The reason I had to call out one of the ‘so called’ advisers is that you cannot just go against the national consensus on Jammu & Kashmir||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/every-party-is-buffeted-by-leadership-tussles-from-time-to-time/article36172897.ece

30 August 2021||New Delhi,||SC issues protocol for physical hearings||The Supreme Court has issued fresh standard operating procedures to accord final hearing of cases in physical mode from September 1, and will employ a hybrid option from Tuesday to Thursday every week amid strict observance of COVID safety norms. The top court has been hearing cases through video-conferencing since March last year due to the pandemic and several Bar bodies and lawyers have been demanding that physical hearings should resume as they face financial and technical difficulties. The SOP, issued by the Secretary-General on Saturday, made it clear that the courts would keep hearing miscellaneous cases through virtual mode on Mondays and Fridays. “Wearing of mask, frequent use of hand sanitiser and maintaining physical distancing norms are mandatory for all entrants into the Supreme Court premises, including into the courtrooms,” the SOP said. The procedures mandated that once litigants and the lawyers opt for the hearing through physical mode, “hearing through video/tele-conferencing mode to the party concerned will not be facilitated”. Representations heard The SOP has been issued on the directions of Chief Justice N.V. Ramana who took note of the recommendations of the Judges’ Committee set up earlier to consider representations and requests of Bar bodies. “With a view to gradually facilitate resumption of physical hearing, the final hearing/regular matters listed on non-miscellaneous days may be heard in the physical mode [with hybrid option], as may be decided by the Bench, considering the number of parties in a matter as well as the limited capacity of the courtrooms; further, any other matter may be heard in physical mode on such days, if Bench directs likewise. “All other matters, including those listed on miscellaneous days shall continue to be heard through video/teleconferencing mode.” The Bench, hearing cases through physical mode, may decide on taking a break during the hearings for 15 minutes, so that the courtroom may be sanitised, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-issues-protocol-for-physical-hearings/article36172902.ece
30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Extend IBC provisions to InvITs: experts||Changes to the Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) structure and regulations are among crucial modifications required to attract retail investors to the National Monetisation Pipeline, say financial experts. Aashit Shah, partner at law firm J Sagar Associates, said extending IBC provisions to InvITs would help lenders access a faster and more effective debt restructuring and resolution option. “However, infrastructure regulators and SEBI would need to work in tandem for a successful insolvency resolution of an InvIT which may involve a change in the sponsor, investment manager and/ or trustee or transfer of an infrastructure asset,” he said. The NITI Aayog has also flagged the fact that lenders do not have existing process for recourse to project assets as Trusts are not considered a ‘legal person’ in its NMP guidebook. “While the lenders are protected under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) and the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993, the provision of recourse under IBC regulations will bring in added level of comfort for the investors,” it opined. Apart from InvITs’ inclusion under the IBC, other amendments may be needed to allay concerns that retail investors may have about the safety of their investments in such large underlying assets, said Abhishek Goenka, partner at Aeka Advisors. Separate section Mr. Goenka also asserted that a separate section in the income tax law to provide capital gains tax relief for investments in eligible InvITs specifically holding NMP assets would be better than extending Section 54EC, which currently applies to bonds issued by the National Highway Authority of India, Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Finance Corporation and the Indian Railway Finance Corporation. “The government should provide a high threshold for such tax breaks given the urgent need to push retail participation in these formats,” Mr. Goenka said. Simply put, InvITs are structured so as to give investors an opportunity to invest in infrastructure assets with predictable cash flows, while the asset owners can raise upfront resources against future revenue cash flows from those assets, which in turn can be deployed in new assets or used to repay debt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/extend-ibc-provisions-to-invits-experts/article36172883.ece
30 August 2021||New Delhi,||International passenger flights stay suspended till Sept. 30||The suspension of scheduled international passenger flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been extended till September 30, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Sunday. “However, international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis,” it added. Scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23, 2020, due to the pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May 2020 and under bilateral “air bubble” arrangements with select countries since July 2020. India has formed air-bubble pacts with around 28 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Under an air-bubble pact between two countries, special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories. The DGCA circular also said the suspension does not affect the operations of international all-cargo services and flights specifically approved by it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/international-passenger-flights-stay-suspended-till-sept-30/article36172904.ece
30 August 2021||Mumbai,||‘No cognisable offence by Deshmukh’||A leaked report of a preliminary inquiry conducted by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) reveals that the agency had concluded that “no cognisable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh, the former Home Minister of Maharashtra”. The inquiry was conducted by a CBI team following orders by the Bombay High Court on a criminal writ petition filed by Advocate Jayshri Patil who had lodged a complaint in wake of the letter written by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. In his letter, Mr. Singh had alleged that Mr. Deshmukh had asked former Mumbai Police API Sachin Vaze to collect Rs. 100 crore from hotel owners in Mumbai. However, based on this inquiry report, the CBI filed an FIR against the former Minister. Subsequently, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) too initiated a probe against Mr. Deshmukh and has summoned him several times to appear for it. The CBI report, which has been leaked to the media and has been seen by The Hindu , has now cast doubts over the ongoing investigation by the central agency. According to sources, despite the investigation officer not finding any cognisable offence committed by Mr. Deshmukh, an FIR was registered. According to CBI report, “There is no proof of any meeting of Sachin Vaze with the then Home Minister at his residence apart from official briefings/purposes in the presence of other officers. There was NO proof of any demand by the then HM or his P.S. Sanjeev Palande for collection of money.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-cognisable-offence-by-deshmukh/article36172891.ece

30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. extends deadline amid IT portal glitches||With the new Income Tax portal yet to become fully functional, the Finance Ministry on Sunday extended the deadlines for several categories of taxpayers to file tax-related forms electronically. The fresh deadlines for 11 specified forms, a couple of which have been extended to March 31, 2022, largely pertain to institutional taxpayers, not individuals. These include multinational firms, sovereign wealth funds, and bodies like charitable trusts. “On consideration of difficulties reported by the taxpayers and other stakeholders in electronic filing of certain Forms under the provisions of the Income-tax Act,1961 read with Income-tax Rules,1962 (Rules), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to further extend the due dates for electronic filing of such forms,” the Ministry said in a statement. “The extension will provide much needed relief to taxpayers for making the compliances and will also save them from penal consequences,” said Shailesh Kumar, partner at Nangia & Co. LLP. “The extension has been made not only to address immediate filing requirements due within August or September 2021, but also some medium-term relief has been given to taxpayers for some compliances,” Mr. Kumar said. The last date for taxpayers to pay up dues under the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme for direct tax dispute resolution has also been extended from August 31 to September 30, where no additional amount is payable. Where taxpayers are required to pay an additional amount, the October 31 deadline has been retained, the Ministry said. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs extended the deadline for an amnesty scheme under the GST regime, from August 31 to November 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-extends-deadline-amid-it-portal-glitches/article36172884.ece

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Oil palm plan is a recipe for disaster, say activists||The Union government insists it is already proceeding on the basis of cautious scientific analysis. A study done by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research recommended 28 lakh hectares across the country where oil palm can be cultivated, out of which only 9 lakh hectares are in the northeastern States, Mr. Tomar said. “This 9 lakh hectares is not being given by cutting forests or other crops. This is land available for cultivation. The other reason is that besides the availability of land and the suitability of climate, in the context of environment too, it will help bring balance,” the Agriculture Minister told reporters after the Cabinet approved the new mission. “There is research going on to increase the production of oilseeds like mustard, groundnut, soyabean, sunflower, and there has been increasing growth in the production of these oilseeds, but if we have to fill huge gap in production versus demand [of edible oils] soon, we will have to venture into crops where production is more. The production of palm oil from one hectare is far greater than the production of mustard oil in the same area. So naturally, though we are promoting the production of other oilseed, the production rate of oilseeds cannot be compared to that of palm oil,” he said. Palm oil currently makes up a whopping 55% of India’s edible oil imports, and the new mission is intended to move towards domestic production and self reliance instead. Previous experience The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have already had some experience with oil palm, including some abandoned plantations on Katchal Island in the Nicobar chain, and a 1,593-hectare area on Little Andaman which was planted more than 35 years ago and abandoned on the instructions of the Supreme Court. According to a feasibility report prepared by the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), based on visits to the islands in late 2018, these can be revived and supplemented by plantations in the grasslands, which make up more than 75% of the land area of Little Andaman, Katchal, Baratang, Kamorta and Teressa. “Existing grass in the islands is not of any use and is being burnt every year to avoid snakebites,” said the IIOPR’s feasibility report, which added that the soil and climatic conditions were suitable for oil palm plantation, with high rainfall doing away with the need for irrigation which could suck out groundwater. All five islands are home to tribal communities, including the Jarawa and Onge tribes. The IIOPR suggested that multi-cropping during the first three years of the oil palm’s life cycle would help provide income before the plantation yields returns from the fourth to seventh years. However, in a January 2019 letter to the Agriculture Department, the Chief Conservator of Forests of the Union Territory pointed out that much of these lands are protected or reserve forests and any land use changes would require the approval of the Supreme Court, whose 2002 order had directed that existing plantations, whether of oil palm, rubber or teak, should be phased out. The land should be regenerated to its natural profile without any further introduction of exotic species, it said. In its feasibility report, the IIOPR said the Chief Secretary of the islands gave an assurance that “A&N administration would take care of issues relating to Supreme Court Ban and other Committee Reports with the help of the Government of India”.  Although it shares similarly suitable climatic conditions, Sri Lanka has recently disavowed oil palm, with a May announcement to raze existing plantations and ban palm oil imports as the crop has replaced more environmentally friendly and employment generating plantation crops, dried up local streams, and showed signs of becoming an invasive species threatening native plants and animals. In the parts of peninsular India which already grow oil palm, the response has been mixed. Industry stakeholders in Kerala, which has had widespread experience with plantation crops, are excited about growth prospects via the new mission. Former Oil Palm India chairman Vijayan Kunissery told The Hindu that a number of rubber farmers are interested in switching to oil palm and expected a revival of the sector by 2022. The State government has identified potential sites for cultivation in Wayanad and Palakkad districts, apart from rejuvenation of existing gardens supported by the new mission. In Andhra Pradesh, which currently grows more than 90% of India’s oil palm, farmers depended on bore well irrigation. G.V. Ramanjaneyulu, an agricultural scientist who heads the Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, pointed out that oil palm requires 300 litres of water per tree per day, as well as high pesticide use in areas where it is not a native crop, leading to consumer health concerns as well. The high levels of investment and the long wait for high returns tend to attract large corporate investors, while small cultivators have struggled with the long gestation period, and have required heavy government support. “If similar subsidies and support are extended to oilseeds which are indigenous to India and suited for dryland agriculture, they can help achieve self-reliance without dependence on oil palm,” Dr. Ramanjaneyulu said. He accused faulty trade policy for undercutting the gains in oilseed productivity which were driven by the technology mission of the late 1980s and early 90s. “When the government cut duties on edible oil imports, the Indian domestic market collapsed. Palm oil imports from Southeast Asia became cheaper than domestic oilseeds because of the subsidies provided in those countries,” he said.

30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Global power shifts lead to security challenges’||Alignment and re-alignment of global powers have added to the already changing security challenges and the changing equations in Afghanistan are a recent and important example of this, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday while stating that the Quadrilateral grouping has been constituted keeping these things in mind. “Today the enemy no longer needs to enter the border. He can also target our security apparatus from outside the border. Alignment and re-alignment of global powers have added to the already changing security challenges,” Mr. Singh told officers at the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington. “The changing equations in Afghanistan are a recent and important example of this. These circumstances have forced every country to think on its strategy today. Quad has been constituted keeping these things in mind,” he said. Stating that despite the challenges on India’s border, the common man is confident that there will be no compromise on national security, Mr. Singh said this belief gradually became stronger that India would not only end terror on its own land, but would not hesitate to hit adversary on its soil if needed. ‘New dynamism’ Referring to the stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Eastern Ladakh, Mr. Singh said a unilateral attempt was made last year to change the status quo in the northern sector too. “Here too we have faced our adversary with a new dynamism away from our past response.” Without mentioning Pakistan, Mr. Singh said one of our neighbouring countries started resorting to proxy war. Terrorism became an integral part of its state policy and it started taking full recourse to it targeting India by giving arms, money and training to terrorists. This was a major change in the paradigm of challenges facing our country and major changes have been made to our security policies to reflect the changes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shifts-among-global-powers-lead-to-security-challenges/article36172889.ece

30 August 2021||New Delhi,||First Covaxin batch from Gujarat-based unit is out||Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Mansukh Mandaviya on Sunday released the first commercial batch of COVID-19 vaccine manufactured in Ankleshwar, Gujarat. The Minister said that vaccination was most important to strengthen the country in the fight against the pandemic. He said that the Ankleshwar plant had a manufacturing capacity of more than one crore doses a month. On the status of Covaxin production in India, the Union Minister said that Bharat Biotech had already deployed multiple production lines at its Hyderabad, Malur, Bengaluru, and Pune units, and the addition of Chiron Behring, Ankleshwar, would further augment its Covaxin production capacity. A release issued by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers noted that a new facility constructed during 2020 was now being utilised for the production of Covaxin. The production had begun in early June, before which the team had executed engineering batches to study the equipment functionality at the facility. Products manufactured from Ankleshwar facilities would be available for supplies starting September 2021, he added. Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said, “Our goal to develop a vaccine with global safety and efficacy standards has now been achieved, we are now marching towards the goal of annualised capacity of ~ 1.0 billion doses.” Global partners Bharat Biotech was also exploring manufacturing partnerships with its partners in other countries which had expertise in commercial scale manufacturing of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment for further augmentation, he added. In his speech, the Minister noted that India was running one of the largest vaccination programmes in the world and it was made possible due to the development of these indigenous vaccines. “The National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme has been successfully going on across all States and Union Territories since January16, 2021,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/first-covaxin-batch-from-gujarat-based-unit-is-out/article36172919.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||The devoted do not fear||At various times, we all make offerings to God, but no one gives everything he has. But Putana gave up her very life, and thus earned moksha, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. Putana had come to kill Krishna. How then could she be considered worthy of moksha? Although her intention had been evil, she had ultimately been killed by Krishna, and had also had the good fortune of touching the Lord. Giving up her life can be said to be giving up everything, and so she qualified for His daya. Krishna closed His eyes, when he sucked her milk and her life. Some interpret this to mean that the Lord was sorry that the first person He was killing in that avatara was a woman. But Krishna closed His eyes for a different reason. Here was Putana giving up her life to Krishna, and what could He give her in turn? Krishna felt that nothing He could give her was enough for this supreme sacrifice! In shame, therefore, He closed His eyes. Such is the Lord’s kindness, that He is never satisfied that He has compensated or rewarded us enough. This attribute of the Lord is pointed out by Venkatadri kavi, the author of Lakshmi Sahasra . He says that the Lord does not know what to give him (Venkatadri) as a reward. The Lord feels that whatever He gives will be too small a gift for the poet. Why did Krishna kill those Kamsa sent to destroy Him? Instead could He not have killed Kamsa first? He wanted Kamsa to live in terror, not knowing when Krishna would slay him. Such fear is what His enemies experience. The Sun is scorching, but the lotus finds the Sun pleasing. Likewise, devotees do not have to fear the Lord. But those who oppose Him will be afraid of Him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-devoted-do-not-fear/article36172909.ece

30 August 2021||New Delhi,||AI moves court to quash Cairn plea||Air India has asked a New York court to dismiss a petition filed by Britain’s Cairn Energy for seizure of its assets to enforce $1.2-billion arbitral awards against the Indian government, saying the litigation was premature as an appeal against the arbitration award was still pending. The petition by the airline, which is separate from the government’s plea in a Washington court seeking dismissal of Cairn’s lawsuit to seek confirmation of the arbitral award, lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a “mere hypothetical question” or one that depends upon contingent future events that may or may not occur, the New York district court said. Cairn first moved a court in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking confirmation of the arbitration awards and then filed a petition in the New York court to seek declaration of Air India as an “alter ego” of the Indian government and so it should be made liable to pay the arbitral awards. An international arbitration tribunal in December last year set aside the levy of capital gains tax, using a 2012 retrospective legislation, on a 2006 reorganisation of Indian business that Cairn carried before listing it on local stock exchanges. “Cairn’s petition to confirm the Award is pending in the District Court for the District of Columbia,” Air India said in the August 23 petition. It said that the government had filed before a court in The Hague a Motion to Stay and a Motion to Dismiss the arbitral award.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ai-moves-court-to-quash-cairn-plea/article36172887.ece

Sources in the State Secretariat said Mr. Bommai would chair a meeting at 4 p.m. and take decisions related to opening of primary schools after consulting health experts and Ministers heading the departments such as Health and Family Welfare, Primary and Secondary Education, and Higher Education. A few days ago, the Chief Minister said the decision on opening of schools till standard VIII would be taken in August-end based on the number of COVID-19 cases in different districts. Classes for IX to XII students have already commenced on alternative days from August 23, except in border taluks. With growing demand for relaxation of norms for public celebrations of Gowri–Ganesha festivals, which fall on September 9 and 10, by BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and many right-wing organisations, the Chief Minister is expected to take a decision on the matter on Monday. A couple of days ago, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said COVID-19 guidelines for the festival could be revised, based on the reduction or rise in COVID-19 cases.

30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tambaram Corporation takes shape amidst great expectations||The announcement of the State government that it would create Tambaram Corporation by merging several fast-growing localities in south Chennai has elated a large section of residents, residents welfare activists and political administrators cutting across parties. The government’s announcement comes as a confirmation of the poll promise made by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin during canvassing for votes for Tambaram and Pallavaram constituencies during the State Assembly elections. L. Sundararaman, president, Chitlapakkam Muthulakshmi Nagar Welfare Association, welcoming the announcement, said the two-decade aspirations of the residents were finally getting fulfilled. The new corporation had given hopes to the people of getting better civic amenities, including underground drainage, better roads, efficient solid waste management, better illumination of the streets and a metro train. Tambaram MLA S.R. Rajaa, who thanked Mr. Stalin and Sriperumbudur MP T.R. Baalu for being instrumental in fulfilling the poll promise, said he aimed to make the corporation the second best in the State after Greater Chennai Corporation by implementing several welfare facilities through the appointment of an IAS officer as Commissioner. Mr. Rajaa, who served as Tambaram municipal chairman and councillor, said in his very first speech after being elected as Tambaram MLA in the Assembly in 2006 that it was for requesting the creation of the Tambaram Corporation. Mr. Rajaa said although Tambaram municipality had been endowed with underground drainage facility, third railway terminal, and underground electricity cable network (for which work was on), upgrading it to the Corporation would pave the way for increased fund allocation and better civic amenities. The Tambaram Corporation would have four additional municipalities of Pallavaram, Sembakkam, Pammal, and Anakaputhur, five town panchayats of Thiruneermalai, Perungalathur, Chitlapakkam, Madambakkam, and Peerkankaranai and 15 special village panchayats. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, which proposed creation of Tambaram Corporation in the Second Master Plan of Chennai Metropolitan Area in 2008, had conducted a comprehensive study of all aspects of urban planning and development and organised public consultations. The officials of CMDA agreed that the creation of a single municipal corporation of Tambaram by merging clusters of municipalities, town and village panchayats would facilitate implementation of large infrastructure projects. The flood mitigation projects in Tambaram Corporation were expected to be implemented after the new Tambaram Corporation Council takes charge, a CMDA official added. However, political administrators point out a minor glitch in the formation of the corporation in merging the 15 first grade town panchayats. Supreme Court’s nod P. Damodaran, former village panchayat president of Mudichur, said the government would have to play an active role by taking permission of the Supreme Court to allow the merging of the 15 town panchayats with the Tambaram Corporation and then conduct the local body election. The failure to take the permission of the Supreme Court for conducting local body elections of the 15 panchayats coming under the St. Thomas Mount union and located in four Assembly constituencies of Tambaram, Alandur, Pallavaram and Sholinganallur would delay the process of these panchayats being merged with the Tambaram Corporation, he added. Opposition to proposal However, a section of residents of Pallavaram were not keen of their municipality being merged with the Tambaram Corporation as the residents fear that area would get a raw deal. Social activist V. Santhanam said the merging of Pallavaram with Tambaram Corporation was not a welcome move as over the years the Pallavaram municipality, which has more population and wards compared to the Tambaram municipality, would remain ignored over the years. He said the residents of Pallavaram and Chromepet remained steadfast in their demand for merging the municipality with the Greater Chennai Corporation or making it a separate corporation rather than being attached to Tambaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tambaram-corporation-takes-shape-amidst-great-expectations/article36173170.ece

30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Mental health of students in focus||As schools gear up to reopen on Wednesday this week for senior classes, several of them are turning the spotlight on the emotional well being of their students and staff members. Students of Classes 9-12 were last on campus in April for two months before the second wave of COVID-19 struck, forcing the schools to close. In the Statement of Procedure issued for the reopening, the Tamil Nadu government has called upon teachers, counsellors and health workers to act in unison to ensure students’ emotional safety. The school closure has impacted the certainty and structure that students had before and set back the daily routines. Nandini Raman, consultant counsellor and secretary, Chennai Counsellors Foundation, said schools had a large role to play in encouraging children to open up and speak about how the last one year had been. “When they get back to school, they can be asked about how the last year has been and discuss both the good and the bad. There are a lot of changes academically for these senior students, and while these are important to tackle, they should be gently eased into getting back on campus and attending physical classes.” Ms. Raman said that with a host of changes over the last year, she had worked with students who had anxiety and depression, experienced panic attacks, and displayed aggressive behaviour. “Many students are panicking about going back to school. For adolescents, there have been several changes to deal with physically and mentally, and there are concerns about how they will face their classmates and teachers.” Several schools that have counsellors on campus have chalked out a plan to address the problems of students. “We definitely expect students to take some time to settle down to daily classes on campus. Acknowledging the mental preparedness needed, we started off with sensitising the teachers to the need for giving the students time to ensure that they ease into this routine,” said J. Alageswari, school counsellor, Shree Niketan Group of Schools. She said that while the academic expectations from senior students were high, care was being taken to ensure that there was no pressure on them immediately after they came back. “If students have mental health concerns and need to speak about them, teachers will immediately refer them to the counsellors...,” she said. While classes continued online for a large part of the previous and current academic years, several private schools had mechanisms for their on-campus counsellors to reach out to students and parents online. Schools have been asked to ensure that regular counselling is done for both teachers and students who are reporting mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, once they are back on campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mental-health-of-students-in-focus/article36173152.ece
30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination centres at schools closed||The Greater Chennai Corporation has closed vaccination centres at schools and other educational institutions in various parts of the city. On Sunday, many residents who visited Corporation vaccination centres were asked to visit alternative locations. Most of the major vaccination centres had been developed on the premises of educational institutions in the past few months. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said a list of new vaccination centres will be ready on Monday. “We will start 200 new vaccination centres from Tuesday,” Mr. Bedi said. Over 45 schools and colleges had been used as vaccination centres. Owing to the reopening of schools, the civic body had to change the venue. “The Corporation has started conducting vaccination camps at private buildings. But residents of other apartment complexes are usually not informed and allowed inside such premises,” said Chidambara Perumal, resident of Padi Kuppam Road, Anna Nagar. On Sunday, 31,636 residents in the 15 zones received doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Ambattur zone registered the largest number of vaccination on Sunday. Manali reported the lowest number.

30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. to reconsider norms for opening ration shops||The Tamil Nadu government has decided to reconsider the norms for opening fair price shops. A seven-member committee has been formed. Headed by the Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, the committee consists of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, the Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, the nominee of the Department of Finance, the Tiruchi Collector, and the Joint Commissioner of Land Administration. The secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, Tiruchi, is the non-official member. There are two special invitees: the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and the Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women. The committee has been given three months to submit its report, according to a Government Order issued last week. According to the policy note of the Food and Civil Supplies Department placed in the Assembly recently, the number of fair price shops is 35,296, most of which are being run by cooperative institutions. After the DMK assumed office on May 7, about 3.38 lakh cards had been issued till July 31. At present, the total number of cards stands at 2.13 crore, including 2.09 crore cards eligible for rice. Broadly, there are two reasons for the government’s decision. Urbanisation, horizontal expansion of towns, the increasing application of technology and the changes in the population density constitute the primary reason. Secondly, the norms do not allow more fair price shops to be opened, though the number of cards is going up with the population increase. The recent developments such as biometric authentication and card portability under One Nation One Ration Card also have a bearing on the system. A fair price shops handles an average of 1,500 cards. In several cases, the number goes up to 2,000; in a handful of cases, it is even 3,000. Likewise, the shops have been located in such a manner that the cardholders need not travel beyond 1.5 km. There are around 3,550 mobile shops to meet the requirements of people in far-flung and hilly areas, and these shops are invariably attached to full-time shops. As for the proposed reorganisation, an official says there are full-time shops having only 200 cards, whereas some part-time shops handle 500 cards. The coverage in the hilly and tribal areas requires revisiting the guidelines. Another official says the number of shops is sufficient to meet the growing demand, and only some shops are likely to be relocated. T. Sadagopan, a consumer activist, feels the government should make public its plan and seek the views of experts and consumer organisations. As the government relies on the ration card database for administering welfare schemes, people feel compelled to seek the cards, thus creating the need perpetually for opening shops. Unless there is any change in the government’s position, the demand for more shops will always exist.  The number of fair price shops is 35,296, most of which are being run by cooperative institutions||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-to-reconsider-norms-for-opening-ration-shops/article36173186.ece
30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC commutes death sentence||The Madras High Court has commuted to life, the death sentence imposed on a former professor of business administration for having murdered his wife at an apartment in Anna Nagar here on December 16, 2012. He had smashed her head with a mortar and then slit her throat with a kitchen knife following a domestic quarrel. A Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and R.N. Manjula found the convict V. Kannan, now 50, guilty of having committed the ghastly crime but did not find it to be a rarest of rare case warranting capital punishment. Terming it to be a run-of-the-mill case, the judges said it did not warrant the convict to be sent to the gallows. “It has not been demonstrated to us that Kannan is addicted to crime and that he is a menace to society, thereby ruling out any possibility of reformation,” the Bench said while passing common orders on a statutory reference made by the trial court as well as an independent criminal appeal preferred by the convict. The judges said the convict had killed his wife when their 13-year-old daughter was asleep. Thereafter, he called his father in Salem. Rajagopal, in turn, took the assistance of his tenants to reach the spot and on the way, they informed the police. During the course of trial, the convict’s father turned hostile. The convict, in turn, accused Rajagopal of having murdered his wife when she resisted his sexual overtures. Holding that the trial court had rejected such accusation, the Bench said the testimony of the convict’s daughter went directly against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-commutes-to-life-death-sentence-imposed-on-professor/article36173530.ece

In a letter to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Confederation’s president D.S.

The panel had recommended that just as the area of Hyderabad and Bengaluru was in the range of 650 sq km to 700 sq km, Chennai should have an area of 800 sq km, comprising Ambattur, Avadi, Tiruvottiyur, Kathivakkam, Madhavaram, Alandur, Pallavaram, Tambaram and town panchayats and villages. Low ranking Despite being an old municipal corporation, Chennai was ranked 15 at the all-India level in terms of its size. He pointed out that in 2011, before the local body elections, the area of Chennai was increased to 426 sq km, by taking under its fold Tiruvottiyur, Kathivakkam, Madhavaram, Alandur and Ambattur. The previous AIADMK regime had made Avadi a municipal corporation. If it was not possible to expand the area of the Chennai Corporation to 800 sq km, the government should at least bring Tambaram, Pallavaram, Pammal, Anakapathur and Sembakkam under the jurisdiction of the Greater Chennai Corporation. Only then the areas would get the civic infrastructure comparable to that of Chennai and have officers who could plan and execute long-term projects, Mr. Sivasamy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-body-seeks-expansion-of-greater-chennai-corporation-area/article36173162.ece

30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two years on, Avadi remains a corporation only in name: residents||The residents of Avadi had lots of hopes when the State government announced the upgrading of the municipality to corporation in June 2019. Two years later, the residents are disappointed that little has changed in the town. Poor roads, delay in the implementation of underground drainage system, absence of flood mitigation measures and poor conservancy operations continue in the area. A. Dharanitharan, a resident of TNHB tenement in Avadi, said except for change in the name from special municipality to corporation, nothing much had changed in the living condition, particularly the civic developments of road, water and other amenities. He criticised the State government for not including Poonamallee, Thiruverkadu, Thiruninravur and Nemilichery in the Avadi Corporation. Only by adding more localities, as had been done in the case of the Tambaram Corporation being formed now, the civic body would get better fund allocation, he added. Social activist T. Sadagopan said the failure of the State government to appoint an IAS officer to manage the affairs of the Avadi Corporation reflected lack of seriousness with which Avadi municipality was upgraded to a corporation. He said several civic projects had been pending for more than two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-years-on-avadi-remains-a-corporation-only-in-name-residents/article36173165.ece

30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Temporary leave to be made easy for Goondas Act detainees||In a decision favouring prisoners’ rights in Tamil Nadu, authorities have decided to amend a provision of the Goondas Act, 1982, to ease the procedure to grant temporary leave to detenus to attend funerals of close relatives. Section 15 of the Act will be amended to delegate powers to an authority at the district level. A meeting of the Committee for Revision of Criminal Rules of Practice of the High Court of Madras, chaired by Justice P.N. Prakash and held last month, resolved that the Home Department take steps for the amendment. So far, relatives of detenus had to approach either the Principal Bench or Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court with a habeas corpus petition or apply for temporary leave through prison officials. The process invariably took a long time. Pending the amendment, the Home Department has formulated a new procedure for handling such requests. Henri Tiphagne, Madurai-based human rights activist and executive director of People’s Watch, welcomed the decision. “This is a humanitarian decision taken by the judges and I only hope that the prison authorities, too, have the humanitarian spirit because most often, we see cases in which authorities delay the process.” The stop-gap procedure should not keep powers with the Home Department but grant them to the DIG of the range concerned, he said. Concurring with him was human rights activist and advocate V. Kannadasan. “This is a major decision that would strengthen the prisoners’ rights. This should be expanded to under-trial and remand prisoners,” he said. If deaths occurred on Fridays or at weekends, detenus could not approach courts, Mr. Kannadasan said. He called for a mechanism to deal with holidays and special occasions when courts did not function. A notification setting forth the temporary procedure was issued by the Home Department on August 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temporary-leave-to-be-made-easy-for-detainees-under-goondas-act/article36173143.ece

30 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Persons should undergo check-up a month after recovering from COVID’||It is better for all those who recovered from COVID-19 to undergo a thorough health check-up one month after their recovery, said R. Anantharaman, senior consultant interventional cardiologist, Kauvery Hospital, Chennai. Addressing a webinar organised as part of The Hindu ’s Wellness Series on “Advancements in Cardiac Therapy: Implications During COVID-19” in association with Kauvery Hospital, he said correlations between severity and possibility of post-COVID-19 complications were hard to arrive at. “We have seen cases where patients with very mild COVID-19 developed severe complications later. One particular patient developed blood clots in arteries in many places in the body even though he recovered from COVID-19 with very mild symptoms,” he said. Therefore it was important for everyone recovering from COVID-19 to undergo a medical check-up. M. Rajendran, consultant interventional cardiologist, Kauvery Hospital, Salem, said despite several challenges faced during initial days of COVID-19, hospitals had established thorough protocols to treat patients amidst the pandemic. The public should not hesitate from visiting hospitals and accessing timely medical care due to fear of COVID-19. He pointed out that even in tier-2 cities like Salem, there was a significant spurt in patients reporting with cardiac illnesses after the second wave of the pandemic. Latest technology The doctors said that several cutting edge technologies were now available for the patients, which enabled better treatment for cardiac illnesses with minimum hospitalisation. Dr. Anantharaman highlighted in particular the laser coronary angioplasty treatment, which he said was available in southern India only at Kauvery Hospital at the moment. Dr. Rajendran spoke about optical coherence tomography (OCT) diagnostic technology that facilitated the execution of angioplasties in a precise manner. Both the doctors stressed on the importance of vaccination. “Cardiac patients in particular should get vaccinated and not listen to unnecessary rumours that create fears about vaccination,” Dr. Anantharaman added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-should-undergo-check-up-one-month-after-recovering-from-covid-19/article36173164.ece

Stalin over the adoption in the Assembly of a special resolution that called for the repeal of the farm laws. In a statement, he said the DMK and its allies had not stated which parts of the laws had affected the farmers. “The parts affecting the farmers should have been debated in the House and an amendment sought. Opposing the laws in their entirety amounts to betrayal of farmers.” The resolution that went through on Saturday was eyewash, similar to what was done in the States under Congress rule, he said. While the Chief Minister had said the resolution was adopted to fulfil the DMK’s election promise, what had happened to the party’s promise to get NEET cancelled, Mr. Annamalai asked. “You have not got exemption from NEET, and only students have suffered by trusting your promise.” The BJP president pointed out that the DMK’s manifesto for the 2016 election had promised a new policy for the sale of farm produce and the elimination of middlemen and its manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha election had vowed to implement the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee’s recommendations. “What you stated in the manifestos is getting fulfilled through the farm laws. Why are you opposing it? This shows you want to blindly oppose [the policies of] Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.

30 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Majority of industrial workers take COVID-19 vaccination||With higher allocation of vaccines to industries, majority of the workers are likely to have received at least one dose of the vaccine against COVID-19. District Industries Centre (DIC) General Manager B. Karthigaivasan said the DIC had received requests from industrial associations and industries for nearly 70,000 vaccine doses. “We had assessed that the district had nearly 4.5 lakh industrial workers. We (the DIC) had given vaccine doses to cover nearly Rs. 1.8 lakh workers. Apart from these, the industries had procured directly from the Health Department and also from private hospitals. So a large number of workers were covered. Of the total requests that we got, nearly 90 % say that they have completed the vaccination,” he said. Most of the requirements were now from the micro units. If there were a few more camps for micro units, they would also be covered. President of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association M.V. Ramesh Babu said the association so far conducted camps and vaccinated 11,000 people. “We will organise another camp on Monday and cover another 2,000 people. With this, we have covered almost our entire requirement.

Sources in the Department said the tusker was spotted with a large cyst on its right hind leg with a white spot on it. The staff were yet to have a closer look at the bulge and check whether pus was oozing from it. They said the elephant was having a few lumps on its body including one on the right foreleg. An official from the Department told The Hindu that different teams were formed to monitor the elephant in Mettupalayam and Sirumugai forest ranges. The elephant was remaining in forest areas of the two ranges during the day and entering human habitations at night. According to the officer, tracking the elephant during the day in interior forest parts was challenging. The frontline staff of the Department shot a few videos of the tusker when it crossed Kotagiri Road which criss-crosses Mettupalayam and Sirumugai forest ranges. The officer said that the Department was yet to seek the help of a veterinarian to assess the cyst on the elephant. Meanwhile, a section of nature enthusiasts have alleged that pellets fired from air rifles and firecrackers hurled at the elephant could have led to infection under its skin leading to pus formation. Though the Department had planned to radio-collar the tusker for study purposes, it operation was dropped temporarily due to practical difficulties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wild-tusker-baahubali-moves-with-inflamed-cyst/article36173182.ece

30 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Negligence led to fatal accident, says Minister||The contractor’s failure to follow safety measures led to the death of a worker engaged in the lifting of a concrete girder for the elevated highway on New Natham Road here on Saturday, Public Works Department Minister E.V. Velu said on Sunday. After inspecting the site along with Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, Mr. Velu said a team of experts from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchi, would hold an inquiry. JMC, the Mumbai-based construction company which is executing the work, had appointed a contractor to ensure safety at the worksite. But no site engineer was present when the 120- tonne girder was lifted. “Only two workers had taken up the work using a hydraulic jack based on an advanced technology without being supervised by the site engineer,” Mr. Velu said, doubting the capacity of the device. “...a hydraulic jack of higher capacity should have been used,” he said. The hose got snapped from the jack leading to the accident. Either the hose would not have been properly fixed or its thread would have worn out, he said. Based on the report from the team of experts, the Collector would take action against the contractors through the National Highways Authority of India, which is executing the work. The construction of the elevated highway, stretching 7.3 km from Chokkikulam to Chettikulam, began in November 2018. The Collector has ordered suspension of the work till the inquiry is completed. The police have booked three officials of the construction firm, Pradeep Kumar Jain, Sathyendar Varma and Baskar, for negligence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/negligence-led-to-fatal-accident-says-minister/article36173151.ece

30 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Waterbodies around U.T. badly in need of rejuvenation||During the French regime, the Aayi Kulam in Muthurayarpalayam brimmed with water and was associated with Puducherry’s drinking water map. Now the tank lies in a pathetic state overrun by the wild growth of weeds and bushes. The pond’s size has shrunk over the years, owing to waste being dumped by residential buildings in the vicinity and sewerage lines directly emptied into the water body. This is not the present state of only one pond. Several waterbodies across Puducherry that formed the lifeline of groundwater sources in the coastal town face a similar situation. While the Oussudu lake, which was renovated alongside Aayi’s sister Oosi and the Bahour tank, the second largest tank in Puducherry, are functional now, they have been shrinking in size due to a mix of anthropogenic activities, including illegal fishing. While the government has erected iron fences on one side of the Aayi Kulam, authorities have been turning a blind eye to its rampant destruction. Legend has it that King Krishnadeva Raya (A.D. 1509-1530) of the Vijayanagar Empire, while on a visit to the house of Uiyyakunda Viswaraya Mudaliar in Villianur, mistook the house of Aayi, a courtesan, for a temple and bowed before it. When he was told that it was a Devadasi’s house, he ordered its demolition. Aayi pleaded with the king and decided to dig a pond there to quench the thirst of people. This tank later served the purpose of providing drinking water to the entire town during the French regime. According to T.P. Raghunath, Svarnim Puducherry, Sri Aurobindo Society, and member of Alliance for Good Governance (AGG), “Puducherry had a beautiful example of the Tank Rehabilitation Project Puducherry (TRPP), where the government-society-tank association partnership worked excellently in both of its phases between 1999-2004, which was first funded by the European Union, followed by the Puducherry government in 2004 to 2008.” Overlooked stakeholders “After lots of efforts from the tank associations and the civil society organisations, the TRPP was again reconstituted in 2013. But unfortunately, while forming the committee, the role of the main stakeholders like community-based tank associations and civil society organisations were completely overlooked,” he said. So, without a plan for sustainability, whatever project implemented would not transform the waterbodies into community-owned and -managed systems as they used to be in the past, Mr. Raghunath pointed out. Puducherry had 87 irrigation tanks and 1,000 ponds when the French handed over the territory to Government of India. However, there was no clarity on how many were surviving, he said. The French had an efficient management system which was subsequently institutionalised as the Syndicate Agricole and Caisse Commune System carried out through participatory processes. However, in the 40 years since the management of waterbodies was entrusted to the Public Works Department, three tanks had been completely encroached and urbanised beyond retrieval, said V. Chandrasekhar, president of the Bangaru Vaickal Neeradhara Amaippu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/waterbodies-around-ut-badly-in-need-of-rejuvenation/article36173527.ece

The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and lack of announcements from the State government regarding Vinayaka Chathurthi celebrations has left artisans involved in making Ganesha idols worried as they haven’t received any orders for large-sized idols this year. Artisans are hopeful that they would at least be able to get rid of stock made last year as sales was affected due to COVID-19 restrictions. Artisans involved in making the idols said that they made only idols of smaller size in negligible quantities this year as the stock from last year was almost remaining intact. An artisan from Rajasthan who has been making a living here said, “we are trying to sell off previous year’s stock only as due to COVID-19 restrictions, we earned nothing last year. Almost the entire stock is intact. We did not make any large-sized statues nor new idols this year and very few people are turning up to buy the idols. Our family is almost starving.” Sonu, another Rajasthani artisan who has been living here for five years, said that they are only selling statues sized between 1-4 ft, ranging from Rs. 250 and highest up to Rs. 4,000. He added that the sales have been dull but is hopeful that it would improve as the festival nears. A.

Its leader A Sethupathi said “when I met organic farming crusader Nammalvar in 2001, he had asked me to search for the native seed varieties in and around Madurai region just like how the delta region managed to find 170 native varieties and marketed them globally. Though my groundwork began a long time back, I started doing the fieldwork, with the help of the farmers in our federation, from the beginning of this year.” After a lot of travelling, they managed to spot and collect 29 samples of native paddy seeds like Thillai Nayagam, Kurangu Samba, Aanai Komban, Thidagaal, Varapu Kudainjaan and Kuzhiyadichaan in the region. The federation is in the process of retrieving some native palm seed, oil seed and cotton varieties, he said. At an event to re-introduce these seed varieties, they were distributed to interested farmers who could cultivate them and bring a produce of about 2 kg or more, which can be used for marketing the paddy variety on a larger scale. The government will help the organic farmers to improve their produce, the Collector said. He said that he was happy that as per the request of many people in the region, the Tamil Nadu government had recently announced the establishment of an agriculture college in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-asked-to-preserve-native-paddy-varieties/article36173284.ece

30 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Trickster nabbed||Vasudevan, 34, son of Krishnan, of Sainikpuri, Kandi Konda in Hyderabad, who was looking for a prospective bride on a matrimony site, lost Rs. 80,000 to a woman in Thoothukudi while they were engaged in a conversation over their mobile phones. Geetha, 36, wife of Thangavelu of Nalu Maavadi in Thoothukudi district, was arrested on charges of cheating and impersonation, among others. The Superintendent of Police S Jeyakumar directed the Cyber Crime Police to register a case following a complaint. According to the petitioner, he had registered his name in a private matrimony website seeking bride. He had chosen an alliance, which claimed as Divya, 28, after browsing the posts. They accepted, in principle, for marriage after preliminary talks. They shared their mobile numbers. Even as Vasudevan and Divya were talking over the phone frequently, on two occasions, i.e., - July 8 and August 4, she told Vasudevan about an emergency financial requirement for her friend, who was hospitalised. Immediately, Vasudevan transferred Rs. 80,000 to the bank account number given by Divya. The mobile number of Divya was either switched off or not reachable after some time. Suspecting a foul play, Vasudevan preferred an online complaint with the cyber wing police in Thoothukudi. Investigations by DSP Illangovan and Inspector Sivasankaran revealed that there was nobody in the name of Divya in the address furnished by him. When the police checked the bank details, they found that Geetha had posted some woman’s profile picture on the matrimony site and played a trick. Police seized four mobile phones and based on her confession, they came to know that she had duped at least 20 people through online. Further investigation is on. In a press release, Mr Jeyakumar appealed to the people not to share personal details such as mobile numbers and bank account details and other identity cards with unknown people, especially, online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trickster-nabbed/article36173281.ece

30 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Newly planned bridge, elevated corridor will be linked, says K. N. Nehru||The new bridge to be built across the Cauvery will have a direct link with the proposed elevated corridor from Odathurai to Kambarasampettai, said Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru. Speaking to reporters after flagging off drinking water rejuvenation and augmentation works to be undertaken at an estimate of Rs. 54.27 crore in the city on Sunday, Mr. Nehru said the existing bridge between Chinthamani and Mambalasalai had served the people for more than 45 years and had weakened mainly due to improper repair and maintenance works. Hence, it had been decided to replace the bridge with a new one. The State Highways would execute the project at a cost of Rs. 86 crore. The Minister said that it had been decided to design the bridge in such a way to link it with the new elevated flyover from Odathurai to Kambarasampettai. Another elevated corridor would come up between the Head Post office and the court on Bharathidasan Road. An announcement to that effect had already been made in the State Assembly. The proposed projects would remove the traffic bottlenecks to an immense extent in the city. The Tiruchi Corporation had initiated steps to prepare a Detailed Project Report for the Integrated Bus Stand at Panchapur on Tiruchi-Madurai highway. A wholesale and retail market would also come up at Panchapur. On drinking water rejuvenation and augmentation works, he said 43,114 households would be benefitted. Drinking water to the length of 103 km would be laid. New overhead tanks would be constructed at Woraiyur, Thennur, Thillai Nagar and Marakkadai. Similarly, the water carrying network to the existing tanks at Rockfort and Keela Chinthamani would be strengthened. Collector S. Sivarasu, Corporation Commissioner P.M.N.

30 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Colleges brace for challenging tasks ahead||Colleges are bracing themselves up for tough tasks ahead in the wake of the Government issuing Standard Operating Procedures and Guidelines for opening of higher educational institutions from the start of September post-lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The vaccination camps in institutions announced by the government have been welcomed by the college heads, since, as per their assessment, not more than 50% of both staff and students have got themselves vaccinated. However, the challenge is in operating the hostels, according to a principal of one of the leading arts and science colleges in the city. Colleges and universities have been asked to reduce the class size to 50% and maintain physical distancing by following the rotational system. “However, the hostel students will have to be accommodated. Leave alone the difficulty in suddently arranging for cooks and helpers, there is no way to cut down the number of students in the hostels,” the college head said. The government has advocated lesser density of students in hostels through encouraging them to stay in houses of relatives in nearby areas. “But, the reality is that relatives have, by and large, become wary of accommodating the students in the current situation. “It is true that students are fatigued due to remaining at home for so long and are longing to get back to the colleges. But, herein lies the trouble. Preventing students from mingling with one another, particularly in hostels, will be a tough proposition," another principal said. The colleges are stated to be on their toes since they will have to identify cooks and helpers to run the hostels within the next few days. There was no way for the colleges to have retained the cooks since the lockdown duration has exceeded well beyond a year. They have gone back to their villages, and are not inclined to come back, say hostel wardens. Nevertheless, teachers have cause for relief since online teaching-learning was never working on desired lines, say college heads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-colleges-brace-for-challenging-tasks-ahead/article36173272.ece

30 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||BJP now has eyes set firmly on 2023 Assembly elections||Close on the heels of ensuring a smooth transfer of power, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has now set its eyes firmly on winning the 2023 Assembly polls in Karnataka. This is evident with the party’s top leaders scheduling a ‘ Chintan Baithak’ , which is a brainstorming session of its think tank, in about a month from now to prepare a road map for its preparations for the elections. Disclosing this to The Hindu , BJP national general secretary and State in-charge Arun Singh said the proposed Baithak would be attended by 30 to 35 prominent leaders to chalk out a plan of action for the party to retain power in 2023. According to him, a prominent constituent of the proposed road map is the need to focus on areas and constituencies where the party has either lost polls or is not strong. “We want to make political inroads into the areas where we are weak, like the Old Mysuru region. This is essential if we have to get a majority in the 2023 polls,” he said. In fact, Mr. Singh has already commenced his efforts to strengthen the party in Old Mysuru region by embarking upon a two-day visit to the region from Monday to interact with party leaders and workers. “I will be touring all such constituencies where the party has lost. I will begin my visit from Mysuru and reach out to all the areas in a phased manner,” he said. He said all the Ministers would be told to tour the districts that do not have political representation in the State Cabinet. Mr. Singh said the party’s central leadership was happy with the performance of new Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai so far. “He is a practical person and has experience too,” Mr. Singh said, noting that the Chief Minister had been told to focus on youth, women, and farmers in particular, apart from making efforts to bring about development of the State. “He will come out with schemes in the above focus areas. He will adopt a three-pronged approach of effectively implementing the schemes taken up by the Union government and of continuing the welfare measures of his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa,” Mr. Singh said. On the role to be played by Mr. Yediyurappa, he said the former Chief Minister would advise the party and help in strengthening its organisation. He added that the veteran would also participate in the proposed Chintan Baithak . Indicating that a ministerial expansion exercise may not happen immediately, he said the focus was on delivering good governance and winning the 2023 polls. He also sought to downplay the episode of Tourism Minister Anand Singh seeking a change in portfolio, saying that he had taken charge of the portfolio allotted to him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-now-has-eyes-set-firmly-on-2023-assembly-elections/article36173125.ece
30 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Has high-speed rail link project been revived?||Is the high-speed rail link project to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) back on the cards? At the inauguration of the extended Purple Line from Mysuru Road to Kengeri on Sunday, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the KIA would be linked with three mass transit networks: suburban rail (Majestic to Devanahalli), Namma Metro (Silk Board to KIA) and a high-speed rail from a city point to the airport. He added that the airport would be unique, as it would have three modes of mass transit. In 2009–10, when the BJP was in power, it attempted to implement the high-speed rail link project from M.G. Road to KIA via Chalukya circle, Hebbal, and Yelahanka. Trains were to operate at a speed of 160 km per hour. However, the ambitious project was subsequently termed “non-feasible” and dropped due to high costs, including that of land acquisition. Instead, Bangalore Metropolitan Rail Corporation Ltd. was asked to develop a metro line to the airport. It is constructing a 55 km-metro line from Central Silk Board to KIA via K.R. Puram and Hebbal under phase II a & b of Namma Metro. Mr. Bommai’s reference to the high-speed rail link caught officials unawares. “I don’t know whether the government wants to revive the project that was shelved earlier. The alignment of the metro line to the KIA is via Hebbal, Jakkur, and Yelahanka, similar to that of the high-speed rail project,” said a senior official. Deadline revision Mr. Bommai said he would be personally overseeing the progress of the mega projects in the city. “I will dedicate my first working hour of the day to supervise the progress of works,” he said. Citizens would also be able to monitor progress of all development works online via a dashboard, which would be operational within 20 days. On implementation of the metro projects under phase II, he said in the next year, a 32-km line would be made operational. He instructed BMRCL to advance the completion of the metro projects taken up under phase II from 2025 to 2024.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/has-high-speed-rail-link-project-been-revived/article36173118.ece
30 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Engineering college fees likely to be hiked this academic year||Engineering students may have to shell out more by way of fees this academic year as the government is considering the demands of private college managements. While the Karnataka Unaided Private Engineering Colleges Association has asked for fees to be increased by around 30%, Karnataka Religious and Linguistic Minority Professional Colleges Association secretary Shafi Ahmed said that colleges under their umbrella have demanded a 25% hike. Sources in the State government said that while they would consider increasing the fees, they would not agree to such a steep increase, especially during the pandemic. “However, as engineering college fees have not been increased over the past few academic years, we are considering increasing them by around 10% this year,” said a source. He added that the Higher Education Department was likely to hold a meeting with college managements during thesecond week of September to hold negotiations so that they could sign a consensual agreement. “Engineering college managements are telling us that while medical and dental college managements were allowed to hike their fees every year, they were not allowed to do so. While their concerns are valid, we cannot afford to allowthem to hike fees by 30%,” said an official. Last academic year, CET students paid Rs. 65,360, while COMED-K students shelled out Rs. 1,43,748. However, in some other colleges, it was Rs. 58,808 for CET students and Rs. 2,01,960 for COMED-K students. The principal of a reputed private engineering college said that engineering colleges that were already struggling with low student strength because of the mushrooming of colleges took a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. “This has forced many colleges to close down. Others are shutting down branches where the demand is low. We are unable to bear the infrastructure costs and pay our teaching and non-teaching staff,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/engineering-college-fees-likely-to-be-hiked/article36173128.ece

While the former Minister R.V.

In the 23-point manifesto, the Congress has promised comprehensive development of the twin cities with introduction of metro rail services for the twin cities. It has also promised reduction in property tax, establishment of modern gymnasiums for men and women in all the wards, a 100-bed hi-tech hospital and renovation of all the government schools in the twin cities.

The police on Sunday handed the youth over to Bangladesh officials on the Petrapole-Benapole checkpost on the India-Bangladesh border, East Godavari Superintendent of Police (SP) M. Ravindranath Babu said. Mr. Ali had spent three years in Rajamahendravaram Central Jail (RCJ) in two terms in two cases including one registered against him for failing to produce travel documents for his visit to India. In 2014, Mr. Ali was taken into custody by the Ravulapalem police. He was sent to RCJ for two years and released in June 2016. Later, the Andhra Pradesh State police attempted to repatriate Mr. Ali but did not get approval from the Ministry of External Affairs (India). The youth had been allowed to stay on the Ravulapalem police station campus and earned a livelihood as a carpenter. In 2018, the youth had damaged a vehicle on the Ravulapalem police station campus and was later sent to RCJ where he spent one year and was released in June 2019.

30 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mangalore University set to open another constituent college||With three of the five existing constituent colleges of Mangalore University awaiting formal approval from the State government, the university is all set to open its sixth constituent college (owned and managed by the university) at Moodbidri in Dakshina Kannada in the academic year 2021-22. Except the two old constituent colleges of the university, one, the University College in Hampankatta and the other, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa College in Madikeri, three constituent colleges, University College at Nelyadi, University College on Mangalagangotri campus and the University Evening College in Hampankatta, which were opened in the recent years, still do not have the formal approval of the government. Of these, the University Evening College and the University College on Mangalagangotri campus are over five years old. The two came into being in the academic year 2015-16 and the college at Nelyadi, which is over three years old, was opened in the academic year 2018-19 when K. Byrappa was the Vice-Chancellor. They do not have permanent faculty, non-teaching staff, their own buildings and other basic amenities. Amid such a scenario, the Syndicate, the highest decision-making body of the university, has agreed to open another constituent college in Moodbidri. A communique from the university said on Sunday that Minister for Higher Education, IT and BT, Science and Technology, Skill Development C.N. Ashwath Narayan will symbolically inaugurate the new constituent college which will be temporarily housed in a school building at Bannadkka, Moodbidri, at a function on the Mangalagangotri campus of the university on Monday. Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya and Registrar (administration) C.K. Kishor Kumar told The Hindu that the statutes of three constituent colleges opened in the recent years are awaiting approval of the State government. The approval is expected within one month, the Vice-Chancellor said. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that temporary teachers, non-teaching staff will be appointed to the new college which will offer BBA, B.Com and BCA courses. The university will have to bear the salaries of temporary staff from its internal resources. It will appoint principals for the colleges at Nelyadi and Moodbidri on temporary basis. A notification for appointment will be issued in a few days. The Registrar (administration) said that the statute of the new college which will come up in Moodbidri is yet to be sent to the government for approval as the Syndicate cleared it only a few days ago. A former president of the Association of Mangalore University College Teachers (AMUCT) Hayavadana Upadhya said that the university should first set its existing constituent colleges in order. Later, it should open new colleges. The three colleges opened in the recent years do not have library and laboratory. It should first appoint permanent faculty, non-teaching staff in those colleges and provide basic infrastructure. Otherwise, the quality of education will suffer. “Opening new colleges just for increasing quantity and by bowing to pressure without focusing on maintaining quality will be an injustice to students,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangalore-university-set-to-open-another-constituent-college/article36173456.ece

30 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Three educational institutions issued notice||Responding to notice served by Dakshina Kannada district administration, three educational institutions in the district have said that they will henceforth strictly comply with the standard operating procedures laid down to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Notice had been issued to Kanachur Institute of Medical Sciences and M.V. Shetty Group of Colleges in Mangaluru taluk and K.V.G. Group of Institutions in Sullia taluk after an inspection by health officials when students, who are in quarantine after their return from Kerala and Maharashtra, were tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 620 students who tested positive in the last 30 days, a majority of them are from these three institutions. District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishor Kumar told The Hindu that these institutions were, among others, not properly quarantining outstation students but allowing them to mix up with other students in canteen and other places. “Therefore, we issued notice and the institutions have written back that they will strictly comply with the norms.” Expressing concern over outstation students with COVID-19 negative certificate testing positive after one week of quarantine, Dr. Kumar, on August 21, wrote to managements of paramedicial, nursing, engineering and dental colleges for strict compliance with protocol. In the letter, Dr. Kumar asked the managements to allow outstation students for physical classes only after they tested negative for COVID-19. The institutions should ensure that students are properly quarantined and food is supplied to their rooms. The institutions have been asked to regularly report to COVID Nodal Officer/ District Disease Surveillance Officer about students testing positive and actions taken. Any non-compliance of these norms will be viewed seriously, the letter stated. Covid Nodal Officer H. Ashok said that paramedical, nursing and other professional colleges have been asked to carry out tests for students at the laboratories of private medical colleges they are associated with.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-educational-institutions-issued-notice/article36173458.ece

30 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||NEP: Questions raised over revised curriculum||The State government’s recent guidelines on the formulation of the new curriculum, sought to be introduced under the New Education Policy 2020, have been questioned for its “hurried” implementation as well as the proposed replacement of the “diversity” in the curricula of different universities with a “common” curriculum. Retired professor of Management, University of Mysore, B. Shivaraj, who had also served as acting Vice-Chancellor, in a statement said the State government issued a Government Order on August 13 directing universities and colleges to comply with the new guidelines on model curriculum and constituted faculty-wise committees of academics. But, the deadline for preparing the curriculum has been set for September 6, he regretted. He criticised the Karnataka State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) and Higher Education Department for the “hurried blanket imposition of a curriculum on a wide spectrum of institutions and heterogeneous student community, disregarding the principles of curriculum planning, designing and implementation…”. Claiming that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had warned against too much interference by the State government in the implementation of NEP, Dr. Shivaraj said NEP 2020 was not meant to replace the “diversity” in universities’ curricula by a “school-type” common curriculum. He said the GO had usurped the powers vested with the universities under the provisions of Karnataka State Universities Act 2000. “By ignoring the provisions of the Act with regard to implementation of the new curriculum, and without carrying out due process of framing course curriculum as required under the Act [vetting the curriculum through Boards of studies, faculty, academic council and final approval by the Chancellor], the government’s action in issuing a GO to hurry through the implementation is a negation of the principles of academic freedom and creativity of universities,” Dr. Shivaraj said. He also slammed the proposal to notify only the first year’s syllabus for nowand questioned how the student can decide on the course based on limited information. “Unless the entire scheme, including syllabus, assessment, exit and entry procedures for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, is published and comments, criticisms and suggestions are heard and incorporated, the proposed scheme must not be implemented,” he said. Dr. Shivaraj urged the government to postpone the implementation of the revised model course curriculum to next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-questions-raised-over-revised-curriculum/article36173478.ece
30 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru gang rape: Five accused remanded in police custody||The five accused in the Mysuru gang rape who were arrested in Tamil Nadu were on Sunday produced before a judge, who remanded them in police custody. Commissioner of Police Chandragupta said they have been given 10 days of police custody and the accused were being questioned and interrogated for additional information pertaining to the crime. The complaint has been registered in the Alanahalli jurisdictional police station, but multiple teams comprising officers drawn from different stations have been roped in to investigate various angles, given the sensitivity and the heinousnessof the case. Though one of the accused has claimed to be a minor, the police said it had to be corroborated through other means. Besides, there is an amendment to the law governing juveniles following the Nirbhaya incident. The amendment provides for trial of the juvenile in the 16-18 age group as an adult, depending on the severity of the crime. Though the local police have gone by the statement of the complainant and a friend of the victim that one person was absconding, the Tiruppur police have stated two persons involved in the crime were on the run and a search was on to nab them. Meanwhile, police patrolling around the Chamundi foothills has been intensified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-gang-rape-accused-in-police-custody/article36173126.ece
30 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Kengeri metro line to benefit commuters from Mysuru||The benefits of the 7.5 km metro purple line from Mysuru Road to Kengeri station will extend to people travelling from Mysuru to Bengaluru also as one can reach Majestic and other parts of the capital without hassles. The new line was inaugurated on Sunday and commuters from Mysuru travelling by road or train to Bengaluru can now terminate their journey at Kengeri itself and opt for the metro service. The metro station is just a few steps away from the Kengeri bus terminal. This will provide significant reduction in commuting time to reach interiors of Bengaluru as the traffic from Kengeri and beyond tends to clog the road and vehicles move at a snail’s pace during peak and even non-peak hours. “During peak hours the journey from Kengeri to Byappanahalli takes about 2 hours by bus or car and is taxing and does not facilitate same-day return’’, according to Ravi, a former railway employee and a frequent traveller from Mysuru to Byappanahalli. But with the inauguration of the new metro service from Kengeri people can board the metro and breeze their way into Bengaluru, he said. People who wish to use their private vehicles but loathe the drive inside Bengaluru also can terminate their journey at Kengeri, park their vehicle and take the metro which will be more convenient and save time, said Mr. Ravi. The same benefits can accrue to train passengers as well in case they terminate their journey at Kengeri station. At times trains from Mysuru tend to get stranded at Kengeri for 20 to 25 or even 30 minutes as the platforms that receive trains from Mysuru tend to be occupied by other out-bound trains. Until the platform is free the trains at Kengeri do not receive the green signal to proceed resulting in enormous waste of time. Though the journey from Mysuru to Kengeri tends to be hassle-free by both train and bus or car, it is the drive beyond Kengeri that adds to the commuting time. The new metro service has the potential to reduce the hassle, provided people opt for multi-mode transportation. Sources in the railways said multi-modal integration is vital for the benefits of metro to reach users from Mysuru and it was now imperative for more trains to be provided stoppages at Jnanabharathi Halt. The Jnanabharathi metro station is next to Jnanabharathi Halt station but only two MEMU services from Mysuru to Bengaluru stop here. If additional trains are provided stoppages at Jnanabharathi Halt, it can help decongestion at KSR Bengaluru Station and also save lot of time for commuters from Mysuru, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kengeri-metro-line-to-benefit-commuters-from-mysuru/article36173476.ece

To keep speeches to the point, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar has started to keep a bell that he strikes when any leader or party worker launches a long-winded speech. He used the bell(in picture)at a meeting of party coordinators called to discuss programmes taken up in the pandemic days. At the meeting, all coordinators were also given forms to write their views on the style of functioning of Block Congress presidents, legislators, visits of party leaders to residences of families whose members succumbed to COVID-19, and the party’s work during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The comments written in the form were kept a secret and would be known only to him, the coordinators, and the All-India Congress Committee general secretary, said Mr. Shivakumar. He was seen striking the bell a few times asking the workers to distribute the forms as well. KPCC working president Ramalinga Reddy too tried his hand at the bell to ensure silence is maintained in the room.   Minister for Ecology, Environment and Tourism B.S. Anand Singh(in picture), who sulked over being allocated “low-profile” portfolios, assumed charge of the departments last week. He said he bowed to the orders of seniors and actually expressed his happiness with the departments given to him. Mr. Singh insisted that he did not seek “high-profile” portfolios for monetary gains. He claimed that it was all a matter of trust. “Someone promised one thing and delivered another. Then I was naturally hurt,” Mr. Singh said. He, however, added that it was a closed chapter now.   Soon after taking charge, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai(in picture)asked government offices not to spend money on garlands and fruit baskets, but to gift books during ceremonies. He also banned rituals and ceremonies such as guard of honour by the police for visiting dignitaries. During a recent trip to North Karnataka districts, he received the guard of honour in Vijayapura and Belagavi. But he reprimanded N. Satish Kumar, Inspector General of Police, for the ceremonies and said they were unnecessary. The Chief Minister’s demeanour was markedly different when politicians came to see him. Legislators who came to see him in Belagavi, Vijayapura, and Bagalkot invariably brought flowers. He accepted them with smiles and chatted with them courteously. At least on three occasions, when Ministers and MLAs handed him huge bouquets in Belagavi, he did not object. There was neither a mild reminder of his strict order nor a polite nudge against the practice.

30 August 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Groyne fields making good progress||The construction of groyne fields (pulimuttu) in Kattoor is making good progress. In a bid to tackle sea erosion, 34 breakwaters with a total length of 3.16 km are being built from Omanapuzha to Vazhakoottam pozhi. Officials said the groyne fields were constructed using tetrapod. “Laying of granite stones of different sizes has been started. Placing of tetrapods weighing five and two tonnes above the stones will begin next week,” said Haran Babu, deputy general manager, Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation. Groynes are constructed 100 metres apart. Each groyne will have a length of 40 metres from shore into the sea and 20 metres width. A total of 23,000 tetrapods of two tonnes and 4,000 tetrapods of five tonnes will be used for the purpose. Tetrapods are used as an alternative for granite boulders, which were widely used for constructing breakwaters. However, an acute shortage of granite in the State forced the authorities to look for alternatives. Officials said that tetrapods would minimise the use of granite in the construction of breakwaters. October 2020 The construction of the groyne fields, which began in October 2020, is expected to benefit 160 families directly and more than 600 families indirectly. Besides, around 20 hectare of land could be protected from coastal erosion. The project being implemented at a cost of Rs. 49.90 crore is funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The State government last year decided to establish 114 groyne fields at five places off the Alappuzha coast at a cost of Rs. 184 crore under the KIIFB, after sea erosion became severe in coastal areas of the Alappuzha district, especially during the monsoon season. The other four groyne fields will be built in Haripad, Ambalappuzha and Alappuzha Assembly constituencies. The structures will directly benefit 625 families and between 1,500 and 2,000 families indirectly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/groyne-fields-making-good-progress/article36173428.ece

The piling work of the Pallathuruthy West bridge, near Kaithavana, which was demolished earlier this month, is making slow progress. The reconstruction of the two bridges is expected to be completed in three months. Authorities last month imposed a total ban on the movement of goods and heavy vehicles as part of reconstructing the 24.16 km road connecting the Alappuzha and Kottayam districts. Although officials maintain that alternative measures have been put in place for vehicular traffic, the traffic chaos on the stretch has deepened following the demolition of the bridge at Ponga.

30 August 2021||Idukki,KERALA||Sugarcane farmers return to traditional crop||A few of the sugarcane farmers led by Jagadeeswaran of Koodayayal have harvested the traditional crop varieties of CO 413 which have almost disappeared from the sugarcane fields in Marayur. Mr. Jagadeeswaran cultivated it in nearly two acres of land after developing the ratooning for three years. He said that this variety was found more yielding and is more adaptable to the change in climate and soil condition.They were earlier cultivating it and even if there was shortage of water, its survival rate was high compared to the improved versions of sugarcane varieties that were introduced later. He said that it yielded three times more than the hybrid varieties after one or two cropping. With the change in the climate and shortage of water, the yield of the new varieties was found less, he said. It needed a growth period of 12 to 14 months compared to the nine to 10 month growth period of other varieties. One of the main features, the farmer claimed, was that it needed less fertilisation and much more rationing (growth of the new plant from the portion left beneath the soil after the cane is harvested). The sugarcane fields have to be cleared for new seedling after three to four ratoons in the case of the other varieties. He said that the Ayurvedic pharmaceutical companies were the main buyers of the traditional crop varieties and they preferred it for the purity of jaggery. He said on Sunday that a few portions of the sugarcane was already harvested and it was stopped due to rainfall. The harvesting will be continued in a day or two, he added. He developed the ratooning after a long search for collecting a few cane stumps. Selvin Mariappan, chef of Mapco (Marayur Agriculture Produce Company), one of the three agencies entrusted with the marketing of Marayur Jaggery after it received the GI (geographical indication) tag said that 20 farmers have already cultivated it thanks to the effort of Mr. Jagadeeswaran. Mr. Mariappan, himself a sugarcane farmer, said that they had very good quality jaggery from the traditional crop variety. It was aimed at further enhancing the quality of Marayur Jaggery. He said that the CO 423 varieties were found to be more adaptable to the problems like water shortage and pest attack in addition to more ratooning though it needed a long growth period. He said that Mapco is planning to supply 85,000 seedlings of it to the farmers. There are 9,000 sugarcane farmers in Marayur now, he added. Common variety Marayur Agriculture Officer N. Priya said that CO 8632 is the common variety now cultivated by the farmers in Marayur. The traditional varieties of crops should be preserved. She said that she was aware of the old variety now being cultivated by a few farmers. The researchers in the sugarcane field had however pointed out that CO 413 contains more fiber than the improved varieties introduced later. However, the efforts of the farmers in moving to the old variety is appreciated, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sugarcane-farmers-return-to-traditional-crop/article36173441.ece

30 August 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Pining for a roof over their heads||The fear of being trampled upon by elephants lurks in the minds of Shantha Karikan, 60, and her family members from the Paniya community living in a shed on the Aralam farm. Just a few metres away is her unfinished house, the construction of which began a few years ago with Rs. 60,000 provided under the Tribal Rehabilitation Development Mission. But the work was suspended midway, as the authorities did not release the remaining funds. Despite knocking on all doors, her pleas fell on deaf ears. She is not the only tribesperson awaiting funds to get a house constructed in Block 9 of the Aralam farm. Several others who reportedly refused to hand over construction work to contractors are facing a similar ordeal, and they continue to stay either in sheds or dilapidated houses constructed by Nirmithi Kendra. Shantha is one among the few Paniya community members who moved from Pookund colony, near the Aralam sanctuary, to settle in Aralam farm during the tribal agitation in 2004-05. “We had received patta after a prolonged struggle. But there are no basic amenities, and the absence of proper houses and constant threats from marauding elephants have made life difficult,” she lamented. “Every time we meet promoters, Tribal Resettlement and Development Mission [TRDM] site manager, and Tribal Department officials seeking release of funds, we feel neglected. They say the money is yet to be sanctioned,” she rued. P.P. Krishnan, another tribesperson, has received no money from the department, and he has a debt of Rs. 4 lakh after he started constructing a house. He too refused to let contractors do the work. As a result, he was yet to be granted the amount, even the promised Rs. 6 lakh despite being included in the LIFE project, he said. Many tribal families are refusing to hand over work to contractors, as their work has been found substandard. “Contractors use poor quality material to construct even a small house, while we can construct bigger houses using better quality material at the same cost,” he explained. Interestingly, those who agreed to engage contractors were given the entire amount, he claimed. “Officials seem to be hand in glove with contractors and are swindling money earmarked for the welfare of tribespeople,” he alleged. Similarly, Nirmala Narayanan is yet to receive the Rs. 3.5 lakh sanctioned by the government. The authorities have paid only Rs. 2.10 lakh, and they have declined to pay the rest citing various reasons. “I have taken a bank loan and some money from Kudumbashree. I have to pay back Rs. 10,000 every month. If the authorities issued the amount, I could finish the work,” she said. Meanwhile, Scheduled Tribes Development Department project officer S. Santhosh Kumar reiterated that all applications were being cleared. He informed that the government had already sanctioned Rs. 75 lakh for the housing project. Probe sought However, tribal associations demanded an inquiry into the matter. Sreeraman Koyyon, president, Adivasi Dalit Munnet Samiti, alleged that there was large-scale corruption, and that the money allotted for tribal welfare was being diverted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pining-for-a-roof-over-their-heads/article36173514.ece

30 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Political space abuzz with a century-old rebellion||The Malabar Rebellion of 1921 continues to set the political agenda of the State with major political parties joining the debate and planning campaigns on the controversial issue.  The Hindu has earlier reported that a subcommittee of the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) had recommended the exclusion of the martyrs of the rebellion from the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle. ‘Distorting history’ The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)], the Communist Party of India (CPI), and the Congress have criticised ‘attempts to distort the history of the freedom movement’ by excluding the martyrs of the 1921 rebellion from it. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan gave an impetus to the debate by describing rebellion leader Variamkunnath Kunhamad Haji as a freedom fighter. He also criticised the attempts to ‘de-recognise the agrarian revolution’ led by Haji. Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, in a Facebook post, accused Mr. Vijayan of distorting the history of freedom struggle to ‘justify and praise Hindu genocide.’ He criticised the CPI(M) for ‘attempting to divide the people for the party to stay in power.’ The CPI(M) will organise a year-long campaign to mark the 100th year of the uprising, which coincides with the 75 anniversary of the country’s Independence, said A. Vijayaraghavan, the acting State secretary of the party. A public meeting will be held at Kottakkunnu in Malappuram on September 4 in which the Chief Minister will participate online, he said. V.D. Satheesan, Leader of the Opposition, said a meeting of the UDF will shortly chart out its campaign to commemorate the movement. The Khilafat Movement, which was part of the freedom struggle, had the support of Mahatma Gandhi. Attempts to tamper with the history of the freedom movement will be resisted, he said. The Indian Union Muslim League will launch a series of programmes, including the re-enactment of a march from Kottakkal to Thirurangadi on Monday, according to its general secretary P.M.A. Salam. The CPI State council of September 8 will give shape to its campaign, said party leader Binoy Viswam, MP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/political-space-abuzz-with-a-century-old-rebellion/article36173395.ece
30 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||KSRTC to get indigenously assembled sleeper buses||The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is gearing up to operate eight air-conditioned sleeper buses of Volvo that conform to Euro-VI emission norms — the first of their kind to be assembled fully in India by a bus manufacturer — on inter-State routes where there is stiff competition from the Karnataka State RTC and private luxury buses. “The buses that will be manufactured at Volvo’s Bengaluru unit and estimated to cost around Rs. 1.50 crore apiece, are expected to be introduced in November. The KSRTC was hitherto operating a limited number of AC and semi-sleeper buses (those having recliner seats) to Bengaluru, although its Karnataka counterpart was operating many more, including sleeper buses, to Kerala,” sources said. Each bus that the KSRTC intends to procure will have 39 sleeper berths, with charger sockets in all berths, said Sibi Mathai, an entrepreneur whose firm maintains the premium buses of the KSRTC and many other RTCs. “They will also come with fire detection and suppression system [FDSS] and CCTVs at the rear - facing interiors and exteriors. Their light-weight body and BS VI engine will provide higher fuel efficiency,” he said. It will be the first time in India that a bus manufacturer is building sleeper class body. The body building job is generally done by other firms, he said. Reining in high fares The KSRTC’s sleeper buses are expected to rein in the exorbitant fares (often near the airline fare) which private bus operators levy on commuters, especially during festival seasons when demand rises. In addition, the agency is expected to roll out 20 semi-premium AC buses that conform to BS VI norms on inter-district routes, for which two prominent manufacturers are in the fray. The existing fleet of 190 low-floor buses were not designed for inter-district use. The procurement of another fleet of 72 non-AC buses, each priced at Rs. 35 lakh, is expected to follow suit. This is apart from a dedicated fleet of 50 non-AC electric buses, for which two manufacturers have qualified. Tender floated The KSRTC has also floated tenders to procure 310 CNG-run, non-AC, BS VI buses for operation on inter and intra-city routes. They will have to come with warranty and annual maintenance contract for up to 10 years. All new buses that will be procured using KIIFB funds are expected to make up for the ageing fleet of superfast and other super-class buses that are expected to be withdrawn from service in the coming months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-to-get-indigenously-assembled-sleeper-buses/article36173390.ece
30 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||With resumption of printing, KBPS on revival mode||The Kerala Books and Publications Society (KBPS) in Kakkanad is seeing a revival of activities with the resumption of printing of lottery tickets as well as near completion of printing of school textbook volumes needed for the academic year 2021-22. The KBPS had faced disruption in operations due to the spread of COVID-19 earlier this year, but printing works were being brought back to near normal, adhering to the pandemic protocol, said managing director Soorya Thankappan. The activities of the society had been affected with the stoppage of lottery sales in the State as part of the efforts to contain COVID-19 outbreak. Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal had said early this month that 237 lottery draws were suspended as part of the government efforts to contain the pandemic. KBPS trade union sources said the society had now received orders for printing paper lotteries for four draws. The KBPS has the capacity to print about one crore to 1.10 crore tickets per day. The KBPS also had orders for printing 4.20 crore textbooks in three volumes for the academic year 2021-22. Of those, the first volumes, comprising 2.65 crore textbooks, had been printed and their distribution is under way. There are 1.41 textbooks of the second volume, the printing of which is being completed. About 1.30 crore of the second volume textbooks had been completed and the remaining texts could be printed in about a week’s time, added sources. There are around 14 lakh books to be printed as part of the third volume of the school textbooks. The operation of the printing society was severely affected by the spread of COVID-19 among employees in early May during the second wave of the pandemic. Employees There are around 170 permanent employees and another 400 workers, including those on daily wages and engaged in canteen operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-printing-of-tickets-and-books-resumes-kbps-on-revival-mode/article36173385.ece
30 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||MVD to crack down on overloaded vehicles||The stand-off between tipper lorry operators and Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) personnel has shed light on the manifold safety issues posed by overloaded goods carriers. The stalemate intensified following a social media campaign against the department and an official who imposed a hefty fine on a tipper lorry at Pathanapuram in Kollam district for overloading. Additional Transport Commissioner Pramoj Shankar said there would be no let-up in the drive against overloaded tipper lorries and other goods carriers, considering the grave safety hazards and damage to roads. On how overloading affected braking and the vehicle’s dynamics, an MVD official said, “Vehicles end up in major accidents. We get to see innumerable instances of axles of such vehicles breaking on undulated roads.” Almost all accidents caused by tyre burst, leading to driver losing control of the vehicle, too have been attributed to overload. The added emphasis on public safety found resonance in the revised penalty that the motor vehicle rules prescribe for overloading. An excess of one tonne load attracts a fine of Rs. 10,000, while Rs. 1,500 is imposed for every additional tonnage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mvd-to-crack-down-on-overloaded-vehicles/article36173378.ece
30 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cong. change of guard a smooth affair in district||The change of guard in the district unit of the Congress appears to be a peaceful affair even as it has triggered serious organisational issues elsewhere in the State. Muhammad Shiyas, a close confidant of Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, was declared president of the District Congress Committee (DCC) the other day. Mr. Satheesan’s choice mattered much in the selection of the DCC president in his home district, and thus Mr. Shiyas rode over others, including contestants from ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups. The names of ‘I’ faction nominees I.K. Raju and B.A. Muthalib were doing the rounds earlier. Though there may be dissent voices in the ‘I’ faction over the selection of Mr. Shiyas, they have not surfaced. The choice of Mr. Shiyas has not generated any public protest in the district, said a party leader. Mr. Shiyas had been serving as vice president of the district unit of the party for the past seven years. He had earlier served as the State general secretary of the Youth Congress and State treasurer of the KSU. The selection of Mr. Shiyas to the post also marked the exit of T.J. Vinod, MLA, from organisational responsibilities. Mr. Vinod had long been holding the post of DCC president. He had held the post even when he was elected Kochi Deputy Mayor and later as Legislator from Ernakulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-change-of-guard-a-smooth-affair-in-district/article36173384.ece

Babu’s car after the boom barrier at the toll booth fell on it on Wednesday, will reach a flash point. Mr. Babu said several others had similar experience at the toll plaza. “I myself have seen an MLA who was stranded at the plaza after the personnel manning the counter refused to permit his vehicle to proceed,” he added. Mr. Babu said no official turned up, although he waited for 45 minutes near the plaza after the incident. Agitated at this, Youth Congress activists and local residents opened all toll gates. “I tried my best to prevent the situation from going out of hand, while the police said they registered a case against personnel at the toll booth. With such incidents recurring often, the NHAI must ensure that personnel who can communicate in Malayalam are posted at toll booths,” he said. He expressed concern at the agency focusing on toll collection, while not maintaining the NH corridor. “This despite the fact that flyovers at four junctions on the stretch were built using State government funds.” The demand to increase the number of toll booths too has not yielded results, with the NHAI saying that landowners are unwilling to surrender land at the cost proposed by it. Haphazard parking in the immediate vicinity of the toll plaza and inadequate lights have been causing accidents. Many service roads do not have drains, with the result that they get waterlogged even in an average downpour, said Anish B., a commuter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-poor-management-of-toll-plaza/article36173379.ece

An initiative of four friends who wanted to do their bit during the pandemic, the van used to distribute provision kits to 19 families with HIV positive members for one year. And in 2021 February, they started taking breakfast to the destitutes in Oachira bus stand and patients and bystanders in TB Hospital, Karunagappally. Four friends Biju Muhammed, an employee of Karunagappally municipality, Abdul Shukkur, high school teacher, Thodiyoor Santhosh, entrepreneur and Haris Hari, photographer are the friends who joined hands to start Nanma Vandi. “Today, we completed 200 days of our free breakfast distribution. A lot of patients from Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and eastern parts of Kollam come to the TB Hospital for treatment. Most of them wait for our van every day and we feed around 70 persons daily,” says Mr. Muhammed. Breakfast Nanma Vandi arrives with breakfast around 8 a.m. with a bunch of plantain leaves to distribute the food. Instead of handing over food packets, they serve the food and wait for some time to make sure that nobody needs second helpings. “Usually, no hospital or voluntary organisation will provide quality cooked food for breakfast. It is easy to opt for bread or porridge, but we wanted to give tasty and homely food,” he adds. The menu includes a range of items from string hoppers and pathiris to vegetable kuruma and chicken curry. The friends have hired a cook to prepare the food everyday, as they didn’t want to depend on restaurants. “We use home-ground masalas to make the food, as we are very particular about its quality. During lockdown, we used to distribute food to all persons including COVID-19 patients who approached us.” Though it was started with the savings of the four friends, later a lot of people came forward to sponsor the food.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vehicle-of-hope-and-goodness/article36173433.ece

30 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Renewed curbs deal a body blow to village tourism entrepreneurs||Containment zone regulations in some of the panchayats in Kozhikode district after the spike in COVID-19 cases are again posing a challenge to local tourism entrepreneurs who run homestays and village food joints. With the intensified checking by local bodies and curbs on entry of tourists to such spots, many small-scale investors are again heading to a financial crisis. Village tourism entrepreneurs from Thiruvambady, Koorachundu, Kakkayam, and Peruvannamoozhi lament that only their sector is now being barred from functioning. “While all other business firms and shops are functioning under regulations, we are not allowed to operate,” they say. Many local homestays run by farmers and entrepreneurs have remained closed for more than a year. Unable to withstand the maintenance cost, many such rural units have already been closed. Those who run food joints are now experimenting with takeaway delivery which is yet to generate a good income. “We used to attract customers by offering sight-seeing packages to ecotourism spots. As all such spots are now restricting visitors, we are totally crippled in the business. Even opening of rooms for tourists are not allowed under the latest micro containment zone regulations,” said a Gulf returnee who runs a village homestay near Thiruvambady. According to him, regulations should be enforced without affecting the livelihood of people. Meanwhile, heads of local bodies where containment zone regulations exist are regularly contacting entrepreneurs to request their cooperation. They are also using their political and personal connections to pacify entrepreneurs who are on the verge of launching protests. Explaining the reasons which led to the temporary closure of tourism locations, a grama panchayat president said it was done after noticing the entry of tourists from other States and districts without following the COVID-19 protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/renewed-curbs-deal-a-body-blow-to-village-tourism-entrepreneurs/article36173375.ece

The consultancy project, Maargaa, which materialised after long months of research and field studies will be launched by District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy on August 30. Maargaa intends to identify potential talents and equip them to be part of technology-driven workplaces. It will work with local and global companies to create employment opportunities and make workplaces disabled-friendly. It will engage with employers, understand the practices for hiring people with physical limitations, and list suitable jobs. The concept is to emerge as a bridge between the employee and the employer. Drafting policies “We are also on a mission to help companies draft policies on hiring the differently abled, accessibility, diversity inclusion, workplace practices, equal opportunities, Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR), and research in favour of differently abled job aspirants,” says Mr. Jayapal. The HR teams of companies will be assisted in zeroing in on suitable candidates, recruitment, training, and retention among others. Mr. Jayapal, who survived a major accident in 2011 and was bedridden till recently, says it is high time the concerns of the differently abled are placed at the centre of any discussion on economy, technology, and well-being. “People with disabilities are a large part of the global population. Their talents are untapped and are significantly under-represented in the work force. We wish to change this situation,” he adds. No fee No registration charge or service fee will be collected from applicants. Priority will be given to those having minimal education and struggle to find a livelihood. The companies will be asked to contribute an amount for the expansion of the service. An e-commerce platform by associating with the Department of Social Justice and the District Legal Service Society is also under consideration for the financially backward members. Mr. Jayapal has been taking up welfare activities and motivational programmes under his Divyang Foundation. He undertook a solo car drive in 2018 from Kozhikode to New Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to explain the concerns of the differently abled. The 43-year-old is persuading government and non-governmental organisations and employers to adopt a barrier-free environment for the differently abled segments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-start-up-to-help-the-differently-abled-find-jobs/article36173374.ece

Anil Kumar on Sunday trained his guns on M.K. Raghavan, MP, for making the DCC a puppet. Mr. Anil Kumar was suspended from the primary membership for criticising the leadership during a news channel debate on Saturday night, as he said that the DCC reshuffle would turn out to be a ‘waterloo’ for the Congress. “The challenge being faced by the party now is an ‘MP-MLA’ brand of politics which is trying to control the organisation. The situation is such that an MP or MLA are determining everything in the party,” he alleged. Mr. Anil Kumar claimed that it was Mr. Raghavan who picked a majority of the candidates for the recent elections to the Kozhikode Corporation. He also wondered what was the indiscipline that he had committed. “What was the reason for the party’s action? That I frankly expressed my opinion during a TV news debate? Has the KPCC convened a meeting to discuss the Assembly election failure? No. So I expressed my views at a forum,” he said. “KPCC president K. Sudhakaran, before he assumed that post, used to freely criticise party leaders. Similarly, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, when he was just an MLA, had spoken against the then KPCC chief and the Chief Minister. I have not gone to that level,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/anil-kumar-trains-his-guns-on-mp/article36173367.ece

30 August 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||Glued to their names, a slice of history||The people of Pookkottur, which saw a crucial battle between the Moplahs and the British on August 26, 1921, as part of the Malabar Rebellion, take a great deal of pride in their village. Dozens carry its name as their surname. Even as the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) started moves to delete 387 Moplah martyrs of the Malabar Rebellion from the list of freedom fighters, the people of Pookkottur celebrated on Thursday the centenary of the ‘bloodiest engagement’ of the Moplah-British battles. As per eyewitness accounts, 400 Moplahs and four British soldiers lost their lives in the battle. There are about five dozen people, known and lesser known, living in Pookkottur and nearby, with the surname. The Hindu could meet at least a dozen of them in less than half-an-hour at Pookkottur. “I took it 35 years ago as I had a great amount of interest and pride in my village,” said Abdussamad Pookkottur, Islamic orator and State secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham (SYS). Shihab Pookkottur, State secretary of the Jamat-e-Islami, echoes similar feelings. Another Shihab Pookkottur, who is physically challenged, is popular as a motivational speaker. Hasan Saqafi Pookkottur is a young Islamic scholar, while Mujeeb Pookkottur is popular among Gulf expatriates as a leader of the Kerala Muslim Cultural Committee (KMCC). On the list are teachers, student leaders, politicians and artists. ‘Politically correct’ Sashi Pookkottur is a non-Moplah Congress leader who took the surname many years ago. “It is politically correct and sensible to have Pookkottur as our surname at a time when the government is hastening to delete 387 Moplah martyrs from the list of freedom fighters. We are happy to be known by this historic place,” said Shihab, also the State coordinator of the Kerala Muslim Heritage Foundation. “Many times, people have asked me, ‘Oh, you are from Pookkottur’. It is a great feeling,” said the motivator Shihab. All of them are saddened by the Sangh Parivar move to portray the Malabar Rebellion as a communal riot. “We are proud of our land. Without love for our land and communal harmony, our country cannot develop. We are saddened by the recent happenings in the country,” said Abdussamad.  As per local accounts, 400 Moplahs and four British soldiers lost their lives in the battle at Pookkottur on August 26, 1921||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/glued-to-their-names-a-slice-of-malabar-rebellion/article36173058.ece
30 August 2021||THIRUVANANTAPURAM,KERALA||Factory check norms changed||The Local Self-Government (LSG) Department has brought about amendments to inspection norms in industrial units by local bodies, in line with the recent changes proposed by the Industries Department to improve ease of doing business. One of the changes is in the frequency of routine inspections in the factories or establishments in various categories. Checks in low risk category establishments need to be carried out only once in three years, once in two years in medium risk category and annually in high risk category establishments. In case complaints are received regarding a particular factory or establishment, inspections can be carried out only with the clearance of the Secretary or an official who has been given the said responsibility by the Secretary. Frequent inspections in the same establishment based on unsubstantiated or anonymous complaints have to be avoided. Successive inspections by the same official in a particular establishment has to be avoided. If there is a need for more than one inspections at a place, another official has to be deputed for the purpose. Issues The local bodies can inspect only issues related to those coming under its powers, including waste management and sanitation. They need not carry out inquiries into issues coming under the ambit of other departments. The factory owner has to be informed in advance about the inspection. A copy of the complaint can be provided, on request, if the inspection is based on a complaint. If required, the official can record a video of the entire inspection process. The establishment's owner can also be allowed to record of a video, if such a request is raised. The respective local body Secretary has to prepare a list of officials for inspection. The official to be sent on inspection has to be chosen at random from this list. The requirement for a site inspection before issuing the license has been done away with, except in the case of permissions for categories that come under the Section 448 of the Kerala Municipal Act 1994. As per the new norms, the site inspection can be carried out within three months of issuing of the license, to ensure that no rules are being violated. Industries Minister P.Rajeeve had in July announced the State government’s plan to form a system of unified inspections instead of different departments carrying out checks on industrial units.  Frequent inspections in same unit based on unsubstantiated or anonymous complaints have to be avoided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/factory-check-norms-changed/article36173393.ece

30 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Focus on correcting lacunae in home care, say experts||Even as the COVID-19 case graph threatens to spiral up, the State’s sole focus should be in improving care and reducing mortality, rather than testing and containment. Since Delta is transmitted through air, there is very little that any health system can do to stop community transmission other than mandating masks and social distancing in public places. With less than 15% of the total active cases getting admitted in hospitals, it is quite evident that the State needs to pay more attention to improving the care of the 85% of cases who are in home isolation. Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors have flagged the fact that delayed arrival of patients to hospitals to be one of the major reasons for the increase in casualties. Despite the State having brought out home care guidelines, the incremental effect of gaps in care and monitoring of patients at home, implementation at the field-level, miscommunication and systemic faults have been pushing up the mortality of home care patients. In fact, the State’s own data analysis on 8,017 COVID deaths (the period of deaths is not clear), where delays in hospital admission might have played a key role, shows that in approximately 25% of these deaths, the patients stood a better chance at life if they had been reached to hospitals on time. The data, presented at the Chief Minister’s COVID review meeting on Saturday, shows that of the 8,017 deaths, 444 patients died at home and 127 in transit. Of those patients who had reached hospitals, 691 patients died within a day, while 533 died within three days. Taken together, admission delays contributed to the death of 1,795 patients (22.39%). Most in Thrissur The deaths due to delays in admission was the highest in Thrissur at 32.98%, followed by Palakkad (26.85%) and Kasaragod (25%). The lowest was in Thiruvananthapuram (15.54%). “Many reasons can delay in presenting COVID patients at hospitals – it could be lack of awareness of the red flag signs indicating clinical worsening, reluctance to go to hospitals, failure in proper follow-up by the system and in most cases, critical delays in decision-making at home,” a critical medicine specialist said. “The causes may vary across districts. A verbal autopsy of some of these deaths due to delays in admission in each district would show if there is a pattern in these deaths and if there are any common factors – systemic or at the field-level – that needs to be addressed, “ he said. Many health experts, however, do not concur with the government’s premise that shifting all patients with co-morbidities to hospitals would solve the issue. “The premise that only those patients with co-morbidities are dying at home is also wrong. We have lost many youngsters to COVID because they stayed home believing themselves to be healthy. Given the extent of morbidities due to diabetes and hypertension, sending all patients with co-morbidities to hospitals will only burden the system. What is needed is a planned and focused approach to identifying and correcting the lacunae in home care,” a senior public health expert said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/focus-on-correcting-lacunae-in-home-care-experts/article36173298.ece

30 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Congress factions cry foul over action against leaders||The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) action against senior leaders K.P. Anil Kumar and K. Sivadasan Nair evoked sharp reactions from the ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups. The groups viewed the disciplinary action as the latest in factional manoeuvring by the emergent ‘K.C.Venugopal’ clique in the Congress. They perceived a move to marginalise the groups and relegate former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala to organisational irrelevance. ‘New axis of power’ The group managers alleged that the up-and-coming axis of power had KPCC president K. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, among others, as its prime backers. Mr. Venugopal is the AICC general secretary in charge of the organisation. The three leaders have repeatedly claimed they were above factional politics. They had declared that their mandate was solely that of the Congress high command. ‘Emphasis on merit’ Mr. Satheesan said group politics could not hold party reorganisation to ransom any more. The AICC’s list of DCC presidents had released the party from the mould of group loyalties. It emphasised merit. No two leaders could apportion party posts between themselves forever, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran also seemed to share Mr. Satheesan's resolve to take factionalism head on. He criticised Mr. Chandy for the ‘painful remark’ and insisted on abiding by the AICC's diktat. In Kozhikode, Mr. Anil Kumar trained his guns on M.K. Raghavan, Kozhikode MP, for making the DCC a puppet. “The challenge being faced by the party now is an ‘MP-MLA’ brand of politics which is trying to control the organisation. The situation is such that an MP or MLA are determining everything in the party. Those in charge of key organisational posts are becoming silent spectators,” he alleged. Addressing media persons In Pathanamthitta on Sunday, Mr. Sivadasan Nair said the list of DCC presidents released by the party leadership failed to reflect the mood of the party workers. He further called for the conduct of organisational elections as a way to overcome the crisis.

Usha, scholar in Central Asian studies, has said. Dr. Usha, associate professor at the Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, was delivering a special online lecture on ‘Afghanistan: Geopolitics of Impasse’ organised by the Vakkom Moulavi Memorial and Research Centre in association with the Institute for Global South Studies and Research (IGSSR) on Saturday. The academic, who authored A Wounded Afghanistan: Communism, Fundamentalism and Democracy , said the narratives on Afghanistan had been greatly influenced by the western world’s manipulation of global public opinion on various issues. “The war on terror itself had been designed as a strategy to dominate the geopolitics of Eurasia and contain nations, including Russia and China. While it began as part of the containment strategy devised during the Cold War (to counter the Soviet geopolitical spread), it later transformed into a new project. After the Ukrainian crisis, the United States had activated the second containment (of Russia) campaign that precipitated after Washington’s Asia-Pacific geopolitical power games with a new focus on China’s emergence,” Dr. Usha said. Public health expert B. Ekbal said the Taliban’s emergence would pose a serious threat to Afghan society in general and its health sector in particular.

30 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Woman police officer transferred||The Kerala Police on Sunday transferred a woman police officer attached to the Pink Police who wrongly accused an eight-year-old girl and her father of stealing her mobile phone. Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thiruvananthapuram Range, Sanjaykumar Gurudin issued the order transferring senior civil police officer Rejitha from the Pink Patrol under the Thiruvananthapuram Rural police to the Kollam City police. She will also undergo a 15-day behavioural training course. The action came on the basis of an inquiry report submitted by District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram Rural) P.K. Madhu on the incident that took place in full public view at Moonumukku, near Attingal, on Friday. The findings of separate probes undertaken by the Deputy Superintendents of Police of Attingal sub-division and the Special Branch formed the basis of his report. Lapses in behaviour The inquiry, which defended the actions of the officer to a large extent, found lapses in her behaviour. It observed that Ms. Rejitha had responded naturally when she had found that her phone had gone missing. While she was not found to have misbehaved or over-reacted, the probe noted that she should have properly ascertained the location of her mobile phone before questioning the father-daughter duo. Her actions had caused inconvenience to them and created a scene in public view. Besides, the officer was also found to have erred by failing to apologise after finding that they had committed no offence. Mr. Gurudin’s order also stated that police personnel, especially those working under Pink Police patrol units, were expected to be courteous and humble in their interactions with the public. However, Jayachandran from Thonnakkal who along with his daughter had been wrongly accused of the theft was unsatisfied with the disciplinary action. He said that he would petition the Chief Minister, State Police Chief and the Kerala State Human Rights Commission to get the woman police officer suspended for her action. He added that he intended to file a defamation suit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-police-officer-transferred/article36173512.ece

The commission had shown scant regard for the unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly to keep power distribution in the public sector, KEOC general secretary P.S. Prasanth said. Several of the draft proposals would adversely impact the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and the ordinary consumers, he said. The condition that the commission could separately determine the tariffs of the KSEB and other distribution licencees would lead to different tariff structures for consumers under different licencees. This situation would benefit private players who would enter the arena once the Electricity (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Parliament, but would have serious consequences on the finances of the KSEB. Once the draft was finalised, the KSEB would not be able to sell surplus power to power exchanges as it was doing now. Instead, it would have to first offer this power to open-access consumers at power exchange rates, Mr. Prasanth said. “Ultimately, the KSEB stands to lose transmission charges, wheeling charges and cross-subsidy surcharge. This will also entail a loss to KSEB to the the tune of about Rs. 2 per unit,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/draft-norms-support-power-sector-privatisation-says-staff-forum/article36173372.ece

The price bids submitted by the firms will be opened in 10 days’ time after the pre-qualification process is completed, KWA officials said. Designed to provide 100 mld of drinking water to the capital city, the project was re-tendered in June this year after the first work contract awarded to a Thiruvananthapuram-based firm in 2019 was cancelled. The remaining 20 mld will be distributed to four panchayats. 18 months’ time The KWA has retained 18 months as the implementation period for the WTP work, revising an earlier decision to fix it at 12 months. Bidders had objected to the decision to cut down the implementation period, prompting the KWA to revert to the original 18-month deadline. Estimated to cost Rs. 60 crore, the work involves the construction of a WTP with plate settler technology (lamella clarifier), a floating water intake structure, pump sets, an electrical substation building and installation of SCADA system. Alignment On another front, the alignment of the transmission main from Neyyar to PTP Nagar in the city — a distance of 23.8 km — is yet to be finalised. The pipeline construction is being taken up as a separate project funded through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). While the KWA plans to lay the pipeline under the road, KIIFB prefers to have the alignment shifted to the side of the road. But the latter proposal would also mean additional delays caused by potential land acquisition requirements and disputes, according to the KWA officials.

The species, Mantispilla indica (Westwood), was found by the research team of the Shadpada Entomology Research Lab of Christ College from Mulangunnathukavu and Irinjalakuda areas of Thrissur district. The discovery by research student Suryanarayanan T.B. and Assistant Professor Bijoy C. has been published in the latest issue of Journal of Threatened Taxa , a national scientific journal. This tiny (10 mm) insect belongs to the family Mantispidae of order Neuroptera, represented by four subfamilies and 410 species worldwide, of which only 17 species, representing a single subfamily Mantispinae, are known so far from India. “They are commonly called Mantispids or Mantid lacewings due to the morphological resemblance with praying mantis of order Mantodea in their raptorial forelegs. They are distinguished by their net-like wings. The taxonomy of this group is least studied either due to the short lifespan of adults or due to their very low population density,” said Dr. Bijoy. The first instar larvae of Mantid lacewings are parasites of spiders and have a complicated development called hypermetamorphosis.  Funded by CSIR As per published literature, this is the third species reported from Kerala after Euclimacia nodosa (Westwood) and Mantispa cora Newman. Mantispilla indica is characterised by a black antenna except for two basal segments. The research was funded by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The same research team had found Thread-winged lacewing (family: Nemopteridae, order: Neuroptera) in State sometime ago. Croce filipennis was the species found in Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district and Pudunagaram in Palakkad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rare-mantid-lacewing-species-found-in-kerala/article36173392.ece

30 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||3,400 kg of marijuana worth Rs. 21 crore seized||The Bengaluru zone team of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) seized 3,400 kg of high-grade marijuana estimated to be around Rs. 21 crore from a truck at the Hyderabad Ring Road toll booth on Saturday. According to officials, the truck was transporting the consignment from Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border to Maharashtra via Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Three people — D. Shinde, M.R. Kamble and N. Jogdand, all from Latur district of Maharashtra, were arrested. The truck, too, had a Maharashtra registration. After receiving intelligence on the movement of the consignment, a joint team of Bengaluru and Hyderabad NCB officials arrived near the toll booth and intercepted the truck. During a search, they found the marijuana concealed in 141 gunny bags that were ingeniously hidden. The gunny bags were concealed under tarpaulin sheets, which were further covered by varieties of nursery saplings in huge quantities in the truck, said Amit Ghawate, NCB, Zonal Director. According to the officials, a kingpin from Maharashtra was running the operation. He had arranged the banned substance for multiple syndicates that were trafficking drugs in Pune district, Mumbai, Thane, and other States. These syndicates, in turn, sell contraband to students in colleges, in private parties, and individual clients via an elaborate ground network, said the NCB. Officials added that the source of the contraband was Andhra Pradesh–Orissa border area, and further investigation was in progress. This is one of the largest hauls of marijuana in recent times. In 2020, the total quantity of marijuana seized by the NCB was 1,970 kg; eight people were arrested. So far this year, 7,500 kg marijuana have been seized by the NCB, Bengaluru zone, and 25 people arrested. Including Saturday’s haul, this is a nearly four-fold increase in less than a year. The substantial seizures of marijuana indicate that the traffickers were desperate and decided to risk transporting the maximum quantity of the contraband, Mr. Ghawate said. “Marijuana is mainly distributed to youth and school and college students. It is a stepping stone for them into the dark life of addiction, and increases the risk of addiction to more potentially dangerous narcotic drugs such as heroin and synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and mephedrone,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/3400-kg-of-marijuana-worth-rs-21-crore-seized/article36173080.ece
30 August 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police tighten security for RBI cash transfers||The Tamil Nadu police have intensified security following a Central agency’s alert on a threat to Reserve Bank of India cash transfers to currency chests across the State. Police sources said the number of armed guards in the convoy escorting the vehicles that carried currency-notes was doubled immediately after the alert was issued recently. DGP’s directive Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu directed the Commissioners and Superintendents of Police to deploy sufficient manpower and vehicles for cash transfers. But senior bank officials have expressed concern over the deployment of a fewer number of policemen than the sanctioned strength at the currency chests. Inadequate weapons At the State-level security review meeting, a senior official of a nationalised bank pointed out that the weapons given to the guards were inadequate. Nationalised banks have their currency chests in Chennai and other cities. Taking a serious note of the concern flagged by the banks, Mr. Sylendra Babu instructed senior officials to make sure that the deployment of policemen matched the sanctioned strength. An advisory was sent out to supervisory officers to ensure that guards with sufficient arms and ammunition were available at the currency chests at all times, the sources said. Police officials raised the issue relating to the payment for the security cover from some banks. Dues to the tune of Rs. 94 lakh were pending from a few nationalised and private banks, they said. On August 9, 2016, an unprecedented heist occurred in the State on a moving train when an unidentified gang drilled a hole into a parcel van transporting soiled currency-notes from a bank to the RBI. The Crime Branch-CID, which investigated the theft of Rs. 5.75 crore from the Salem-Chennai Express, arrested a gang from Madhya Pradesh. But no significant recovery was made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-tighten-security-for-rbi-cash-transfers/article36173136.ece
30 August 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials on alert as Chittoor sees a slight surge in COVID-19 cases||Task force personnel have expressed concern over the daily COVID-19 tally in Chittoor district that has remained over 250 during the last one week. Of the 255 cases on Sunday, half of them are from urban areas, mainly from Tirupati, Chittoor and Srikalahasti. Chittoor district recorded about 7,000 fresh cases by August 29, the highest in the State, with a fatality rate of 1.6%. Since March last year, the district has reported a total of 2.38 lakh cases and 1,840 casualties, also the highest in the State. Nodal Officer for Government District Headquarters Hospital (DHQH) and Apollo Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (AIMSR) A.K. Rajesh Babu said that top priority was being given to keep the cases under check as positivity rate has remained higher than the recovery rate in Chittoor for a week now. “Considering the rising cases as a warning, special task force teams have been formed to curb public mobility by monitoring the gatherings at festivals, private functions and marketplaces,” the official said. Chief Administrator (District Headquarters Hospital) Naresh Kumar Reddy said that the vaccination drive in Chittoor district had covered 147 sites and administered 24.27 lakh doses, including 7.28 lakh second doses, by August 29. Special vaccine drives Special drives were conducted to increase vaccine coverage among people here and steps have been taken to expedite contact tracing, he said. “We are raising awareness among the public on the need to be extremely cautious for the next two months, considering the festival season,” the official said. Mr. Naresh Kumar Reddy said that the complications, arising out of COVID-19, were least among the vaccinated section, but high-to-very high among those who did not receive the jab. “Early identification of infection, visiting doctors and getting COVID-19 tests done reduce the risk of severity of disease. Unfortunately, many people do not get tested and remain under home isolation and go for self-medication. Our study revealed that 90% of the casualties are due to neglecting symptoms in the initial stage,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-on-alert-as-chittoor-sees-a-slight-surge-in-covid-19-cases/article36173097.ece

The police have arrested nine persons of the accused. The deceased were identified as Hanamath Mudaraddi, 45, Basavaraj Mudaraddi, 37, Ishwar Mudaraddi, 35, and Mallu Mudaraddi, 33, all brothers. Property dispute The ghastly incident took place in Madhurakandi village in Jamkhandi taluk on Saturday. According to sources, there was a property dispute between Mudaraddi and Putani families and a quarrel broke out between the two families on Saturday after one of the members of Mudaraddi family was attacked by members of the Putani family. Subsequently, other members of the two families joined the quarrel, during which members of the Putani family hacked to death four men of the Mudaraddi family with lethal weapons. The police soon rushed to the village and arrested nine of the 12 accused in the case. According to police sources, Nandish, Nagappa, Parappa, Shivanand, Irappa, Shankar, Ambavva, Rukmavva, Malashree, Sundanda, Prema and Channabasappa Nidoni of the Putani family were said to be involved in the crime.

30 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||ICCR chief moots certificate course in milking cows||The ‘New Education Policy’ (NEP) introduced by the Central government has scope for several innovations and educationists should think of introducing ‘cow or buffalo milking’ and ‘village management’ certificate courses for the rural folk, said Rajya Sabha MP and president of Indian Council for Cultural Relations Vinay Sahasrabuddhe on Sunday. “The ‘10 plus two plus three’ education framework obviously did not fulfil the objectives as a mad rush to the colleges continued with vocational occupations suffering as people wanted to go for higher education. Higher education gives them (rural people) respect, dignity and social acceptance, so why can’t we have an out-of-the-box approach where universities can offer diploma courses in milking as it not easy to milk a cow or a buffalo. A certificate will give them prestige. Gram sewaks can given training in rural leadership. Three such courses can be converted into a degree,” he told an audience of academicians including vice-chancellors of various State universities. Mr. Sahasrabuddhe was addressing a round table organised on MISSION 5151, an initiative of Gramodaya Chamber of Commerce and Technology (GCOT) in association with Institution of Engineers (India)-Telangana State chapter, here on Sunday. The senior BJP leader said the universities can also think of having courses for college and university management since registrars have a tough time in preparing the roster for reservations giving rise to several accusations about social justice being denied to certain sections of the society. Stating that social harmony in villages has been crumbling over the years due to community or caste issues, he called for earnest efforts to restore them. Social studies are required to study the changes in the villages to understand the people better and there is also a need to map cultural heritage and remove the distinction between arts and crafts, he said. Vice-Chancellor of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, V. Praveen Rao suggested creation of an open data platform in mission mode to bring agriculture in tune with the changing scenarios of climate change, technological changes, dietary patterns, ecological aspects, food procession and so on. Osmania University Vice-Chancellor D. Ravinder Yadav said a ‘Centre for Telangana Studies’ is being set up and rebuilding of villages will be taken up as part of the academic social responsibilities. Telangana State Council of Higher Education chairman R. Limbadri sought Centre’s assistance to improve higher education as several scientific institutions that have a base here and said enrolment at 36% is more than the national average of 26%. GCOT managing director D. Vasanth Kumar explained the ‘village monograph’ project where the entire village is mapped for infrastructure, cultural, social and agriculture details. Dr B.R. Ambedkar Open University Vice-Chancellor K. Seetharama Rao also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/iccr-chief-moots-certificate-course-in-milking-cows/article36172920.ece

30 August 2021||MALAPPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Student held in rape case freed after negative DNA test result||The police were left with egg on their face when an 18-year-old higher secondary student walked out of the Tirur sub-jail here in Kerala on Saturday after 35 days of incarceration. He was jailed in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) case after a 17-year-old schoolgirl alleged that he had raped and impregnated her. A DNA examination conducted on the girl proved that the boy was not responsible for her pregnancy. The POCSO court which had ordered that he be put behind bars ordered his release following this. The Plus-Two student from Tennala, near Tirurangadi, said he knew the girl for about a year from school but had not abused her. Days of trauma He said he underwent severe mental trauma after being wrongly arraigned in a POCSO case. “Who is going to compensate me for what I suffered these days? I am a student. I was taken to two police stations and three jails,” he said. The police had picked him up at midnight from his house and taken him to the station without even telling his family the reason for the arrest. “In the jeep, one constable showered me with abuses. At the police station, he threatened to apply pepper spray on my genitals,” he said. He had been taken to the girl’s house with handcuffs the next morning. “I could not hear properly for many days after a sub-inspector slapped me on my face. The worst police behaviour was at the Kalpakanchery station,” he said. He said the case should be investigated properly and the culprits brought to book.  Who will compensate me for what I suffered? I’m a student.

30 August 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Prakasam ryots want inclusion of Veligonda project in gazette||The joy of farmers over the completion of first phase of the long-pending Pula Subbaiah Veligonda project will be ephemeral if urgent steps are not taken for inclusion of the project in the gazette notification issued by the Centre, a group of ryots in Prakasam district has said. The farmers from the district want Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to direct the Irrigation Department officials to write a fresh letter, urging the Centre to include this project in the gazette notification considering that the command area of more than the Rs. 7500-crore project is mostly drought-prone , said All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee Prakasam district convenor Ch.Ranga Rao. He took stock of the development on Sunday with various farmers’ organisations in the district. He explained that though the project had been included in the A.P. State Reorganisation Act, the same was not included in the gazette notification issued by the Centre for administration by the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) due some typographical errors in the schedule of projects as per the Act. The State government wrote to the Centre for including not only the Veligonda project but several other projects. But it led to a stalemate as the Centre was in no mood to consider all the projects though it was favourably inclined to consider the Veligonda case following intervention of Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu, he said . He said the irrigation officials in the State should write a fresh letter in this regard considering the fact that the project would benefit the farmers in the drought-prone areas in not only Prakasam district, but also in the neighbouring SPSR Nellore and YSR Kadapa districts. Mr. Ranga Rao said sharing of the Krishna water between A.P. and Telangana in 70:30 ratio was a closed chapter and 50:50 sharing arrangement demanded by the upper riparian State was unjustified. “The present arrangement should continue till the conclusion of the Krishna water dispute proceedings,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/prakasam-ryots-want-inclusion-of-veligonda-project-in-gazette/article36173499.ece
30 August 2021||ongole,ANDHRA PRADESH||Abducted baby reunited with mother in Ongole||Prakasam police acted swiftly to reunite an infant with her mother within hours of her being kidnapped from the Markapur government hospital, here on Saturday. Y. Komali (26) wept tears of relief as Superintendent of Police Mallika Garg placed her five-day-old daughter in her arms. Police arrested three persons, identified as D. Rehana (26), D. Haleema Begum (33) and Sk. Rahmatunnisa (34), for kidnapping the infant. Officials said the baby, immediately after delivery, was put in a phototherapy room for treatment of jaundice from where she went missing on Saturday. After Komali’s husband Srinivasulu lodged a complaint, police swung into action and registered a case under Section 363 of the IPC. Going through CCTV camera footage, Markapur police found that the baby was whisked away by a burqa-clad woman from the hospital. After alerting all police stations in the district and by erecting checkposts on inter-district borders and stepping up vigil at important road and railway junctions, Markapur police noted the movement of a suspect near a private hospital in Markapur town in the wee hours and nabbed Rehana, who reportedly confessed to the crime. In her confession, the accused reportedly told police that she had sold the baby to her relative for Rs. 50,000. The accused women were produced before the Markapur Additional Judicial First Class Magistrate who remanded them to 14 days’ judicial custody.

30 August 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Plan to lay highway to Sabarimala||The decades-long proposal to construct an alternative route through the thick forests for Sabarimala pilgrims is finally set to become a reality. Aimed at easing the pilgrim flow from Tamil Nadu, the Kerala government has decided to kick start works on a high range highway between Achencoil to Plapally near Sabarimala. A decision to this effect was arrived at a meeting convened by the Public Works Minister Mohamed Riyas in Thiruvananthapuram. The project, to be developed in three stretches at a cost Rs. 86 crore, will be implemented by the Kerala Road Fund Board. As it entails widening the road in areas that pass through the forest, the meeting also decided to take steps to get regulatory clearances. According to officials, a 5.9-km-long stretch between Thannithodu and Chittar will be developed under the first reach while the second reach envisages construction of a 3.80-km-long road between Urumbini and Valupara. The Seethathodu bridge and remaining portions are included in the third reach. Cutting across different forest divisions including Ranni and Konni, the road also connects the Pathanamthitta district to the Mekkarai-Achencoil inter-State route. “The works along the Achencoil-Kalleli and Thannithodu-Chittar stretches will begin only upon obtaining the requisite clearance from the Forest Department. The works in the remaining portions including the Seethathodu bridge, however, will begin soon. On completion, the road will have a width up to 12 metres,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plan-to-lay-new-highway-to-sabarimala/article36173056.ece

30 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Infighting engulfs Congress in Kerala||The Congress unit in Kerala appeared engulfed in a potentially incapacitating feud on a scale rarely seen in recent years. The latest round of infighting in the party is the political fallout of the contentious nomination of District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents. Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, the ‘A’ and ‘I’ group’s leaders, respectively, have aired their misgivings about the appointments. They said they had no role in the reorganisation. Mr. Chandy said the reorganisation would have transpired in a better atmosphere had the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership consulted everybody. “My name was dragged into a process in which I had no say,” he said. Mr. Chennithala echoed a similar sentiment. He said keeping everybody in the loop would have ensured a smooth transition of power at the DCC level. Groups were an undeniable reality in the party, he said. Fragile unity The DCC reorganisation seemed to have exacerbated the factional divisions in the party and raised questions about whether the fragile unity forged by the party high command would hold. For one, ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups were miffed that the KPCC had suspended senior leaders K.P. Anil Kumar and K. Sivadasan Nair from the organisation for pointing out the DCC postings were arbitrary and imposed from above without factoring in the ground reality. The groups viewed the disciplinary action as the latest in factional manoeuvring by the emergent ‘K.C.Venugopal’ clique in the Congress. They perceived a move to marginalise ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups and relegate Mr. Chandy and Mr. Chennithala to organisational irrelevance. The group managers alleged that the up-and-coming axis of power had KPCC president K. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, among others, as its prime backers. Mr. Venugopal is the AICC general secretary in charge of the organisation. The three leaders have repeatedly claimed they were above factional politics. They had declared that their mandate was solely that of the Congress high command. Mr. Satheesan said group politics could not hold party reorganisation to ransom any more. The All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) list of DCC presidents had released the party from the mould of group loyalties. It emphasised merit. No two leaders could apportion party posts between themselves forever, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/infighting-engulfs-congress-in-kerala/article36173062.ece

This number is just over half the total number of such buildings built over a period of time by the temple trust board to rent those out for performing marriages and domestic functions. The TTD has developed 300 such properties. However, most of the halls do not register weddings even in single digit in an entire year, thus becoming the proverbial white elephants, the present move is viewed as an attempt to put the properties to the best use. Having decided to lease out the Kalyana Mandapams for five years, the TTD has appealed to the Hindu religious organisations, mutts and individuals to submit their proposals on www.tender.apeprocurement.gov.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-to-lease-out-177-kalyana-mandapams/article36173501.ece

A second grade student of the Edify School, Raja Anirudh Sriram passed the tech giant Microsoft’s toughest examination to join the one million people who have got this certification across the globe. During the practice tests, his score gradually improved from 546 to 950 out of 1,000. Though he could not clear the examination in his first attempt, Anirudh achieved the feat with his dedication and practice in the next seven days, i.e., on August 21. “The examination has a mix of multiple choice questions, drag and drop queries, hotspot and scenario-based questions. The hardest challenge for us was to explain the language and the concepts of the test to a six-year-old boy,” says his parents Saketh Ram and Anjana Sravani. They say that Anirudh’s sharp memory power, fast grasping skills, intuitive knowledge and enthusiasm to learn new things have helped him achieved the feat. Thanks to the restricted school hours, Anirudh is attending the online coding classes being offered by Whitehat Jr., and has risen to an impressive level. “Since too much of computing might cause a negative impact at this tender age, we have restricted it to just 30 minutes a day,” says Anirudh’s grandfather Srinivasa Rao. First record As the family is into automobile business for two generations, the boy naturally has developed interest for vehicles and their brand names. By identifying 100 cars in 160 seconds, Anirudh secured a place in the India Book of Records for the first time in 2019, when he was just four, displaying exceptional memory power. In an informal chat with The Hindu , Anirudh says that he wants to be an astronaut. “I want to steer a rocket and fly high into the space,” he says while staring at the sky and the determination in his voice says he means it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/6-year-old-from-ap-becomes-microsoft-office-specialist/article36173060.ece

30 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||RTC cargo wing to start door delivery service from Sept. 1||To augment the dropping revenues in the pandemic times, the A.P. State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) plans to increase the volume of cargo business by starting door delivery service from September 1. The officials of the public transport giant always had in their minds the door delivery and pick-up services, but shortage of staff prevented them from materialising their plans. With COVID-19 hitting the cash-starved corporation’s revenues hard, the officials thought this to be the right time to increase the volume of business in the cargo sector, which has been earning a decent income for the organisation even in hardest of times. Not leaving anything to chance, the corporation conducted a survey in July, which showed that 66% of the customers wanted door delivery of their parcels. The RTC currently runs its cargo services through 120 pick-up and booking counters set up in bus stations across the State. “We have realised that nearly 45% of the parcels are being collected from our bus stations by persons other than those who booked them. To increase the last minute connectivity, we have started experimenting with the delivery services,” said Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of the corporation Dwaraka Tirumala Rao. He said it would take some more time to start the ‘pick-up’ service. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Rao said an exercise of studying the rates of private courier services and discussing other key factors preceded before arriving at the decision to start the courier delivery service from 16 places in the State. “The trial run will be done in Vijayawada, Tirupati and Rajamahendravaram,” he added. Initially, parcels with a weight of only up to 10 kg will be delivered in a radius of 10 km. “Depending on the public response, we will increase the distance and weight of the packages,” he said. Nearly 200 buses will be used for cargo services. Currently, the RTC handles nearly 18,000 parcels daily, which earn a revenue of Rs. 35 lakh to the corporation. “We are hopeful that people will choose RTC for their cargo needs as our rates will be much lesser than what the private courier services charge,” said Mr. Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rtc-cargo-wing-to-start-door-delivery-service-from-sept-1/article36173504.ece

Mr. Veerraju launched the ‘Telugu Bhasha Vaarotsavalu’ here on Sunday, marking Telugu Language Day, which is celebrated on the birthday of linguist and writer Gidugu Venkata Ramamurthy. “Campuses of the Telugu University including the Rajamahendravaram campus are struggling for existence.

Nagendra, based on credible information, the police have intercepted two vehicles near Cheedipalem Junction and recovered the ganja. “One accused was acting as a pilot to inform the other, who was coming in another vehicle with a load of ganja. Acting on a tip-off, the two accused were caught,” said Mr. Nagendra. Mr. Nagendra said that the smugglers were instructed to take the ganja load till Rajamahendravaram, from where some other persons would take control of the vehicle. The final destination is not known to the duo. Based on the call data records, others who were involved in the smuggling would be arrested,he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/2700-kg-ganja-seized-in-koyyuru-mandal-two-persons-arrested/article36173580.ece

Members of the Joint Forum representing various mass organisations of weaker and downtrodden sections took out a rally in Kothagudem on Sunday demanding stern action against those allegedly responsible for “discourteous behaviour” towards Government Whip Rega Kantha Rao at the official function. The activists staged a demonstration at the Post Office Centre in the district headquarters town on Sunday afternoon. They raised slogans against the organisers of the official function for allegedly not inviting all Dalit organisations in the coal town to the statue unveiling function. It may be mentioned that Mr Kantha Rao, who represents the ST-reserved Pinapaka Assembly constituency in the tribal majority district, expressed resentment over the alleged violation of protocol by the organisers of the function held on Saturday night. Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar among others attended the function chaired by Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao. Apparently upset over not finding his picture on the banner put up on the dais at the official function, Mr Kantha Rao rued that he was meted out humiliation at the official function held in connection with the inaugural of the statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, the champion of downtrodden sections. He said he would bring the issue of “breach of protocol” to the notice of the Assembly Speaker and the Chief Secretary for appropriate action to prevent recurrence of such incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/protocol-breach-leads-to-protest-in-bhadradri/article36173360.ece

30 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Recreate romance on Tank Bund||A leisure walk with your beloved with the cool breeze stirring the senses is absolute romanticism. In the concrete jungle of Hyderabad, that romanticism was recreated with the popular hangout spot, Tank Bund, closed for vehicles on Sunday evenings, and leaving it to people to rekindle some good old days when life was full of pleasures moving at snail’s pace. It was kind of reclaiming the roads to take a leisure stroll on a cool evening, children skating and a few riding bicycles and the young finding space to revitalise romantic relationships. The cloudy sky played the perfect host and the breeze flowing from the lake added to the lovely set-up for hundreds of people who thronged the lake road. This was the first Sunday after the government decided to close down Tank Bund road for vehicles from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. and the response was pretty good. The decision came after MA&UD Minister K.T. Rama Rao mooted the idea after a citizen requested him. Hundreds of citizens took to Twitter posting pictures and videos of vehicle-free Tank Bund. The road that connects Hyderabad and Secunderabad is never devoid of vehicles. It reminded of the government’s similar initiative ‘Raahgiri’ launched in 2015 in the IT corridor. It became an instant hit with thousands of people reclaiming the street and pedestrians playing cricket, football, bicycling, rope walking and some of them showing off their Zumba moves. Citizens thanked KTR for the vehicle-free lake road initiative so that the local populace could enjoy their evenings without vrooming sounds of vehicles. Shiva Prasad @shivainn tweeted saying ‘Newly Transformed TankBund. Good decision’. Nalin Kumar Asawa @NalinAsawa had an advice saying ‘to attract more people some events can be organised apart from camel ride, horse ride and boating.’ Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration, Arvind Kumar tweeted thanking KTR for the idea and adding that Tank Bund was recently renovated and the sheer enjoyment and relaxed ways of families were worth all the effort. ‘It’s nice to have some space & time on Tank Bund dedicated to evening walkers, families and especially kids. From today Sunday evenings in #Hyderabad are more enjoyable and pleasant.’ There were a few like G.V. Vamsi Krishnan who criticised police saying it led to traffic jams. ‘It is a stupid decision and hope they will feel the pain of traffic jam once they retire.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/recreate-romance-on-tank-bund/article36173339.ece
30 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Metro to chug in Old City once in power: Bandi Sanjay Kumar||The BJP will bring Metro rail to Old City till Falaknuma and will ensure equal employment opportunities for both Hindus and Muslims, without any discrimination, once it comes to power in 2023 elections, said party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on the second day of his ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ on Sunday. He minced no words in charging the Majlis party with being solely responsible for Metro not running in Old City and halting the construction at MGBS, Imblibun. “The government should explain why there is lack of development in Old City,” he said. “People of Telangana have already decided to support my party,” he said, and was confident of raising the saffron flag on Golconda Fort. “Once in power, the very first public meeting will be held at Bhagyalakshmi Temple at Charminar,” he added. “BJP is not against any religion and the ‘Triple Talaq’ Act was brought forth for the benefit of Muslim women. Centre’s welfare schemes are for all and not just for the majority community,” he said. The BJP chief accused the TRS first family of “swindling funds from Centre”. Mr. Sanjay Kumar, accompanied by scores of party leaders and followers, talked to people involved in petty businesses on roadsides throughout, seeking details about their livelihoods, incomes and difficulties. “Did you get the 2BHK house as promised by this government?” was his main query, as a loud ‘no’ was the answer. He told people about the Rs. 10,000 loan by the Centre for street vendors. The party pulled no stops to make the programme a success with banners and flags adorning the route with artistes performing and songs played continuously as firecrackers were burst as he walked through Toli Chowki, Shaikpet, Golconda, Langer Houz and so on, for about 11 km, with night halt scheduled at Bapu Ghat. Heavy rain in the evening called for a break for sometime. Earlier, the party chief held a meeting with State office bearers and top leaders at Mehdipatnam, where he thanked them and the general public for the overwhelming response to his yatra. Senior leader N. Indrasena Reddy, MLA Raja Singh and others claimed that the inaugural public meeting was an unprecedented success and has enthused the cadre. Party sources also claimed that Home Minister Amit Shah made inquiries about the programme and congratulated Mr. Sanjay Kumar for the grand launch of the walkathon in Telangana. He was said to have been briefed about the meeting by general secretary Arun Singh and State in-charge Tarun Chugh.  Once in power, the very first public meeting will be held at Bhagyalakshmi Temple at Charminar.

30 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Staff await schedule for DPC meetings||State government employees are anxiously waiting for the government’s initiative to release schedule for departmental promotion committee (DPC) meetings as the panel year for promotions (September 1 to August 31) will expire in a couple of days. The government had announced constitution of the DPCs last year. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar earlier this year asked special chief secretaries, principal secretaries and other senior officials to complete the process of giving promotions to employees in Secretariat and at other levels. A majority of the departments too are said to have complied with the directives but the process of giving promotions has been delayed because of “technical issues”. Guidelines issued by the High Court with regard to implementation of the rule of reservation in promotions is said to have delayed the process to some extent. According to DPC rules, vacancies arising for different reasons, including promotions, retirement, death and leave reserve, should be assessed before the conclusion of the panel year so that there is clarity on the vacancy position for the next panel year. The exercise assumes significance in the light of the State government’s directives asking the department to submit details of the staff like regular employees, vacancies in the departments and those under contract and outsourcing basis. The exercise has been launched consequent on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s resolve to fill vacancies in direct recruitment posts initially, followed by vacancies arising due to promotions and for other reasons. An estimated 57,000 posts under direct recruitment are said to be pending at present. Employee unions lament that the promotion process had not been initiated in the last two panel years too as a result of which several eligible employees were drawing less salaries. But for the government’s initiative to raise the retirement age from 58 to 61, several of them would have retired on low pay scales, resulting in lower pensions. There are more than 350 proposals in respect of employees of ranks of section officers, assistant secretaries, deputy secretaries, additional secretaries and joint secretaries that are awaiting clearance for promotion. The other day, employees staged an impromptu sit-in in front of the Chief Secretary’s office, demanding that the process be completed at the earliest. “These promotions will be cleared once the DPC meeting is held. But schedule for such meeting is not forthcoming yet,” a representative of the employee unions said. Employees are hopeful that the government would take the initiative in a day or two to notify the process of promotions or at least give promotions to a section of employees on ad hoc basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/staff-await-schedule-for-dpc-meetings/article36173348.ece
30 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Putting work culture back on track||The pandemic brought in a paradigm shift in our approach to work culture, owing to the work from home (WFH) situation. Comfort over style, flexibility over fixed deadlines, slouching over straight posture and snacks over a good meal have all led to a lifestyle that hinged on the breakdown of normal professional behaviour. Most women sported messy buns and tight ponytails while working from home, causing damage to hair. Dermatologist Lakshmi Divya says, “A constant ponytail can lead to follicle damage and breakage, triggering a receding hairline. This is called traction alopecia.” Tightly knotted hairstyles are not good while sleeping either. Tied-up hair or friction while rolling on bed can cause strain on hair roots, leading to thinning. Even the elastic band can cause the snapping of strands. Use of satin fabric wrap around the elastic or a choice of scarf or ribbon to tie the hair while sleeping is a good option. Loungewear lies Innumerable memes aside, WFH made us discard our formal dresses and opt for casual pyjamas and loungewear 24x7, effectively concealing the stealthily growing flab. Consultant nephrologist Rajiv says, “What does aggravate belly fat is a combination of inveterate snacking, lack of exercise and disrupted sleep — the holy trifecta of WFH.” With the right attitude, returning to the office can be a plus for health, with a greater opportunity to move, walk around and climb stairs, says Dr Rajiv. “All those steps count even if they don’t add up to 10,000. But ideally, you should turbocharge your metabolism with a morning workout. A 10-minute session of High Intensity Interval Training will keep your metabolism humming throughout the day, burning calories even when you are sitting at a desk, and lowers stress hormones, which reduces belly fat,” he explains.  Dust those dumbbells With limited mobility and exercise during the pandemic, fitness routines have gone for a toss for many. To those who want to resume, celebrity trainer Babita Jacqueline Xavier has a word of caution: “After being locked in at home with home workouts, one must take it easy and slow start the outdoor or gym workouts. Too much too soon, too fast is the road to injuries. Avoid this road.” If you have exercised in casual clothes all these days and are ready to step outdoors for workouts, it is important to pay attention to what you wear says, Babita. “You may be more comfortable wearing clothes that are breathable, fit well and will wick the sweat away from your body. Avoid super-loose clothes that may topple over your head or get caught with the equipment you use during your workout.” Watch out for the big C The WFH situation also made women discard the bra. P. Raghuram, founding director, KIMS-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, says, “Many women have breast pain either due to wearing an ill-fitting bra and not wearing one at all. By not wearing a bra, the weight of the breast, particularly if the breasts are large, can cause breast pain and also muscular pain in the back, neck and shoulders. When breasts sag due to ageing, not wearing a bra can further worsen the condition. And so, wearing a correctly fitting bra helps relieve breast pain and posture relating issues.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/putting-work-culture-back-on-track/article36173330.ece
30 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||PJTSAU to have its footprint in agri innovation ecosystem||Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) will join a few other agricultural universities in the country to have the distinction of housing agri incubators when its agri innovation hub, AgHub, is inaugurated on the campus here on Monday. AgHub operates in a hub and spoke model, where the innovation hub headquartered on the PJTSAU campus supports agritech startups through ‘Innovation-Incubation-Acceleration’ of the startups across the country, whereas the rural innovation spokes in Jagtial, Warangal and Vikarabad would cater to the promotion of rural entrepreneurship. The rural entrepreneurship for building agribusiness enterprises promoted by rural youth, women, farmers and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) would cater to the last mile delivery of innovations. They would also act as agritech innovation pilots, help capacity building of FPOs and building FPO-led enterprises for building up crop value chains in select by-crops of Telangana. As very few agri graduates and post graduates are inclined towards agri-preneurship as well the emerging opportunities in the startup ecosystem, PJTSAU has created AgHub, a first-of-its-kind innovation hub to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in agriculture, university officials said. The officials stated that the AgHub would focus on three core areas — innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem through promotion of startups, which includes sensitisation, ideation, innovation grants, incubation, acceleration and seed funding; research ecosystem through promotion of translational research to post-graduates, Ph.D scholars and scientists; and finally, rural innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem through promotion of rural entrepreneurs and FPOs. Recognising the need to foster entrepreneurial climate in Telangana, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) gave a grant of Rs. 9 crore to PJTSAU in April 2021 this year for a five-year programme. AgHub is a NABARD-funded incubator under its Rural Business Incubation Scheme.

Chandrasekhar Rao with the Home Minister Amit Shah and the Enforcement Directorate if he was sincere in his criticism. Mr. Tagore said both Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) were one and the same, indulging in fake fight in Telangana, while being super-friendly at the Centre. He was speaking at the TPCC meeting of the Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency on Sunday. He said Mr. Sanjay had been ranting about KCR’s corruption but had not lodged a complaint with their government at the Centre showing their strong bond. He said Mr. Sanjay’s padayatra was just a show piece and nothing serious can be expected from it as the BJP president would repeat the same allegations against KCR. His non-serious allegations would not have any takers unless they were followed by complaints with the Home Minister, CBI or the ED. If Sanjay wanted to prove his trustworthiness he had no other go but seek ED inquiry into the assets of KCR, Santosh Kumar, KTR and Gangula Kamalakar. The parliamentary constituency meeting discussed strengthening the party apart from the issues associated with Huzurabad elections. TPCC working president and Karimnagar Parliament incharge T. Jagga Reddy, AICC secretary Bose Raju, TPCC working president Mahesh Kumar Goud, former MP Ponnam Prabhakar, TPCC general secretary Harakara Venugopal and DCC president Satyanarayana were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tagore-dares-sanjay-to-seek-ed-probe-into-trs-corruption/article36173355.ece

30 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Adapting to new social dynamics at the office||Just as adjusting to WFH was difficult, getting back to offices will be equally difficult, says Purnima Nagaraja, psychiatrist and psychotherapist. People may be looking forward to getting back to work. But work has its own stresses and office dynamics, cautions Dr Purnima: “Any problem with colleagues while working online is going to resurface and it will be worse because you are face to face. So dynamics have to be worked out.” Since one is likely to be double-masked at work now, it is important to take it off for a five-minute breather and not get paranoid if someone coughs or sneezes. It could be fairly harmless, points out Dr Purnima and suggests that organisations should rearrange their culture and probably allow their staff to take power naps, “Either at their desks or provide camp-cots as a few MNCs do. People have got used to taking short naps and they need to refresh themselves. These are all new routines one has to rework into office life.” For those who are yet to start WFO, Dr Purnima suggest that they start a routine at least 15 days before they get back to work. Mental health matters During the second wave of the pandemic, the world went into Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). People suffered from depression, anxiety, bodyweight issues, eating disorders, relationship issues — all these popped up overnight and mushroomed into a mental health crisis. Dr Purnima stresses the importance of having counsellors on board in offices. “They need people to talk to other than HR and be able to destress themselves,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/adapting-to-new-social-dynamics-at-the-workplace/article36173331.ece

While SC Minister Rajaiah and BC Minister Eatala Rajender were unceremoniously removed from the Cabinet, charges against Mr. Malla Reddy are not being probed,” he said at a press conference along with Medchal district Congress president Nandikanti Sridhar. “Is the government ready for an open debate on the lands related to Survey No 650 of Gundlapochampally, cancellation of NAAC recognition to Malla Reddy Engineering College for submitting fake forms and the lands related to CMR Hospitals? If not, it would be construed that TRS bigwigs also have share in them,” he charged. Mr. Sravan asked Mr. Malla Reddy to specifically explain how the land in Survey No 650 had 22 acres and 8 guntas from 1965 to 2001 had increased to 33 acres and 16 guntas on the Dharani portal. Similarly, government lands in Jawahar Nagar where registrations were banned were now with Mr. Malla Reddy for establishing a hospital. How can the government grant university status to such institutions, he asked and demanded that the Minister explain these charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-has-caste-based-norms-on-graft-charges/article36173356.ece

For example, if two people in Excise Superintendent cadre work in the same Station, it becomes difficult to execute orders. Who will command whom?

After garlanding the statue of Ambedkar at Tank Bund, Mr. Narasimhulu proceeded to his house to stage the protest. Several SC leaders expressed solidarity with him. Addressing a gathering, Mr. Narasimhulu criticised the BJP as a casteist and religion-conscious party which was indifferent to other social issues. He said the BJP and Congress targeted the Dalit Bandhu because posts to TRS leaders would depend on the success of the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/one-day-fast-by-narasimhulu/article36173352.ece

30 August 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Rampur oustees stall work||Mallannasagar, the big dream of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to construct 50 tmcft capacity reservoir as part of Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS), was realised and the Godavari is being pumped for the past one week without any hindrance. All the oustees were vacated. But the question of paying compensation to the oustees is looming large with some of them stalling works in the name of compensation due to them and the authorities are not responding despite repeated appeals. On Saturday, some oustees of Rampur stalled work of Mallannasagar, saying some payments were due to them and the amount was not being released despite repeated appeals. “About 10 people in the village are yet to receive compensation. That includes Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) and for house structures as well. The standard answer from officials was ‘come tomorrow’ whenever we approached them. Payment was yet to be made for five house structures followed by Rs. 5.04 lakh for construction of house for two families and R&R package for four families. The oustees recently approached the MLA who contacted the officials. It is the Collector who is to take a final decision,” said Mr. Anjaneyulu, an oustee from Rampur village. Similar was the case of Tukkapur villagers who stalled works a day earlier. The oustees were reportedly promised a higher payment for losing their lands but the amount was not released, this time purportedly by the construction agency. “We have met the authorities several times, to no avail. I do not have trust in them and they may get transferred. Please tell me when you are going to pay,” was what a man was telling the representatives of a construction agency in a video that went viral.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rampur-oustees-stall-work/article36173358.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Bashing on the sidelines||The ongoing spat between Labour Minister Ch. Malla Reddy and Telangana Congress committee president A. Revanth Reddy was not without its supporters who too were indulging in bashing on the sidelines. In the midst of the tussle was the padayatra by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar which expanded the ring for more players to jump into the fray. Now, it is a three-cornered fight where guns are trained on each other to fire political salvos. Social Welfare Minister Koppula Easwar reacted to the emergence of Mr. Revanth Reddy and Mr. Sanjay as fit for firing practice solely because they were State presidents of their parties. How did they become State presidents? It was only because of the statehood for Telangana achieved by TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao.   Transport Minister P. Ajay Kumar had a taste of transport travails during a tour of Kothagudem district. His car was stuck in slush due to rain while returning after participating in a function near Dummugudem. It required use of force by villagers and his security personnel to wriggle the car out of the tight spot. The road communication for Ministers has often been quite risky when they tour districts. Recently, Panchayat Raj Minister E. Dayakar Rao also faced a freak accident when a cage wheel used in agriculture which was mounted on a tractor going ahead broke off and rolled down to hit his car.   Days before the launch of Praja Sangarama Yatra several State BJP leaders were complaining that the GHMC authorities were slapping fine on party supporters and leaders for arranging (displaying) flex posters, hoardings and banners in public places about the yatra . However, when drizzle started minutes after the flag-off of the yatra on Saturday, it proved to be a blessing in disguise and giving double protection – not only protecting party activists participating in the yatra from drenching as they held the posters over their heads but also saved the leaders who arranged the posters from paying the fine. As the activists removed the posters tied to the street-light and other poles along the yatra path, they left no evidence (posters) denying any opportunity to the GHMC officials to record evidence and slap fine on those who arranged the posters and hoardings.   The delay in giving promotions to employees in government departments, Secretariat departments in particular, is emerging a major controversy between the government and employees. The delay in promotions has led to employees staging an impromptu sit-in in front of Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar’s office a couple of days ago even as the exercise was said to have reached the final stages. Prompted by the development, staff of other departments are said to be planning similar agitations demanding that the government take initiatives to address their concerns too.  (N. Rahul, B.

Janmashtami is on Monday. Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said adequate security arrangements are in place.“We have deployed adequate numbers of personnel in all district across the national capital. We also urge people who will come out of their homes to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour and DDMA guidelines,” Mr. Biswal said. Senior officers said they will ask people to strictly wear mask and not gather at a public places. Siddhant Sharma (30), a resident of Vivek Vihar in east Delhi, said after the COVID outbreak, they perform ‘puja’ at home. “Before the pandemic, we used to go to the temples. Since the COVID outbreak, we have been worshipping at our home. We, especially our parents, do not go outside in crowded areas.

30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nearly 4.13 lakh register for 70K seats in DU||With one  day left for Delhi University’s undergraduate registration portal to shut, DU has already seen over 4.13 lakh  aspirants  registering for the various courses for the 70,000 seats that are on offer. Out of the total number of registrations, around 2.14 lakh have completed the payment process as on Friday, according to officials. Even though the registration process is set to close on August 31, the first cut-off list is expected on October 1. Officials said that students who are set to reappear for their board examinations in September will be allowed to update their marks before the cut-offs are declared. Pinki Sharma, DU’s Dean of Admissions, said: “We have to see finally how many complete the entire registration process by making the required payment. That will be our base for the number of students. While the schedule for all the cut-off lists is yet to be approved, the first cut-off list will be declared on October 1. This is being done so that students who are appearing for their boards in September have time to update their marks on the portal.” Due to a high number of students receiving above 95% in their Class 12 board results, the cut-offs are likely to see a spike, according to officials. The CBSE itself saw over 70,000 students scoring above 95% while in 2020, over 38,000 students had scored above 95%. High cut-off mark Last year, Lady Shri Ram College for Women had set a 100% cut-off for three courses including Psychology, Economics and Political Science. “The high marks received by students in their board examinations is bound to have an effect on the cut-off marks. The total number of students applying will also play a factor in determining the degree of how much higher the cut-offs will go. The final deliberations can begin only once the registration process closes,” said the principal of a South Campus college. Data provided by Delhi University had shown that in the first two weeks of registration, over 1.21 lakh students from the CBSE board had registered to the university. According to the data, over 8,300 students had registered under the ECA (Extra-Curricular Activities) category and 5,187 registrations were recorded under the sports category. No trials Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, trials will not be held by the university this year and admissions will be based on certificates of previous years. Rajeev Gupta, Chairperson of Admission in the varsity had earlier announced that the best three certificates from the last four years will be considered. “This modification has been brought to  ensure that students who were unable to participate in events last year due to the pandemic are also able to upload their three best certificates. This will give students a wider chance. They can upload certificated dated between May 1, 2017, and April 30 this year,” a senior official said. There are around 27 sports-listed and 14 categories under the ECA quota in the university, according to officials. The registration process for undergraduate admission to the various courses began on August 1. Apart from selected UG courses for which the Delhi University Entrance Test (DUET) will be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), admission to all other courses will be based on merit. Bachelor in Physiotherapy, Bachelor in Occupational Therapy, Bachelor of Prosthetics and Orthotics are some of the undergraduate courses for which the DUET will be conducted. Following the declaration of the first cut-off list, admissions to the various merit-based undergraduate courses in the university are expected to begin from October 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nearly-413-lakh-register-for-70k-seats-in-du/article36173249.ece
30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bus row: Gupta says Delhi govt. trying to silence ‘voice of truth’||BJP MLA Vijender Gupta on Sunday said the Delhi government was trying to silence the “voice of truth” in response to a criminal and civil defamation suit filed against him by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot for claiming irregularities in the procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation. “Instead of answering people on the financial irregularities in the DTC bus purchase scam, the AAP government has been going after me for exposing them. Both CM Arvind Kejriwal and his government are scared of the questions, which I am raising in the Delhi Assembly and on social media platforms,” Mr. Gupta said. He added that his tweets are always based on facts, which are from reliable sources. Gahlot’s alleges Mr. Gahlot has alleged that Mr. Gupta intentionally defamed and tarnished his reputation of the Transport Minister for malafide purposes and to gain political mileage. He has as sought Rs. 5 crore as damages in the civil defamation suit from Mr. Gupta for making such reckless remarks against him. The Transport Minister has further sought removal of all defamatory content posted by Vijender Gupta against him on Twitter and Facebook. The Delhi High Court, however, has refused to pass an ex-parte interim order directing the removal of allegedly defamatory statements and posts shared by Mr. Gupta on social media against Mr. Gahlot. The court on Saturday, granted 30 days to the BJP leader to respond to the suit as well as the application for an interim order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bus-row-gupta-says-delhi-govt-trying-to-silence-voice-of-truth/article36173242.ece

30 August 2021||New Delhi,||Investigation standard ‘very poor’ in number of Delhi riot cases: court||A Delhi court has observed that “the standard of investigation is very poor” in a large number of cases related to north-east riots. It has asked the Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East) and other officers to take notice of the issue and initiate immediate remedial action. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said: “It is noticed that after filing the half-baked chargesheets in court, the police hardly bothers about taking the investigation to a logical end. The accused persons, who have been roped in multiple cases continue to languish in jails as a consequence thereof”. “It is really painful to note here that a large number of cases of riots have been pending consideration on charge before this court and in a majority of cases the investigating officers [IOs] have not been appearing in court either physically or through videoconferencing at the time of consideration on charge,” the judge said. “In the morning of the date of hearing on the charge, they simply e-mail PDF of the chargesheet to the Special PP [public prosecutor] and leave it upon him to argue the matter on charge as it is without giving him an opportunity to go deep into the facts and the investigation conducted in the matter,” the court said. “After the filing of chargesheet in the Court, neither the IO nor the Station House Officer [SHO] nor the aforesaid supervising officers bother to see as to what other material is required to be collected from the appropriate authority in the matters and what steps are required to be taken to take the investigation to a logical end,” the court added. The court’s observations came while framing charges against one Ashraf Ali for allegedly attacking police officials with acid, glass bottles and bricks during the riot on February 25, 2020. “This case is a glaring example, wherein injured persons/victims are police personnel itself, yet the IO did not bother to collect the sample of acid/corrosive substance and to have its chemical analysis,” the court said adding, “the supervising officers have miserably failed to supervise the investigation”. On behalf of the accused, it was argued that he had been falsely implicated in the matter by the investigating agency, being a resident of the same locality. The accused argued that there is an “unexplained delay” of about two days in the registration of FIR, as the alleged incident took place in the afternoon of February 25, 2020, while the case FIR was registered on February 27. The court, however, noted that though there is no CCTV footage of the incident available on record.

30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jain inaugurates 10MW battery energy storage system||Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday inaugurated a 10 MW “Battery Energy Storage System” at the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) plant in Rohini. The system will help the city deal with its peak demand for power, he added. The system could be charged with solar and other renewable sources of energy. Mr. Jain said the new system of energy storage is designed in a way that it can be charged during off-peak power demand hours. The stored energy can be utilised during peak hours, thereby stabilising the whole grid against fluctuations. “The Delhi government is planning to create a 600 MW network of such power banks around the Capital, creating a power reserve that shall benefit the consumers in case of grid instability or a shutdown,” Mr. Jain said. He used the opportunity to reiterate that the Kejriwal government’s people-oriented governance model and its innovative solutions that often involve smart use of technology, can be replicated in other States. The Minister added that the facility costs around Rs. 55 crore but the government was looking to reduce costs by innovating further. “We will review the project in a month’s time and based on our learnings from its operation, we will plan out the replication of the system for other parts of the city,” Mr. Jain said.

30 August 2021||Delaware,||Biden honours U.S. troops killed in Kabul||President Joe Biden met in solemn privacy on Sunday with the families of the 13 U.S. troops killed in the suicide attack near the Kabul airport as the remains of their loved ones returned to U.S. soil from Afghanistan. First lady Jill Biden joined the president at Dover Air Force Base to grieve with loved ones as the “dignified transfer” of remains unfolded, a military ritual for those killed in foreign combat. The dead ranged in age from 20 to 31, and came from California and Massachusetts and states in between. They include a 20-year-old Marine from Wyoming who had been expecting his first child in three weeks and a 22-year-old Navy corpsman who in his last FaceTime conversation with his mother assured her that he would stay safe because “my guys got me.” Five were just 20, born not long before the attacks of September 11, 2001, that spurred the United States to invade Afghanistan in order to topple al-Qaeda and dismantle their Taliban hosts who ruled the country. The 13 service members were on the ground assisting a chaotic evacuation of Americans and of Afghans who helped the U.S. war effort and are now fleeing the Taliban after their return to power. “The 13 service members that we lost were heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others,” Mr. Biden said in a statement Saturday. “Their bravery and selflessness has enabled more than 1,17,000 people at risk to reach safety thus far.” Family members of the fallen often travel to Dover to be present as flag-draped transfer cases are taken off the transport plane that returns them to American soil. Aside from the quiet commands of honour guards who carry the transfer cases, the prayers of the chaplain typically are the only words spoken during the ritual. Mr. Biden’s three most recent predecessors as Presidents all attended dignified transfers for troops killed in the nearly 20-year Afghanistan war. It will be the Mr. Biden’s first time attending the ritual as President, but he has been here before. Mr. Biden attended a dignified transfer for two U.S. soldiers killed in a suicide blast at Bagram Airfield in the final months of his vice presidency in 2016. In 2008, while a Senator and at the request of the grieving family, he attended one for a soldier killed in a car bombing in Iraq.

Evacuation for 300 The U.S. has the capacity to evacuate the approximately 300 U.S. citizens remaining in Afghanistan who want to leave before President Joe Biden’s Tuesday deadline, senior Biden administration officials said on Sunday.

30 August 2021||Kabul,||Taliban kill Afghan folk singer in Baghlan||A Taliban fighter shot dead an Afghan folk singer in a restive mountain province under unclear circumstances, his family said on Sunday. The killing reignited concerns among activists that the insurgents would return to their oppressive rule in the country after their military blitz toppled the government. The shooting on Friday of the folk singer came in the Andarabi Valley for which he was named, an area of Baghlan province, some 100 km north of Kabul. The Valley had seen upheaval since the Taliban takeover, with some districts in the area coming under the control of militia opposed to the Taliban rule. The Taliban say they have since retaken those areas, though neighbouring Panjshir in the Hindu Kush mountains remains the only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces not under its control. The Taliban previously came out to Andarabi’s home and searched it, even drinking tea with the musician, his son Jawad Andarabi said. But something changed on Friday. “He was innocent, a singer who only was entertaining people,” his son said. “They shot him in the head on the farm.” His son said he wanted justice and that a local Taliban council promised to punish his father’s killer. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that the insurgents would investigate the incident, but had no other details on the killing. Andarabi played the ghichak, a bowed lute, and sang traditional songs about his birthplace, people and Afghanistan as a whole. A video online showed him at one performance, sitting on a rug with the mountains of home surrounding him. “There is no country in the world like my homeland, a proud nation,” he sang. “Our beautiful valley, our great-grandparents' homeland."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-kill-afghan-folk-singer-in-baghlan/article36172867.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||China to require foreign vessels to report in ‘territorial waters’||In a move that could have ramifications for the free passage of both military and commercial vessels in the South China Sea, Chinese authorities said on Sunday they will require a range of vessels “to report their information” when passing through what China sees as its “territorial waters”, starting from September 1. Over $5 trillion trade passes through the South China Sea, and 55% of India’s trade pass through its waters and the Malacca Straits, according to estimates by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). China claims under a so-called “nine dash line” on its maps most of the South China Sea’s waters, which are disputed by several other countries, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. While it remains unclear how, whether, and where China plans to enforce this new regulation starting Wednesday, the Maritime Safety Administration said in a notice “operators of submersibles, nuclear vessels, ships carrying radioactive materials and ships carrying bulk oil, chemicals, liquefied gas and other toxic and harmful substances are required to report their detailed information upon their visits to Chinese territorial waters,” the Communist Party-run Global Times reported. The newspaper quoted observers as saying “such a rollout of maritime regulations are a sign of stepped-up efforts to safeguard China’s national security at sea by implementing strict rules to boost maritime identification capability.” The notice said in addition to those vessels, any vessel deemed to “endanger the maritime traffic safety of China” will also be required to report its information, which would include their name, call sign, current position next port of call, and estimated time of arrival. The vessels will also have to submit information on the nature of goods and cargo dead weight. “After entering the Chinese territorial sea, a follow-up report is not required if the vessel’s automatic identification system is in good condition. But if the automatic identification system does not work properly, the vessel should report every two hours until it leaves the territorial sea,” the notice said. The Global Times noted the Maritime Safety Administration “has the power to dispel or reject a vessel’s entry to Chinese waters if the vessel is found to pose threat to China’s national security.” How China will enforce these rules remains to be seen, and in which waters of the sea. Indian commercial vessels as well as ships of the Indian Navy regularly traverse the waters of the South China Sea, through which pass key international sea lanes. While China claims most of its waters, marked by the “nine dash line” on its maps, Indian officials say Beijing has generally only sought to enforce its claims in response to the passage of foreign military vessels not in the entire sea but in the territorial waters around the islands, reefs and other features, some artificially constructed, that China claims. ‘Nine dash line’ The “nine dash line” is deemed by most countries as being inconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which only gives states the right to establish a territorial sea up to 12 nautical miles. The requirements of the latest notice will also be seen as being inconsistent with UNCLOS, which states that ships of all countries “enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea”. The MEA told Parliament in 2017 in response to a question on India’s trade in the South China Sea that over US$ 5 trillion global trade passes through its sea lanes and “over 55% of India’s trade passes through South China Sea and Malacca Straits.” “Peace and stability in the region is of great significance to India. India undertakes various activities, including cooperation in oil and gas sector, with littoral states of South China Sea,” the MEA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-to-require-foreign-vessels-to-report-in-territorial-waters/article36172864.ece
30 August 2021||Gaza City,||Israel strikes Gaza after fire balloons, clashes||The Israeli Air Force attacked two sites in Gaza on Sunday, the Army said, after Gazans clashed with forces on the border and launched incendiary balloons into southern Israel. The latest escalation came as Israel and Egypt continued to relax restrictions on commerce and travel imposed on the Gaza Strip, largely cut off by both countries since the Islamist movement Hamas seized the Palestinian enclave in 2007. Israeli “fighter jets struck a Hamas military compound used for manufacturing weapons and training as well as an entrance to a terror tunnel adjacent to Jabalia,” the Israeli Army said. “The strikes were in response to Hamas launching incendiary balloons into Israeli territory and the violent riots that took place yesterday,” it said. The Army said both incidents were “examples of how Hamas continues to employ terror tactics and target civilians.” There were no reports from the Gaza Strip of any casualties caused by the Israeli strikes. Speaking in Washington, where he met with U.S. President Joe Biden, Israeli PM Naftali Bennett said he held Hamas responsible for any unrest from the Palestinian enclave. “As I have already said, our actions in Gaza will serve our interests,” he told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-strikes-gaza-after-fire-balloons-clashes/article36172868.ece

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||The Afghan theatre and judging India’s responses||The Government’s decision to pull out all staff from the Indian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, including the Ambassador, has come in for much adverse comment among analysts and experts. It is argued that all major powers, including China, Russia and Iran, have maintained their missions. We would have been of much better help to our citizens and others had we remained there instead of packing our bags and leaving in such haste. At the least, it is said, we ought to have had a consular office at the airport, such as the one said to have been kept by the Americans. Some have even stated that the Taliban had requested India to maintain its embassy, meaning thereby that they had assured us of safety. This is a brief summary of the views of those critical of the Government. Where India stands This writer has no means of verifying whether or not the Taliban had made such an approach to the Government and would not like to second-guess its decision. But it seems to me, that on balance, the Government was justified in taking the decision that it did. First, India is not a major power, particularly when it comes to Afghanistan. We have not followed an independent or national interest-based policy towards the events in that country. This is true also of the previous Government. We have let the Americans decide our actions. To reiterate, we have never been a major player in Afghanistan. All we did was to support whatever government was installed in Kabul by the United States, first that of Hamid Karzai, and then Ashraf Ghani. Putting all the eggs in the Ghani basket was wrong. He might have been a good academic and authority on developing countries, but he was not a statesman or a good administrator, besides being corrupt and tolerating corruption on a massive scale. Also, he was not a free agent, having to do America’s bidding all the time. We poured money — $3 billion worth — in small and medium projects across the country, which has undoubtedly earned us goodwill among the people of Afghanistan. But that did not earn us any role in the political consultations or so-called reconciliation negotiations among the stakeholders. Feelers to the Taliban In other words, India has not been a relevant player in whatever mattered most in relation to Afghanistan. Criticism of the Government for not engaging the Taliban, not establishing contacts with them, is fully justified. It is reported in the media that the Government did engage the Taliban of late; the Government has not denied this claim. However, if it did begin talking to the Taliban, it was too little, too late. We should have been open about it and established contacts at the senior level of the Taliban. Other powers did — China, Russia and even Iran, a Shia-majority country openly talking to a Shia-hating Sunni terror group. Even America started talking, openly, without feeling in the least embarrassed, to the Taliban at the senior level; this is the terrorist group which is estimated to have killed 2,500 American military personnel since 2001. We were obviously not wanting to upset Ashraf Ghani. We could not talk to the Taliban because they refused to talk to the Government. As Ambassador Vivek Katju has argued, engaging does not imply endorsing. This was a serious lapse. We have to talk to people whom we may find distasteful to talk to, whether it is Pakistan, China or the Taliban. Even if we had had skeleton staff for consular work, how would those needing consular help have approached them? Nobody wanted to risk going out, everybody was afraid of gun-toting Taliban fighters. Online help? That could be extended from anywhere. Now, the Government has even cancelled all the visas issued so far; not a convincing way to render consular assistance. If the Taliban did give an assurance of safety and requested us not to close the embassy, how could we rely on their word? Did we, do we, have the means to force them to keep their word? The Americans have; they can still cause a huge amount of harm to the Taliban; they have assets on the ground to do so, and which they are not able to deploy fully to protect their people. The other groups And it is not just the Taliban. There are other groups in Afghanistan that are inimical to India — the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Jaish-e-Mohammed, as well as the Islamic State in Khorasan (ISK, or ISIS K). The Government had possibly intelligence about the threats posed by these groups. It is reported that they provided thousands of fighters to the Taliban in their jihad against foreign forces. They are a potent threat to us now, also perhaps to the Taliban as demonstrated by the horrific suicide bombing on August 26 which took the lives of at least 13 American military personnel and many more Afghans. Even if one of our citizens had been killed, there would have been an outcry. Foreign policy approach One can criticise the Government for some approaches it has followed in foreign policy, for example aligning so closely with America which has, in turn, has caused the Russians to be unhappy with us and which has led them to move closer to our enemy, China. Giving such huge importance to the Quad (composed of the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan) is also a questionable decision; the Quad is an American manoeuvre to contain China; it is an unabashedly anti-China arrangement which perhaps we ought not to have embraced so enthusiastically. But closing the embassy in Kabul does not fall among the questionable decisions. Chinmaya R.

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Towards a more humane police force||Earlier this month, Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana expressed concern at the degree of human rights violations in police stations in the country. He said that “the threat to human rights and bodily integrity is the highest in police stations”. He also said that “in spite of constitutional declarations and guarantees, lack of effective legal representation at the police stations is a huge detriment to detained persons”. However, a reality check shows that the picture is not so bleak and efforts are being made to improve the human rights protection regime in police stations. Deaths in police custody Deaths in police custody are indeed a matter of grave concern. Each such death must be seriously inquired into, to unravel the truth. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data reveal that though the number of custodial deaths varies year to year, on average of about 100 custodial deaths have taken place every year between 2010 and 2019. Of them, about 3.5 persons allegedly died due to injuries caused by policemen, 8.6 while escaping from custody, 28.1 due to suicide, and the rest due to various reasons like illness and injuries caused in road accidents. A judicial inquiry, which is mandatory for every suspicious custodial death, was conducted in 26.4 cases. Though every death in custody needs to be prevented, suspicious deaths which bring disrepute to the police system must be rooted out completely. The foremost measure to reduce instances of custodial violence is to reduce the number of arrests. The law on arrest says that arrest for offences punishable up to seven years of imprisonment should be made only when the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is necessary to prevent the person from tampering with evidence, to prevent the person from committing any further offence, etc. The Supreme Court held that each arrest must be necessary and justified; having the authority to arrest is alone not sufficient. In Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014), it was held that despite the offence being non-bailable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which relates to torture for dowry, arrest is not mandatory as per Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). In Special Action Forum v. Union of India (2018), the Court further held that the police officer shall furnish to the magistrate the reasons and materials which necessitated the arrest for further detention of the accused. The purpose of these checks is to ensure that the police does not abuse the power of arrest. NCRB data show that the ratio of the number of arrests to the number of IPC offences has decreased from 1.33 in 2010 to 0.96 in 2019 and despite an increase in total IPC offences, the actual number of arrests has reduced by more than five lakh in the last five years. Though the arrests in the previous years’ cases may increase to some extent, it is hoped that violence in custody will be checked if the amended law is implemented in letter and spirit. The National Police Commission (1977-81), the Law Commission in its 154th report (1996) and the Malimath Committee Report (2003), among others, and the Supreme Court in Prakash Singh v. Union of India (2006), have recommended that the investigating police should be separated from the law-and-order police to ensure better expertise in investigation. It was suggested that the separation start in towns which have more than 10 lakh population. It is believed that a separate wing will do more professional investigation and will not use unwarranted methods to extract confession from the accused. The Central Bureau of Investigation and the National Investigation Agency have already earned the reputation of the country’s premier investigation agencies. Though efforts have been made by some States in this direction, more resources are required in policing to implement the Court’s directions. One of the alleged reasons for using extreme methods is to extract a quick confession from the suspect. Though the total police force has increased in the last five years, the civil police mostly remains over-stretched. Therefore, unless investigating officers are increased in proportion to the number of serious offences, the quality of investigation may suffer, and the Malimath Committee’s recommendation that an investigating officer should preferably investigate no more than 10 cases every year will continue to remain a dream. Similarly, with the increase of newer types of crime like white collar crime and cybercrime, subject experts are needed to assist the police in the investigation. It cannot be denied that much has changed in the police consequent to the judgment in D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1996). In that case, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines to check custodial torture and increase transparency and responsibility of the police officer effecting arrest. Most of these guidelines such as providing information to a friend or relative about the arrest, medical examination, and permission to meet a lawyer have now been incorporated in the CrPC. Investigating officers mostly comply with them. Further, in order to check the violation of human rights, CCTV cameras have been installed in police stations. In Paramvir Singh v. Baljit Singh (2020), the Supreme Court has directed States to cover more area of each police station under CCTV cameras and have storage facility of audio-video recording for 18 months. An independent committee shall study the footage and periodically publish reports of its observations. Thus, sufficient steps are being taken to ensure that the abuse of human rights is minimised. Custodial death is perhaps one of the worst crimes in a civilised society governed by the rule of law. The guilty, therefore, must be punished severely for his misconduct and criminal act. NCRB data show that on average about 47.2 criminal cases were registered annually against policemen in last 10 years. Departmental action against errant officers is a rule in the police force, rather than an exception. The National Human Rights Commission also oversees deaths in custody due to human rights violations and recommends compensation in appropriate cases. Protecting human rights The police officers must know that their mandate is to protect human rights and not violate them. They need to be sensitised regularly and encouraged to employ scientific tools of interrogation and investigation like the lie detection test, narco test and brainfingerprinting test. The Home Ministry has recently linked the ‘police modernisation scheme’ with police reforms. Unless sufficient action is taken by the State governments and the police authorities, incentives in the form of additional funds will not be released. The CJI’s suggestion to install display boards on human rights to disseminate information about the constitutional right to legal aid and availability of free legal aid services may deter police excesses. Our commitment to the protection of human rights is unconditional and total. Many steps have been taken so far to check custodial violence and no stone shall be left unturned to eliminate such violence in toto. R.K. Vij is a senior IPS officer in Chhattisgarh.

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Seize this opportunity to institutionalise accountability||The Drugs Controller General of India granted Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Moderna and by Johnson & Johnson, in end June and early August 2021, respectively. In addition, India has an opportunity to receive 5 crore to 10 crore doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA-based vaccine, including through the COVAX mechanism co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi and the World Health Organization, before the end of 2021. What it covers Despite granting EUA for two vaccines and a third (that of Pfizer-BioNTech) being eligible for approval, uncertainty on supply and availability remains. One of the primary reasons for this is the Indian government’s indecision on requests for indemnity from these manufacturers. Indemnity translates to protection from legal proceedings and liabilities, against claims from people who may experience rare and serious Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI). COVID-19 vaccines are given EUA by the regulatory authorities after a thorough review of their safety and efficacy. However, even though vaccines meet safety parameters, as an immuno-biological substance, a vaccine can be associated with rare and serious AEFIs, some of which — such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and Myocarditis — are known. Other long-term impacts can only be known over a period of time. There is a need for increased and sustained vaccine supply in India. The country’s COVID-19 vaccination drive has been underperforming, and in the seven-and-a-half months since the drive was initiated, only 11% of the total population has been fully vaccinated, and 35.5% has received a single dose. A reason for this is the insufficient supply, which has consistently been less than the projected vaccine availability. The situation persists in spite of the certain regulatory modifications enacted by the Government to increase availability, including: fast track authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines approved by regulatory authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Europe, and those included in the World Health Organization (WHO) emergency use listing; waiving off requirements for bridging trials; and doing away with mandatory batch testing for vaccines manufactured abroad. Though these steps have led to the EUA of two additional vaccines, there is a lack of clarity on the definitive timeline on their availability in India. A key bottleneck is demand from manufacturers to grant indemnity. The core argument of the manufacturers is that they have been granted indemnity in their country of origin and have supplied vaccines to other countries only when granted indemnity. Vaccines under COVAX programme, further have an effective waiver of indemnity, through a separate mechanism that has been established. The existing provisions The idea of not granting indemnity is to hold vaccine manufacturers accountable. The manufacturers of the three vaccines currently being administered in India (Covishield, Covaxin, and Sputnik V) have not been granted indemnity. There seem to be two key thoughts that are delaying the Government’s decision on indemnity. First, the supply from these manufacturers is likely to be a very small proportion of total vaccine availability in the country. Second, it is likely that once foreign manufacturers are granted indemnity, manufacturers currently supplying vaccines might make similar demands citing the fair play rule. What do the existing rules and regulations suggest? The rules governing clinical trials in India specify that compensation must be granted in case of injury or death of a trial subject. However, though a similar compensation mechanism does not exist for AEFIs reported under the Government’s routine immunisation programme in the country or for any other vaccine-related injury; the legal responsibility for any vaccine-related injury, in the existing Indian regulations, lies with the manufacturers. Therefore, if manufacturers are granted indemnity for any COVID-19 vaccine, there has to be an alternative mechanism for people to make a legal claim for compensation. That essentially would mean the Government has to accept responsibility to provide compensation for any such proven injury or harm. Second, indemnity must not be construed as blanket protection for deliberate acts, fraud or instances of negligence. Third, if foreign vaccine manufacturers are granted indemnity, then manufacturers of the vaccines currently in use are likely to demand similar protections. Though at a broader level, the stand and unwillingness of these manufacturers to supply COVID-19 vaccines to any country unless granted indemnity is too rigid. However, beyond indemnity, India does have mechanisms in the current legal framework to ensure safety and legal remedy for any harm. First, the Drugs Controller General of India while granting registration certificates is empowered to take action against companies found to be in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Second, any individual seeking compensation after experiencing AEFI may directly file petitions before consumer courts and the High Courts. Third, recent amendments to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 disallow individuals but permit the regulatory bodies to initiate class action suits (cases representing groups of people who have suffered from the same loss) based on individual complaints. Opportunity in the crisis Requests for indemnity must be contextualised within the larger public interest. For citizens, as long as mechanisms to tackle and compensate for a potential harm are effective, it makes a marginal difference if they come from the Government or a manufacturer. Moreover, even in cases where manufacturers hold legal liability, the Government and regulators cannot wash their hands of their responsibility to protect public health. Therefore, India should examine safeguards instituted by countries which have granted indemnity to manufacturers, such as America’s Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) and similar schemes in the U.K., Canada, the European Union, and Singapore. The COVAX has underwritten the compensation burden to protect vaccine manufacturers and distributors. This discourse clearly needs a recalibration and provides the Indian government a valuable opportunity to institutionalise legal safeguards from vaccine injuries and possibly, at a larger level, improve overall patient and health-care safety in the country. Such institutional mechanisms need to be supplemented with dedicated funding from the Government. Such systems can then be applicable to any licensed vaccines in India. One of the characteristics of India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been delaying decisions till a point of crisis has emerged. Situations such as the novel coronavirus pandemic demand proactive and decisive problem-solving instead of burying our heads in the sand, hoping the problem will disappear. However, the debate on indemnity has far-reaching consequences. It must be seen as an opportunity far beyond the quantum of vaccines, to review legal provisions and create long-term mechanisms for protection from vaccine harm and making health services safer and accountable. It is a high time that a decision on granting (or not) indemnity to COVID-19 vaccines manufacturers is taken, before the situation morphs into another crisis and then a decision is rushed. The approach has to be to safeguard the interest of the citizen and convert this as an opportunity to reduce vaccine ‘licensing to availability gap’, increase vaccine availability, and establish institutional mechanisms.

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Disappearance of follow-up||Readers’ Editor proposes; reader disposes. Or so it seems. When I started this countdown series, the idea was to focus on journalism and its multiple challenges including the erosion of public trust, the elusive business model and a polarised polity. I also wanted to make the readers realise the differences in approach between audience-oriented editors and a news ombudsman. I have always been concerned about the vulnerability of journalists. In light of the Pegasus spyware scandal, I was looking at the digital surveillance industry. It is a broad and largely opaque network of companies that produce technology to monitor and track individuals. A recent report by the Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA), ‘Spyware: An Unregulated and Escalating Threat to Independent Media’, documented how the privatisation of digital repression is hurting free and independent media. I was also intrigued by the averment of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the two-member commission of inquiry headed by retired justice Madan Lokur set up by the West Bengal was unconstitutional. Intrinsic element of good journalism However, I was forced to pause my study of the spyware’s debilitating impact on journalism following a mail from a contributor-reader, K. Balakesari, former Member of the Railway Board. He raised questions about the report “Industry’s practices are against national interest, says Piyush Goyal” (August 14) in which the Union Minister targeted the Tata group. Mr. Balakesari wrote: “I would have expected that such a strong tirade by a senior Minister in the Union Cabinet against industry in general and particularly against a business house that is held up as a bellwether of corporate rectitude and sound business practices would have merited at least an editorial in The Hindu . I can understand industry wanting to downplay the incident because of various considerations but what prevented the media from taking the issue further in the public domain? Censorship or ‘voluntary’ self-regulation.” Mr. Balakesari is right; as follow-up is an essential and intrinsic element of good journalism. News manuals say that “follow-ups are needed because one story on its own may not cover all aspects of an event or controversy properly.” Mr. Balakesari said that the silence of industry leaders means that they either endorse what the Minister alleged or they are collectively spineless. His question to news organisations in general, and this newspaper in particular, was how this episode made a disappearing act. Shifting focus The lack of follow-up to the Minister’s uncharacteristic observation against a conglomerate was neither the result of censorship nor self-regulation. Off-the-cuff remarks by those in power have become commonplace. The news cycle has become relentless and many significant developments — including the fall of Kabul and the Finance Minister’s announcement of the Rs. 6 lakh crore national monetisation plan for infrastructure assets — took place in the days following the strange observation of the Commerce and Industry Minister. The media was forced to focus on these emerging issues. While I can give any number of reasons for the media not following up on Mr. Goyal’s attack on the Tatas, including the factors that forced the Confederation of Indian Industry to pull down the video from its YouTube channel, I value the idea of follow-up. It helps to beat the compulsions imposed by the relentless news cycle and tries to keep the focus on holding those in power accountable. One of the biggest successes in journalism in recent times is the ‘Spotlight’ investigation by the Boston Globe reporters. The meticulous documentation by the reporters of sexual abuse by Catholic priests won them a Pulitzer Prize. This investigation highlighted the importance of follow-up stories as part of the news agenda and helped to circumvent the tyranny of the news cycle. The International Journalists’ Network has a section dedicated to follow-ups in its journalism basics section. It argues that the partial decline in follow-up stories is due to slashed newsroom budgets and the warp speed of the Internet age. It says that a structured follow-up mechanism helps a newsroom make the competition follow it. If holding power accountable is the central tenet of journalism, and if newsrooms are not going to be swept by the power of algorithmic decision-making and Big Data, follow-ups are the best journalistic tool. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/disappearance-of-follow-up/article36172857.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||The purpose of literature||Delhi University recently dropped Mahasweta Devi’s renowned short story, ‘Draupadi’, and two Dalit writers — Bama and Sukirtharani — from the BA English (Hons) syllabus. Several writers, academics and media outlets have reacted adversely to this news. Devi’s short story details the plight of tribals and remains relevant to this day. Bama’s Karukku will forever be remembered for its searing account of her life of subjugation and perennial ostracism. Sukirtharani’s poems lay bare her Dalit feminist politics. These are important voices that any student of literature or the Humanities ought to engage with in contemporary India. And it is often through university syllabi that young minds are introduced to such writing which may not feature in the usual bestseller lists or other traps laid out by corporate publishing intended to endear readers to certain types of books – lifestyle, self-help and ‘how to do’ guides – which don’t encourage critical questioning and thinking. An introduction to who we are At this point, we must ask: what is the purpose of literature in a classroom really? Literary studies have moved far beyond merely imparting tools of literary analysis to students in the classroom. Studying literature no longer means analysing plot, character and setting, and writing long prosaic answers in exams alone. These are important elements to understand a text in its entirety but literature is also an introduction to where and how we live and the challenges that face our time and society. In many ways, literature is an introduction to who we are, or ought to be, as people. All over the world, literature syllabi are being redrawn to ensure inclusion and diversity. The writings of the authors who have been dropped from the course could be subjected to traditional literary analysis. At the same time, they also identify and highlight concerns that aid a socio-cultural understanding of the issues that plague Indian society. These texts, however, are not to be read as sociology camouflaging as literature. We must discuss their artistic and literary merits too. I have encountered several realities of this nation through these writings with little or no experience of the terrain the writers have written about or the caste atrocities they have faced. Their writing has been a great education to say the least. At the same time, history is archived in the life story of the individual and other characters in their fiction. The decision-makers at Delhi University could argue that all syllabi should be regularly updated. While that cannot be contested, the texts that replace the above writers should invite further scrutiny. Also, it should be asked why only these texts were chosen to be axed while others were left untouched. This act of elimination will hopefully motivate several to read these writers and explore their work with greater interest. The same happened in the past when texts such as A.K. Ramanujan’s Three Hundred Ramayanas and Rohinton Mistry’s A Fine Balance were dropped from university syllabi under political pressure. Needless to say, banned books have always aroused great curiosity amongst readers. Reading Indian writing It was a welcome move by Delhi University to teach the writings of Mahasweta Devi and Bama as part of the English syllabus and wean such courses away from their excessive Eurocentrism. To read Indian literature in translation is one of the best introductions to the country and its enormous literary wealth. Through such a practice, students are also taught to read and appreciate literature in the comfort of a familiar context and become informed citizens. While world literature has its own merits, an introduction to Indian writing and especially those that help us to be ‘critical insiders’ (a term that the writer U.R. Ananthamurthy used) will go a long way in creating passionate learners. Isn’t that the purpose of education after all?

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||A fine line||The need for infrastructure development in the Himalayan region rubs up against the environmental and ecological challenges that they pose. The Uttarakhand government has for decades envisaged hydroelectric projects as the way forward to power the State, premised on the region’s undulating topography. However, the rising frequency of intense rains has been contributing to landslips, avalanches, and the loss of lives and property. All of this has a bearing on hydroelectric projects being situated in terrain prone to environmental shocks. In the aftermath of the devastating Kedarnath floods of 2013, the Supreme Court ordered a halt to hydroprojects in the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins pending a review on whether they exacerbated the damage. The last few years have seen considerable friction on this issue, especially because the future of hydroprojects is closely linked to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) programme. For the health of the river, it must be allowed to flow unimpeded, and hydropower projects are an obstacle. A committee of experts recommended to the Court that almost all hydropower projects, cleared by the Government for construction, be scrapped. Proponents of six of these projects approached the Court on the grounds that they had obtained prior clearances and scrapping projects would entail significant losses. Since then, the Centre has been trying to walk a fine line between salvaging some of them while acknowledging, at least on paper, the environmental costs. There have been divisions even within various Central ministries: the Water Resources Ministry, which manages the NMCG, is opposed to hydropower projects while the Ministry of Power roots for them. Through the years, whenever a group of experts has recommended a cessation of infrastructure development, there is always another group of experts, usually affiliated to government institutions, that differ and recommend the opposite. The avalanche in Chamoli this February, that destroyed two power projects and killed at least 200, was only the latest reminder of the fraught risks that committees and their tussles inadequately account for. The Centre has been saying that it is not too keen on new hydropower projects and is only permitting those that are at least 50% complete to go ahead given the sunk costs. While such statements have been made in Parliament, they do not appear in the latest affidavit to the Court; so there are concerns on whether this is indeed a lasting policy commitment. Uttarakhand, like all other States, is not immune from the demands for reliable power and infrastructure from its people. Along with better dialogue, power companies and the Centre must inspire greater trust in the residents of the region: infrastructure development will have to necessarily account for the region’s constraints.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-fine-line/article36172846.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Rape and insensitivity||The narrative of violence against women in India continues unhindered. On August 24, an MBA student was gangraped near Chamundi Hills in Mysuru, sending shock waves around the country. Four men and a juvenile have been arrested from Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu in connection with the rape. The men tried to rob the girl and her friend but on finding no valuables, they raped her and assaulted him. Earlier this month, a minor Dalit girl was raped, murdered and hurriedly cremated in Delhi while the parents were kept away. In July, two minor girls were raped in Goa. Despite stringent laws in place, especially after the 2012 Nirbhaya case in Delhi, a rape occurs every 16 minutes in India, according to the latest records available with the National Crime Records Bureau. To make matters worse, sexist, misogynist, survivor-blaming remarks and inept measures invariably follow a heinous crime against women. Girls are pulled up for wearing ripped jeans, and staying out late. Sections of society, in their warped thinking, often argue the survivor could have evaded the assailants by adhering to conservative norms: wearing traditional attire, skipping parties, returning home by sunset. Parents are blamed for not bringing up their girl children with ‘Indian values’. After the Mysuru rape, a similar pattern ensued. The Karnataka Home Minister, Araga Jnanendra, ‘joked’ about rape while accusing the Congress of ‘politicising’ it. He subsequently retracted his insensitive remarks after State Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai stepped in. Mysore University did a flip-flop too, first announcing that girls would not be allowed to step off the Manasagangotri campus after 6.30 p.m., and then withdrawing the missive. Activists cried foul because the action showed the intent to blame everything on the girl. To do right by women, courts too should play a role, but despite some soul-searching as in Aparna Bhat & Ors vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. , where the Supreme Court admitted to the “entrenched paternalistic and misogynistic attitudes that are regrettably reflected at times in judicial orders and judgments,” other verdicts have fallen short. Recent rulings by the Chhattisgarh High Court and the Kerala High Court, reiterating that any sexual act by a man against his wife, even if it involved force, is not rape, may be correct in law, but served to highlight the lacuna in the penal code, which does not recognise marital rape. In June, the Supreme Court had to order police protection to a couple in a live-in relationship who were denied relief by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Women have come a long way, fighting for their rights against patriarchal mindsets and other social ills. Instead of curbing their freedom, society and the state must ensure protection of women both in public and private places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rape-and-insensitivity/article36172847.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Prohibition goes in Tamil Nadu||Though Prohibition will remain suspended in Tamil Nadu from to-morrow, bars will not be allowed in hotels and restaurants, according to a decision taken by the State Government [Madras, Aug. 29]. Social clubs will, however, be permitted to serve liquor to its members as hitherto. But the license fee in their case will be doubled from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000. In addition, these organisations will be required to pay a club fee of Rs. 2 (instead of Rs. 1.60) for every 50 bottles of liquor served to its members. An official spokesperson explained there were at present 22 social clubs in the State holding two kinds of licences, F.L.2 and F.L.2-A. The former authorised them to serve drinks to its members, both Indian and foreign, while the latter restricted it to foreigners alone. This discrimination would be removed from to-morrow and there would be a single licence for all clubs. Western-style hotels holding F.L.-3 licences are now permitted to supply liquor to foreign tourists and foreign residents for consumption within their private rooms at the hotels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/prohibition-goes-in-tamil-nadu/article36172855.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Align your investments with goals||In the month of May in 2019, I was returning from Ahmedabad by Duronto Express. This was a non-stop train between Ahmedabad and Mumbai. A fellow passenger wanted to get down at Borivali. However, he was not aware that the train wouldn’t stop there. He had two options, either to jump off the train at Borivali station, which was obviously a riskier option, or to travel all the way up to Mumbai Central and then make his way back to Borivali. He opted for the latter and had to make arrangements to travel to Borivali. His time got wasted, money spent and energy drained. All because there was a mismatch between the station he wished to get down and the train he had booked. Similarly, most of us end up making mistakes while investing. Years ago, a middle-aged couple called me up. They were living in a smaller city of Gujarat. From that city’s perspective, they were wealthy. Apart from the bungalow they lived in, the total value of their assets was about Rs. 5 crore. The assets consisted mainly of real estate — in the form of a plot of land, two residential properties and a few shops. Of the Rs. 5-crore assets, only about Rs. 25 lakh of investment was liquid in the form of bank FDs, shares, mutual funds and other investments, which could be encashed immediately. The rest was all in illiquid, indivisible real estate. The reason they called me was because they needed Rs. 47 lakh to fund their daughter’s forthcoming education abroad. They had two choices, either they could take an education loan or liquidate a piece of land costing approximately Rs. 90 lakh. There was obviously a mismatch between their financial goals and investments. Most of us have never made an appropriate list of our financial goals — those goals for which we are saving and investing money. Because of this habit, we are unknowingly exposed to a mismatch risk. Aim for optimum returns All of us want to invest in instruments that generate higher, faster and maximum returns. Between an aeroplane and a bicycle, which one would travel higher, faster? Obviously, the aeroplane. However, if we were to travel to a place that is 3 km away, which one would be our choice of transport? Naturally, we would opt for a bicycle ride. Hence, always focus on optimum returns and not on maximum returns. What’s the point in generating maximum returns if those are not going to be of use to us when we need them? Every time we invest, we should ask ourselves the question, “For which investment is this financial goal?” If the investment is not aligned to a financial goal, then unknowingly, we are exposed to a risk of mismatch.  Every year in the months of January, February and March, I receive a plethora of queries about investing in instruments that offer investor tax benefits. In reality, these are the worst months to invest for tax saving. Several financial products are unveiled to lure investors into investing during this time. Due to lack of time, most people end up investing in instruments that are of no use to them. A 65-year-old widow without any dependents purchased a life insurance product by paying a hefty premium. A couple repaying a home loan invested in a five-year bank FD with lock-in. They were any way getting benefit for repaying the principal amount of the home loan. Many salaried individuals exhaust their tax-saving limit when they contribute to EPF and pay school tuition fees for their children. They don’t need to invest more. Senior citizens can consider investing in the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme. Families with a girl child can consider the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojna. Our Income Tax Act is brilliantly enacted. If we plan at the beginning of the financial year and choose an instrument that would help us achieve our financial goals, we will surely find one that will help us with both tax savings and achieving financial goals. We RIAs (registered investment advisors with SEBI) often joke, “Most people die in India in the month of Jan., Feb., March.” This is sarcasm. We say this because most life insurance policies are sold in these months to save on income tax. Plan in advance Someone rightly said, “If we fail to plan, we plan to fail.” Plan your investments, link them to financial goals, and give direction to them. Only then we will enjoy the fruits.  (The writer is a financial planner & author of Yogic Wealth)   What’s the point in generating maximum returns if those are not going to be of use to us when we need them?

30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Wanna become rich or achieve your goals, or both?||To say that we live in a technology-driven world is axiomatic. First-person view drone and virtual reality have brought excitement to our lives. The question is: Will new-age investments such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) bring the same enthusiasm to our personal finance? In this article, we discuss why traditional investments are appropriate to achieve life goals and new-age investments (or alternatives) are best kept in the ‘explore’ portfolio. Traditional vs alternatives Equity and bonds are considered as traditional investments. You can add real estate to this group if you accept the argument that people traded in real estate even before they invested in equity and bonds. All other investments are considered as alternatives. This category has witnessed blistering additions in the last two decades — private equity, volatility-based products as well as wine and antiques for those who wanted to convert their passion into investments. And now, it is cryptos and NFTs. Before you invest in alternatives, consider whether you are investing to achieve a goal or whether you are exploring avenues to get rich. Of course, all of us want to be rich, but only some are fortunate enough to become successful entrepreneurs or investors. So, you may want to first set up a path to achieve your goals and then explore avenues to getting rich. By goals, we mean buying a house and funding your child’s college education. It is preferable to invest in traditional investments to achieve your goals. Why? For one, traditional investments have an established market and, therefore, are easy to sell. You can redeem your equity mutual funds because there are regulations in place to do so. For another, traditional investments do not exhibit the level of volatility seen in traded alternatives such as cryptos. Perceived valuation You can consider alternative investments as part of your ‘explore’ portfolio. This as a portfolio where you invest in alternatives to earn higher returns or derive returns from non-traditional factors such as volatility and inflation. Investing in cryptos, NFTs and passion assets such as arts and antiques fall into this ‘explore portfolio’. This means that your primary savings must be in traditional investments. Your additional savings can be in alternative investments of your choice. You must, however, conduct your due diligence before investing in alternatives. This is important given the short track record for these assets and the continual development in process and technology to provide credibility to these investments. Note that an asset’s price is based on its perceived value. You may buy, for instance, an NFT of the Magpie-robin, an endangered species that lives in Seychelles. These so-called ‘collectibles’ may be valuable when it catches collectors’ fancy, given that there will be only limited tokens sold by Nature Seychelles. But their price will depend on perceived value. True, even financial assets trade on perceived value, but there is an underlying cash flow as a reference point. Bond investments have interest income; you can depend on company earnings to arrive at a stock value. This provides some ground to justify the valuation process of traditional investments.  Exploring newer investment avenues is fine, but considering alternatives for your goal-based investments is quite another argument. You would do well to allocate not more than 25% of your total investments to alternatives as part of the ‘explore’ portfolio. Note that these investments could be illiquid; you may be forced to sell at a lower price based on the urgency with which you want to convert them into cash. It will be interesting to observe how individuals who prefer the touch-and-feel of real assets such as land and gold embrace digital assets such as cryptos and NFTs. Only time will tell which will turn good — traditional investments set up to achieve your goals, or alternatives investments that have the potential to make you rich, or perhaps both.

30 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||Sania flies the flag for sporting mothers||Six-time Grand Slam champion Sania Mirza embarks on yet another journey carrying the message that an athlete’s life doesn’t stop on attaining motherhood. The 34-year-old Sania is partnering CoCo Vandeweghe at the US Open, which begins on Monday. Her father-cum-coach Imran Mirza says Sania is going through another critical phase of her career. “As long as she wants to play, she will. But, her priorities have obviously changed a bit after the birth of son Izhaan. “She is mature enough to know what she wants and what is good for her and her family,” Imran said during a virtual interaction with fans and Shivani Gupta, co-author of Sania’s biography Ace Against Odds . “Yes, she will have to make a few adjustments. It will be a tough ride. If she wins one more Grand Slam, and even if she competes on level terms with the best in the world, she would be making a very strong point — life doesn’t stop after motherhood,” he said. “We (family) have always made her smile, even in defeat, with the right dose of humour. Nasima (mother) and I have always ensured we never put pressure on her by way of expectations,” Imran said. To be in rhythm at the highest level, a player needs at least 30-40 matches a year. But, due to injury, pregnancy followed by her son’s birth and then the pandemic, she had only played around 25 matches in the last four years, Imran said, adding “that’s just not enough.” “I am more than satisfied with her achievements. It is up to her to take a call on how long she will play and balance her role as a mother as well as her family commitments,” he said. “But, Sania is keen to prove what a mother can achieve in the world of sport. I’m happy she wants to make a point and she has the entire family’s support,” Imran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sania-flies-the-flag-for-sporting-mothers/article36172838.ece

30 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Another feather in Sajan’s cap||Ace swimmer Sajan Prakash, after becoming the first Indian to qualify directly for the Olympics, has achieved another distinction in his career. The 26-year-old Sajan was the only Indian to be picked for the International Swimming League (ISL) 2021 season, which got underway in Naples on Saturday. Held up However, Sajan who has been undergoing ayurvedic treatment in Thrissur for the past one week, could not join his team — Energy Standard — right away. But he is confident he will be able to figure in the playoffs likely to be held in November. “It is a great recognition for me as well as Indian swimming. We need to take part in such leagues and hopefully we can see more Indians in the ISL in the near future. “ISL is all about short sprints and they know I am good at it and picked me for Energy Standard, which won the ISL in 2019. I am part of a 30-member team. Hopefully I will be able to swim in the playoffs,” he said. Sajan said his shoulder was better after the ayurvedic treatment. “I have a two-week treatment schedule for the neck and shoulder injuries that have been troubling me for the last one year, even during the Olympics. After a week of treatment I am feeling much better,” he said. Learning curve Sajan said the Olympics had been a great learning curve, but that he had been mentally and physically exhausted by the time he reached Tokyo. “To be honest, I was exhausted as I had spent my energy trying to qualify for the Olympics. I cannot say I was entirely happy with my Olympic performance even though I was able to better my 100m butterfly timing. It was a great learning curve and it will stand me in good stead at future events,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/another-feather-in-sajans-cap/article36172835.ece
30 August 2021||LONDON,||Son sends Spurs to the top; Greenwood nets United’s winner||Son Heung-min sent Tottenham Hotspur to the top of the Premier League as the South Korean’s free-kick clinched a 1-0 win against Watford on Sunday. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have made a flawless start to the new domestic season and sit two points clear of second-placed West Ham after a third successive victory. Son settled a hard-fought clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium when his free-kick caught Watford keeper Daniel Bachmann out of position in the 42nd minute. Three consecutive 1-0 wins, including one against champion Manchester City, as well as progress in the Europa Conference League, suggest Tottenham could enjoy a better season than expected. Meanwhile on Saturday, Chelsea held out with 10 men for the entire second-half to frustrate Liverpool as the heavyweight clash ended 1-1 at Anfield. Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Hertha Berlin 5-0 on Saturday, with the Poland striker passing the milestone of 300 goals for the defending Bundesliga champion. Juventus slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to promoted Empoli in Serie A on Saturday in its first match of the post-Cristiano Ronaldo era.  The results: Premier League: Burnley 1 (Wood 61) drew with Leeds 1 (Bamford 86); Tottenham 1 (Son 42) bt Watford 0.   On Saturday: Premier League: Aston Villa 1 (Buendia 13) drew with Brentford 1 (Toney 7); Brighton 0 lost to Everton 2 (Gray 41, Calvert-Lewin 58-pen); Liverpool 1 (Salah 45+5-pen) drew with Chelsea 1 (Havertz 22); Newcastle 2 (Wilson 55, Saint-Maximin 90) drew with Southampton 2 (Elyounoussi 74, Ward-Prowse 90+6); Norwich 1 (Pukki 44-pen) lost to Leicester 2 (Vardy 8, Albrighton 76); West Ham 2 (Fornals 39, Antonio 88) drew with Crystal Palace 2 (Gallagher 58, 70).

30 August 2021||New York,||History beckons as Djokovic chases sporting immortality||Top-ranked Novak Djokovic will try to complete the first calendar-year men’s singles Grand Slam in 52 years and become the all-time men’s leader in Slam titles by capturing the US Open. Not since Rod Laver in 1969 has the feat been achieved and the chance at tennis history has fuelled Djokovic’s fire. “I know how big of an opportunity is in front of me,” the Serbian star said. “I’m very motivated to play my best tennis. I’m hugely inspired and motivated by that, no doubt.” Missing stars Five past champions won’t be in the field when the showdown begins on Monday at Flushing Meadows, with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka, Juan Martin del Potro and 2020 winner Dominic Thiem absent due to injuries. That leaves the main obstacles in Djokovic’s path to a 21st career Slam crown as a set of rising 20-something talents trying to build their trophy hauls — Russia’s second-ranked Daniil Medvedev, Greece’s third-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas and fourth-ranked Olympic champion Alexander Zverev of Germany. After opening against a qualifier, Djokovic could face sixth seed Matteo Berrettini in a quarterfinal, Zverev in a semifinal and Medvedev or Tsitsipas in the final. US Open 2019 runner-up Medvedev, who won a tune-up title at Toronto, sees Djokovic as a clear favourite. Tsitsipas is proud of his ranking and his Roland Garros finals run. “Three is a number that’s very significant,” Tsitsipas said. “It pushes me so much to sustain that, to want to go the extra mile.” Zverev, last year’s US Open runner-up, won the Cincinnati title and beat Djokovic in the Olympic semifinals. He’s on a 12-match win streak. Eyes on Osaka Meanwhile, women’s defending champion Naomi Osaka seeks her third US Open title in four tries. What’s uncertain is whether New York will see Osaka rediscover her dominant form. The 23-year-old Japanese star lit the flame in the Olympic cauldron at the Tokyo Games and lost in the third round. Since Japan she has played only two matches ahead of the Open.  Ashleigh Barty, in her 83rd consecutive week atop the world rankings, has rolled to wins at Wimbledon and Cincinnati, putting her on best form entering the Flushing Meadows fortnight.  Men 2-Medvedev vs. Gasquet 3-Tsitsipas vs. Murray 5-Rublev vs. Karlovic 18-Bautista Agut vs. Kyrgios   Women 2-Sabalenka vs. Stojanovic 3-Osaka vs. Bouzkova 9-Muguruza vs. Vekic 12-Halep vs. Giorgi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-chases-calendar-grand-slam/article36173074.ece
30 August 2021||KOCHI,||Shaili Singh — grit and determination aplenty||When Shaili Singh spotted Swede Maja Askag training at the long jump area during the recent under-20 Worlds in Nairobi, she got a little excited. Askag, the junior European champion, had a wind-aided 6.80m just weeks earlier and was the favourite for gold (which she would go on to win) but Shaili did not let herself be intimidated. “She started showing off a bit on the runway. I told her, 'that's your big opponent’,” revealed her coach Robert Bobby George in a chat with The Hindu . “She replied, 'I won't be scared even if her dad comes. She doesn't know... I'm Shaili Singh'.” Bobby was stunned. “Shaili is like a tiger. She told me that she would fight till the last drop of her blood. She can tolerate a great amount of pain— mental and physical. Anju was also like that,” said Bobby. Now, it looks like there could be more such bravehearts in Jhansi (UP) where Shaili comes from. “She says there are many children like her back home, who are talented like her. That's something amazing. If you look around, there could be 10 more Shailis,” said Bobby. And he is eager to have a look. “What I need is support... and you give a free hand to experts to spot talent. Anju can go and shortlist athletes, we can conduct a small camp and scrutinise. We need everybody on board, the federation (AFI) and the SAI. Bobby’s big dream “My dream is to have six girls who are capable of crossing 6.50m from my academy (Bengaluru's Anju Bobby Centre where he's head coach and Anju the mentor). It's possible, but I need resources, funds and other support too.” Clearly, Shaili is as much of an asset for Bobby as he is for her. “It's the dream of any coach if he can execute the plan and produce the best results... I'm happy in that sense,” said Bobby, who expects Shaili to be India's first seven-metre jumper in a few years. “I would like to call this my second wind.” Bobby is the only coach in the country who has produced two World championship medallists (the other being his wife Anju George — 2003 Worlds, long jump bronze). And Shaili, despite being just 17, has been able to help her struggling mother and siblings back home. “She is supporting her family with the scholarship money she gets, supporting her brother's studies. And because of migraine, her mother's tailoring work is gone, so Shaili is supporting her too,” said Bobby.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shaili-singh-grit-and-determination-aplenty/article36172818.ece
30 August 2021||New Delhi,||Myneni replaces Nagal in Davis Cup squad||Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal has withdrawn from the country’s upcoming away Davis Cup tie against Finland citing a hip injury and has been replaced by Saketh Myneni in the five-man squad for the indoor contest on September 18-19. Nagal, who had lost in the first round of the US Open Qualifiers, communicated to the All India Tennis Association (AITA) on Saturday that doctors have advised him not to play on the hard courts. Non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal and chairman of the selection committee, Nandan Bal then discussed the replacement and agreed upon the name of Myneni, who last played for India in 2018 in the World Group Play-off tie against Serbia. “Sumit Nagal has written to us that he can’t play this Davis Cup tie due to a hip injury he sustained after the US Open qualifiers. Myneni can play both singles and doubles, so he has been added to the squad,” AITA secretary-general Anil Dhupar said. Myneni has played six Davis Cup ties for India in eight nominations. He was part of the Indian squad that beat Pakistan in Kazakhstan in 2019 but did not get to play any match. “I have been training and playing practice matches. It’s good to be back in the team,” Myneni said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/myneni-replaces-nagal-in-davis-cup-squad/article36172832.ece
30 August 2021||London,||You cannot have four rabbits from 8-11: Vaughan||Mohammed Shami’s unbeaten half-century at Lord’s gave India a “false sense of security about their tail” and they cannot have “four rabbits from 8-11”, said former England captain Michael Vaughan after the visitors suffered an innings defeat in the third Test. Vaughan feels senior off-spinner R. Ashwin’s inclusion in the playing XI can solve the problem. “Surely they have to pick Ravi Ashwin next week. You cannot have four rabbits from 8-11. The resistance at Lord’s lulled them into a false sense of security about their tail. In reality, they cannot have Mohammed Shami coming in at eight,” Vaughan wrote in a Facebook post. Shami had smashed an incredible 56 not out off 70 balls in the second Test to take India to 298 for 8 declared, setting a target of 272, which the hosts failed to chase. “Ashwin has to come in ...They got away with it at Lord’s, you can’t have four rabbits at 8, 9, 10 and 11. Ashwin has to play, he has got 5 Test match hundreds, he has got 400 Test wickets, he has to come into this Test team,” Vaughan told BBC’s Test Match Special Podcast. “In the Indian dressing room, there is a lot of experience. The last two games, two really good venues and two venues where you can say spin has played a part historically. I would be staggered if R Ashwin is not on the team sheet on Thursday morning.” Joe Root has been simply sensational, smashing a hundred in each of the last three Tests, to inspire England to a come-from-behind win at Headingley and also in the process become the country’s most successful Test captain. “Well done to Joe Root for becoming England’s most successful Test captain of all time,” Vaughan wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/you-cannot-have-four-rabbits-from-8-11-vaughan/article36173377.ece
30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jadeja taken for precautionary scans||All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was taken to a hospital in Leeds on Saturday for precautionary scans to know the extent of a knee injury he sustained during the third Test against England. Jadeja apparently hurt his knee while fielding during the England innings on the second day of the match. Jadeja posted a picture of himself, wearing hospital apparels, on his instagram page with a caption “Not a good place to be at”. As of now, the Indian team management doesn’t seem to be too worried as it might not be “very serious”. The Indian team is supposed to leave for London on Monday and if the scan reports do not reveal anything major, Jadeja will accompany the team. The fourth Test starts on September 2 at the Oval and there is a possibility of R. Ashwin replacing Jadeja on a track which is known to offer help to the slow bowlers. Meanwhile, pacer Mark Wood and all-rounder Chris Woakes are set to be added to the England squad for the fourth Test against India after regaining full fitness, head coach Chris Silverwood said on Sunday. Wood had hurt his right shoulder while fielding during the second Test at Lord’s, while Woakes has recovered from the heel injury that has kept him out of international cricket since the ODI series against Pakistan in July. Woakes played a domestic T20 game on Friday and will be a welcome addition to the squad in the absence of key players such as Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer. “Both of them have come through fine. Wood was bowling yesterday morning. He will be available for selection and Woakes has played so he becomes available again,” Silverwood said a day after England’s series-levelling win over India at Leeds. The fourth Test begins on Sept. 2 at the Oval. Wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler could miss the remaining two Tests to attend the birth of his second child.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jadeja-taken-for-precautionary-scans/article36173070.ece

30 August 2021||MUSCAT,||Yashasvi and Hardik drive Mumbai’s win||Contrasting fifties by opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (82, 79b, 5x5, 5x6) and wicketkeeper-batter Hardik Tamore (51 n.o., 70b, 4x4) ensured spinners’ impressive efforts did not go waste as Mumbai won the first one-dayer of the three-match series against Oman without too many hiccups. After bowling Oman out for 196 in the 48th over, Mumbai overhauled the target with four wickets and 38 balls to spare here on Sunday. Sensible batting When Jaiswal was dismissed in the 27th over, with 63 runs still required, Mumbai was in a bit of a bother. However, Tamore batted sensibly, along with the lower order, to give Mumbai the lead after the visiting team lost the three-match T20 series. Earlier in the day, Mumbai attack justified the decision to field on a sticky pitch by restricting Oman below 200. At 115 for two at the halfway stage, Oman was eyeing a bigger total. However, offie Shashank Attarde (2/27) struck twice in four balls to put Mumbai in charge. Captain Shams Mulani (3/45) then stifled the lower order batsmen with his left-arm orthodox spin to emerge as the most successful bowler.  The scores: Oman 196 47.1 overs (Khalid Kail 76, Khawar Ali 52, Shams Mulani 3/45) lost to Mumbai 199/6 in 43.4 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal 82, Hardik Tamore 51 n.o.) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/yashasvi-and-hardik-drive-mumbais-win/article36173468.ece

30 August 2021||TOKYO,||High jumper Nishad and paddler Bhavina bring cheer with silver||Table tennis star Bhavina Patel and high jumper Nishad Kumar won silver medals while discus thrower Vinod Kumar claimed a bronze at the Paralympics here on Sunday, to give the country a big reason to smile on National Sports Day. The 21-year-old Nishad, a farmer’s son from Himachal Pradesh, cleared 2.06m in the T47 class before 41-year-old BSF man Vinod, whose father fought in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, produced a best throw of 19.91m to clinch a bronze in F52 event. The two athletics medals came after paddler Bhavina gave India its first medal in the Games after going down to Chinese paddler Ying Zhou in the Class 4 women’s singles final. Asian record Nishad cleared the same height of 2.06m to set a new Asian mark. USA’s Roderick Townsend, won with a world record jump of 2.15m, while fellow-American Dallas Wise was also awarded a silver for his 2.06m effort. The second Indian in the fray, Ram Pal, finished fifth with a best jump of 1.94m. T47 class is meant for athletes with a unilateral upper limb impairment resulting in some loss of function at the shoulder, elbow and wrist. Vinod also set an Asian record while winning the bronze medal. Piotr Kosewicz (20.02m) of Poland and Velimir Sandor (19.98m) of Croatia won gold and silver. A protest has been lodged against Vinod after his podium finish. The Indian contingent is, however, confident that the athlete will retain his bronze. “It was only four days back that his classification was done and I was there. Three Tokyo Paralympics classifiers had classified Vinod as F52. We are confident that the medal will stay after review,” Team India’s deputy chef de mission Arhan Bagati said. The F52 classification is for athletes with impaired muscle power, restricted range of movement, limb deficiency or leg length difference, with athletes competing in seated position. Delighted, disappointed Earlier, Bhavina’s impressive run ended with a fighting 7-11, 5-11, 6-11 loss to World No. 1 Zhou, a two-time gold medallist, in a summit clash which lasted 19 minutes. “I’m extremely delighted to win a medal but also a bit disappointed as well. I got a bit nervous,” Bhavina, who also became the first Indian to win a Paralympic medal in table tennis, was quoted as saying by International Paralympic Committee. “I can only assure you that next time I meet her you will see a different me. She clearly got the better of me and had all the shots in her book to outsmart by effort. However, this medal will go a long way and I can assure you that,” added Bhavina. In archery, the Indian challenge ended in the compound mixed pair Open section after the duo of Rakesh Kumar and Jyoti Baliyan made a quarterfinal exit. The sixth-seeded duo lost to Turkey’s Oznur Cure and Bulent Korkmaz 151-153. Earlier, the Indians had stormed past Thailand’s Anon Aungaphinan and Praphaporn Homjanthuek 147-141. In women’s compound open section, Jyoti lost to Kerrie-Louise Leonard of Ireland 141-137 in the first round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/high-jumper-nishad-and-paddler-bhavina-bring-cheer-with-silver/article36173073.ece

At Drive & Dine by Dhuaan in Kanpur, golf carts deliver food to cars packed in designated spots. Launched last August, by the Status Hospitality Group, this idea was a response to the pandemic. “The hospitality industry was shook. We have hundreds of employees to support. Home delivery was the only thing that was working but that was not enough to cover costs,” says Yash Malhotra who has taken over the family hospitality business along with his sister Insha Malhotra. With large banquet lawns at their disposal, they realised a drive-in diner was a great way to capitalise on their expansive property. “This way diners can maintain distancing while being able to go out of the house and enjoy a meal,” says Yash. Picnic benches are placed alongside cars, in case people wish to stretch their legs, and get out of the car as well. Orders are made via QR codes. The drive-in experiment got more traction than the Malhotras expected (roughly 60 cars over the weekend), and has now become a permanent feature. “Seeing the success, a couple of small restaurants from cities such as Surat and Chandigarh reached out to us and have implemented a similar concept,” says Yash. As Drive & Dine by Dhuaan turns one this week, the team continues to make an effort to keep the space exciting. They host themed evenings such as movie nights, Sufi nights, and even distance dancing nights. “Sometimes clients book the entire or part of the space to play tambola in their cars or for social events,” adds Yash. Drive-in birthday parties are trending too. Shyam Sunder, who runs Arjun Garden Cafe in Chennai’s Medavakkam says that he often hosts families and friends who park their cars at his cafe, and celebrate special occasions with confetti and cake. Flash mobs have also taken place here, he says. Shyam, who worked briefly at the Imperial in Delhi, and trained at the Indian Accent restaurant, also in the capital, returned home to Chennai in 2019, to set up the drive-in Cafe with his father Bala Sunder. Spread over an acre, it houses a seating area with a thatched roof, another space for pets and their owners, as well as 30,000 square feet of open space that can accommodate 45-50 cars. When launched two years ago, he says, no one really came just for the drive-in. He tried telecasting cricket and football matches on the large screen, which drew in a few clients. Post pandemic, it is a different story. “People are more comfortable sitting in their car as it’s their space, while we take care of everything else,” says Shyam. He adds that once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, he lost out on his bachelor clients as most of them moved back to their home-towns. Instead, he saw a rise in the family crowd. “I now have 80% more sales from the drive-in than I did pre-pandemic,” he says. What makes it safer To ensure physical distancing, a metre’s gap is maintained between the cars. Although the drive-in cafe is busiest at dinner time, they have a growing clientele coming in early in the day, to breakfast on the cafe’s popular uthappam waffles, gingelly oil dosa and chicken keema dosa. Regulars often call in and order in advance. Some call to pre-order slow-cooked meat, which they then enjoy outside on areca palm plates. In an attempt to make clients feel safer, restaurants are constantly upgrading systems now. At Kaasa Kitchen, Kochi, finger bowls and fumigators (to get rid of the smell of the food) are part of the process. Others, like Zam Zam in Thiruvananthapuram, are thoughtfully providing trays that can be attached to the cars’ windows, so diners can eat comfortably without juggling hot food on their laps.   With inputs from Chitradeepa Anantharam  Woodlands did it first In 1962, at the centre of what is now Semmozhi Poonga, stood Woodlands, in Chennai, south India’s first drive-in restaurant. The Woodlands Hotel Group leased out 18 of the 320 acres of the Agri-Horticultural Society on Cathedral Road to build what would go on to become one of the city’s most popular landmarks until it shut down in 2008. Considered an innovative venture then, it helped popularise Udupi style vegetarian cuisine. The entire car parking area functioned as the restaurant and steel trays, with glasses of water, were fitted to the front doors of the cars. Waiters would then come to the car and narrate the items on the menu that day. Its sprawling greenery that included a play area for children, made it popular among families. Located in the heart of the city, it attracted many morning walkers who would stop by for breakfast and be assured of steaming hot pongal and idli as early as 6 a.m. Their chole bhature , masala dosa , sambar vada , chilli cheese toast, bonda and coffee were the most popular items on the menu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/pancakes-on-the-move/article36173407.ece
30 August 2021||August 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Time for a change||An obsessive concern caused by the disrupted academic year has been the conduct of the summative exams and the declaration of results. Students of Class 12 and the final semester of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes were traumatised by the ensuing uncertainty. Divergent views have been expressed to resolve the conundrum and one suggestion was to do away with language exams and conduct only subject exams. As a language teacher, I fail to understand why language exams are equated with subject ones. There is hardly any difference in the modes and tools of assessment. The question paper pattern in the same — short answer, paragraph and essay questions — and the duration is also three hours. The way the curriculum is translated into practice also does not differ. While this has been ignored so far, the pandemic has highlighted this fallacy, which needs to be resolved. Curricular objectives The curricula at school and college levels distinctly articulate the objectives of teaching of English as: to develop the four language skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing (LSRW) to enhance communicative competence; to inculcate the habits of reading and writing extensively; to listen to and comprehend global English with varied accents; and enable students to engage in fluent and error-free communication with all. The objectives of teaching other subjects are to familiarise students with concepts, ideas, theories, and formulae. Therefore, the exams aim to find out the level of understanding. Unfortunately, exams in English are also designed similarly, defeating the objectives of teaching it as a language. Assessments in English have to measure proficiency levels in all four skills to calibrate the spontaneous production of language and not reproduction of textual content. Moreover, testing of competence in language is not syllabus-bound; instead, it offers freedom to choose texts from any domain of knowledge. One who has acquired the four language skills should be able to read any text in English, respond to any English speaker, or express oneself on any subject, whereas the subject curricula unintentionally limit the learners’ operational knowledge of the domain chosen. International frameworks of reference Assessments in English could be modelled on standardised tests such as IELTS, TOEFL, and TOEIC or customised to suit our purposes. Unlike traditional ones, these standardised exams comprise all the skills and can be conducted either integratively or discretely, and online or offline. Language skill acquisition does not actually require summative assessments; it can be measured progressively throughout the academic year. An advantage of using standardised tests (or their adaptations) is the rubrics that accompany each of the skill assessment tools, facilitating objective evaluation and providing scope for different kinds of assessment — self and peer assessments,and assessment by the teacher. The rubrics have to be made familiar to students so that assessment becomes transparent and they understand their strengths and learning gaps. Additionally, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Teaching, Learning, Assessment, abbreviated as CEFR (2001), provides guidelines for different proficiency levels (from basic to mastery), which enable learners as well as teacher-examiners to measure the proficiency levels accurately and strategise to enhance students’ competence in English. It is, therefore, high time we transformed language exams, distinguishing them from subject exams, to enable learners to acquire and demonstrate language skills.

30 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||A pandemic of loneliness||It’s been over 12 years since Kiran Bhandari, 70, has been living at ‘Gharonda’ old age home. She doesn’t wish to live any more, a feeling that has only become stronger since the COVID-19 outbreak last year. Like Ms. Bhandari, there are 27 other senior citizens living here in this double-storey home with twin sharing rooms and a sprawling garden area located on a narrow street in South Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri. At least 20 others are currently back with their families because of the pandemic. The inmates at the home come with a load of emotional baggage, memories of a life spent with family and fear of being forgotten by all. The pandemic has only made matters worse. Ms. Bhandari still wears bright red vermilion. She is hopeful that her husband would return one day but somewhere inside, she knows he might not. “I am just waiting to die. I have lived alone for so long. What’s the point of it? I have a phone and there’s no one to talk to,” she said. Abandoned by family Her husband — who was under heavy debt — disappeared one day about 13 years ago, leaving her alone in a rented house in Mahipalpur. She knocked at door of her mother-in-law who turned her away. Her own brother also didn’t take her in. After spending a year at an ashram in Ballabhgarh, she was told about this old age home where she has now been staying. “All I pray to God is to let me leave the world from here only. I don’t want to go to another old age home,” she said. The last one and half years have been very tough for Ms. Bhandari. Kamlesh Malik, whom Ms. Bhandari takes as her mother at the home, had gone back to her own family in Rohini for 10 months. She returned only three weeks ago after losing both her sons in a span of three months. Ms. Malik hesitated to share what transpired before she moved into the old age home. She cried, not for being abandoned by her family but for the demise of her two sons. Ms. Bhandari recalled: “The last few months were very tough, especially without mummy [referring to Ms. Malik]. Every time I watched news and heard about people dying, I just wished to be gone in this wave.” Ms. Bhandari saw a sister in Usha Goyal, 75, and a brother in 64-year-old Kishan Lal. “ Ab to yahi ghar wale hain… inhi se baat karke time nikal jata hai [Now, this is my family and time goes by talking to them]”. An inmate who refrained from following news was Mr. Kishan. He said he stopped watching TV because it troubled him. He said he didn’t miss stepping out much because he usually stayed indoors. Mr. Kishan spends his day helping in daily chores, serving meals and taking care of his roommate – his namesake Kishan Lal, 86. Mr. Kishan had come here seven years ago from Haryana’s Rewari. A heart patient, he suffered two heart attacks and his medicines cost Rs. 7,000 a month — an amount his son wasn’t capable or willing to bear. His wife still lives with the son and he visits them occasionally. “My heart only works at 25% capacity. I don’t have the courage to deal with any problems anymore. I used to meet my wife and my son before the pandemic outbreak. It stopped after that,” he said. Talking about his roommate and namesake, the octogenarian Kishan Lal, Mr. Kishan said his son is differently abled and his wife works as a house help in East Delhi. As she was unable to take care of both of them financially, Mr. Lal had to come here eight years ago. He doesn’t have teeth and has trouble walking. His digestive system is weak and he lives only on fluids. “It’s tough to see him like this,” the younger one said. Since February 2020, when COVID-19 pandemic first hit the country, the octogenarian’s family has not come to see him. Others aren’t sure if he even waits. Full of fear For Usha Goyal, life during the pandemic has been full of fear of being stuck outside the old age home. On the day the lockdown was announced in March last year, Ms. Goyal was visiting her daughter in Moti Nagar. She ended up staying with her for the next five months till the unlock phase began. Ms. Goyal came to this home 15 years ago with her husband Raghuvir Goyal. Raghuvir passed away after suffering a heart attack 12 years ago. She had three daughters — two of them passed away a few years ago. She also has a son she doesn’t want to remember him. “I don’t know where he is and I don’t want to know it either.” Her expressions change from calm to angry just at his mention. He is said to have left his family in his early 20s when they used to live in a rented house in Paharganj. “ Beti se milti thi har mahine corona se pehle. Jab se wapas aayi hun, tab se nahin mili hun. Phone pe baat hoti hai [I used to meet my daughter every month before the COVID-19 outbreak. I haven’t met her since I came back after spending five months. We talk over the phone,]” she sighed. The last few months have made her feel lonelier but she is okay, she said, spending her time listening to radio, watching TV, sitting in the garden and talking to the rest of the inmates. The most loved one The most impacted by COVID-19 and also the most loved inmate at the home is Gurucharan Singh Bhatia, 88. He was the first resident of this old age home in 2000. “His health has deteriorated a lot in the last year and a half. He doesn’t remember much now and also talks about things nobody understands,” said caretaker Sunil Bishwas, 58, who has been working here since the opening of the home. Mr. Bhatia used to be handle the patients at the clinic located in the front porch of the old age home. He would hand out prescription slips and take details of the visitors. However, now, he is incapable of any of it. But the caretakers and owners let him sit at the clinic and work in whatever capacity he can so he doesn’t feel left out. “He was a social person and COVID-19 meant social distancing. It clearly had an impact on his mind,” Mr. Bishwas said.  No visitors Mr. Bhatia clearly remembers he was born in Sialkot in Pakistan and during the Partition, he moved to Muradabad. No one has visited him in the last 21 years. His wife is believed to be dead. A man so active once upon a time, now mostly prefers to sleep. The owner of the old age home, Pravesh Jain, a businessman based in South Delhi who runs a trust — Paras Foundation, said the reason behind running this home is his father. “My father would look at old, homeless people and worry about them. After he passed away, I decided to turn this place into an old age home. And I run it like my own house and treat the elderly residing here like my parents. I try to take care of all their needs – from food to medicines,” he said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/a-pandemic-of-loneliness/article36173232.ece
30 August 2021||GURUGRAM,||Kisan Mahapanchayat flays police action on farmers in Haryana||A Kisan Mahapanchayat at Nuh on Sunday condemned the police action on protesting farmers at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal a day ago. The farmers belonging to all communities participated in the Mahapanchayat and resolved to make all Samyukt Kisan Morcha decisions a big success, be it the proposed Muzaffarnagar kisan rally or Bharat Bandh. SKM top leaders Rakesh Tikait, Jogender Singh Ugrahan, Dr. Darshan Pal, Yogender Yadav, Avik Saha, Inderjit Singh, Satyawan and others appealed to the gathering to make village-level committees to strengthen the ongoing farmers struggle to get the three “black laws” withdrawn and get a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price for all crops. Dr. Pal expressed surprise as how could a government official order the police to break the heads of farmers without having a signal from the political bosses. Mr. Yadav raised the issue of discrimination meted out to Mewat region by successive regimes, which has rendered the region into socio-economic backwardness. Mr. Singh cautioned the farmers against communal forces which were desperate to polarise the people on communal lines by disrupting the historical unity and amity of the Mewati people. Mr. Ugrahan highlighted the successes the ongoing farmers movement had already achieved in the form of unprecedented unity of the toiling masses of various States. Besides, this struggle has totally exposed the pro-corporate character of the Modi government, he said. ‘Assets sold for a song’ Mr. Tikait recalled how the conspiracy was hatched to disrepute the farmers movement on 26 January. He said that it was not just the three laws, but the real issue was to save the country. He accused the Modi regime of selling out valuable national assets to his corporate friends for a song. The farmer leader alleged that hoarding of food grain and fruits had already been launched in huge silos belonging to the Adanis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kisan-mahapanchayat-flays-police-action-on-farmers-in-haryana/article36173219.ece
30 August 2021||Pune,||Slanging match continues: Rane says Sanjay Raut has damaged Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena had been irretrievably damaged by its chief spokesperson MP Sanjay Raut, said Union Minister Narayan Rane on Sunday as the vicious sabre-rattling between Mr. Rane and the Sena continued unabated after the Minister’s controversial “would have slapped Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray” remark. Speaking in his stronghold Kankavli in the Konkan’s Sindhudurg district on the last day of his eventful Jan Ashirwad Yatra, Mr. Rane claimed that Mr. Raut’s intemperate remarks in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana had resulted in the “party going to the dogs”. “Mr. Raut is responsible for sullying Saamana ’s prestige and the Shiv Sena as a party…If he keeps up this level of personal invective against me, then I will be compelled to offer a similarly sharp response and make revealing disclosures about various Sena leaders [alluding to Maharashtra Minister Anil Parab] through my own newspaper Prahaar ,” warned Mr. Rane, the Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. Mr. Rane, an ex-Shiv Sena stalwart who is now the Sena and Chief Minister Thackeray’s bitterest adversary, had stirred the hornet’s nest earlier in the week when he said he would have given Mr. Thackeray “a tight slap” for allegedly forgetting the number of years of India’s Independence during the Chief Minister’s August 15 speech. A slew of FIRs were lodged against Mr. Rane, who was arrested and later released on bail by a local court in Mahad, following a high-voltage drama that lasted till Tuesday midnight, and which resulted in irate Sena workers pelting stones on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) offices in a number of places in the State while clashing with BJP workers in Mumbai. The incident has since been followed by a strident slanging match between Mr. Raut and Mr. Rane. Mr. Raut, who is the executive editor of Saamana , questioned in his weekly column ‘Rokthok’ the support that Central BJP leaders like BJP president J.P. Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah had reportedly extended to Mr. Rane in the wake of the latter’s “arrest humiliation”. “If this is true [Central BJP leaders offering to support Mr. Rane], then it is an insult to Maharashtra’s self-respect and pride. Why does Delhi stand in support of those who insult Maharashtra’s pride and self-respect? A Union Minister talks of slapping the State’s Chief Minister and BJP leaders look around helplessly,” he wrote in his column, while expressing surprise over how the BJP could term Mr. Rane’s arrest “unconstitutional”. Mr. Raut accused Mr. Rane and his sons of consistently using “derogatory and unparliamentary” language against the Sena leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sanjay-raut-has-damaged-shiv-sena-rane/article36173210.ece
30 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC grants relief to electrician who fell from pole||In a rare show of compassion for a young electrician, who became permanently disabled following an accident at work, the Delhi High Court has not only ordered monetary compensation but also taken the initiative of planning a stable source of income for him. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani ruled that both the contractor and the power distribution company were jointly and severely liable to compensate Bharat Singh for putting him in his current state where he is unable to perform even basic, personal and daily chores himself. He is all but 100% dependent on others. The judge directed the contractor — Bryn Construction Company — and BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) to pay Rs. 10 lakh each, totalling a sum of Rs. 20 lakh, to the 28-year-old within four weeks. Non-monetary relief Generally, courts restrict their adjudication in similar cases to monetary compensation aspect only. However, Justice Bhambhani went a step further. The judge ordered the father of the victim to open a “general/provisions store” in the name of Bharat from the money received through compensation. The court instructed that the general/provisions store shall be run from a portion of his house in Daulat Nagar, District Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh and all earnings from the store will be used and applied for Mr. Bharat’s medical and living expenses and for his welfare and well-being. The High Court also directed the Uttar Pradesh government to continue to treat Mr. Bharat as a person with 100% permanent disability and to provide him disability pension, lifelong free bus and railway passes, and free physiotherapy and occupational therapy. The court further directed the State government to extend all other forms of assistance, help and aid in accordance with Mr. Bharat’s entitlements, under government schemes, rules and notifications, as may be applicable to him from time-to-time. 2014 incident On April 25, 2014, Mr. Bharat, who was then about 21 years of age, while working as an electrician with Bryn Construction Company, was tasked with rectifying a fault in an electricity pole that was causing fluctuation in the electricity supply at a farmhouse in Bijwasan, New Delhi. As Mr. Bharat climbed the electricity pole and started repairing the fault, it fell along with the live electricity cable and he suffered severe trauma on his backbone. The High Court was informed that Mr. Bharat is unable to perform any of his daily chores on his own and requires to be physically supported for all daily routines, from the time he wakes up till the time he sleeps, since he cannot stand-up or walk or even sit on a chair without support and assistance. The court was further informed that Mr. Bharat needs constant supervision even while sitting, since he is not stable and risks falling over. No safety gear The High Court noted that Mr. Bharat was not provided any safety gear, including rubber gloves, ladders before he was directed to climb the pole to undertake the repair task. “It is clear that the accident could not have occurred had Bryn and/or BRPL not been negligent in taking reasonable precautions to avoid it; which gives rise to their strict liability for the injuries sustained by Bharat,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-grants-relief-to-electrician-who-fell-from-pole/article36173221.ece
30 August 2021||Patna,||JD(U) calls for caste-based Census||At its national council meeting in Patna under new president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal-United JD(U), on Sunday passed eight resolutions, including the demand for a caste-based Census and a focus on girl education for population control in the country. Earlier, Mr. Singh who was nominated as new party president, had called upon the party office-bearers and functionaries to work together to fulfil Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s dream of making the JD(U) “a national party”. At the national council meeting, the party ratified Mr. Singh’s nomination as national president and recalled the pioneering works done by former party president and now Union Cabinet Minister, R.C.P. Singh. Eight resolutions were passed at the meeting held at the party headquarters and attended by all of its top leaders. In one of its resolutions, the JD(U) said it was necessary the Central government conducted a caste-based Census to make public the actual population of all castes so that the fruits of development reach poor and underdeveloped people. “Caste-based Census will be in the interest of both government and society and it will strengthen our Parliamentary democracy,” a JD(U) leader said. The JD(U) runs the government in Bihar along with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and two other alliance parties, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). The JD(U) also passed a resolution saying “educated girl-happy family” of “Bihar model” should be the criterion for population control in India. “The JD(U) is not in the favour of any harsh or tough measure for population control, rather it supports awareness campaign and education for girls for this,” party leaders said at the meeting. Rohini panel report The party also demanded the recommendations of Justice Rohini Commission be made public to strengthen efforts for social, educational and economic empowerment of extremely backward people. In another resolution, it welcomed reservations in medical education. “This will encourage efforts of providing equal opportunity in medical services,” party leaders said. While speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of the meeting, party leader K.C. Tyagi said that the JD(U) would welcome the setting up of a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coordination committee to resolve issues between alliance partners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jdu-calls-for-caste-based-census/article36173217.ece
30 August 2021||New Delhi,||Bail plea of man involved in fake currency racket rejected||The Delhi High Court has observed that fake currency has the propensity of having a disastrous effect on the economy, while noting that the process of making fake currency notes has reached a level of immaculate sophistication due to which they are indistinguishable from real currency notes. “Circulation of fake currency notes is severely detrimental to the economy and hampers the financial regulation of the country,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said while rejecting the bail plea of a man who was part of a well-organised syndicate involved in printing, procuring, circulating fake Indian currency notes. “The production of counterfeit currency notes often stems from dissatisfaction with a country’s growth, and is therefore, aimed at financially disintegrating and destabilising the steady equilibrium of liquidity in the economy,” Justice Prasad said. “Counterfeiting of currency notes breeds drug smuggling, purchase of illegal arms and ammunition, funding of undesirable terrorist outfits, cross-border money laundering, human trafficking and various other phenomena. It has a disastrous effect on the economy.” The High Court rejected the bail plea of one Tabrej Ahmed noting that he was part of a “well-oiled machinery/syndicate dealing in printing and circulation of fake currency notes and it has the propensity of having a disastrous effect on the country’s economy”. “The nature of the activity, the chances of the petitioner [Ahmed] absconding/jumping bail or continuing to indulge in the same activity on release cannot be ruled out at this juncture,” the court added. On December 19, 2019, Delhi Police Special Cell received secret information that a Dubai-based Pakistani national was trying to bring fake Indian currency notes to the country. Probe was conducted and it has surfaced that a syndicate of procurement, printing, circulation and distribution of fake notes is being done. Ahmed’s name surfaced along with the names of a few other people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bail-plea-of-man-involved-in-fake-currency-racket-rejected/article36173222.ece
30 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Riot-displaced people to return home after 25 years in Assam||Thousands of people displaced by ethnic and communal riots in areas under the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) since 1996 are set to return to the homes they left behind. Central schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Jal Jeevan Mission have been dovetailed with the rehabilitation programme within the next three months, Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) chief Pramod Boro said. “Bodoland had witnessed riots in 1996, 2008 and 2012. Peace has returned to the region after the signing of the BTR Peace Accord in January 2020. We want the affected people to go back home and live their lives without fear,” Mr. Boro told The Hindu from the BTC headquarters Kokrajhar. He was a signatory to the accord as the president of the All Bodo Students’ Union. He quit the union and became the president of the United People’s Party Liberal, which rules the BTC in alliance with the BJP and the Gana Suraksha Party. Adivasi, Bodo people “The rehabilitation will start with the affected Adivasi and Bodo people of Gossaigaon area [Kokrajhar district]. It is unfortunate that they have been away from home for 25 years,” he said. Between 1993 and 2014, more than 970 Bengali-speaking Muslims, Adivasis and Bodos died in clashes triggered by indiscriminate shooting by extremist groups, primarily the now-disbanded National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB). Some of the 8.4 lakh people displaced by the violence have remained in shabby relief camps while others relocated to areas beyond present-day BTR. “We are rebuilding the damaged or destroyed houses of a few thousand.

30 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Manipur autonomous council head accused of fund misuse||More than a year after RTI activists were forced to flee for seeking information on the utilisation of Central funds by the Autonomous District Council (ADC) of Senapati district, beneficiaries in another Manipur district are allegedly being threatened for demanding details on how the money for developmental projects has been spent. The work agencies and beneficiaries of projects sanctioned under the ADC of Tamenglong district have accused the council’s former Chief Executive Officer Dinganglung Gangmei and Chairman Namsinrei Panmei of misusing Rs. 1,802.28 crore received under the 14th Finance Commission of 2017-18. Work agencies are locals chosen by the ADC for executing a range of developmental projects. A statement issued by the work agencies and beneficiaries of Kambiron and Lungkao villages demanded punishment of the two officials for embezzlement. ‘Public has lost trust’ “The public has lost trust in such public servants/civil servants who do not hesitate to commit the act of gross misappropriation and cheating the innocent work agencies and beneficiaries,” it said. The statement clarified that the work agencies were “not a party to the signatories of any document related to the issuing of work order, check slip or withdrawal of money from their bank accounts”. The work agencies and beneficiaries said the authority concerned should be wary of the accused destroying evidence between the period of inquiry and their summoning by the Lokayukta. They also alleged that the former CEO had been threatening the locals with “severe consequences” if they did not withdraw their complaint to the Lokayukta. Mr. Gangmei and Mr. Panmei could not be contacted but an associate in the ADC said the charges against them were baseless. Extremist groups in Manipur have had a history of taking away the lion’s share of development funds allegedly in collusion with officials and contractors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/manipur-autonomous-council-head-accused-of-fund-misuse/article36173214.ece
30 August 2021||Agra,||AAP brings out ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in Agra; Sisodia slams Yogi govt.||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers brought out a ‘Tiranga Yatra’ here on Sunday, led by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

Ahead of the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, the AAP plans to take out Tiranga Yatras in Ayodhya, Lucknow and Noida to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence. Mr. Sisodia said his party would carry out ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in the Ayodhya on September 14 and later, it would be brought out in 403 Assembly segments in Uttar Pradesh. In Agra, the ‘Tiranga Yatra’ started from the GIC ground around 4 p.m. and ended at the Shaheed Smarak in Sanjay Place. ‘No good education, job’ Interacting with reporters at the circuit house in Agra, Mr. Sisodia said, “This government is failing to provide good education to the children of the poor, employment to the youth, and good amount for crop to farmers.” “Because of unavailability of the beds in hospitals, a pregnant woman had to deliver a baby on road in this State. They feed salt and roti in mid-day meal and act against the reporter if they try to raise the issue.” he said. Mr. Sisodia was referring to a journalist booked in 2019 for allegedly doing the “despicable work” of maligning the image of the Uttar Pradesh government by recording a video of school children being served salt and roti in mid-day meal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-brings-out-tiranga-yatra-in-agra-sisodia-slams-yogi-govt/article36173215.ece
30 August 2021||Navi Mumbai,||American woman treated for bowel endometriosis at Mumbai hospital||A 35-year-old woman from the U.S. has been successfully treated for a dangerous type of bowel endometriosis at ACI Cumballa Hill Hospital in Mumbai. The patient from Boston had a large endometriosis nodule in the mid and upper rectum almost resulting in occlusion, and inability to conceive due to significant endometriosis and adenomyosis. The woman, who complained of chronic period pain, constipation, and bloating, has resumed her daily routine now and is also scheduled to undergo an IVF treatment soon in her country. Dr. Abhishek Mangeshikar, consultant laparoscopic and robotic gynaecologist with the hospital, said the patient had a history of severely painful periods and severe constipation and bloating. “Her ultrasound examination revealed a large endometriosis nodule in the mid and upper rectum almost resulting in occlusion. These findings were corroborated by an MRI.” Bowel endometriosis, Mr. Mangeshikar said, could be seen when tissues similar to the uterine lining grew on the bowel or intestine. “It is the most common type of extra pelvic endometriosis. About 12% of cases affect the rectum and sigmoid colon. In India, an estimated 25 million patients suffer from endometriosis. We have treated 80 patients over the past year with advanced endometriosis and almost 60% had bowel involvement.” In this particular case, delaying treatment could cause intestinal obstruction which could become a life-threatening complication because the patient would be unable to pass stools and the intestine would eventually perforate leading to severe complications such as sepsis and possibly death. “The surgery is not only useful in improving quality of life and reducing pain but also in improving fertility,” Dr. Mangeshikar added. The woman said that the first two days of her menses were petrifying. She would change pad from time to time but still find herself with a sordid bloody pool on the bed, and the pain gave her nightmares. “My family was supportive and helped me with hot water bottles, painkillers, and even sympathy that I would be fine. I was physically, mentally, and emotionally disturbed. I was just looking out for ways to end my suffering. Finally, the sufferings seem to have ended for me,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/american-woman-treated-for-bowel-endometriosis-at-mumbai-hospital/article36173411.ece
