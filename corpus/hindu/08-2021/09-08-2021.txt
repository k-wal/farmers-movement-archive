09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Covishield-Covaxin mix gives better protection, says ICMR||A combination of Covishield and Covaxin elicits better immunogenicity than two doses of the same vaccine, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Sunday. The council released its findings which suggest that immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity. The immunisation programme against COVID-19 in India started with two vaccines — AstraZeneca’s ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (named Covishield in India) and inactivated whole virion BBV152 (Covaxin). A homologous prime-boost approach was followed. However, 18 individuals in Uttar Pradesh, under the national programme, inadvertently received Covishield as the first jab and Covaxin as the second. In its study, the ICMR compared the safety and immunogenicity profile of these persons against that of individuals receiving only one of the vaccines — either Covishield or Covaxin.  The pre-print report titled “Serendipitous COVID-19 Vaccine-Mix in Uttar Pradesh, India: Safety and Immunogenicity Assessment of a Heterologous Regime,” has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice, the council said. It, however, maintained that the findings have an important implication for the COVID-19 vaccination programme wherein heterologous immunisation will pave the way for induction of improved and better protection against the variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. “Such mixed regimens will also help to overcome the challenges of shortfall of particular vaccines and remove hesitancy around vaccines in people’s mind that could have genesis in programmatic ‘errors’ especially in settings where multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being used. However, to conclusively prove these findings a multicentre RCT needs to be carried out,” the ICMR said. Previously the World Health Organisation had warned against mixing of vaccines, saying there was very little information on the mix-and-match of vaccines. It advised against people mixing and matching vaccines from different manufacturers, calling it a “dangerous trend” since there was little data available about the health impact. The Council admitted that there are few limitations to their study. “The sample size was small and the participants were put under a short follow up period of only 60-70 days after immunisation with the first dose and baseline serological and immunological data of the participants not available,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covishield-covaxin-mix-gives-better-protection-says-icmr/article35806734.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Human rights at risk in police stations: CJI||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Sunday said police stations pose the “highest threat” to human rights and dignity, which are “sacrosanct”. “The threat to human rights and bodily integrity is the highest in police stations... Going by recent reports, even the privileged are not spared third-degree treatment,” the Chief Justice said. Custodial torture and police atrocities still prevail despite constitutional guarantees, he said. Lack of effective legal representation at police stations is a huge detriment to arrested or detained persons. The first hours of arrest or detention often decide the fate of the case for the accused, the CJI said. He was speaking at the release of the National Legal Services Authority’s legal services app and vision statement at Vigyan Bhavan. Chief Justice Ramana had a word of advice for his fellow judges. He noted that if the judiciary wants to gain the trust of the poor and the vulnerable, it has to assure the marginalised that it exists for them. For the longest time, he noted, the vulnerable sections have lived outside the system of justice. “If judiciary wants to garner the faith of the citizens, we have to make everyone feel assured that we exist for them,” the CJI said. “For the longest time, the vulnerable population has lived outside the system of justice,” Chief Justice Ramana said, showing the mirror to fellow judges on the pitfalls of the justice administrative system. Lengthy, expensive formal processes followed by courts dissuade the poor and the vulnerable. The judiciary’s toughest challenge today is to break these barriers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/human-rights-at-risk-in-police-stations-cji/article35806736.ece
09 August 2021||Kunduz/Kabul,||Taliban seize three more Afghan cities||The Taliban tightened the noose over northern Afghanistan on Sunday, capturing three more provincial capitals as they take their fight to the cities after seizing much of the countryside. The militants have snatched four provincial capitals in Afghanistan since Friday in a lightning offensive that appears to have overwhelmed government forces. Kunduz, Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan in the north fell within hours of one another on Sunday, lawmakers and residents in the cities confirmed, but not without fierce fighting. Pro-Taliban social media accounts claimed that the insurgents were also close to overrunning the provincial capital of Taloqan. In Kunduz, one resident described the city as being enveloped in “total chaos”. “After some fierce fighting, the mujahideen, with the grace of God, captured the capital of Kunduz,” the Taliban said in a statement. “The mujahideen also captured Sar-e-Pul city, the government buildings and all the installations there,” it said. The Taliban had the compound “surrounded”, said Mohammad Hussein Mujahidzada, a member of the provincial council. Perennial target Kunduz is the most significant Taliban gain since the insurgents launched the offensive in May as foreign forces began the final stages of their withdrawal. It has been a perennial target for the Taliban, who briefly overran the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but never managed to hold it for long. The Taliban captured Taloqan city in northeastern Takhar province on Sunday, a security source and residents told  AFP. A resident of the city said, “We saw the security forces and officials leaving the city in convoys of vehicles.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/taliban-seize-three-more-afghan-capitals/article35806742.ece

09 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Vaccine reluctance higher among senior citizens||Over six months after COVID-19 vaccination was rolled out in Tamil Nadu, misconceptions about vaccines still prevail, and vaccine hesitancy is higher among senior citizens, reveals a study done by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. The fear of complications, being afraid of injections and the ill-conceived notion that they will not contract COVID-19, along with lack of awareness of the vaccines and knowledge of where to get vaccinated, were among the reasons, according to the findings of the study released on Sunday. The ‘vaccine hesitancy’ survey was conducted to analyse people’s perception of the vaccine in July. A total of 95 clusters were chosen randomly — each comprising 30 random houses. Of the total 2,855 people interviewed, only 1,048 were vaccinated (802 got a single dose and 246 both doses). With the results highlighting misconceptions, the Health Department will focus on awareness activities, Director of Public Health T.S. Selvavinayagam said. Of the three age-groups (18-44, 45-60 and above 60), vaccine hesitancy was the highest among senior citizens. The study found that vaccine acceptance was 83.1% among the 18-44 group, 81.8% among the 45-60 group and 72.4% among those aged above 60. “Vaccine hesitancy was the highest among those aged above 60 at 27.6%,” the report said. About 16.9% of those aged 18-44 and 18.2% of those aged 45-60 were hesitant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccine-reluctance-high-among-senior-citizens/article35806820.ece

The protesters have been demanding retention of Amaravati as the sole capital of the State. A huge contingent of police personnel was deployed on all routes leading to Thullur as several leaders belonging to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) were taken into preventive custody. Protesters pitched tents at Thullur, the main scene of action. Many of them, including women, entered into arguments with the police, demanding that they be allowed to march to the temple. But the police stopped them, citing pandemic-related restrictions. At Venkatapalem, 15 women were taken into preventive custody as they sneaked through to the High Court premises. Several leaders, including former Ministers Devineni Umamaheswara Rao and Nakka Ananda Babu, and TDP leaders, including Ganji Chiranjeevi, were confined to their homes. The JAC has been holding protests since December 2019 when Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced the three-capital plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/march-from-amaravati-to-mangalagiri-temple-foiled/article35806570.ece

Some street vendors and passers-by noticed that the young man had dropped off his mother in the street in front of the taluk hospital gate. He also put her bed, some bags and clothes beside her. While she looked confused and remained silent, he turned to go, leaving her there. The young man was Sridhar Tolasi and the woman who found herself in such unfortunate circumstances was Savitri Bai, his mother. When cornered by some passers-by, he gave evasive answers and asked them to mind their own business. Soon a crowd gathered around the woman. Someone called the local police. Meanwhile, people stopped him and told him that he will not be able to go till the police arrived. Police officers who arrived there in minutes began asking Sridhar Tolasi some questions. He identified himself as a law student in Pune. His family hailed from Athani. He had decided to leave his mother in front of the taluk hospital as she was suffering from psychiatric problems for some time now. Police officers then told him that this was not the way to treat his mother. They asked him to take his mother back home.

09 August 2021||Srinagar/New Delhi,||NIA searches houses of Jamaat leaders in 56 locations in J&K||Eighteen months after the socio-religious group Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) was banned in J&K, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday conducted searches at 56 locations in 14 districts in the Union Territory (UT) in connection with a terror funding case in the wake of reports of regrouping by the banned organisation. Sources said NIA teams searched the residences of former JeI heads and in-charge of its Falah-e-Aam Trust, a charity organisation that runs nearly 100 schools in the Union Territory, at Soura, Nowgam, Bemina, Harwan and Lal Bazaar in Srinagar. House of JeI leader Mohammad Sultan Bhat, at present in Pakistan, was searched in the Soibugh area of Budgam in central Kashmir. So were houses of former JeI presidents in Budgam, Ganderbal, Kulgam and Baramulla. In Shopian, which was once considered a hub of the JeI, the house of the brother of Hamid Fayaz Ganie, who was Amir (head) of the organisation when it was banned in February 2019, was searched. Ganie was arrested and booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA). A NIA spokesman said 56 locations were searched in Srinagar, Budgam, Ganderbal, Baramulla, Kupwara, Bandipora, Anantnag, Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam, Ramban, Doda, Kishtwar and Rajouri districts. In February, the NIA registered the case on a reference from the Union Home Ministry related to separatist and secessionist activities of the JeI, which was proscribed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on February 28, 2019. “The members of the organisation have been collecting funds domestically and abroad through donations, particularly in the form of zakat (donations), mowda and bait-ul-mal (charity) purportedly to further charity and other welfare activities, but these funds are instead being used for violent and secessionist activities,” the NIA said in a statement. Money for Hizb, LeT It was alleged that funds raised by the JeI were also being channelled to the banned outfits such as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) through well-organised networks of the JeI cadres. The JeI had also been motivating the youth of Kashmir to recruit new members in J&K to participate in disruptive secessionist activities, the NIA added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-searches-houses-of-jamaat-leaders-in-56-locations-in-jk/article35806524.ece

The video — first released by Trinamool Congress leader in the Rajya Sabah Derek O'Brien — sets the tone for the Opposition’s strategy in the coming week even though parties will formally meet on Monday morning to decide their strategy in the two Houses of Parliament. “Mr Modi, Come listen to us,” Mr. O’Brien tweeted and tagged 10 Opposition parties including his own party. ‘BJP stalling debate’ “PM @narendramodi seems to have lost his nerves. Why is he not keen on answering questions in the Parliament? The opposition parties are ready for discussions in the Parliament, but @BJP4India Govt is stalling the proceedings so that the truth doesn’t get to the people,” Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said on Twitter and tagged the three minute 45 seconds video. Talking to The Hindu about the idea behind video, Mr. O’Brien said, “When the voice of the entire Opposition is being censored daily in Parliament, we will innovate to communicate... and there is more to come.” The video is a compilation of statements made by different Opposition MPs in the Upper House in the past three weeks on the issues of the farmers’ agitation and the Pegasus spyware. Leaders indicated that merely disrupting the proceedings of the Parliament was not enough and it was important for the people to know the “causes” for which the Opposition is fighting. “You are not allowing the discussion we have been asking for the past 14 days and the discussions we can do later. You are passing that Bill now. If you have courage, begin the discussions on Pegasus now,” Mr. Kharge is heard saying in the video, in a short clip of what he said earlier on the floor of the House. Sukhendu Shekar Roy of the Trinamool is heard raising the issue of “freedom of speech in Parliament”; the clip with Manoj Jha of the RJD alleges that “Pegasus has reached everyone’s house” and the Congress’s Deepinder Hooda is seen saying he would raise issues relating to farmers only if his “microphone is not switched off”. Meanwhile, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in a series of tweets, said, “The ECONOMIST magazine has reported that India is among ten countries that had a potential list of 50,000 telephone numbers out of which hundreds of numbers were infiltrated. NSO Group admitted to have 40 countries and 60 agencies as its clients. Ten of those countries used Pegasus spyware for spying. Was India one, is the question”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-urges-pm-to-listen-to-them/article35806542.ece
09 August 2021||New Delhi,||MPs seek reasoned view to open schools||The hazards of not reopening schools after prolonged closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic are “too serious to be ignored”, according to a parliamentary panel. The committee noted that the closure of schools had not only impacted the social fabric of families in a negative manner, but also increased the involvement of children in household chores. “The closure of schools for over a year has had a deep impact on the well-being of students, especially their mental health... The confinement of young children within the four walls of the house, being unable to attend school, has altered the relationship between the parent and the children adversely,” the panel said. “The closure of schools has impacted the social fabric of the family in negative manner leading to early/child marriage and increased involvement of children in household chores. The present situation has exacerbated the learning crisis that existed even before the pandemic with the marginal and vulnerable children getting adversely affected. Keeping this situation in mind, it becomes all the more imperative to open schools,” the panel has noted. This week, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports, headed by BJP MP Vinay P. Sahasrabuddhe, tabled in Parliament its report ‘Plans to bridge the learning gap caused due to school lockdown as well as review of online and offline instructions and exams and plans for reopening of schools’. A well-balanced, reasoned view may be taken for the opening up of schools, the panel said. Accentuating vaccine programmes for all students, teachers and allied staff so that schools may start functioning normally at the earliest; holding classes on alternate days or in two shifts to thin out students, along with observance of physical distancing and compulsory wearing of face masks at all times; frequent hand sanitisation, etc.; and regular thermal screening at the time of attendance and conducting random RT-PCR tests to identify and isolate any infected student, teacher or staff immediately, were among the recommendations for the reopening of schools made by the panel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mps-seek-reasoned-view-to-open-schools/article35806559.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Putin to join Modi in UNSC debate today||Russian President Vladimir Putin will join the open debate on maritime security that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over on Monday at the U.N. Security Council as India holds the Presidency for the month. The Embassy of India in Russia has announced that President Putin will participate in the event through video conference. The participation of world leaders in the session is part of the broader global message about the consensus over India providing leadership of the UNSC as the world deals with conflicts in Afghanistan, Myanmar and Yemen among others. . The current stint is the eighth time that India has held the Presidency of the top U.N. body. Yet out of all the tenures, it is the first in 1950-51 that left lasting lessons about how difficult international affairs can be at the level of the chair of the President. It was in 1950-51 that the issue of Kashmir took a critical turn at the Security Council which took the Indian delegation by surprise. India was still struggling with the initial phase of freedom and the Kashmir issue had opened up almost immediately with the war of 1947-48. The issue arrived at the UN on January 1, 1948 as India urged the UNSC to discuss the battle that began with the invasion of tribal irregulars from Pakistan. The Indian submission marked the origin of the “Jammu and Kashmir Question”. The title of the dispute was changed on January 22, 1948 to “The India-Pakistan Question”. The period from 1948 to 1951 was heated as far as the Kashmir issue was concerned as there was little flexibility on display by either India or Pakistan as the UN involvement through the first UN Representative Owen Dixon failed to resolve the situation. In this backdrop, on March 30, 1951, the UNSC took up an Anglo-American resolution on Kashmir and laid out a process of continuation that would give the Kashmir issue a long shelf life at the UNSC where it was formally taken up last time in 1971 before the August 2019 discussion on the issue by China in the backdrop of India’s abrogation of Article 370 by the government of Prime Minister Modi. What was particularly embarrassing about the 1951 resolution was that the Kashmir issue concerned the President of the UNSC — India — and yet neither the U.S. nor the U.K. hesitated from going ahead with it. The Resolution 91 decided to replace the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) with UNMOGIP (UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan). It also decided to appoint a UN Representative for India and Pakistan in continuation of the role of Sir Owen Dixon. The second decision almost institutionalised the Kashmir issue in the U.N.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/putin-to-join-modi-in-unsc-debate-today/article35806730.ece
09 August 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Coffee major to source from Koraput tribals in Odisha||One of India’s largest coffee producers is set to buy coffee beans grown by tribal people in Koraput district of Odisha. The new purchase deal involving Tata Coffee is likely to give confidence to tribal coffee growers for continuing their beverage plantation. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, in a statement on Sunday, said: “The cooperation of Tata Coffee in State government’s efforts to uplift socio-economic standard of coffee farmers will prove beneficial in their welfare. It carries importance in protection of livelihood of tribals at critical juncture like COVID pandemic.” According to the Tribal Development Co-operative Corporation of Odisha Limited (TDCCOL), everything about the 100% Arabica coffee beans is sourced from the State itself. Coffee is grown in the Laxmipur, Kashipur, Dasmantpur, Nandpur, Lamtaput, Koraput, Potangi and Nandpur blocks in Koraput. This year, around 28,790 kg of coffee cherries was procured from 193 tribals farmers, says TDCCOL. “We had sent samples of the Koraput coffee to Tata Coffee. The company found its quality to be very good,” said TDCCOL Managing Director Mansi Nimbhal. TDCCOL started selling Koraput coffee in 2019 through Adisha, its retail outlets. Koraput Agro Products Producer Company Limited (KAPPCO), a producer company of the Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society in Koraput, had approached TDCCOL to facilitate marketing of the coffee. KAPPCO said it was happy that Tata Coffee had shown interest in buying Koraput coffee from tribal farmers. The beverage crop was introduced about 90 years ago in Koraput, situated in the Eastern Ghats hill ranges. According to a 10-year plan, an area of 46,500 hectares will be brought under shade plantation and 22,570 hectares under coffee in Koraput district. About 25,000 families, mostly from tribal communities, will be provided with a record of rights for coffee plants for their long-term livelihood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coffee-major-to-source-from-koraput-tribals-in-odisha/article35806550.ece
09 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||‘SP will conduct a caste census’||If the Samajwadi Party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2022, it would conduct a caste census of the OBC communities, its president and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said on Sunday. “How much time will it take in the age of technology,” asked Mr. Yadav, while addressing a gathering of workers of the Mahan Dal. In a bid to counter the BJP’s strategy of pitting the Yadavs versus the other OBCs — the largest community bloc in U.P. — Mr. Yadav has forged an alliance with the Mahan Dal, an OBC-based party headed by Keshav Dev Maurya. On Sunday, the Mahan Dal held its workers meet at the SP’s headquarters and Mr. Yadav was the chief guest at the event. The auditorium resonated with the chant, “ Mahan Dal de thahna hain, SP sarkar banana hain .” Mr. Yadav said the BJP would never conduct a caste census “because they know who are more in numbers”, a reference to the numerically-dominant OBCs. In the past few elections in U.P., the BJP has successfully been able to pit the non-Yadav castes against the Yadavs, who are the core support base of the SP. Sunday’s event was one of the few occasions when Mr. Yadav tried to address that question, though in a mild fashion. He warned the Mahan Dal support base of Maurya, Kushwaha, Sakhya and Saini communities that as elections come near, the discussion on the binary of Yadav vs non-Yadav would get intensified by the BJP. “They created a fight between us saying that Yadavs stole all [your] rights. Sometimes they say we snatched everyone’s rights, the rights of pichdas (Backward Caste),” Mr. Yadav said. The SP president also dismissed the BJP’s claims of being the “biggest well-wisher” of the OBC and Dalits, accusing the party of snatching their rights and honour. The Mahan Dal has a base among the backward caste Maurya-Shakya-Kushwaha-Saini communities, traditionally associated with growing vegetables and farming. In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, it allied with the Congress but fared poorly. In 2014, it forfeited deposits on all three seats it got as part of the alliance — Budaun, Etah and Nagina, securing less than 23,000 votes. In 2019, too, it supported the Congress, which eventually won only one seat. Mr. Maurya, who started his career with the SP, said his fight was to provide “honour and share” in the power to the Maurya, Kushwaha, Sakhya and Saini castes. He claimed his outfit could damage the BJP by 15,000-20,000 votes in each constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sp-will-conduct-a-caste-census/article35806538.ece
09 August 2021||Mussoorie,||ITBP inducts first women officers on combat service||The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force, which guards the Line of Actual Control (LAC) along the India-China border, on Sunday commissioned its first two women officers in combat after they completed their training here. A total of 53 officers passed out from the ITBP officers’ training academy located in Mussoorie after a parade was held, with Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami officiating as the chief guest. The first-ever History of ITBP , a 680-page book containing unknown facts and photographs of the border guarding force, was also released by Mr. Dhami and ITBP Director-General S.S. Deswal. Mr. Dhami and Mr. Deswal put the rank of Assistant Commandant, an entry-level officer rank in the paramilitary, on the shoulders of two women officers — Prakriti and Diksha — after the passing out parade and an attestation ceremony where they took their oaths to serve the country. While Ms. Prakriti’s father has retired from the Indian Air Force (IAF), Ms. Deeksha’s father, Kamlesh Kumar, is an ITBP Inspector. “My father is my role model. He never considered me lesser than anyone,” Ms. Deeksha said. Ms. Prakriti, who holds a degree in electrical engineering, said life in the force was “very tough, but it is also challenging and exciting”. The ITBP started recruiting women combat officers in its cadre from 2016 through an all-India examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Before this, it had combat women only in the constabulary ranks. Out of the 53 officers, 42 officers are in the general duty combat cadre, while 11 are in the engineering cadre of the force. These officers will now be posted across ITBP formations in the country, including along the LAC with China and the anti-Naxal operations theatre in Chhattisgarh. Addressing the young officers, Mr. Dhami said the commanders should “give their best” while performing their duties. He said the country was safe due to the valour of its armed forces and the sacrifices made by the personnel in uniform. “I am the son of a soldier and I have seen the Army closely. I have seen the struggles of their families,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/itbp-inducts-first-women-officers-in-combat/article35806530.ece
09 August 2021||Ghaziabad,||VHP demands Central law against forced conversion||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday demanded a Central law against forced religious conversion. Addressing a press conference in Meerut, Surendra Jain, the international joint general secretary of the Parishad, thanked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for bringing a strong law against forced conversion in the State. “But the recent events in Loni area of Ghaziabad proved that it is a pan-Indian racket and hence requires a Central law.” Adding that they would raise the demand with the Union Home Minister, Mr. Jain claimed those involved in conversion activities also indulged in spreading terrorism and thus required a strong Central law. He alleged that the so-called secular parties provided support to such activities. “When a private member Bill against forced conversion was brought in the Chhattisgarh Assembly, it was nixed by members of the Congress,” he alleged. ‘Saffron revolution’ Calling for a “saffron revolution” in the region, Mr. Jain also said the VHP and Bajrang Dal had identified 70 sensitive spots in western Uttar Pradesh from where Hindus were seeking mass exodus out of fear. “We will nurture self-confidence in Hindus who are living in areas where they are in a minority,” he said, referring to a recent incident in Moradabad where around 80 Hindu families had allegedly put posters declaring that their houses were on sale because they were facing harassment at the hands of Muslim neighbours. The local police, however, had debunked the theory. In “Palayan nahin Parakram” (Courage not exodus), he said, the VHP had given a new motivational chant to Hindus in western U.P. “It has been decided that every village will have a Bajrang Dal akhara and a Durga Vahini centre.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vhp-demands-central-law-against-forced-conversion/article35806536.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||2 more held for derogatory posts against judges||The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested two more persons in connection with derogatory social media posts against judges and the judiciary. The agency has so far arrested five persons in the case. The accused Pattapu Aadarsh and Lavanuru Samba Siva Reddy were arrested by the agency on Saturday. “In order to investigate the larger conspiracy, the CBI has also examined certain persons, including Nandigam Suresh, MP, and former MLA Amanchi Krishna Mohan, not mentioned in the First Information Report (FIR),” said a CBI official. In the same case, the CBI arrested Dhami Reddy Konda Reddy and Pamula Sudheer on July 28. While Mr. Dhami Reddy Konda Reddy is currently in judicial custody, Mr. Sudheer is in the agency's custody till August 10. Another accused named Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy, who earlier worked in Kuwait, was arrested on July 9. He is also in judicial custody. FIR filed The agency took over the probe on November 11, 2020, after registering the FIR against 16 accused and other unknown persons, following a direction from the Andhra Pradesh High Court. It was alleged that they deliberately targeted some judges of the Supreme Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court through interviews in the media, abusive comments and threats on social media platforms. During the investigation, the CBI traced 13 persons named in the FIR. Three of them were found to be living overseas. The agency has examined 11 accused. The CBI is also trying to secure the presence of two other accused, said to be in the United States, for their questioning. While five have been arrested so far, evidence against the remaining six is being evaluated for further necessary legal action. “Searches were also conducted on the premises of accused persons. One of them, Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy, had allegedly been using a passport issued in another name,” the official said, adding that all the objectionable contents were removed from the Internet. The agency has sought assistance from its counterparts in other countries, through the Interpol, to gather evidence from abroad. It is alleged that the derogatory contents were posted last year after different Benches of the Andhra Pradesh High Court passed orders with regard to some petitions filed against the instructions and actions of the State government and its functionaries. “Even the persons occupying high position gave interviews against judges,” the Court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-more-held-for-derogatory-posts-against-judges/article35806548.ece
09 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Till debt do us part: Punjab’s ‘contract marriages’ are cases of cheating||The family of 26-year-old Harpreet Singh at Mandi Gobindgarh in Punjab is yet to come to terms with what they describe as a “marriage fraud” allegedly played on them by their daughter-in-law after she left for Canada two-and-a-half years ago. “Our son [Harpreet] married in July 2018. In January 2019, my daughter-in-law, who had scored well in the IELTS [International English Language Testing System], went to Canada on a study visa. After reaching Canada, she conveyed to my son that she did not want to continue her relationship with him as she had plans to spend her life with another person,” Manjeet Singh, Mr. Harpreet’s father, told The Hindu . “It was a shock for the family. My son is in extreme distress. We have not yet come to terms with it. I spent around Rs. 28 lakh on the wedding, paid for her air tickets, the institute’s fees... We did not think such a fraud would be played on us.” Later, after pressuring the girl through mutual friends and relatives, the family was able to send Mr. Harpreet to Canada on a spouse visa. “But the girl then filed for divorce in Canada. After this, I filed a complaint here and a first information report [FIR] was lodged for cheating under Section 420 of Indian Penal Code [IPC] and other sections against the girl and her family,” Mr. Singh said. Punjab has been witnessing an increasing number of “contract marriage frauds” carried out for securing the Canadian ‘Permanent Resident’ status required to migrate to that country. Jobenjeet Singh, 33, of Fatehgarh Sahib district, has a similar tale to share. “I got married in 2012. My wife had a good IELTS score and she applied for a student visa to Canada, which she received in January 2014. I deposited her college fees and spent lakhs on her travel to Canada. After reaching Canada, she initially stayed in touch with me, but later stopped all communication. My in-laws are based in Barundi village, Ludhiana, and every time I met them, they would assure me that she would soon apply for the spouse visa. But they filed a divorce case on behalf of their daughter in 2020. It was then that I approached the NRI [Non-Resident Indian] wing of the Punjab police, following which a case under Section 420 was registered,” he said. According to official data, 4,266 complaints were received by the NRI wing of the Punjab police in 2019, which included cases of cheating, matrimonial dispute and property dispute. The complaints were filed by both men and women. In 2020, the number of complaints stood at 3,829, while in 2021, so far, 2,248 complaints have been lodged. A large number of people, especially youth from Punjab, travel abroad in the hope for a better life. Marriages of convenience are known to facilitate these aspirations. To do this, the bride, the groom or their families enter into an informal contract in which the boy or his family is willing to pay for the girl’s education and travel abroad, provided that once she completes her education and gets a Permanent Residency (PR) of the foreign country, she will apply immediately for a spouse visa. However, many young men find that “the women go abroad and dupe” them. “It’s basically an arrangement to facilitate the immigration of boys who are not scoring good grades in the IELTS. In some of the countries, one can take spouses along, but in some others, it is not allowed. Canada has certain conditions and it’s only after fulfilling those conditions that spouses are given a visa. Hence, the cases of cheating surrounding Canada are a tad higher,” A.S. Rai, Additional Director-General of Police (NRI Affairs), told The Hindu . Mr. Rai said it had been observed that the cases were not of matrimonial dispute, but instead that of cheating “where one party has entered into a contract with the other person, who has the promised delivery of some service, and one has paid a certain amount of money, but the person has rescinded on that contract”. “In such cases, we check the financial transactions. The finances have to be routed through legal channels, for instance, air tickets have been purchased, university fees paid, etc.. We are then able to establish a case of cheating,” he said. “Around 2.5-3 lakh students move abroad annually from Punjab, apart from the 2 lakh who leave for jobs, etc. The trend of going abroad soon after passing Class 12 slowed down in 2020 because of the pandemic.” Mr. Rai added that the Punjab government was cognisant of such cases, and the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission’ provides free counselling for youth interested in foreign study and placement. The initiative is beneficial for Punjabi youth, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/till-debt-do-us-part-punjabs-contract-marriages-are-cases-of-cheating/article35806555.ece
09 August 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. slams Twitter’s ‘double standards’||A day after social media giant Twitter temporarily blocked former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s account allegedly following complaints from the NCPCR, the party on Sunday condemned the platform’s “double standards”. Twitter had also removed one of Mr. Gandhi’s tweets of a photograph of the parents of a nine-year-old girl, who was raped and brutally murdered in the national capital, after he met the victim’s family last Wednesday. Under Indian law, revealing the identities of sexual assault victims or their families is prohibited and may be taken as a violation of Twitter’s policy in India. On Wednesday, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had asked the micro blogging site as well as Delhi Police to take action against Mr. Gandhi. However, Congress leaders claimed that similar photographs, revealing the identity of the parents, were shared by members of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Why was Mr. Gandhi being singled out, the Congress asked. “See the double standard! @TwitterIndia how fearful are you of the Modi govt that you are singling out Shri @RahulGandhi's account, when Govt bodies have done the exact same thing,” Congress general secretary (Organization) K.C. Venugopal asked on twitter. Meanwhile, women members of the Congress held a press conference to question the silence of the top leadership over the crime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-slams-twitters-double-standards/article35806540.ece

Ltd. In the session moderated by freelance writer Pankaja Srinivasan, key speaker Nicy Binu, director, Santamonica Study Abroad, focused on study avenues in various destinations, including Canada, the U.K., the U.S., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Germany. “Even in the midst of the pandemic, study abroad continues to be popular. There has been a significant spike in the percentage of students aspiring to study abroad,” she said. According to Ms. Binu, the U.K. and the U.S. offer a range of unique courses. However, the U.S. has no open work permit, unlike Canada, Germany, Ireland and others. While there was a period when the U.K. government took away the post-study work permit, the country is attracting more Indian graduates after exiting the EU. Canada is famous for its immigration-friendly policies and is among one of the top three destinations preferred by Indians. Ms. Binu said in Australia, part-time employment opportunities and earnings are high and the most welcoming regions, in terms of ease of obtaining PR, are Tasmania and South Australia. In New Zealand, engineers and healthcare professionals will be able to avail PR easily, she said. Ms. Binu also pointed out that while education is not too expensive in Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, and France, these countries prefer students who can speak their language.

09 August 2021||New Delhi,||Adoption not limited by religion: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court has declared a Christian couple, both U.S. citizens, as ‘adoptive parents’ to a minor girl born out of Hindu parents while reprimanding them for trying to adopt the child under a wrong law. The High Court reiterated that Christian and Muslim couples could not adopt a Hindu child under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (HAMA), as was sought to be done in this case. “The Adoption Deed drawn up under the HAMA is invalid as the parties are Christians and not Hindus,” Justice Asha Menon said, taking note of the fact that the child, now more than six-years-old, had been under the custody of the adoptive parents since her birth. Justice Menon said the child was being well taken care of by the foster parents and their family and hence “there is no cause to remove the child from their charge and custody.” The High Court said the personal law of the Hindus recognised adoption. “Therefore, the adoption ceremony known as ‘Datta Homam’, where the biological parents voluntarily surrender and hand over the child to the recipient, following religious ceremonies, was considered sufficient to result in a valid and legal adoption,” it said. The relationship of the biological family to the child given in adoption extinguished when this ceremony was conducted. However, this right to adopt had been brought under the HAMA, which laid down certain limitations on who could adopt and who could be adopted and what were the other conditions for a valid adoption. HAMA was applicable only to Hindus, and specifically provided that it applied to “any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion”. However, Justice Menon said that a person interested in adopting a child was not limited by his or her religion, if adoption was sought under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adoption-not-limited-by-religion-delhi-hc/article35806544.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Have not left Samyukt Kisan Morcha: Haryana farmer leader||A day after he walked out of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s (SKM) general body meeting, Haryana farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni has clarified that he has not left the movement or the protests against three farm reform laws. However, differences remain, especially with regard to his political ambitions. Mr. Chaduni, who heads his own faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union and is also one of the nine members of the SKM’s core committee, accused other leaders of discriminating against him and his supporters. In a statement, he explained that he walked out of Saturday’s general body of the joint farmers front, as some of his supporters — farm leaders from Punjab who are not part of the SKM — were asked to leave the meeting. These supporters have been part of his campaign for Mission Punjab, a controversial call for farm leaders to directly contest next year’s Assembly elections. The SKM leadership has officially repudiated such an entry into the poll arena by the farmers and previously suspended Mr. Chaduni from the core committee for a week for his political statements. Terming the ejection of his followers as the decisions of a “dictatorship,” Mr. Chaduni pointed out that other SKM leaders who have similarly violated the front’s non-political stance have not been pulled up. To protest such “injustice,” Mr. Chaduni had declared his decision to boycott the general body and core committee meetings. On Sunday evening, he clarified that he was not leaving the SKM or breaking with the front and its objectives. However, he reiterated that he was against the double standards of the other union leaders, especially a section from Punjab. As the State polls draw nearer, the tensions within the movement remain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/have-not-left-samyukt-kisan-morcha-haryana-farmer-leader/article35806528.ece

However, to conclusively prove these findings a multicentre RCT needs to be carried out,” the ICMR said. Previously the World Health Organisation had warned against mixing of vaccines, saying there was very little information on the mix-and-match of vaccines. It advised against people mixing and matching vaccines from different manufacturers, calling it a “dangerous trend” since there was little data available about the health impact. The Council admitted that there are few limitations to their study. “The sample size was small and the participants were put under a short follow up period of only 60-70 days after immunisation with the first dose and baseline serological and immunological data of the participants not available,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covishield-covaxin-mix-gives-better-protection/article35806517.ece

Vulnerable sections “For the longest time, the vulnerable population has lived outside the system of justice,” Chief Justice Ramana said, showing the mirror to fellow judges on the pitfalls of the justice administrative system. Lengthy, expensive formal processes followed by courts dissuade the poor and the vulnerable. The judiciary’s toughest challenge today is to break these barriers, he said. “If we want to remain as a society governed by the rule of law, it is imperative for us to bridge the gap of accessibility to justice between the highly privileged and the most vulnerable. For all times to come, we must remember that the realities of socio-economic diversity which prevail in our nation cannot ever be a reason for denial of rights. Let our past not determine our future...” Digital divide Chief Justice Ramana said the digital divide has not helped the cause of easy access to justice. Rural and remote areas suffer from lack of connectivity. “Accessing justice in India is not merely an aspirational goal. We need to work hand in hand with various wings of the government to make it a practical reality.” ‘Equality is reality’ The Chief Justice said he has already written to the government about the urgent need to bridge the digital chasm “on a priority basis”. “Let us dream of a future based on legal mobility, a future where equality is a reality. That is why the project ‘Access to Justice’ is an unending mission,” CJI Ramana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/human-rights-at-risk-in-police-stations-says-cji/article35806518.ece
09 August 2021||Srinagar,||No mercy for militants, supporters: J&K L-G||J&K Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday said there would be no mercy for militants and their supporters in Kashmir, a day after militants attacked and killed one policeman and injured two others in south Kashmir’s Kulgam. Speaking during an official function in Kulgam, L-G Sinha said there was no place for violence in the land of Sufi saints. “Misguided youth must shun violence, choose better future. I urge imams (priests) and khateebs (preachers) to keep a watch on children and prevent them from treading wrong path. The J&K admin is committed to creating schemes that will strengthen the abilities of youth.” Talking tough against militants amid stepped up operations by the security forces in J&K, the L-G said his administration was committed to ensuring peace and development in Kashmir. Without naming Pakistan, the L-G said the neighbouring country, besides some elements in J&K, doesn’t want peace. “But we are committed to defeat violence,” he added. Praising a resident from Kulgam, Tanvir Khan, son of a rickshaw puller who cracked the Indian Economic Service (IES), Mr. Sinha said, “Khan made the people of not only Kulgam but entire J&K feel proud. Youth must take cue from him and follow his footsteps and choose better future.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-mercy-for-militants-supporters-jk-l-g/article35806526.ece

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Spirit of surrender||Alavandar, also known as Yamunacharya, is revered as the foremost of acharyas in the Vaishnava tradition as he has laid the foundation of the Visishtadvaita philosophy through his many excellent granthas. His direct disciples and other acharyas in this lineage have been quick to discern the salient features of this sampradaya from his works and have in turn further clarified, explained and propagated them through their works and teachings. In this context, interpreters have highlighted the significance of his hymn, ‘Stotra Ratna,’ for the way in which Alavandar establishes the Supremacy of Sriman Narayana and the efficacy of the paths of bhakti and prapatti, pointed out Sri A. K. Sundararajan in a discourse. This hymn, held as a jewel among hymns, instils in the spiritual seeker the values and the inherent path of dharma shown in the Vedas. Alavandar draws much philosophical strength and conviction from the hymns of Azhwars who have shown the way to salvation by seeking God’s feet. The bhava or spirit of utter humility and helplessness which is to be present in the seeker when he offers surrender to God is captured most effectively in one particular verse in this hymn. The verse, roughly translated runs thus: “O Lord, You alone are to be sought as refuge by me, but I am not worthy as I am not established in dharma; nor do I have any atma jnana; my devotion is not in any way fervent or deep; but I am helpless and without any support; so, I seek you since you are the sole protector and support of all beings.” The prayer is applicable to all jivatmas who are aware that their practice of the paths of karma, bhakti or jnana is very limited and insufficient. The seeker accepts his inability to protect himself and is aware that he has no other refuge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/spirit-of-surrender/article35806553.ece

In a communication to all States and Union Territories, the Union Home Ministry said the national flag represented the hopes and aspirations of the people of the country and, hence, should occupy a position of honour. “There is universal affection and respect for, and loyalty to, the national flag. Yet, a perceptible lack of awareness is often noticed amongst people as well as organisations/agencies of the government, in regard to laws, practices and conventions that apply to display of the national flag,” it said. It told the States and Union Territories that on the occasion of important national, cultural and sports events, national flags made of plastic were also being used in place of flags made of paper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disallow-use-of-plastic-national-flag/article35806531.ece

In an interview with PTI, he also put the blame for the logjam in Parliament on the BJP and said it had reduced the “temple of democracy to a rubber stamp for its agenda or worse, a notice board to announce its unilateral decisions”. Asked if going forward the Standing Committee on IT would be able to take up the Pegasus snooping issue, Mr. Tharoor said that for two years now the IT committee had been conducting discussions on citizens’ data privacy and security and cybersecurity, topics that also featured in its agenda under the previous chairman, BJP’s Anurag Thakur. The Pegasus issue, therefore, clearly fell under the panel’s purview. “It is no secret that the committee’s meeting [July 28] was disrupted by BJP members who did not want Pegasus to be discussed. It was unprecedented for 10 members to attend and to refuse to sign the register in order to deny the committee a quorum,” the Thiruvananthapuram MP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-will-take-up-pegasus-issue-tharoor/article35806546.ece

Sanjeev Gupta, Secretary, Inter-State Council Secretariat, Union Home Ministry, on Saturday had complained on Twitter that an economy class ticket on British Airways’ Delhi-London flight for August 26 was priced at Rs. 3.95 lakh. He said a Vistara and Air India ticket for August 26 was priced between Rs. 1.2 lakh and Rs. 2.3 lakh, amid the college admission time in the U.K. Mr. Gupta said he had “alerted” Union Civil Aviation Secretary P.S. Kharola about it. A senior DGCA official said on Sunday that the aviation regulator had asked the airlines that operate India-U.K. flights currently to submit fare details. While there have been lower and upper limits on all domestic airfares in India since May 25 last year, no such limits had been imposed on international airfares. Vistara said: “Pricing is always a function of supply and demand. There are only 15 flights a week allowed currently on the India-U.K. route for Indian carriers and when there is relaxation and more capacity allowed, it will automatically bring down prices.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dgca-seeks-details-of-uk-airfares/article35806557.ece

Sekarbabu has said. As a first step, 539 temples that get an annual income of Rs. 10 lakh each would get the plans done. “Smaller temples can do little things that go a long way. These include improvement of lighting, removing any unnecessary tiles on walls and flooring and keeping their premises clean. Last month we had done a mass cleaning of all temples. That would be repeated every month,” he said. During inspections done over the last two months it was found that in many cases temples lacked even necessary lighting. “We can light temples in a manner that the architectural and heritage aspects are shown appropriately,” he explained. In a detailed set of instructions issued recently, the department told officials that any changes to existing structures, including painting, placing granite or putting up barricades or even shades, would have to be done after due consultation with the respective sthapathi, Joint Commissioner and ASI experts. “Modifications would be carried out only after obtaining due clearance from the regional-level, State-level or High Court-appointed committee, whichever is applicable,” explained an official.

09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation turns to tech innovations to solve civic challenges||The Greater Chennai Corporation’s Innovation Hub (CHUB), which seeks to foster research and development on urban issues, is set for a major transformation. The civic body has started discussions to sign memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with five incubators, focusing on technological innovation to find solutions for civic issues faced by the city’s residents. “We are in the initial stages of discussion with five incubators. MoUs have not been signed yet. CHUB will act as an international platform. Any person, incubators and startups from different countries can connect with CHUB. We will promote cross-border collaborations as well,” said Azhagu Pandia Raja M.P., Chennai city innovation officer, Chennai Smart City Limited. “For citizens, it is an effective way to work along with the government in problem- solving. Also, the focus of CHUB is to solve civic issues, which will ultimately benefit citizens,” he said. Recently, two startups have begun work on raw data collection, including real-time videos about traffic congestion on city roads collected by the Integrated Command and Control Centre, to find solutions to civic issues faced by residents in each locality. “The pandemic gave an immense opportunity to CHUB to work on various challenges caused by COVID-19, and we came up with multiple technological initiatives, which were highly successful,” Mr. Raja said. “Current initiatives at the Corporation are in various stages of development. Further, CHUB caters to the need of other city corporations as well. Recently, Madurai Corporation, Chengalpattu Municipality and Tiruvallur Municipality consulted with CHUB for solutions to various issues,” he said. Madurai has asked for an online slot-booking tool for COVID-19 vaccination while Tiruvallur wanted a mobile application for farmers to eliminate middlemen during the government’s procurement of crops. CHUB is also working alongside StartupTN, the State government’s mission to promote startups. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Works) M.S. Prasanth said the civic body had requested everyone to make use of the platform. “CHUB is a dedicated platform to foster and promote innovation through civic engagement. It will facilitate and sustain the discovery and deployment of innovation to tackle urban issues. The Corporation will use this platform to support innovative ideas emerging from society. CHUB has started benefiting the civic body with recent initiatives like the online COVID-19 vaccination tool,” he said. At least one lakh residents, including senior citizens, have benefited from the online vaccination tool. Startups are likely to start work on such data for various aspects of COVID-19 management. Pivotal role “CHUB will play a pivotal role in bringing the academia, research, industrial thought leaders, government agencies and industries together to solve issues pertaining to the development goals of the city. CHUB has the right intent and leadership, that believes technology and collaboration can accelerate the goals. The solutions are built to scale it across the State,” said Narendran M., vice-president, head of engineering, Mr. Cooper - India, which worked with CHUB. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said, “We do encourage innovations and involvement of citizens in urban governance. In CHUB, we already have citizens’ participation. We would like citizens and startups to be part of the Corporation’s urban governance so that residents can get better service.” The current initiatives of CHUB include the development of workforce application to digitise solid waste management process in Corporation limits, waste exchange portal, open data portal for the Corporation and optimisation of the existing Namma Chennai application. “We have interacted with startups in their incubators about the existing opportunity in CHUB. The whole setup is very young, just six months old. But it has started gaining traction and attracting more people,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-turns-to-tech-innovations-to-solve-civic-challenges/article35806846.ece
09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Restoration works on heritage structures across State begin||The Public Works Department (PWD) has started work to simultaneously restore 20 heritage structures across the State. While restoration works on several British-era structures at a cost of nearly Rs. 100 crore are at different stages of implementation, 13 more projects have been lined up. The PWD is planning to complete the works within two years. Among the various public heritage buildings that have been identified and are functioning as courts, schools and government offices, nearly 45% restoration work has been completed at the Registration Department building on Rajaji Salai, Chennai, and on the damaged roof and domes at the Tower Block building of the University of Madras. Built in 1864, the building on Rajaji Salai, spread over nearly 25,000 sq ft, was damaged due to ageing. Work on restoring the leaky Madras Terrace roofing and wall plastering is being carried out at a cost of Rs. 9.7 crore, officials said. K.P. Sathyamurthy, Joint Chief Engineer, PWD (Buildings), said preliminary work was on to rehabilitate a portion of the Government Central Press at Mint, which was damaged during a fire accident in 2013. Originally constructed for minting coins and producing gunpowder by the East India Company, it was later converted into a printing press by the State government. “Humayun Mahal at Chepauk will be the first structure to be restored by the year-end. Nearly 80% of the Rs. 33.95 crore project is over. The other projects are in the initial stages due to labour shortage and challenges in transporting traditional construction material during the pandemic,” he said. The Building Centre and Conservation Division, PWD, which has trained engineers and skilled labourers to deal with heritage work, is executing the projects. Youngsters are also being trained in the technology. Other challenging heritage works include the restoration of the ‘Kuthiraivandi’ (horse cart) court or old labour court and the Governor’s bungalow in Coimbatore. “Built in 1863, it was here that freedom fighter V.O. Chidambaram was awarded rigorous imprisonment. This court levied fines on horse cart drivers for not having lanterns or bells on their carts. About 15% work to restore this historic court is over, and the structure will be ready by May next year,” said PWD Superintending Engineer (Designs) C. Kalyanasundaram. Besides five projects in Kanniyakumari district, heritage structures housing Collectorates in Tiruchi and Madurai, munsif courts in Paramakudi and Manamadurai, and the old district court, Salem, are also being restored. In Pudukottai district alone, five projects are set to begin, including the renovation of taluk offices and the Collectorate. The other restoration works lined up are at the Rani Mangammal Palace in Madurai that houses a government office, and the majestic Kohinoor Bungalow in Kodaikanal. “We are planning to take up 25 more historic structures for restoration in the next phase. The Thanjavur Prince Palace and the Poosi Forest Palace in Arni are among them,” Mr. Sathyamurthy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restoration-works-begin-on-heritage-sites/article35806841.ece

Recycled material “We used the scraps of the railways to make these toilets. They are like a small table and can be carried anywhere,” said S. Louis Amuthan, deputy chief security officer. He explained that there was a need for portable toilets after the railways had recruited a lot of women for the RPF. “When we conduct range classes in forest areas and parades outside, men can probably adjust. But such trips always proved a problem for women,” said Mr. Amuthan who designed the toilets. The RPF have made use of toilets and other materials from old coaches to design the moveable toilets. First, they tried wood for assembling the unit before switching over to metals and rexine since wood was very heavy. Water reusable “The advantage with these toilets is that a day after using them, the water could be drained for watering plants. The inoculum bacteria in the chambers of the bio-toilet convert the waste into useful material,” Mr. Amudhan said.

The CEA has fixed 3,853 million units. Since April 1, the State generated around 1,570 million units, about 210 million units higher than what was achieved during the corresponding period in the previous year. The optimism of officials in charge of hydro power generation is based on the pattern followed in the State. Ordinarily, it is only during July-December (most part of the southwest monsoon, coupled with the entire northeast monsoon) that the reservoirs generate about 60% of the annual production. With virtually five more months to go, the State, in the assessment of the officials, will be able to experience several rounds of substantial inflow and generate more than the target. During 2020-21, the total hydro power generation was 4,040 million units. Though the share of hydro power is hardly 5% of the present total power availability, the hydel stations come handy for the authorities to handle the peak-hour load, besides in times of sudden failure of the coal-based thermal power stations or a steep fall in production of infirm power such as wind and solar energy. However, the present storage of hydel reservoirs, despite being higher than what it was in the previous year, may not surpass the maximum storage attained three years ago. As on date, the storage of the reservoirs, expressed in terms of million units, was around 1,327, about 430 million units higher than that of the corresponding day in 2020. The maximum storage — around 2,390 million units — was recorded on August 15, 2018, going by the meteorological forecast for the coming days. According to the latest forecast of the meteorological department, the State, especially the catchments of the hydel reservoirs, is likely to witness rainfall during August 7-9, but this spell is not expected to bring huge inflows. The current rate of inflow is around 17 million units and the generation is 20 million units. Power plants These days, wind and solar power plants account for about 108 million units of the State’s total energy consumption of 350 million units every day. The coal-fired thermal power stations of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation contribute 69 million units. The State gets around 82 million units in its share from the Central Generating Stations in places such as Ramagundam, Vallur, Neyveli and Kundankulam. Of the remaining sources of energy, long term open access (LTOA) accounts for around 47 million units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-hopes-to-exceed-hydro-power-generation-target-for-2021-22/article35806863.ece
09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TFPC, FEFSI heading for a showdown||The Tamil Film Producers’ Council (TFPC) and the Film Employees’ Federation of South India (FEFSI), a 25,000-strong workers’ union, are heading for yet another showdown after TFPC reportedly annulled an agreement it reached with FEFSI unilaterally on August 6. One of the main resolutions adopted by TFPC stated that its members were free to employ anyone they wanted for film shoots. It further said there would be no negotiations with FEFSI on the issue as the latter consistently disregarded the agreement with TFPC. TFPC also said it would take legal action against any union that tries to intervene or stop the filming of any movie. The council is also reportedly set to reignite its feud with theatre owners over the payment of the Virtual Print Fee which, TFPC contends, should be borne by theatre owners. FEFSI president R.K. Selvamani said actor Silambarasan’s dispute with a number of producers from TFPC was at the centre of the issue. He said FEFSI decided to cooperate with producer Ishari K. Ganesh on his film, Vendhu Thanindhathu Kaadu , starring Mr. Silambarasan, only after providing clarifications and undertakings to TFPC. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Selvamani said, “This has been announced unilaterally. I don’t know if there is some miscommunication. If there was something wrong with me or FEFSI, we are ready to rectify it.” Mr. Selvamani said FEFSI had not called for a strike, but it would raise the issue with Chief Minister M.K. Stalin if the livelihoods of the workers got affected.

09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tindivanam Ramamurthee dies at 87||Former Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president Tindivanam K. Ramamurthee, who had represented the party in the Assembly, the Legislative Council, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, died on Sunday. He was 87, and is survived by two daughters and a son. Ramamurthee had his political roots in S.S. Ramasamy Padayachi’s Tamil Nadu Toilers Party. “He accepted the call of Congress leader Kamaraj and joined the party. He was among the Congress leaders who were elected to the Assembly in 1967 when the DMK captured power,” said R. Rajamohan, Ramamurthee’s son-in-law. He was elected to the Legislative Council in 1978 and served as the leader of the Congress. Ramamurthee was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 1984 and elected to the Lok Sabha from Tindivanam in 1991. Though he was close to party stalwart G.K. Moopanar, he did not join the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) floated by the former in 1996 in protest against the Congress leadership’s decision to align with the AIADMK. “Moopanar had chosen him as the candidate for the Tindivanam Lok Sabha constituency. But DMK leader Karunanidhi told him that Ramamurthee was unlikely to join the TMC, and he was proved right. Subsequently, the DMK fielded T.G. Venkatraman, a cousin of Ramamurthee, who became a Union Minister,” recalled a senior Congress leader. He was appointed president of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee in 1998. But his relationship with the party was always a roller-coaster ride. In 2006, he was expelled from the party after he met AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa and gave an interview to Jaya TV when the Congress was an ally of the DMK. He later floated the Tamizhaga Indira Congress, which was rechristened and registered as the Tamil Nadu Jananayaga Congress, and extended support to the AIADMK. However, Jayalalithaa did not allot any seat to his party in the Assembly election that year. Ramamurthee also had a brief stint in the Nationalist Congress Party of Sharad Pawar. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin paid his respects to the leader. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and TNCC president K.S. Alagiri were among those who condoled his death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tindivanam-ramamurthee-dies-at-87/article35806827.ece

Ramadoss on Sunday wondered when Tamil Nadu could dream of getting clean drinking water in pipes at homes similar to the scheme that the Odisha government has introduced in Puri. He estimated that such a scheme would enable people here save Rs. 20,000 crore that they spend to purchase drinking water. In a statement, he said that the ISO 10500 standard drinking water is being supplied to all the homes through pipes in Puri. The scheme is going to be implemented in another 17 cities. “The water from Bhargavi river near Puri is being purified and supplied. Considering the paucity of drinking water in Chennai and other cities, this scheme can be implemented in Tamil Nadu as well,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said that 40 litres of drinking water could be given free of charge and those who consume above the limit could be charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/provide-piped-drinking-water-like-in-odisha/article35806853.ece

09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘A proactive Minister is needed to tackle atrocities against Dalits’||Activists and parties championing the Dalit cause want those heading the Department of Adi Dravidar Welfare to be proactive in dealing with cases of atrocities committed against the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The Ministers for Adi Dravidar Welfare — be it under the DMK or the AIADMK — have been silent on such issues as caste killings and humiliation of Dalits. They have rather been focusing attention on government schemes. A case in point is the recent incident of a Dalit government employee falling at the feet of a caste Hindu man at Ottarpalayam in Coimbatore. “The problem lies in the selection of candidates for the post. The political parties do not opt for a candidate capable of handling issues independently...,” says V. Sivakami, a former IAS officer, who served as the Secretary of the Department. The Minister and the Department have the duty to intervene when such incidents occur. “Even there is the protection of civil rights wing, headed by the IGP (Human Rights and Social Justice-CID), under the supervision of the ADGP (Social Justice-CID). This wing suo motu can inquire into the issue,” she says. In Tamil Nadu, the protection of civil rights wing enforces the Protection of Civil Rights Act and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. She recalls that when there were complaints of police excesses at Sankaralingapuram, she had asked the then Commissioner of the Department, P. Shanmugam, to conduct an inquiry. “Mr. O. Panneerselvam was the Chief Minister. Jayalalithaa, after taking over the position from Mr. Panneerselvam, visited the family of the policeman killed in the incident, but not the villagers.” Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi MP Ravikumar, too, questions the selection of candidates for Minister for Adi Dravidar Welfare. But he argues that the larger part of the problem is the allocation of the Ministry to candidates of the Devendrakula Vellalar community. “When the community is demanding that it be excluded from the Scheduled Caste list, how do you expect a Minister from that community to function in a proactive manner while dealing with atrocities against the Dalits? The post should ideally go to a member of the Paraiyar-Adi Dravidar community, which constitutes 15% of the Adi Dravidar population,” he reasons. Another problem is the style of functioning of the State-level high-powered vigilance and monitoring committee, constituted under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act. “It should meet twice a year. In the districts, it should meet once in three months. It never met when Edappadi K. Palaniswami was the Chief Minister. Now, the reconstituted committee is going to meet on August 17,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-proactive-minister-is-needed-to-tackle-atrocities-against-dalits/article35806821.ece
09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 50% eligible refugees vaccinated against COVID-19||Over 50% of the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in camps are said to have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccines. Of the eligible population of about 35,000 refugees (aged 18 and above), approximately 20,000 had been vaccinated, a senior official of the Rehabilitation Department said, adding that this was as per a conservative estimate. The compilation of the exact figure for those who have received the jabs is being carried out. As is the case across the State, Covishield is being administered more than Covaxin. The total population of refugees in camps is around 58,000. The vaccination drive has picked up momentum in recent weeks. The authorities are taking steps to sensitise the refugees about the importance of vaccination, as the density of population in the camps is higher than elsewhere. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, camps in the State have reported around 2,500 cases, and 40 people have died of the infection. Lately, cases reported at camps in Kanniyakumari and Thoothukudi districts appear to be higher than they were in the past. Fever camps were being held regularly at the refugee camps to monitor the situation, the official said. The frequency of such health check-ups is higher in congested camps. “Mass testing is carried out whenever a camp reports cases,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-50-eligible-refugees-vaccinated-against-covid-19/article35806825.ece
09 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Discussion on within AIADMK on next chairperson||The AIADMK has begun informal discussions on appointing the next party presidium chairman following the vacancy caused by the death of E. Madhusudanan. An opinion is getting formed within the AIADMK in favour of a candidate from religious minorities or Scheduled Castes (SC) for the post. Among those whose names are being talked about are A. Anwhar Raajhaa, minorities wing secretary and former Ramanathapuram MP; J.C.D. Prabhakar, deputy secretary of the minorities wing and former Villivakkam MLA; Tamilmagan Hussain, MGR Mandram secretary; S.P. M. Syed Khan, Theni district secretary and former MP; P. Dhanapal, former Assembly Speaker, A. Arunachalam, former Minister and Deputy Speaker, and P. Venugopal, medical wing secretary and former Tiruvallur MP. Main reason The main reason being cited by many office-bearers for the proposed basis of selection is that the loss or absence of support from the two broad categories of voters is a major factor that caused the AIADMK’s defeat in the Assembly elections. The choice of a person from the minorities or the SCs. will address this issue. Challenges  Given the challenges that the party, while in the Opposition, has to face, the view that several functionaries also hold is that the occupant of the post should be one of the long-standing members of the party; should have an appreciation of legal issues and should be able to withstand any political or legal campaign that the camp of V.K.Sasikala, former interim general secretary, may launch against the party in future. Legal battle Many explain that the post of presidium chairperson acquires importance in the light of the legal battle launched by Mr. Madhusudanan in the Election Commission which led to the freezing of the party symbol, “Two Leaves,” in March 2017. Eventually, the panel had allotted the symbol to the group led by Mr. Madhusudanan. A former Minister observes that when Jayalalithaa was at the helm of affairs, her choices did not invariably create any adverse perception that the party preferred persons from one particular community or the other. But, under the present circumstances, the situation is different. The party co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami, being a Vellala Gounder and Mr Panneerselvam, being a member of the Mukkalathor, will have to take a decision in such a manner that the party is not in the hands of this social group or that group. Others who do not belong to the minorities and SCs but whose names are also being floated are Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, former Forests Minister; K.A.Sengottaiyan, former School Education Minister, S.

09 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools must issue TCs within a week of application, says HC||The Madras High Court has ordered that no school in the State should deny a transfer certificate (TC) to any student on account of any dispute, including the inability of the parents to settle the fees due to the financial strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh stated that those wanting to leave a school must apply for transfer certificates, and such applications must be honoured by the management within a week. Disputes, if any, should be worked out independently as per law. If schools fail to issue TCs within a week, complaints could be made to the jurisdictional Chief Educational Officer, who shall ensure that the certificates are issued. The court would also initiate suo motu contempt proceedings in case of non-compliance, the judge warned. The court passed the orders while disposing of a writ petition filed by United District Self Financing Schools’ Association. The association challenged the State government's instructions that students could change schools without a transfer certificate. Its counsel P. Ebenezer Paul contended that such instructions were against the statutory rules, and that they might go against the interests of the students as there would be no proper records regarding the school from which a student had quit. Concurring with the counsel, the judge overruled the government’s instructions, which were issued to assist students who want to switch schools due to their inability to pay high fees, and ordered that students must obtain a transfer certificate but it could not be denied on any ground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-must-issue-tcs-within-a-week-of-application-says-hc/article35806864.ece

K. Sekarbabu has said. As a first step 539 temples that get an annual income of Rs. 10 lakh each would get the plans done. “Smaller temples can do little things that go a long way. These include improvement of lighting, removing any unnecessary tiles on walls and flooring and keeping their premises clean. Last month we had done a mass cleaning of all temples.

09 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||TFPC and FEFSI heading for a showdown again||The Tamil Film Producers Council and the Film Employees Federation of South India, which is a 25,000 strong workers union, are heading for yet another showdown after Producers Council reportedly annulled the agreement reached with FEFSI unilaterally on August 6. One of the main resolutions said that members of the TFPC are free to employ anyone as per their wish for film shootings. It further said that there would be no negotiations with FEFSI regarding the matter as it had disregarded the agreement with TFPC consistently. The TFPC also said that it would take legal action against any union that tries to intervene or stop filming of any movie. TFPC is also reportedly set to reignite its feud with theatre owners over the payment of ‘Virtual Print Fee’, which they say should be borne by the theatre owners. FEFSI President R.K. Selvamani said that the actor Silambarasan’s dispute with a number of producers from TFPC is at the center of this issue. He said that FEFSI decided to co-operate with producer Isari K. Ganesh’s film, Vendu Thanindhadhu Kadu, starring Silambarasan only after providing clarification and undertakings to the TFPC. Speaking to the reporters, Mr. Selvamani, said, “This has been announced unilaterally. I don’t know if there is some miscommunication. If there was something wrong with me or FEFSI, we are ready to rectify it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tfpc-and-fefsi-heading-for-a-showdown-again/article35806923.ece

It began the street art project by painting the compound wall of the Central Zone office on Huzur Road. On the stretch of the wall between the main gate and the Coimbatore South MLA’s office, the Corporation, by engaging Chennai-based Catalyst Art Foundation, has painted images capturing activities in ancient Tamil life. The Foundation’s programme director K. Phanikumar said images of weaving basket, planting paddy, making pot, milking cow, harvesting cane, playing drums and a few more formed part of the street art. And, there was an image showing the evolution of the Tamil script as well It took an artist five days to complete the wall painting. Even as the artist was going about painting the wall, the project had a good reception, he added. “A woman stopped by to say that the image of weaving basket reflected exactly how she would weave basket,” Mr. Phanikumar recalled and added that a day after painting a few children and parents stopped by to look at the paintings. The Corporation chose the Central Zone office compound wall because it fit perfectly well into the Corporation’s scheme of things and the Foundation’s requirements, said Corporation Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. The civic body and the Foundation surveyed more than 30 places before zeroing in on a few places and then chose the Central Zone office first because the wall belonged to the Corporation, was fit for street art and had good visibility. The Corporation would continue painting on a few more walls as the initiative had received good response from the public. A few residents’ welfare associations had approached the Corporation, the Commissioner said and added that decorating flyovers and subways was also a part of the Corporation’s plan to give a facelift to the city. And, to ensure that the street art was not disturbed, the Corporation was in the process of curtailing sticking bills and would soon invoke the relevant laws to penalise those who stick bills, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-launches-street-art-project/article35806869.ece
09 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Exporters demand measures to address logistics issues||Textile and garment exporters have sought measures by the Union government to address the issue of container shortage. In an interaction recently with the Prime Minister, the export promotion council heads pointed out the challenges they face on the logistics front. According to Manoj Kumar Patodia, chairman of the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council, the acute shortage of containers and the need for greater focus on logistics development were emerging as major challenges. He urged the Government to step in immediately to address the issue of container shortages faced by the exporters which is turning out to be very serious. He also appealed to the Government to include textiles in the priority list while negotiating Free Trade Agreements with the UK, the European Union, Canada, and Australia. Apparel Export Promotion Council chairman A. Sakthivel said the government should look at FTAs with the UK, the EU, and the US, and CEPA with Canada and Australia. Shortage of containers is affecting all exporters and the Government should advise shipping companies to bring empty vessels directly to India, he said. India should develop an Indian Shipping Line of global repute so that the country saves over $ 50 billion annually which exporters are currently remitting as freight charges. While the demand for exports is very good, exporters are facing cash flow issues as buyers are asking for longer periods of credit. Dues from the Government should be released quickly, which will help the exporters, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/exporters-demand-measures-to-address-logistics-issues/article35806860.ece
09 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Industry demands amnesty scheme||The trade and industry here has appealed to the State government to announce an amnesty scheme to settle pending Value Added Tax /Central Sales Tax issues. The industry associations submitted their memorandum to the government at a meeting held on Friday. According to the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia), an amnesty scheme should be introduced to clear pending VAT/CST dues with partial relief in tax payable and full relief from interest and penalty. The government should relax and give time to furnish documents for VAT/CST assessment or any pending audit matters. The Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said entry tax cases pertaining to 15 or 20 years back are now reopened and assessed. When an order is passed, the payment cannot be adjusted or set-off. Hence, a ‘samadhan scheme’ exclusively for Entry Tax may be envisaged. A settlement scheme can be introduced for VAT and CST issues too. The Codissia added that the Goods and Service Act provides for sanctioning refund amount within a specific time. There is a provision to sanction 90 % of the claimed amount within 10 days and balance amount to be sanctioned after verification of claim. This is followed at GST and Central Excise Department. However, it is not followed strictly in State Tax Department. The MSMEs are facing financial hardship because of the pandemic. Sanctioning of refund amount on time will help the industry meet its financial needs. Refund melas can be organised. Further, industries need six months time to make GST and Income Tax payments due in July /August 2021. And, the late fees applicable on delayed filing of GSTR 1 should be waived off. Loans from State Financial Institutions such as the Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation Ltd. (TIIC) etc. needs to be rescheduled for six months and the interest rate for the lockdown period should be nil. All concessions/subsidies provided to the existing SIPCOT / SIDCO Industrial Estates should be extended to all the industrial estates with full infrastructure facilities, for the development of industries, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industry-demands-amnesty-scheme/article35806956.ece

K. Gopalsamy, 38, from Gobirasipuram near Annur, was booked for making casteist remarks against P. Muthusamy, 56, a Dalit working as a thandalkarar at the village office, and for preventing public servants from discharging their duty. The action was taken a day after a video of Mr. Muthusamy falling at the feet of Gopalsamy and apologising to him was widely circulated. Cases were registered under Sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the IPC, based on complaints lodged by Mr. Muthusamy and village administrative officer V. Kalaiselvi. With Gopalsamy’s act drawing widespread criticism, Coimbatore Collector G.S. Sameeran tasked a team, headed by District Revenue Officer P.S. Leela Alex, to conduct an inquiry. Ms. Alex’s report considered the video the main evidence. It also showed Gopalsamy admitting his mistake and accepting the Dalit man’s apology. Based on the inquiry, the Collector sent a letter to Coimbatore District (Rural) Superintendent of Police S. Selvanagarathinam, directing him to take action against Gopalsamy. The Collector’s letter said no one had seen Mr. Muthusamy beating Gopalsamy, as claimed by him in a complaint to the police.

09 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Hundreds swarm riverside to perform Aadi Amavasai rituals||Hundreds of people gathered at Pechiamman Padithurai on the southern bank of Vaigai river to perform rituals in remembrance of their forebears on Sunday on the occasion of Aadi Amavasai. With all temples out of bounds for devotees in view of COVID-19 threat, they had gathered on the bathing ghat. Two priests performed the rituals for batches of 50 to 60 persons. “None of them wore face mask or maintained physical distance,” said one of the residents, V. N. Ganesan. People thronged the riverbed from 4.30 a.m. There was a semblance of discipline till the day break when shoppers also gathered at the weekly poultry market on the riverbank. “As the people coming to sell and buy poultry birds and pigeons also gathered in large numbers, the entire South Bank Road was awash with people,” he added. Some of those who had gone to Vaigai riverbed near Kalpalam for performing the rituals were chased away by the police. However that crowd also trickled into nearby Pechiamman Padithurai. Later, a team of police personnel chased all those who had come for the rituals and the poultry market from the river bank road. Sathuragiri hills Meanwhile, the ban on entry for devotees into Sathuragiri hills rendered Thaniparai foothills deserted.

Nagar is a popular spot in the city for walkers and fitness enthusiasts. But the area close to the entrance of the park has turned into an eyesore due to dumping of garbage. Two dumper bins that were placed on the Lake View Road close to East 4th Street in K.K. Nagar for the convenience of residents were removed and the public continue to dump garbage at the same place, now on the pavement. People who use the Lake View Road also bring their garbage and throw it on this spot. A woman residing in K.K. Nagar said that the Corporation should place a dumper bin there. She said that stray cattle and dogs rummage through the pile and scatter them all over the place, while gogs bring the garbage bags into the residential areas. The Corporation has been urging people to maintain cleanliness in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, in the absence of dumper bins, people had no choice but to throw garbage on the roadside, she said. A regular to the Walkers Park, D. Raghavan, said that the place would become messy once the monsoon sets in. The authorities should act before the rains, he said. Another resident T. Thirumurugan said that it was the bounden duty of the authorities to ensure a clean environment. The residents said that dumper bins must be placed at many places at a regular gap.

09 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||A third of govt.-trained priests become ineligible for recruitment by HR&CE Dept.||After a gruelling wait of more than 12 years, over a third of the 200-odd people from all castes, who underwent training for temple priesthood in 2007-08, have become ineligible for recruitment to the posts of priests as the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department has an age ceiling of 35. Non-Brahmin priests trained at six pathasalas during the erstwhile regime of former Chief Minister Karunanidhi are looking to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin for relaxation in the age criterion to help them realise their dreams of performing pujas in HR&CE Department-administered temples. “Karunanidhi brought about reformation by allowing people from all castes to become priests in HR&CE Department-run temples. We were thrilled to undergo training in the pathasalas . However, a prolonged legal battle delayed the job opportunities,” said a person from Madurai, who was trained at the government pathasala .  Their hopes were revived when the DMK government, after getting re-elected, expressed its intention of appointing non-Brahmins as priests in temples. “The eligibility criterion, as per a recent announcement of the HR&CE Department to recruit temple priests across the State, has, however, come as a shock to many of us,” said another person from Theni. Legal battle Many could have now got at least 10 years’ experience as priests in HR&CE Department-run temples had things been smooth for the State government’s reformation plan. “However, many of us have lost precious years of our youth due to legal complications. Of the 202 people trained in the pathasalas, 76 of us have crossed the age of 35, and have now become ineligible,” he added. They want the Chief Minister to provide five years’ relaxation in the age criterion so that all trained priests can be eligible for recruitment to government-run temples. “In the usual recruitment for government departments, candidates from the Backward Classes, the Most Backward Classes and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes get relaxation in the age ceiling. But this is a peculiar case, and to bring about changes in the age criterion, the government needs to bring in an amendment to the HR&CE Act/rules,” said a senior official of the Department.

09 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Difficulty in identifying colours will pose a problem to candidate: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has allowed an appeal preferred by Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) against a Single Bench order that directed the Corporation to provide employment to a man found to be deficient in identifying colours. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T. S. Sivagnanam took note of the fact that the candidate was qualified. However, in the medical examination, he had difficulty in identifying colours. The panel included an ophthalmologist. Tangedco rejected the candidature on the grounds that the job of the engineer would involve dealing with power cables and wires which were colour-coded. With his condition, it would be difficult for him to discharge his duties. The Single Bench in its order had observed that the candidate was not colour blind as such. The condition of defective colour vision might not be an impediment to discharge the duties of an Assistant Electrical Engineer. The Division Bench observed that a specialised team was set up with an ophthalmologist on board to consider the matter and the committee was of the opinion that the man could not be allowed to take up the post. Considering the wires and sensitive electrical equipment that were to be handled by engineers, the man would be at risk if he was allowed to discharge his duties. The decision of Tangedco could not be said to be without basis. Engineers had to to function, sometimes in closed places, with the help of a torch or flashlight. In emergency situations they had to decide, in a split second, which wire to pull and which not to touch, the judges said. The judges observed that if the decision-making at such a time was impaired or affected by the condition, the person might be found unfit for the position. Courts should be slow in interfering in such areas, particularly where judges might not have the requisite expertise, they said, and set aside the Single Bench order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/difficulty-in-identifying-colours-will-pose-a-problem-to-candidate-hc/article35806925.ece

R. Sowmya and her cousins N. Nandhitha and N. Souparnika, students of the Government Model School in Erode, did not have much to do except for online classes during the lockdown period. The girls thus found a new hobby of making bird nests with coconut fibre. To their surprise, a sparrow found home in the first nest they made and hatched eggs in it. This boosted the confidence of the girls and they decided to make more nests and sell them for a profit. They procure coconut fibre from a market in the neighbourhood and once the nests are ready, display it along the main road near their house. “The nests come in 20 different models and are sold for Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 each. We have sold all the nests made so far,” said Sowmya, a Class VII student. The students use discarded cardboard boxes to give the nests desired shapes and cover it with coconut fibre and twine. Though it started as a hobby, the students said they would continue making the nests as it helped them support their family financially during the lockdown. Sowmya’s father Rajendran runs a small mess and her mother is a home maker. N. Nanditha and N.Souparnika are in Class VIII and Class VI respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-school-students-master-the-art-of-making-bird-nests/article35806960.ece

09 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Ramping up infrastructure is imperative||There has been much buzz on the revival of industrial activity in the Union Territory, but the business community is of the firm opinion that improvement is possible only if infrastructure is ramped up in the industrial estates. Industrialists also are of the view that any move to improve the condition of industrial estates at Mettupalayam, Thirubhuvanai, Sederapet and Polagam has to begin with making the Pondicherry Industrial Promotion Development and Investment Corporation Limited (PIPDIC), the agency which manages the estates, more effective and functional. Except for some repair works at Mettupalayam, the agency has not taken up any road improvement work or work for providing streetlights and drinking water for several years. Even the briefest visit to these estates can highlight the sorry state of affairs in the sprawling facilities. Pothole-ridden roads make the ride bumpy and travel during the nights through the estates become scary as most of the streetlights are dysfunctional. The streetlights are either under repair or damaged by miscreants for the obvious reason of theft under the cover of darkness. M. Thiruvengadam, secretary for PIPDIC Industrial Estate, Thirubhuvanai, said the roads are damaged to such an extent that heavy vehicles carrying finished goods or raw material get stuck often. “Adding to the problem is the issue of streetlights. Most of them are either faulty or completely damaged by miscreants. There are a few pharma companies which run two to three shifts and staff have to travel during the night,” he said adding women staff feel really unsafe to travel in the night. PIPDIC officials, he said, believed that their job ends with signing the lease agreement for the land with the owner of a business establishment. “It is the nodal agency for business promotion. They have a much larger role to play. Now, most of the industries have to face enormous hardship for annual renewal of trade licence in commune panchayats. PIPDIC should play a more active role,” he said. Thefts inside the estate have become common, he charged. Joseph Rozario, Director of MetalScope in Sederapet Industrial Estate, said, “Bringing customers from outside the territory, transporting raw material and sending the finished goods have become extremely difficult due to the condition of the estates. If revived, the Sederapet estate could turn out to be a business hub due to its close proximity to Tindivanam Highway.” The government should create a road map for industrial promotion and act accordingly, he added. Former Member of Parliament and Economist M. Ramadass said the fast deceleration in industrial activity that led to sickness and closure of many industrial units and the consequent retrenchment of workers should be of a major concern to the government. As a first step toward revival, the government should constitute a committee comprising academics, financial experts, industrialists and senior officials. The company should be mandated to bring out a strategy to revive the industrial units and attracting new entities. PIPDIC and the District Industries Centre should be revitalised to meet the demands of changing industrial scenario. The government should increase the capital outlay for industrial growth by earmarking 5% of its budgetary outlay. The industrial infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, water supply, access to transport, raw materials and marketing facilities in the industrial estates should be augmented. Industries Secretary E. Vallavan told The Hindu that the government had already directed PIPDIC to prepare an estimate for improving the infrastructure at Sederapet and Thirubhuvanai industrial estates. Once the estimate was ready, the government planned to approach Union Commerce Ministry for funding, he said.  PIPDIC and the District Industries Centre should be revitalised to meet the demands of the changing industrial scenario||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ramping-up-infrastructure-is-imperative/article35807204.ece
09 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Varsity licences wastewater treatment tech to Mumbai firm||Pondicherry University has successfully commercialised the wastewater treatment technology that was developed in-house by a research group at its Centre for Pollution Control and Environmental Engineering, School of Engineering and Technology. Gurmeet Singh, Vice Chancellor of Pondicherry University said that the inexpensive and eco-friendly wastewater treatment technology developed by the research group, comprising S.A.Abbasi, S. Gajalalakshmi and Tasneem Abbasi, had been licensed to a Mumbai firm. Vision Earthcare (P) Limited, a Mumbai-based company, has been granted licence for non-exclusive rights on the use of the University’s patented technology. According to the inventors, the unique feature of Pondicherry University-licensed technology is that it is over six times less expensive than the next cheapest conventional technology while being as effective and efficient as the best. It is also ‘self-propagating’, requiring very low energy inputs, material inputs and maintenance effort. B.M. Jaffar Ali, coordinator, Intellectual Property Rights Cell, Pondicherry University said in 2018, a patent was granted to Pondicherry University, after the technology had been extensively field-tested on several pilot plants set up within Pondicherry University campus, as well as in some villages of Puducherry. This technology is promoted under the trade name ‘SHEFEROL’ (acronym for “sheet-flow root level” reactor), comprising channels in which short-statured terrestrial, amphibious, or aquatic weeds are packed to capacity. The unique design and operation of SHEFROL enables it to achieve removal of numerous pollutants in a single step, or ‘pot’, in contrast to conventional technologies which need several different units in series. Low ecological footprint This entails very significant cost advantage and reduction of ecological footprint. The developed technology is particularly suited for the treatment of sewage. “As of now over 75% of it is discharged untreated, playing havoc with our rivers, lakes and ponds. It is also believed to be the biggest source of most water-borne diseases, leading to avoidable expenditure of billions of rupees per year in healthcare and lost man-days,” the University said. The research group is actively involved in the field of mitigating pollution and rendering environmental remediation and have published over 17 research articles in indexed international journals on the various scientific and technological aspects of the wastewater treatment technology. It is hoped that commercialisation of SHEFROL will lead to the emergence of many more such technologies from Pondicherry University in the near future. Pondicherry University has also patented related downstream technologies developed by this research group, with which the sludge and the spent plants coming out of SHEFROL reactors and similar sources, can be converted into organic fertilizer. However, this is the first patented technology coming from the research laboratory of the Pondicherry University that is getting commercialised.  A patent was granted to Pondicherry University, after the technology was extensively field-tested on several pilot plants set up within the Pondicherry University campus, as well as in some villages of Puducherry B.M.

Devotees were not allowed to Sri Ramanathaswamy temple and also to the Agnitheeram seashore. The police had put up picketing ahead of Pamban Bridge to stop devotees from various parts of the State entering the island. The announcement of the district administration to ban entry of devotees from August 1 had helped in people not planning their pilgrimage to the island. “Last year, the police had to face the ire of the devotees as many the announcement of ban of entry to devotees came in the last minute,” a police officer said. The devotees who had come from the length and breadth of the country complained that they had incurred huge expenditure on their travel only to have darshan and the holy dip on the festival day. The devotees would also offer ‘tharpanam’ to their ancestors on this day. Suspension of train services to the island also came handy for the police to contain the movement of people to Rameswaram. However, special pujas were conducted inside the temple and the procession of the presiding deities was confined to the premises. The police had prevented people from entering Sethukarai and Devipattinam as these places attract a large number of devotees from the neighbouring districts. Sathuragiri hills  The ban on entry for devotees into Sathuragiri hills rendered Thaniparai foothills deserted.

09 August 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Motorists allege irregularities in toll collection at Yercaud||Motorists travelling to Yercaud have alleged irregularities in toll collection on the ghat road here. The ghat road between Salem and Yercaud is primarily used road by motorists to reach the hill station. The block development office here has set up a toll booth at the beginning of the road. Motorists using the road complained that receipts or tokens were not issued to them for paying toll charges. For two-wheelers, Rs. 10 was collected and for cars Rs. 40 to use the ghat road, authorities said. A motorist who used the ghat road on Saturday said he was charged Rs. 10 and staff at the booth refused to provide token or receipt despite demanding for it. Some motorists alleged that toll receipts were being provided only for a few vehicles. Despite the district administration prohibiting tourism activities in the hill station during weekends, toll was being collected from people instead of turning them away. Several vehicles were turned away on Saturday and Sunday at the police check post past the toll booth, the motorists said. Officials from the block development office said tender would be called for every year to run the toll booth. But, this year, bids were not invited due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the booth was being maintained by the office at present. The authorities said staff at the toll booth had been strictly instructed to issue receipts for the toll collected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/motorists-allege-irregularities-in-toll-collection-at-yercaud/article35806954.ece

09 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Complacent public fail to mask up||Though the threat of the third wave of COVID-19 looms large, a section of the public continues to flout COVID-19 norms, prompting the Tiruchi Corporation to resume inspection and impose fines to ensure adherence to protocol. It is not that people are unaware about the necessity to wear masks and to follow personal distancing norms for protection from COVID-19 but they have been lulled into a sense of complacency. The onset of the second wave highlighted not just the unpredictability of the virus, but also the damage COVID-19 variants and negligence can cause. The public seems to have forgotten it quickly, a senior health official said. “It is disheartening to see this. While we continue to harp on about wearing masks, it is the people who have to understand the seriousness,” the official said. Some say that the weather in the city causes discomfort and therefore they are unable to wear masks. “I am feeling breathless and am not able to wear my mask for a long duration. However, I must go to work to earn a living,” a woman in Woraiyur said. At the Mainguard Gate, where families and youth spend time on weekends shopping and having street food, mask-wearing was at its bare minimum. “We have all got the COVID-19 vaccine. We believe we are safe,” a shopper said seemingly ignorant of the consequences of such an attitude. The public needs more awareness, a senior citizen said. “We are telling them to wear masks and also levying fines, but those who flout the norms do not understand the effect of the virus. Those who have been affected by it, whether directly or through the loss of a family member will be cautious. Better awareness methods are required,” he said. Speaking to The Hindu , City Health Officer M. Yazhini said that the civic body had resumed the collection of fines three days ago. “On the first day, we collected Rs. 1.70 lakh, while on Friday and Saturday, sums of Rs. 53,000 and Rs. 35,000 were levied. We will continue to do so until the public follow the norms,” she said. Dr. Yazhini also urged the public to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a protection against the viral infection Inoculation of pregnant women In a move to ensure that pregnant women would get the COVID-19 vaccine in the city, the Tiruchi Corporation has arranged for free vaccination. While the response of pregnant women in rural areas has been good as they depend on Primary Healthcare Centres, in the city, a large number of women consult doctors at private hospitals, where vaccines are not available. To bridge this gap, the district administration would purchase vaccines directly from the suppliers for private clinics through donations and CSR funds, and inoculate the pregnant women for free. “This way, the doctor that the women consult can encourage them to take the vaccine,” Dr. Yazhini said. The doctors too would feel safe, she added. The administration of the vaccine would be done through the health workers of the Tiruchi Corporation itself. “We have mobile vans we are using this to inoculate some special groups. These vans would go to the private clinics to inoculate the women when the hospitals reach out to us,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complacent-public-fail-to-mask-up/article35806928.ece
09 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Despite lull in construction, price of brick goes up||The price of country bricks has gone up by 20% in Tiruchi, much to the dismay of builders who are also surprised since there has not been any surge in construction activity. The price of country bricks manufactured by several kilns at Kondayampettai near Thiruvanaikoil is a case in point. Though many builders prefer bricks produced by chambers (modern brick kilns), the country brick, which is popularly known as “Kondayampettai kal” has a niche market in the construction industry owing to its sturdiness and strength. The rise in the price of these bricks that are commonly used in Tiruchi, Ariyalur, Perambalur and Pudukottai districts has become noticeable after the State government eased curbs on total lockdown. Before the lockdown imposed after the State elections, one load of brick (2,500 nos) was sold for Rs. 16,250 in Tiruchi. If bricks were to be delivered outside Tiruchi city, it was supplied for Rs. 17,500. One load of brick is now being priced at Rs. 18,750. It costs Rs. 20,000 in the peripheries of Tiruchi. The price varies depending upon the distance between the supplier’s point and construction site, brick traders say. Though there is no real surge in new construction projects due to the cascading impact of the two successive lockdows since March 2020, it is said that the price of bricks has gone up by 20%. The current demand is mainly from unfinished projects, which were launched before the first lockdown in 2020, according to builders. The long break in labour centric supply chain management in brick kilns, reduction in brick manufacturing and upward trend of fuel prices are the main reasons for the steep hike in rate of bricks, they explained. According to industry sources, a section of brick kilns workers, who had returned to their native places, were yet to return to the work places. Similarly, due to poor demand some of the leading brick manufacturers have brought down the production by nearly 50%. Moreover, surge in fuel prices, particularly diesel, was said to have shot up the input costs of manufacturing and supply of bricks. “Stringent mobility restrictions and frequent closure of shops and establishments have disrupted the manufacturing and supply chain of bricks. It has fuelled the cost of bricks,” says P. Dharmar of Thiruvanaikoil, a brick and sand supplier in Thiruvanaikoil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/despite-lull-in-construction-price-of-brick-goes-up/article35806920.ece
09 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Re-opening of schools has triggered fear among teachers||Now that the government looks serious about resuming in-person classes for higher levels from the September, notwithstanding the fears of third wave of the pandemic, several teachers have raised concerns about mingling with unvaccinated children. The school education department had, after a phase of vaccine-hesitancy among a section of teachers, prevailed upon a majority to see reason and fall in line to get their vaccine jabs. “Later on, the teachers did evince interest and got themselves vaccinated in large numbers. The special vaccination drives in schools did helped in immunising a number of teachers against COVID-19,” according to a senior head master of a government higher secondary school. “The teachers are now of the view that the government must undertake special vaccination drive to cover students who will be attending classes from September,” he said. The government has said that classes must be conducted with 50 per cent students in attendance in order to comply with physical distancing norms. “No doubt, the in-person classes are bound to help the students at higher levels to get serious about their academic activities. But, before that, the government must carry out special drives to vaccinate the children of higher level,” a teacher of a government-aided school said. The Tamil Nadu government, officials said, was toeing the line of other States in a ‘wait and watch’ mode. The Puducherry government had deferred its earlier decision to re-open schools from July 16, factoring in the unexpected rise in number of COVID-19 cases. The Karnataka government had earlier announced that the schools will re-open for classes IX to XII from August 23. The UNICEF had, earlier this month, observed that limited access to health services and immunization outreach was the reason for a number of children not receiving even their very first vaccinations. The State Government, official sources said, was unable to initiate a drive for inoculating children at this juncture due to the limited availability of vaccines even for adults.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/re-opening-of-schools-has-triggered-fear-among-teachers/article35806921.ece

Teams of police personnel were deployed in front of the Amma Mandapam from Saturday evening itself and barricades were put up blocking the path leading to the bathing ghat along the Cauvery river. Over 100 police personnel in shifts were deployed at Amma Mandapam and other places along the Cauvery and Coleroon river in Srirangam police station limits.

09 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||19 stone quarries raided||Surprise raids were conducted on 19 stone quarries in Radhapuram taluk by a team of revenue officials on Sunday as Collector V. Vishnu received several complaints about illegal quarrying in the region, bordering Kanniyakumari and Kerala. Mr. Vishnu recently inspected a few spots in this region along with V. Sivakrishamurthy, Sub-Collector, Cheranmahadevi. Subsequently, Mr. Vishnu chaired a meeting where he instructed revenue, police and mining department officials to toughen surveillance on illegal mining of all sorts of minerals while marking only two routes via Kavalkinaru and Anjugramam check-posts to take minerals to Kanniyakumari or Kerala. Whenever a sand or stone-laden vehicle crossed these check-posts, the policemen or officials deployed there would check the permit. If any violation was found, criminal action would be initiated against the drivers and the owners of the vehicles, Mr. Vishnu warned. The Collector also instructed the Tahsildars to convene taluk-level committees twice a month to look into the complaints against illicit quarrying and take appropriate action. The action taken report should be submitted at the district-level meeting. Village Administrative Officers should alert instantly their higher-ups – Revenue Inspectors, Tahsildars, police and the Department of Mines – about illegal quarrying or stocking of minerals, if any, in the areas under their jurisdiction. Those who failed to honour this instruction would face a serious action, Mr. Vishnu warned. Against this backdrop, Mr. Sivakrishnamurthy, along with 30 officials, raided 19 quarries in Radhapuram taluk, mostly in and around Irukkanthurai and Koodankulam, since Sunday morning. The raids that lasted for more than nine hours to ascertain the quantum of minerals mined and the areas of mining were conducted at the stock yards and the routes being used to transport the quarried minerals also. Since mining operations within a distance of five km from the nuclear reactors of Koodankulam have been banned, the officials also checked the distance between the quarries and Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project site. They employed Differential Global Positioning System to ascertain if mining had been done only in the permitted areas and in permitted quantity. A group of residents from Soochikulam met Mr. Sivakrishamurthy and appealed to him to ban quarrying as the explosives being used in the quarries were triggering serious cracks in their houses. “We’ve started the inspection today which may take considerable time for completing it. If any violation is established, appropriate action will be taken,” said Mr. Sivakrishnamurthy. When Mr. Sivakrishnamurthy was going for the raid in the morning, he impounded a stone-laden lorry near Valliyoor for overweight and took the vehicle to the police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/19-stone-quarries-raided-following-complaints/article35806950.ece
09 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Adi amavasai prayers held in houses||The beaches and the Tamirabharani watercourse wore a deserted look on Sunday as the police had prohibited offering prayers near the waterbodies on the occasion of Adi amavasai. As the Hindus would gather in large number at Papanasam and along the Tamirabharani watercourse up to Punnaikayal in Thoothukudi district to offer special prayers in memory of their ancestors, the State government had banned it in the wake of the pandemic. Subsequently, police personnel were deployed in these places since Sunday morning to discourage the people from gathering near the Tamirabharani to offer prayers. Sorimuthu Ayyanar Temple inside Kalakkad– Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve near Papanasam dam that would attract thousands of devotees for Adi amavasai ceremonies wore a deserted look on Sunday. However, special prayers being offered in the shrine were conducted as usual. Only a few people, who took the narrow lanes to reach the river, took bath in the Tamirabharani and offered prayers in the places where no policemen had been deployed. Most of the people offered the prayers in their houses itself. Thoothukudi In Thoothukudi, police personnel had been deployed at specific points near the Tamirabharani watercourse where the people would usually gather for offering prayers and also at beaches. Police stopped the people going to the beach at Terespuram and New Harbour Beach by putting barricades across the roads leading to these places. In Tiruchendur, police personnel were deployed on all the roads leading to the beach to stop the people, who could not offer prayers near Bhairvar Temple either due to the police presence. When Hindu Munnani State vice-president V.P. Jayakumar and a few others tried to offer prayers, they were stopped by the police. They subsequently, offered Adi amavasai prayers near a pond close to Vinayaga Temple and left the spot. Similar situation prevailed near Chairman Arunachala Swamy Temple in Eral. Kanniyakumari In Kanniyakumari, the police personnel deployed near the traffic island near Bharathi Guest House, Siluvai Nagar, Leepuram Road, Thalakulam Road, Vivekanandapuram Road, Four-lane Zero Point and other points sent back the people who came to the beach for offering prayers.

The road leading to the temple to the extent of 200 meters is in a damaged condition. Devotees coming barefoot are the most inconvenienced, due to the rough surface. Even two-wheeler riders face the risk of skidding due to the presence of loose gravel and pits. Petitions submitted by devotees to the district administration have not been acted upon. Devotees believe the onus is on the local body and the HR & CE Department to swing into action for remedial measures. Saravanan Natesan Puthanampatti   While the solid waste collection process undertaken by the Tiruchi Corporation at residential localities is commendable, and the sewage removal is also satisfactory, the sight of chopped branches on the roads for lengthy durations are an eye sore. In localities like Mangamma Nagar and Sudarsan Nagar in Srirangam, the branches cut down by the Electricity Department to safeguard power lines have not been removed. Cattle foraging on the fallen branches make matters worse, by obstructing vehicular traffic. T.M. Ranganathan Srirangam   Branches of trees that had to be cut down to prevent contact with electric lines are usually left uncleared until the residents pressurise the civic body. In a recent instance, when the City Corporation was sounded about dumping of branches in vacant plots in Srinivasa Nagar, the Corporation acted by removing the waste materials in a truck. But, this work is carried out only in bits and pieces. The Corporation has to act fast before hoteliers, shopkeepers and other vendors get emboldened to convert vacant plots into garbage dumps. V. Sundararaju Srinivasa Nagar South   Several homeless people, alms-seekers, and wandering destitutes who have been living on roads across the city are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. People with mental illness could be found wandering near Cantonment military canteen on Lawsons Road, Raynolds Road, near Axis Bank on Bharathidasan Road, and Williams Road, making themselves vulnerable to anti-social elements. They move around along with their belongings in dirty dresses, and do not wear face masks. These people need to be protected from anti-social elements. M. Sainithii Cantonment   There are indications that not all women construction workers are aware of the government’s free bus service privilege for them. Awareness about the government scheme must be created, to protect them from contracting pandemic virus while hitch-hiking. Stan Victor Ponnagar   The DMK announced in its manifesto that it would give Rs. 1,000/- p.m. to women head of the family as mentioned in family card. But this has not been implemented even after the passage of two months. The government ought to pay women from the month of June itself. It is the bounden duty of the party to implement its assurance on financial sop for women. S.

It is very difficult to ride on this road once it is dark. I request the corporation authorities to ensure that this important and busy road is well-lit so that accidents can be prevented. M. Sundararajan, Surveyor Colony   The road stretch between Keelavasal junction and Teppakulam is choked with vehicles after a median was constructed recently. There are only four points where vehicles can take a ‘U’ turn on the more than four-km stretch. It has become difficult for pedestrians also to cross the road. Men, women and even children jump over the median dangerously. I request the Collector and highways authorities to ensure that the new set-up is trouble-free for motorists and pedestrians. G.

As passengers from southern districts - right from Kanniyakumari to Virudhunagar - prefer this train to travel to Chennai as it is the first train to reach there in the morning, more coaches must be attached to it.

09 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||State govt. is taking all steps to manage the pandemic: Minister||“The State government is taking all steps to manage the epidemic. We are ready to face a third wave, if there is one,” Minister for Handloom, Textiles and Sugar Shankar Patil Munenakoppa said in Hubballi on Sunday. He was speaking at an interaction with journalists at the Chigurupati Mallikarjun Rao Memorial Swarn Bhavan organised by the district unit of the Karnataka Union of Working Journalists. “Some experts have said that the third wave could hit by the end of September or early October. But I feel that if people don’t follow health protocols, then such a wave can arrive sooner. Kerala and Maharashtra are witnessing a surge in positive cases. If we do not follow the rules, then we will also see a sharp rise in such cases,” he said. He said that steps are being taken to reduce the loss of lives. The district has lost 1,284 people to the pandemic in the first two waves. “With Central aid, we are ensuring that every taluk gets an oxygen plant or a ventilator system. They will be functional in two weeks. We will not allow anyone to die for want of oxygen,” he said. There are 750 paediatric beds to manage new cases in the district. Development works in the twin cities are being delayed due to lack of co-ordination between officials and due to some technical reasons, he said. He said that he would convene a meeting of officers to review these works. Earlier, he was felicitated by KUWJ members. He agreed to resolve the issue of housing faced by journalists in the twin cities. KUWJ district president Ganapati Gangolli, office-bearers Sushilendra Kundaragi, Veeresh Handigi, Gururaj Hugar, Jagadish Burlabaddi, Manjunath Jaratarghar, Vaman Bhandage and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-is-taking-all-steps-to-manage-the-pandemic-minister/article35806970.ece

However, no deadline can be fixed for implementation, as there are many legal and technical issues involved, he said. 24 x 7 water scheme He said that the government will find a permanent solution to the problem of drinking water supply in the twin cities. “We have allotted Rs. 2,900 crore for the 24 x 7 drinking water project,” he added. Jaljeevan and other schemes will be implemented in the rural areas, he said. He hoped the projects will be completed by the end of the term of this government.

09 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Creating those water coolers online||V. Nancy’s early weeks in the corporate world are best described as close to disastrous. Onboarded online, her work-from-home colleagues often greeted her overtures of friendship with frosty silence. Worse still, the lack of in-person contact led her to see offence where none was intended. “I was badgering a colleague with too many questions about my project through Slack (a communication platform) and as he tried explaining things to me over the phone, but I thought his tone was harsh. Lack of face-to-face contact did make some early interactions with colleagues feel more transactional,” says Ms. Nancy, who was hired three months ago by a multinational company in Bengaluru. Ms. Nancy found out the hard way that online conference tools can be an ally in team bonding only when teams have bonded organically around the water cooler. In the current scenario, it takes extra effort from the new hire to make that connection. Buddy partner Realising the challenges in online onboarding, proactive organisations assign a buddy to help the new hire. They also keep the feedback loop open. Vikas Arora (name changed), a campus hire after his internship with an investment bank, was assigned a buddy partner from the team but the latter was hard pressed for time. “Friday was when he would entertain questions from me. Thankfully, I had figured out many things during my internship in the same firm or navigating the early months would have been tough,” reveals Mr. Arora. For Anu M., who joined a German multinational last year, the first few months were beset with anxiety despite the fact that she came with 10 years of experience. There was no clarity on her role and she did not know how to use the communication tools effectively. It was only after some team members reassured her that “no question is silly and you can ask any number of questions” that Ms. Anu stopped being diffident about seeking clarifications. “Only after I got done with my first project release did I get the confidence,” reveals Ms. Anu. Welcome kits and feedback Even before Ms. Anu could formally join work, a welcome kit that included a letter, diary, pen, and candles was delivered home. Once she joined, a team member was assigned as buddy. To improve the onboarding process, the HR sought feedback 15 days after she had joined and repeated the exercise two months later. “Questions ranged from ‘did the manager talk to you on the first day?’ and ‘did you feel welcomed by the team in the first week?’ to ‘did you get the right support?’” says Ms. Anu. Training managers Satya Sharma, co-founder and CHRO, TO THE NEW, a digital technology company, says integrating new hires into the organisation’s culture is a challenge. “While we have certain processes and practices in place, we have to up the ante. Organisations will have a strategic advantage if they understand the dynamics of engaging people working from home,” he says, adding that his organisation has declared a permanent work from anywhere for all employees. Engagement initiatives should help reinforce company culture — as the workforce is parked online, there should be more of these initiatives. Mr. Sharma cites the example of the virtual town hall conducted every quarter. He adds, “I will not say we have cracked it completely but we are consciously working towards it. For instance, we train our line managers on how to develop a rapport with not just a joinee but also older employees.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/creating-those-water-coolers-online/article35806785.ece
09 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Schools, parents in a tussle over fee||School managements and parents are involved in a tussle over the fee structure for the 2021–22 academic year. While school managements are charging a higher fee when compared with that collected in the year when the pandemic hit, parents say they are finding it difficult to pay as they have faced salary cuts or financial losses during the second wave of COVID-19. Sumana S., mother of a class nine student who studies in a CBSE-affiliated school, said she had not paid the complete fee for the previous academic year. “While our daughter has been promoted to the next grade, she has not got her marks and her report card,” she said. Another parent, Harish K., whose sons study in a school in north Bengaluru, said he did not want to pay the fee this academic year till the High Court passes an order on the fee structure. “We paid the full fee of the last academic year and were told that we will get a 30% refund on the tuition fee, but the management refused to refund. So we will pay only once the matter is resolved.” D.Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools, said they had asked schools to collect the fee charged during the 2019–20. “We have told schools not to charge the full computer fee, extra curricular fee and fee under different sub-heads that students may not be using. But schools will have to collect a portion of these fees as many of them will have to clear loans and will incur other expenses,” he said. In the 2020–21 academic year, the State government issued an order stating that schools can charge 70% of the tuition fee charged for the academic year before the COVID-19 outbreak. They had stated that no other fee can be charged under any other subheads. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said they had received several complaints pertaining to schools charging fee over and above what was stipulated by the government last year. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, DPS Group of Schools, said the matter was sub judice . “We are charging the fee that we charged in the 2019–20 academic year. Many parents have still not paid the fee and we will wait for the court order on this,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-parents-in-a-tussle-over-fee/article35806793.ece

Soon after the meeting, Ms. Shaw said it was a fruitful affair. “Had a very engaging meeting with Mr. Bommai to discuss economic and infrastructure issues. We are confident that he will drive visible change and [have] assured him of our support,” she tweeted.

09 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two killed as car knocks down bike in Bengaluru||Two labourers from Rajasthan were killed when a car allegedly driven by a 26-year-old event manager under the influence of alcohol knocked them down on Banashankari 9th Main Road on Saturday night. The impact of the accident was such that the car knocked down the bike in front of it, jumped on the footpath and crashed into signboards of shops on the footpath, before coming to a halt. People who were walking on the footpath escaped narrowly, but later in a fit of rage thrashed the driver before the police arrived at the spot. The incident occurred at around 11 p.m. when Suhas Venkatesh, a resident of Padmanabhanagar, was returning from a party with his female friend. He lost control over the SUV and knocked down two persons riding the bike, the police said. The deceased have been identified as Ketharam, 40, a carpenter, and his assistant Keemaram, 28. According to the police, the duo hailed from Rajasthan and were living in a rented house at Cauverynagar in Banashankari. They were working in an under-construction apartment and returning home after work. While Ketharam, who was riding the bike, was crushed to death on the spot, Keemaram was tossed in the air and fell on the footpath, sustaining severe head injuries. The victims were shifted to a hospital, where Keemaram succumbed later. Suhas was also admitted to the hospital and is recovering. The police said his blood sample test confirmed that he was under the influence of alcohol. The police are waiting to take him into custody for further interrogation. According to eyewitnesses, the car was being driven in a zigzag way before it crashed into the footpath, after which the driver and the woman tried to flee from the spot. Passers-by thrashed Sushas, who allegedly tried to misbehave with them and later alerted the police control room. The family of the deceased told the police that the duo had come to the city eight years ago and were working in an apartment complex. They had gone to their home town two months ago during the lockdown and had returned to the city a month ago. The Banashankari traffic police have registered a case against Suhas, charging him under section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and section 304 (causing death by negligence).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-killed-as-car-knocks-down-bike-in-banashankari/article35806776.ece

Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools, and arrested five persons. Mr. Kumar was attacked outside his house at Mutyalanagar on the night of July 29. The police have recovered a pistol along with ammunition, lethal weapons, pepper spray, two bikes, and two mobile phones from the accused. On July 29, a group of four armed men attacked Mr. Kumar while he was getting down from his car. In a bid to escape, he got back into the car, took out the licensed pistol and opened fire in the air, following which the accused escaped. Soon after the incident, the police with the help of CCTV camera footage and call record details, tracked down the accused and arrested them. Investigations revealed that the attack was plotted by a member of a parents’ association who engaged a group of habitual offenders to eliminate the 51-year-old Mr. Kumar to take over his position. Key accused on the run While the police arrested five people, the prime accused along with others is absconding and efforts are on to track them down, Dharmendra Kumar Meena, DCP North division, said. The assailants have murder cases pending against them at various police stations. The prime accused had approached the assailants, who had come out on bail a few months ago, and gave the contract to eliminate Mr. Kumar, Guruprasad A., Jalahalli police inspector, said. He had rented a house six months ago for the accused near Mr. Kumar’s residence so that they could keep a watch on his movements to plan the attack, the police said. According to thepolice, the prime accused in the case, an activist, was involved in a case of kidnap of a school owner in Vijayanagar last year to extort money. The accused wanted to take over Mr. Kumar’s position to extort money from private school owners, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/case-of-attack-on-school-association-general-secretary-cracked/article35806786.ece

Municipal Administration and MSME Minister N. Nagaraj (MTB) has joined the ranks of disgruntled Ministers. “Both B.S. Yediyurappa and Basavaraj Bommai have not kept their word to me. I am not happy with the allotted portfolio. I will take a call in this regard in 2-3 days,” he tweeted. Tourism Minister Anand Singh, who had made similar noises on Saturday, met Mr. Bommai with his family in tow on Sunday, when the Chief Minister is learnt to have tried to placate him. Housing Minister V. Somanna, who is said to have expected to be allotted the Revenue Department, is also upset, according to sources. “Such minor dissatisfaction is usual after any Cabinet expansion exercise and we have the ability to sort out these differences. I have spoken to Anand Singh and will do so with MTB Nagaraj as well,” said Mr. Bommai. Meanwhile, several legislators who failed to make it to the Cabinet are disgruntled and some have even met as a separate group, causing concern of fresh dissidence in the party. Ramesh Jarkiholi, a key defector from the Congress, reportedly met former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, who had bowed out of the Cabinet race. Other MLAs such as Raju Gowda, Shivanagouda Nayak, C.P. Yogeshwar, and M.P. Renukacharya are also believed to have met Mr. Jarkiholi. This, even as Preetham Gowda, Satish Reddy, and MLAs from Kodagu have expressed their unhappiness. Mr. Reddy, who told presspersons that it had become difficult to strengthen the party in Bengaluru as only two of the seven Ministers from the city were from the old guard, met the Chief Minister on Sunday. Meanwhile, Mr. Bommai met former Chief Minister B.S.

09 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Prasanna threatens to go on hunger strike||Veteran theatre personality and handloom activist Prasanna has threatened to sit on a hunger strike if another lockdown disrupts the livelihood of the poor in the State. “We are not opposed to scientific restrictions to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. But we are only calling for a more fair, reasoned, and holistic approach to these restrictions,” he said. This comes close on the heels of the government tightening restrictions and reimposing weekend lockdowns in certain districts, amid a fear of a third wave of COVID-19. “The lockdowns imposed by the government have already destroyed the artisans and the poor in Karnataka, even as the State has done little to compensate them. Any restrictions imposed to control the spread of the virus must negotiate concerns over livelihood, especially in the villages. If there is another lockdown without accommodating these concerns, I will sit on a hunger strike,” Mr. Prasanna said. “With due respect to the medical experts, they seem to be taking a sectarian view. They, and by extension the government, don’t seem to understand the village and the poor,” he said, adding that the situation was only exacerbated by over-enthusiastic bureaucracy and panchayats on the ground. Contrary to claims by the government, the MGNREGS has come to a halt in most villages, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prasanna-threatens-to-go-on-hunger-strike/article35806808.ece
09 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Withdraw NEP till it is discussed in detail’||Criticising the National Education Policy-2020, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Sunday urged the government to withdraw the policy till a detailed discussion is held on it. “The implementation of the policy should be withdrawn until a detailed discussion is held. The order to implement the policy without holding discussion shows the dictatorial attitude of the government and [is] an insult to the federal structure of the country,” he said in a note released here on Sunday. Several education experts, seniors, and leaders of Opposition parties had urged the government not to implement the policy in a hurry and had suggested a discussion on its pros and cons, he added. Despite opposition to the policy, the former Chief Minister said, the NEP is sought to be implemented from this year. “The order has several lacunae. It will affect the dreams of poor and middle class families in seeking higher education opportunities,” he said. For example, Mr. Siddaramaiah said, “Earlier, it was said that Kannada would be taught only in two semesters or one year. When opposition came to the proposal, Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan promised to address the problem. However, the order implementing the policy issued on Saturday is not clear about it.” Furthermore, he said the new policy allows online credit/marks systems to an extent of 40%, which will reduce universities to centres of distance education learning. “Instead of concentrating on pedagogy, the new policy reduces universities to shops selling certificates,” the Congress leader said. Mr. Siddaramaiah also expressed feared that the quality of education would suffer as the new policy envisages a reduction in the number of core subjects from three to two. He said the changes being brought into the system could render many lecturers jobless, besides reducing the horizon of learners. The State government, instead of questioning or opposing the new policy, is sacrificing the needs of the education sector, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/withdraw-nep-till-it-is-discussed-in-detail/article35806810.ece

The diamond jubilee is an important milestone for the corporation, but due to the pandemic, the management has decided to make celebrations a low-key affair. Shivyogi C. Kalasad, MD, KSRTC, told The Hindu that 60 drivers from the four road transport corporations will receive the Chief Minister’s Gold Medal for accident-free driving. “Due to restrictions to contain the pandemic, we have no big plans for celebrations. The CM will present the medal to some of the drivers from each corporation at a ceremonial function. Later, each corporation will present the medals to their respective drivers.” Last time, the Chief Minister’s medal was presented in 2016. The official further said that the corporation also has plans to release a commemorative volume narrating the progress of the KSRTC in the last six decades. Usually, the KSRTC inducts new buses on important occasions, but due to the pandemic, the cash-strapped corporation has postponed the plan of procuring new buses to the next financial year. Museum plan Meanwhile, in June, 2019, the Majestic bus stand - the transport hub of the city, completed 50 years of existence. The KSRTC had planned to build a museum on the premises of the bus stand to showcase the development of KSRTC. However, the corporation is still buying time to implement the project on the lines of the Railway Museum. The Majestic bus stand was built on what was once Dharmambudhi lake. In 1969, the bus stand was opened for operations. The journey Under the provision of the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950, on August 1, 1961, the then Mysore Government Road Transport Department (MGRTD) was converted into an independent corporation known as Mysore State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) with a bus fleet size of 1518. In 1973, Mysore state was renamed Karnataka; hence, MSRTC became Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). In 1997-1998, two more corporations - Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) - were carved out of KSRTC. In 2000, one more corporation North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) was formed. In July 2021, the NEKRTC was renamed as Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cms-gold-medal-for-60-accident-free-rtc-drivers/article35806792.ece

09 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Alumni fund groundwater recharging project at NIT-K||In a rare initiative, alumni of National Institute of Technology-Karnataka (NIT-K) in Dakshina Kannada have funded a groundwater recharging project by harvesting roof-top rainwater. The Rs. 20-lakh project, which is in place now on campus of NIT-K at Surathkal, has been financed by the alumni of the 1994 batch. It harvests roof water from 4,270 sq m covering three buildings, the Trishul boys hostel and two commercial complexes housing Canara Bank and the State Bank of India. Rainwater from these roofs has been diverted to an artificial percolation or recharge well constructed nearby. “The well was able to store 12 lakh litres of harvested rainwater this June and July,” Assistant Professor of the Department of Water Resources and Ocean Engineering at the institute Pruthviraj Umesh told The Hindu . The alumni pledged their support to the project during their silver jubilee meet in 2019. The institute has named the project as Trishul Jal Sanchayan. Saplings The recharge well is surrounded by green foliage where 415 saplings of local fruit-bearing varieties have been planted. “This ambience emanates a sense of peace and calmness in the area,” the Assistant Professor and co-ordinator of the project said. The garden or green foliage surrounding the well has seating arrangements where 11 laterite stone benches have been built. They have been named after 11 old students of the 1994 batch who have passed away. “This project is intended to meet the daily water requirement of Trishul hostel accommodating 324 students throughout the year along with the two commercial complexes housing the bank branches. The percolation well is recharging the groundwater table on the campus and nearby areas to reduce the effect of salt water intrusion,” he said. The project, which was formally dedicated two days ago, had taken off a year ago. It is one of the projects taken up by the institute to address its water needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/alumni-fund-groundwater-recharging-project-at-nit-k/article35807131.ece
09 August 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Tulu training resumes for police personnel||After a gap of over five years, the city police resumed training to speak Tulu on Thursday. As many as 50 police constables will undergo the one-month training by the Karnataka Tulu Sahitya Academy. A majority of personnel working in the Mangaluru Police Commissionerate are from North Karnataka and other regions of Karnataka. It was in 2016 that then Police Commissioner M. Chandra Sekhar began training personnel to speak in Tulu and then in Beary, two popularly spoken dialects in the region. Experts from University College conducted the training. The present Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar who resumed the Tulu training said: “The personnel who are undergoing training joined Mangaluru Commissionerate in 2017, 2018 and 2019.” The training will be held in three sessions between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. everyday by experts deputed by the academy, he said. It will be held in phases to cover all the personnel, he added. Of the 50 personnel in training, eight are from Vijayapura district; seven from Haveri district; six from Belagavi district; four each from Chikkamagaluru, Bagalkot and Ballari districts, three from Davangere; two each from Kalaburagi, Koppala, Shivamogga, Hassan and Mysuru; and one each from Yadgir, Uttara Kannada, Kodagu and Gadag districts. In his inaugural address, Mr. Kumar said it is good for personnel to learn a new language. “You might serve for a few years in this region and move out. Knowing a new language in this period is good skill, which will be beneficial to personnel,” he said. Tulu is widely spoken in Dakshina Kannada and speaking in Tulu will help police to develop good rapport with people. Speaking in the native language comes handy in maintaining law and order, Mr. Kumar said, using the example of IPS officers from North India who undergo training to speak in Kannada. Academy chairman Dayanand Kattalsar also spoke. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) B.P. Dinesh Kumar and Assistant Commissioners of Police M.A. Nataraj and P.A.

The badges are embedded with vegetable seeds like brinjal, tomato and leaf vegetable like palak. The badges can be planted in the kitchen garden, pots or on farmlands. “This 75th year of Independence take a pledge to protect the Nature,” says its founder and promoter Nitin Vas, who is also an artist. During the celebrations, the badge can be pinned on any body garment as it has a safety pin behind. But as containment measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including the weekend curfew in eight districts on bordering Kerala and Maharashtra, are in force till August 16, Paper Seed fears that there may not much demand for the badges as there will be no mass celebrations. Hence it has prepared only about 500 badges for now. “Though we are prepared to roll out more, we are not sure of the demand from schools and colleges,” Mr. Vas told The Hindu.  But a few demands on the on-line mode have come from Delhi and Nagpur to where the badges are being dispatched, he said adding that some have placed demand from Mysuru and Bengaluru. In addition, Paper Seed now has also made eco-friendly seed rakhi from areca palm leaf for this year’s Raksha Bandhan. They also contain vegetable seeds. Earlier, it had made eco-friendly paper flags for Independence Day. For last year’s Raksha Bandhan it had made seed rakhi from paper pulp and terracotta. About four months ago, it had made seed masks which grow into plants while thrown. It, made from recycled cotton rags and cotton cloth, contained seeds like tulsi and tomato. Its other latest products included toys made from paper pulp. Mr. Vas named them Mangaluru toys on the lines of Channapatna toys which are made from soft wood. Those toys reflected local culture. It also makes eco-friendly jewellery, earrings, keychains, ladles, cups from coconut shells, driftwood sculptures, baskets from locally available creepers and climbers. Some of the other products include seed pens, bamboo toothbrush, designed papier-mache, seed paper notepad, paper straw, recycled paper cards, newspaper seed pencils, organic agarbatti, and the like.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pin-tri-colour-seed-badges-for-azadi-ka-amrut-mahotsav/article35806980.ece

09 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Railways, INTACH in talks for restoration of Kabini bridge||The Mysuru Division of South Western Railways and the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) will collaborate to conserve the old railway bridge across the Kabini near Nanjangud. An earlier proposal mooted by the authorities to have a restaurant on wheels is also being revived to boost tourism. INTACH Mysuru convener and heritage expert N.S. Rangaraju told The Hindu that multiple rounds of talks have already been completed and the details, including the cost pertaining to its conservation and development, are still being worked out. The heritage committee members, including a few experts comprising structural engineers and architects, along with railway officials recently paid a visit to the Mysuru Rail Museum to apprise themselves of the rail heritage. Dr. Rangaraju said the stakeholders were also toying with the idea of roping in corporates for funding the project. Apart from the bridge, the old metre-gauge rail – which has now been dismantled – will be re-laid and a few coaches will be converted in to a restaurant. A railway coach converted into a cafetaria already exists in the museum and the heritage experts inspected it to check its feasibility. Even the Sujathapuram station will be developed as part of the project. A similar proposal was made more than 10 years ago but the project did not take off. The bridge is located between Tandavpura and Nanjangud town on the Mysuru-Chamarajanagar section. But the authorities are confident of signing an MoU to kickstart the project after finetuning the final details. However an area of concern is the seasonal flooding for a short duration that takes place when the discharge from the Kabini reservoir exceeds 75,000 cusecs during monsoon. In 1991, the bridge was submerged and hence the authorities are wary of such a situation and how the damage if any to the project could be avoided. The bridge across the river Kabini or Kapila is nearly 280 years old and existed even before the advent of the railways. Reckoned to have been constructed in the 1730s, it was the initative of Dalvoy Devaraj, who was a local chieftain, and the metre-gauge link connecting Mysuru to Nanjangud was laid and commissioned in 1899. Built in the Gothic style, the bridge runs parallel to the existing road bridge and the new railway bridge. It measures 225 metres in length and has 56 piers. The bridge was closed and decommissioned for traffic after the last metre-gauge train crossed it on January 17, 2007. In October last year, the railway authorities visited the bridge and announced that it would be developed and conserved as a heritage structure given its historicity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/railways-intach-in-talks-for-restoration-of-kabini-bridge/article35807155.ece
09 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Activists ask govt. to set up task force on SWM and committee for lake protection||Non-government organisations and activists in the city have urged the authorities and the government to constitute a district-level task force on solid waste management as mandated by the law and district lake protection committee to save waterbodies. Activists from the Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP) and Clean Mysuru have also urged the chairman of the State Level Committee to implement SWM Rules to ensure that the task force was constituted to help tackle garbage menace. Activists, including S. Shobana and Venkatesh Kharidi of MGP and Ramesh Kikkeri of Clean Mysuru, drew attention to the worsening garbage crisis in the city and said that it was ironical that Mysuru was ranked the cleanest when the ranking and award were first instituted. But since then, the city has not been able to maintain that rank, said the activists, who pointed out that it was not entirely the fault of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) which had taken steps to keep the city clean. The MCC’s waste collection efforts from houses have seen marked improvements though there is still scope for better performance, they said. But it was pointed out that once the waste is collected from residences or commercial establishments, its treatment to dispose in an environmentally sustainable way needs considerable improvement. While there are some efforts made to convert into compost manure at regional/ward levels (zero waste management facilities) or at city level, there is scope for further improvement, they said. Blaming the public also, the activists said that many residents failed to segregate and many dumped it on footpaths, vacant land etc. Hence the NGOs called for imposing hefty fines to act as a deterrent against littering and dumping garbage in public places. The activists said it has been more than two years since a direction was issued by the authorities to establish a district-level task force to help implement SWM Rules 2016. Drawing attention to the state of lakes and waterbodies in the district, the attention of the district administration was also drawn to encroachment and the imperatives of cracking down on such developments. “There are 2,991 lakes and waterbodies in Mysuru district but over the years we have seen them becoming easy prey to the greed of people with no concern for the society,” according to the MGP and Clean Mysuru. Though a High Court order in 2012 directed that district lake protection committees be constituted, it has not been done so far and hence the urgency of constituting the same was underlined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/activists-ask-govt-to-set-up-task-force-on-swm-and-committee-for-lake-protection/article35807153.ece
09 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||They develop a green project that will take you places||For M.N.V. Shwetha, a final-year student of electrical engineering from Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering (VVCE) in the city, it was a childhood dream to drive her own car. But she went a step further and built one. So too was the case for Saima Zulfa and J. Nanditha, who are all are on the cusp of graduating in electrical engineering this year. The three students from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering took up a project that is in sync with the automobile industry, which is going green and building electric vehicles. Conceived as part of their academic requirement, the students were guided by K. Gopala Reddy, Professor, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Prof. Reddy came up with a battery-operated car as a project and allotted it to his three students. Apart from meeting the academic requirement, it also addressed the issue of reducing air pollution and offsetting the rising cost of fuel. “There were technical issues regarding the appropriate batteries and motors that were resolved and the project materialised,” said Prof. Reddy. The students spent about seven months and built the car using a 12v, 32 amp lead acid battery and a 1 KW motor. The car has a mileage of around 70 km on a full charge and consumes only a unit of electricity for it, according to Ms. Nandita. The initiative was led by Ms. Zulfa, whose father is also an electrical engineer and motivated her to pursue electrical engineering. She has completed many projects, such as devising a fire alarm, sensors-related home automation and appliances, and is set to join Capgemini. “We plan to make it more efficient and intend to tap solar power and refine the design,” said Ms. Shwetha, who intends to become a start-up entrepreneur. The vehicle, which costs around Rs. 60,000 to build, can carry a load of 138 kg and was tested along the Outer Ring Road, said Prof. Reddy. It is virtually noiseless, eco-friendly with zero emission, has a leg brake, and easy to drive on narrow roads, he added. Praising the students, B.

09 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Non-essential shops remain closed in Mysuru during weekend curfew||Most shops and commercial establishments, which fall under the non-essential category, remained closed in Mysuru on Sunday, the second-day of the weekend curfew. Thin traffic plied on the roads in the CBD comprising Sayyaji Rao Road, D. Devaraj Urs Road, Ashok Road and Irwin Road as most shops and establishments remained closed. However, shops selling essential items like daily provisions, vegetables, fruits and milk, besides drug stores remained open. The weekend curfew imposed in Mysuru along with seven other districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra began at 9 p.m. on Friday and is scheduled to end at 5 a.m. on Monday. The decision to impose weekend curfew in Mysuru had evoked an angry response from various trade and business organisations, who claimed that the lockdown would seriously affect their and their employees sources of livelihood. The trade and business organisations, which had formed a federation, to oppose the lockdown, had earlier decided to violate the curfew on Sunday, but with withdrew their threat and kept their shops closed. The decision to withdraw their threat to violate the lockdown came after Minister for Co-Operation promised to appeal to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to relax the restrictions in Mysuru as the COVID-19 situation was under control in the district. While 98 COVID-19 positive cases were reported in Mysuru on Sunday, the State COVID-19 War Room report dated August 6 said the seven-day average Test Positivity Rate (TPR) in Mysuru was 1.46% against the State’s 1.18%. Even after lockdown was lifted more than a month ago on July 5, the number of cases continued to decline gradually. Also, there has been a week-on-week decline in the number of cases in Mysuru, according to the COVID-19 State War Room report dated August 6. While 785 cases were reported during the week ending August 6, the previous week saw 864 cases. This was preceded by 966 and 1,236 respectively during the earlier weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/non-essential-shops-remain-closed-in-mysuru-during-weekend-curfew/article35807157.ece

The petition - launched by Naveen Madappa and Vinay Kaypanda has garnered over 6,000 signatures so far and argues that the park was originally known as Nagarahole and was renamed after Rajiv Gandhi ‘to please a particular family and its party’. It has called for either reverting to its original name or rename it after Field Marshal Cariappa who was also from Kodagu. The petitioners say Indian citizens need to be recognized and not just a few politicians. The petition has also been addressed to the Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Myuru MP Pratap Simha and the PMO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/online-petition-to-rename-park/article35806983.ece

Nagesh has said. He was talking to media after visiting flood-prone Wadagera and Surpur taluks on Sunday. Mr. Nagesh, who was reviewing the COVID-19 and floods situation in the district, said: “The State government has a responsibility in carrying out a scientific study on crop loss owing to floods every year, after water is discharged from the Basavasagar Reservoir at Narayanpur. Thus, it is thinking of conducting a scientific study to release compensation for crop loss.” The Minister spoke to farmers whose crops were destroyed due to floods in Anakasugur and Ikur villages. He collected information from individual farmers and asked officers of the Agriculture and other departments to take further steps to provide affected farmers compensation. Mr. Nagesh then visited the community health centre in Wadagera, the primary health centre in Hayyal (B) and Kodekal and the taluk hospitals in Surpur and Hunsagi and inspected infrastructure, including oxygen units.

Nagesh, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education, has asked the district administration and the Health Department to be ready to tackle a possible third wave of COVID-19. He chaired a meeting in Yadgir on Saturday. The Minister, who was informed about the situation by District Health Officer Indumathi K.

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||During both the occasions of the BJP government forming a Cabinet in the present term of the Assembly — the first under B.S. Yediyurappa and the second under Basavaraj Bommai — the name of four-time party MLA S.A. Ramdas(in picture), who represents Krishnaraja constituency in Mysuru, made the rounds. But both times, it was missing on the official list. Mr. Ramdas, who had served as Minister for Medical Education during Mr. Yediyurappa’s earlier tenure, was among the strong aspirants for a ministerial berth, which has been denied to Mysuru district under the BJP dispensation. Despite being a man from the RSS stables who is unlikely to rebel against the party, Mr. Ramdas, went as far as putting out a sarcastic tweet this time around, indirectly expressing disappointment over the inclusion of new entrants to the party into the Cabinet. His contention was that his name went missing from the list even after senior leaders such as Mr. Yediyurappa had informed him of clearing his name for a berth. He said that he had even received congratulatory messages from party leaders and religious heads a day before Mr. Bommai’s Council of Ministers was sworn in. But these claims rang a bell. For, Mr. Ramdas had put forward a similar line of argument when he was not included in the Yediyurappa Cabinet constituted in August 2019. This time around, Mr. Ramdas even claimed that a phone call to the central BJP leadership at the eleventh hour prevented him from eventually making it to the Bommai Ministry. Only Mr. Ramdas can uncover this faceless nemesis.   Former Women and Child Welfare Minister Shashikala Jolle(in picture)joined the Basavaraj Bommai-led Ministry after a period of uncertainty, following allegations of bribery over the supply of eggs to anganwadis. She has now been allotted Muzrai, Haj and Wakf, which is considered a lighter portfolio. She has said she has no problems accepting the respon- sibilities, though insiders say she was positively miffed. During a conversation with reporters in Vijayapura, the Minister said she was not complaining about the so-called lower significance of the portfolio. She also said she did not think the party had “demoted” her. Her argument was that the portfolio was deemed light considering that two men had been given the responsibility prior to her. Though the logic behind such an argument is hard to grasp, she is perhaps not in a position to make her displeasure known publicly.   Of the 29 legislators took oath as Ministers last week, MLA for Aurad Prabhu Chavan’s oath-taking stood out. He came to the ceremony dressed in a traditional Lambani community outfit and was the delight of every photographer and videographer. He also generously gave sound bites to TV channels on all types of questions. While most Ministers took oath in the name of “God”, Mr. Chavan took oath in the name of “ gau mata ”. Under the B.S. Yediyurappa government, as Minister for Animal Husbandry, he had tabled the anti-cow slaughter Bill in the legislature and offered pooja to “ gau mata ” outside the Secretariat. It seems the “ gau mata ” has blessed him, as Mr. Chavan has again bagged the same portfolio.  Laiqh A.

Vijayaraghavan, cardiologist and founder-director of KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram has said. He was inaugurating a webinar series titled ‘New Normal and Health’ organised by the Postgraduate Department of Zoology and Research Centre, Sanatana Dharma College, Alappuzha, in connection with its platinum jubilee celebrations. Doubled in a century “Our longevity during the 1900s was merely 35 years. By the year 2000, it had doubled to about 70 years. This was mainly achieved due to improved health care, including universal vaccination/immunisation, food, and nutritional security. The challenge before the governments of the future will be to cater to the unique needs of the ageing population,” Dr. Vijayaraghavan was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the college authorities here on Saturday. Lifestyle clinics He said the future hospitals would be “lifestyle modification clinics” and the treatment strategies include organ replacement by stem cell therapy, anti-glycosylation therapy, gene therapy, and robotic surgery among others. “The future diets will include synthetic oils and plant sterols and stanols. Diabetes and similar lifestyle diseases will be a major threat facing humanity,” Dr. Vijayaraghavan stated.

09 August 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Lockdown stress killing children?||Has lockdown-induced stress sparked an increase in suicide cases among children in the hilly district? As per official data, five children took their lives in Idukki last month. Within a period of one year, 25 child suicide cases were reported in the district. Some of the cases included that of a 14-year-old boy at Kalyanathandu who gave up his life on June 30 after his parents scolded him for overuse of mobile for games. Another was of a Class 10 girl student who was found hanging at Murickassery on July 4. A 11-year-old girl was also found hanging at Manakkad on July 19. A Class 9 girl student took the extreme step at Kunthalampara, near Kattappana, on July 22. The latest one was at Chakkupallom where a 12-year-old boy committed suicide in the bathroom of his house. Except one, all other suicide incidence last month were in the High Range where one house is away from another. The arrangement of houses adds to the isolation that is said to be one of the trigger. Mental stress, family issues, overuse of mobile and internet, and depression are also said to be sparking suicidal tendencies among the children. With schools closed and personal relation with peer groups and teachers hindered, children have grown addicted to mobile phones further accentuating the isolation and subsequent mental distress they face. Nadasha M., psychologist under Our Responsibility to Children (ORS) project in the district, says mobile addiction has taken chronic dimensions. As a resource person giving tele counselling to children, she claims out of the calls she received from children, 90% were related to disorders due to chronic internet addiction. e-learning Though mobiles were given to children as part of e-learning, the misuse and overuse are increasing, she says. There are 68 schools having counsellors in the district and majority of them highlighted the issue of mobile phone addiction among the students. “Unlike in other districts, the low-income earners did not give much care to children and when the mobile addiction became chronic, they approached us. When the symptoms are chronic, it will be difficult to bring them back. We advise parents to give more care to the activities of the children,” she says. Addiction to mobile phone games should be nipped at the bud else it would become chronic resulting in sleeplessness, poor food intake, emotional and angry reactions, or lack of interest on school lessons. There are various agencies working under the government in different projects for counselling children. Such counselling work is imperative now with schools remaining closed. “Most kids, when they have a problem, they share it first with their friends at school or teachers. They do not often share it with parents out of fear and schools act as an umbrella of protection,” Laksmi P.C., a police official for counselling children under Chiri helpline, says. Ms. Laksmi also says with parents away at work and the kids alone at home, the chances of sexual abuse of the children have increased. The long period of isolation should be addressed by parents giving more care to children, she says.

The Minister lauded health officials, people’s representatives, and NGOs for accomplishing the target. The Health Department had organised various programmes, including March Mission, Mop up April, and Gothra Raksha May, to achieve the target, Ms. George said, adding that the first dose for those in the plantation sector was given with the support of the Labour Department. The Minister said 13 teams had been constituted for the drive, which was held in accordance with a plan chalked out by each civic body. The mission became possible with the cooperation of the district administration, Tribal Development Department, District Kudumbashree Mission, and ASHA workers.

The scheme aims to give vaccines as bonus to local bodies that conduct the maximum number of RT-PCR tests. The Collector said an additional 750 doses would be given to the panchayat and municipality that conduct the highest number of tests in a week. The decision on the scheme was taken at a meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority. The rate of testing will be assessed every week, on the basis of which bonus doses will be made available to the best performers, in addition to the population-based vaccine quota. The Collector said RT-PCR test was being promoted to stop the spread of infection. Delaying the test until symptoms appear or not conducting it in the absence of symptoms can lead to a spread of the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-bonus-scheme-to-encourage-testing/article35807039.ece

09 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||CJM to take up House ruckus case today||State General Education Minister V. Sivankutty and others will find their discharge petition in the Assembly ruckus case strongly opposed by the prosecution when the court considers the case on Monday. The politically sensitive case will come up before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, as the Supreme Court had earlier rejected the State government’s plea to withdraw the prosecution in the case. The prosecution will strongly oppose the withdrawal petition as there are enough grounds and materials on record for objecting to the petition. For a petition to be withdrawn, there should be valid grounds, which are absent in the present case, prosecution sources pointed out. Six in all Left Democratic Front (LDF) leaders, including Mr. Sivankutty, K.T. Jaleel, MLA, and four others have been charged with offences under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act besides various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The pecuniary loss the State sustained in the unruly events that unfolded on the floor of the Assembly on March 13, 2015, was estimated to be around Rs. 2.20 lakh. The LDF legislators, who were in the Opposition then, occupied the dais of the Speaker and damaged the properties on the dais in an attempt to prevent the then Finance Minister K.M. Mani from presenting the annual Budget. In a warrant case, discharge can be considered only when the charge framed in the case was a groundless one. Here, there are enough grounds for sustaining the charge. Moreover, there should also be some material discrepancy or patent illegality on the grounds in which the case was booked or the charge should lack the necessary ingredients to attract the provisions of law. There is a solid case against the accused and hence the plea of withdrawal of petition cannot be considered, prosecution sources pointed out. K. Balachandra Menon, Deputy Director of Prosecution (Thiruvananthapuram), is expected to be appear for the prosecution to oppose the petition of the Minister and others as the Director General of Prosecution had issued an order asking Mr. Menon to appear in court. Not to seek extension The prosecution will not seek extension of time and is ready to contest the case straight away, sources said. The United Democratic Front had been campaigning for the resignation of the Minister since the apex court rejected the State’s plea to withdraw the prosecution in the case.

09 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||DPR for North-South green corridor by November||The detailed project report (DPR) for the 2.5-km European Union (EU)-aided ‘green corridor’ proposed between Ernakulam Town (North) and Ernakulam Junction (South) railway stations is expected to be readied by November. The much-awaited corridor has been envisaged under a 1-million Euro grant from the EU under Mobilise Your City (MYC) programme, to decongest M.G. Road and Banerjee Road by providing direct connectivity between the two railway stations. It will thus lessen the distance between the two stations by almost half. In addition, it will have links with the KSRTC bus station (which will be relocated to Karikkamuri in a couple of years) and four metro stations on the route, helping bus and metro commuters as well. The project is expected to pick up pace in the coming months, a year since its French project consultant readied a feasibility report in July 2020. Mayor M. Anilkumar said the stretch would shortly be inspected by a team of officials of the Kochi Corporation, Railways, and other stakeholders, in order to take the project ahead. Apart from building a safe and modern corridor for pedestrians, bicyclists, and two-wheelers, the green corridor will have e-rickshaws and e-autorickshaws. The stretch will largely run parallel to the railway track linking the two stations, thus also helping railway personnel commute between the stations. The ill-lit stretch has often been in the news for being a haven for anti-social elements. This will change once the corridor is ready, official sources said. The corridor has been envisaged with a uniform width of 12 metres and will run approximately 2.5 metres away from the railway land. There will also be a utility corridor (duct). Two options have been conceptualised in the design readied by a team of postgraduate students of Government Engineering College, Thrissur, and TKM College of Engineering, Kollam. Under option-1, the carriageway will be confined to a 3.50-metre dedicated space for electric vehicles with restricted two-way movement and designated cycle lanes and footpath, each of 3-metre and 2.50-metre width respectively. Under option-2, the carriageway having a width of 5.50 metres will enable the operation of electric vehicles in both directions, with 3.7-metre width each for cyclists and pedestrians. Both the options will have a utility corridor 1.20-metre and 1-metre width respectively, they added. Bollards have been envisaged at regular intervals to ensure safety of pedestrians. Steps will also be taken to prevent direct connectivity to the corridor from side roads. This will ensure that the corridor will be strictly used for non-motorised transport (NMT) and e-vehicles, thus safeguarding the design principle of promoting green mobility. The 2.5-km corridor will shortly be surveyed to assess the ownership of land that will have to be acquired. The expense of the project has been tentatively pegged at Rs. 16 crore, since almost all landowners are willing to surrender land in their backyard for the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dpr-for-north-south-green-corridor-by-november/article35807054.ece
09 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Pokkali rice cultivation at Chellanam comes alive again||The pokkali rice fields at Maruvakkad in Chellanam came alive again on Saturday, with farmers sowing the fields even as the delay in commencing farming is likely to affect the crop cycle. Sprouted seeds are sown following the first rain in June after salt water is drained from the fields. Father Prashant Palakkappally, a Catholic priest and former principal of Sacred Heart College, Thevara, who launched sowing in the fields of Chandu Manjadiparambil, a farmer from Maruvakkad, said farmers provided sustenance to society and were invaluable. The normal pokkali cycle starts in the middle of April and lasts till November. However, the delay in draining the fields this year has resulted in farmers holding up sowing. Francis Kalathungal, an activist who works for the protection of pokkali rice tradition under the aegis of Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti, said the shrimp cultivation lobby had been attempting to sabotage rice cultivation, and that it was through court intervention that the ground was cleared for rice cultivation. Pokkali rice plants take 120 days from sowing to be harvested. It takes around 90 days for flowering and another 30 days before the crop is ready to be harvested. Now, farmers are worried that the crop cycle could be upset by the withdrawal of the monsoon ahead of the flowering season, said Mr. Kalanthungal. He added that the salinity level of water was critical to the production of pokkali rice. Water quality with sustainable salinity of up to 8 to 12 parts per million (ppm) was tolerable, while the ideal condition is 6 ppm. The total extent of fields at Chellanam is 1,300 hectares, but only 10 acres have been brought under cultivation, said Mr. Kalathungal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pokkali-rice-cultivation-at-chellanam-comes-alive-again/article35807061.ece

The joint inspection team comprising Mohammed Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs; Anoop Krishnan, Foreigners’ Regional Registration Officer, and Sunit Sarma, Senior Commandant, Aviation Security Group (CISF) visited Terminal -2 and inspected the renovation plans of Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), said a communication here. The inspection team instructed CIAL to prepare a report to be submitted to the higher authorities for obtaining formal approval. CIAL managing director S. Suhas said the joint inspection by the regulatory authorities had instilled confidence in the project team, and the renovation work could be started by September 2021. “The chairman and the board of directors have earmarked the T2 conversion project for high priority. This is the part of CIAL’s plan to activate several revenue streams and improve passenger experience and ensure sustainability in income flow, he said. Three blocks Terminal-2, having a built-up area of one lakh square feet, was previously used for domestic operations and was then earmarked for future expansion. CIAL’s T2 conversion plan envisages a cost-effective renovation of its interiors into three blocks. Thirty per cent of the built-up area will be used for block one, which will be converted into an exclusive business jet terminal with three lounges. The terminal will cater for both international and domestic business jets. Exclusive areas for customs, immigration, and security holding operations will be allotted. Block-2 will have an area of 10,000 sq.ft and is earmarked to house a VVIP safe house. The concept will ensure hassle-free movement of passengers during VVIP movement. Block-3 will have an area of 60,000 sq.ft. CIAL is planning to build 50 budget rooms for passengers who intend to stay at the airport for short periods. It is planned to apply the dynamic tariff concept, wherein the rent will be calculated on hour-based scale.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/formal-checks-put-cial-t2-project-on-fast-track/article35807060.ece
09 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Falling vitamin D level in children worrying||With little to no outdoor activities depriving their exposure to sunlight, deficiency of vitamin D has become rampant among children leading to musculoskeletal disorders. While vitamin D level in excess of 50 nanograms per millilitre (ng/ml) is considered sufficient, between 30 and 50ng/ml is insufficient and below 30ng/ml is considered low. Locked up inside their homes for more than a year, it is found plummeting to alarming level of 10ng/ml or below in children. “While the deficiency is age-neutral, it’s particularly worse in children causing muscle and joint pain and brittleness of bones. Exposure to sunlight for about 30 minutes a day is the simplest solution,” said Manoj G. Panicker, head of the general medicine department at Ernakulam General Hospital. Since the deficiency of vitamin D is devoid of tell-tale symptoms and is unreflected in vital parameters, it often goes undetected or is diagnosed quite accidentally while consulting doctor for completely unrelated problems. K.G. Saju, consultant ENT Surgeon at General Hospital, recollected how two young children whom he prescribed for vitamin deficiency test on a hunch returned an alarmingly low level of below 10ng/ml. Physical well-being Vitamin deficiency apart, there is an overall downturn in the physical well-being of children owing to the extended indoor life. For instance, the frequent use of earphones during online classes is taking its toll on the children’s hearing. “High frequency hearing loss caused by physiological aging of ears usually associated with those aged 70 or above is now setting in at a disturbingly young age. The reason being that earphones expose ears to only a particular frequency of sound while cancelling out the rest unlike in normal life when the cochlear is exposed to a mix of sounds. The real impact on hearing will be felt another five or six years,” said Dr. Saju. The use of unfit earphones could lead to the inflammation of the external auditory canal, a very painful phenomenon. Excessive stress to eyes is also being widely reported owing to glaring at screens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/falling-vitamin-d-level-in-children-worrying/article35807059.ece
09 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kochi to host memorial for Sankara Kurup||An eco-friendly memorial for poet G. Sankara Kurup will soon come up in Kochi. The State-level steering committee for Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) projects gave the go-ahead for the proposal last week. The poet was the first recipient of the Njanapith Award in 1965. Though the memorial had found place in the agenda of the previous civic administrations, it got entangled in a host of issues. Eventually, the Kochi Corporation identified a 25-cent holding next to Mangalavanam. It took a series of negotiations to obtain a passage to the holding. The Greater Cochin Development Authority, Kerala State Housing Board, and the Kochi Corporation joined hands to develop a road to the parcel of land, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. Though the Corporation council lead by Tony Chammany in 2010, which had B. Bhadra, the granddaughter of the poet, as Deputy Mayor, made efforts for setting up the project, it did not materialise. Initially, the suggestion was to have a one-acre holding for the project. Later, it was trimmed to 25 cents. The efforts of then council to set up the memorial did not succeed owing to a host of reasons, Ms. Bhadra said, adding that the memorial should be one that should reflect the thoughts and literary contributions of the poet. Minimal construction According to the project proposal, an eco-friendly memorial will come up. Construction work will be kept to the minimum possible level. There will be an open stage, an art gallery, a sound museum where the poems of Sankara Kurup could be listened to, a history garden with vertical plaques carrying his story, and a tranquillity space with a replica of a flute hung by steel wires representing his famous poem Odakuzhal , according to the concept note. The total built-up area will be restricted to one-third of the holding, leaving space for greenery. The firm that prepared the concept note has been asked to come up with a detailed project report. The project is estimated to cost Rs. 3 crore. The civic body has earmarked funds from its Plan fund. Resources from the AMRUT project will also be utilised.  There will be an open stage, an art gallery, a sound museum, a history garden and a tranquillity space with a replica of a flute representing his famous poem Odakuzhal .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-green-memorial-for-g-sankara-kurup/article35807057.ece

Industry sources said that discussions were held with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), which will support the programme. Sources said bulk of the products that now pass for handloom products are churned out in powerlooms. The proposed online platform, expected to be up and running by Onam, will help customers realise the quality of original handloom products. The online platform will be launched on a pilot basis for handloom cooperatives in Ernakulam. Meanwhile, after Onam and Vishu season sales having been wrecked by the COVID-19 pandemic, handloom weavers in Ernakulam, especially in Chendamangalam, are pinning their hopes on upcoming festivities. Around 65% of sales in a year take place during the Onam season, said T.S. Baby of the handloom cooperative at Chendamangalam, and the upcoming season offers hope that pending stocks can be sold off by cooperatives. He said the cooperatives, 13 of them in Paravur taluk, had stocks worth around Rs. 6 crore. If the stocks could be sold off during the season, it would be a great relief for nearly 500 weavers as well as around 200 people, who are indirectly employed in the weaving industry. The stocks mostly comprise dhotis, saris, and shirt pieces, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/handloom-cooperatives-to-get-e-commerce-portal/article35807050.ece

Functionaries of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti and the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Samiti say conditions forcing customers to carry vaccination certificates or test results to enter shops will backfire and affect business. “Traders are banking on the Onam season to compensate for the loss they faced in the past two years. Imposing new regulations in the name of safety will not help them tide over the crisis,” says Mujeeb Rahman, a member of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti. He points out that many of the traders are leading a miserable life as they do not have any free treatment plan, educational support for children and any other source of income. Samiti leaders say a State-level study by the government about the plight of traders following the pandemic will throw light on their crisis. Unnatural deaths because of financial crisis are on the rise, they lament. “Within a week, two traders in Kozhikode district alone were found dead. They had told their relatives about the poor financial condition,” said T. Joseph, a grocery shop owner near Kuttiyadi. He said there should be some relief measures from the government for traders by waiving off tax or other such mandatory payments. Wayside ventures The increasing number of wayside ventures is also projected as a challenge by many of the licensed traders in the district. According to them, the police, who never act tough on wayside traders, are mercilessly targeting licensed merchants. Those who react to police action out of their anger are now being trapped with criminal cases, they allege.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-call-for-compassionate-approach-by-state-government/article35807047.ece

Police sources said that priests had been given instructions not to hold rituals on the beach, but several people had assembled there in the early hours of the day to perform rituals. The police then intervened and registered cases. Meanwhile, thousands performed the rituals at their homes across the district on Sunday. “I have been performing the rituals at popular spots for a long time.

The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), Kozhikode, recently offered them training to sail through the crisis. According to K.M. Sofia, lecturer, DIET, around 100 visually-impaired teachers are working in various lower primary and high schools in the district. The extent of visual disability is up to 80% in most of them. “A survey conducted by us revealed that they were not being trained properly in teaching keeping in mind their conditions. Self-confidence was found to be lacking. They have a problem being visible among others. Some of them have a feeling that they are a burden for the schools,” she said. Ms. Sofia said, quoting the survey, that though computers were convenient for them, a majority of these teachers were using mobile phones for their academic work. “Their understanding of computer-assisted learning and teaching was found to be inadequate. These teachers were finding it difficult to interact with students through the online medium. They were not able to collect information related to their work and make documents,” she said. DIET recently held a training session to help them deal with their problems. Titled ‘Ulloli’, the training was conceived in such a way that visually-impaired teachers themselves trained others facing similar disabilities. DIET sources said though Kerala was taking significant steps in the educational sector to help differently-abled people, those with visual impairment too should be given equal importance. The education system should change to suit their needs. Some experts who addressed the participants said other teachers should take up the responsibility to bring them forward to the mainstream of the educational sector. Ms. Sofia said a collective of visually-impaired teachers should be formed to strengthen their academic work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ulloli-sheds-light-into-lives-of-visually-impaired-teachers/article35807036.ece

Tribal leaders alleged that the police attacked them. However, the police denied the allegation. The tribespeople staged a protest in front of the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) office at Agali. The police said they would investigate the matter and initiate action if any officer was found guilty. Report sought The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights filed a case and sought a report from the District Police Chief. The issue started when the police reached the hamlet to arrest V.S. Murugan and his father Choriya Moopan in connection with a complaint filed by Karunthachalam. Karunthachalam had reportedly been attacked by the father-son duo while grazing his cattle on Murugan’s land a few days ago. Trouble began as Murugan and Choriya Moopan refused to board the police jeep and the police tried to arrest them by force. Hospitalised Tribespeople accused the police of beating up a 17-year-old boy, Rajeev.

Twenty-three students of the Malampandaram tribe in the Sabarimala forests have been dependent on this school bus service to attend their daily classes. The service, operated by Government Tribal LP School, Attathodu, transports the children to an anganwadi here, which serves as a study centre. According to S.S. Sudheer, Tribal Development Officer, Pathanamthitta, the service is for students from the Palappally-Chalakkayam stretch, who have struggled to access the virtual classes. Govt. meets expenses “Because of their location deep inside the forests and their nomadic nature, most of these families do not have power supply. For now, offering daily transportation is the only option,” he said. The cost of running the bus, including the driver’s wages, is borne by the Tribal Welfare Department. The school bus pick ups students from Plappally at 8.45 a.m. After dropping them at the study centre, the bus then leaves for Chalakkayam to transport the remaining children. A walk through forest At the study centre, the students, from Class II to Class VII, attend virtual classes through the KITE Victers channel from 10 a.m. They are assisted by teachers too. “The return trip starts by 12.45 p.m. as some students have to walk about 1.5 kilometres through the forests to reach home,” said Manoj Philip, former headmaster of the school. Vinod C.K., the school bus driver, said the service covered 100 kilometres a day, including the return trip. “The service was cancelled two weeks ago following a spurt in COVID-19 cases at Chalakkayam. It will resume next week,” he said. The Ranni-Perunad panchayat, which provides power supply and Internet connection at the study centre, has set aside funds for providing breakfast and lunch to the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/schools-are-shut-but-a-school-bus-is-still-in-service/article35807080.ece
09 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||No hope in sight for EICL workers||When the workers of English Indian Clays Ltd (EICL) in Veli walked out of the company on August 9 last year, they did not have a clue about the temporary lockout notice that would welcome them the next day. But the word ‘temporarily’ in that notice had given them hope. Now, one year later, the meaning of that word has been redefined as there are no signs of the Veli unit reopening yet, even as the Thonnackal unit has started functioning. Several meetings Over this period, several meetings have happened between the company management, employees' unions, labour commission officials and Ministers. Yet, things have remained at a stalemate, even as the around 1,500 employees, including allied workers, are pushed into distress. Early in January, Prafullakumar, one of the employees who have been active in the protests here, was found hanging in the company premises, pointing at the levels of desperation. Quite a few have been forced to take up other odd jobs, while the majority who haven’t have unpaid house loans, insurance policies, rents and fees. The Thapar Group of Companies took over ownership of the company in the early 1990s. Till then it was a joint venture between a local entrepreneur with UK-based English China Clays Ltd. The clay deposits in the region with high kaolinite content made the processed clay from here a sought-after material for a variety of companies, including paint, paper, ink and even eye-liner manufacturing companies. The management has pointed at the lack of demand from their clients for not reopening the Veli plant, while the unions question this claim. Questions claims “The management makes such claims even as operations continue in the Thonnackal plant. They have been trying to forcibly make the remaining staff at Veli to resign. Some of them put in their papers, due to various methods used by the management. Six were sent to their plant in Gujarat, out of which two resigned, due to the 12 hours working time there. The company has been running in high profits even at the time of closure. Nothing goes waste here, as even the clay remaining after processing, which is supposed to be used for filling up the mined trenches, are being sold outside,” says K. Udayakumar, District Clay Workers' Union (CITU). A High Court order in 2018, prohibited the company from clay mining at Melthonnackal and Veyiloor villages, creating a shortage of raw materials. But it later managed to restart operations using alternate mining locations in Thonnackal. Not honoured “Though Ministers have participated in meetings, the company has not honoured any of the promises. They had promised Rs. 25,000 interim payment for employees, but only half of this has been paid by them. This too is being given like a loan, which will be deducted from us on retirement. The government should take over the company and run it like the Kerala Ceramics Limited in Kundara,” says Radhakrishnan, INTUC leader and member of the joint protest committee. A management official told The Hindu that there are no plans currently for re-opening the unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-hope-in-sight-for-eicl-workers/article35807236.ece
09 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSRTC holds trial run for city circular service||Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) conducted its first trial run for the proposed circular bus service in the capital city on Sunday. The endeavour that was primarily meant to adjust service timings to overcome possible hurdles such as traffic snarls along designated routes was largely successful. Ninety low-floor non-air conditioned (AC) buses were plied during a two-hour-long period as part of the timing rehearsal that got under way at 2 p.m. While 54 buses commenced from East Fort, the rest began trips from Peroorkada. Most services reached their destinations within the allotted time. As many as 180 bus crew members and 85 other employees, including 35 inspectors, were involved in the rehearsal conducted on the total lockdown day. Transport Minister Antony Raju, who oversaw the trial run along with KSRTC chairman and managing director Biju Prabhakar from the Central Bus Terminal in Thampanoor, said the rehearsal will continue for two more lockdown days after making certain changes in the planned routes. The service will be rolled out after a final trial run that will be held during peak traffic on a working day. The city circular bus service, which will link government offices, hospitals, shopping centres and other major institutions, is primarily meant to provide commuters with more options rather than being forced to reach Thampanoor or East Fort where the services currently originate from. In the initial phase, the service will be conducted along seven circles, each being designated separate colours – red, blue, brown, yellow, violet, magenta and orange. While buses will be plied both clockwise and anti-clockwise along each circular route, at least five buses will conduct trips in the same direction at a given point of time. They will originate and conclude at the same location. The public-utility hoped to ensure buses reached each bus stop every 10 minutes. With a minimum charge of Rs. 10, the ticket rates will be fixed as Rs. 10, Rs. 15, Rs. 20, Rs. 25 and Rs. 30. Passengers will be able to travel all day long with one-day tickets, named Good Day, that are priced at Rs. 50.

The government had earlier directed that bali be offered at homes. Not allowed The police had clarified that balitharpanam would not be allowed in public places. Temples under the Travancore Devaswom Board too did not allow the rituals. The traditional venues for offering the bali – beaches and banks of rivers such as Shanghumughom, Varkala, Thiruvallam, Aruvippuram, Thrivikramangalam and so on - on vavu (no moon) day were off-limits. Instead, priests and residents’ associations facilitated the conduct of the rituals in homes or in small groups. The Federation of Residents’ Associations Trivandrum (FRAT) directed its members on how to go about the rituals and the requirements for it as per the directions of Kariyam Rajan, priest and Thottappattu singer. FRAT president M.S. Venugopal said he too offered bali at his home as per the guidance received and found it more rewarding owing to the peaceful atmosphere that allowed complete focus. This was also the message communicated to residents’ associations – remembering the departed wholeheartedly, with the ritual aspect only coming next. Mr. Rajan who has been overseeing the balitharpanam rituals for nearly half a decade at Shanghumughom said he had visited quite a few homes since early Sunday morning in the Kariyam area. Small groups “People who used to come to Shanghumughom to offer bali asked me to come and oversee the rituals at their homes.” He also helped a few residents’ associations organise the rituals for small groups in adherence to COVID-19 protocols. Many people, he said, had also contacted him to understand the various prayers and other details needed to offer bali at home on their own. Sreena Sreekumar, youth convener of the Vanchiyoor residents’ association, said they had provided Bali kits comprising bali flowers, rice, ghee, sesame, darbha grass, sandalwood, banana, and so on to families who had evinced interest. Along with her father, she visited many homes to guide people on the rituals and prayers and how to offer bali for the salvation of their ancestors. Many people also turned to social media such as YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp for detailed videos on the rituals, their requirements, and prayers and their meanings. These online tutorials, brought out by priests and temples, proved very handy and informative in conduct of the rituals. The essentials required for the bali rituals were available in handy kits priced around Rs. 130 in the market. Santhosh Kumar who runs a shop at Karamana said he had sold nearly 300 Bali kits comprising flowers, banana, honey, sesame, ghee, rice, darbha grass, sandalwood, pavithrakettu (a ring made of drabha grass) on Saturday. Poojas online Poojas in connection with the rituals were held in temples. The devout could pay for the poojas online. YouTube channels of temples, including that of Sivagiri Math, also guided the public on the rituals and prayers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hundreds-offer-karkadaka-vavubali/article35807227.ece

09 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Sudhakaran’s poem generates a buzz||A recent poem penned by G. Sudhakaran, former PWD Minister and Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] veteran from Alappuzha, became a political talking point seemingly out of the blue on Sunday. Mr. Sudhakaran is purportedly the target of a CPI(M) State committee inquiry for allegedly remaining aloof from the party’s 2021 Assembly election campaign in the Ambalappuzha constituency. He reportedly stayed away from a crucial meeting of the CPI(M) leadership at the AKG Centre last month, triggering media speculation that Mr. Sudhakaran’s relationship with the party had soured. Interpretations Not surprisingly, Mr. Sudhakaran’s latest poem ‘Nettavum Kottavum’ (Gains and Losses), raised several eyebrows in social media and political circles. By one account, the poet signals that he felt unappreciated. His long years seemed futile in hindsight. The poet also wishes his successors well and hints at a parting. Mr. Sudhakaran has denied the poem is autobiographical or political. Readers had interpreted the poem as they understood it individually. ‘Veiled criticism’ However, some quarters viewed the verse as a veiled criticism of Mr. Sudhakaran’s party compatriots in Alappuzha. The CPI(M) district committee had reportedly accused Mr. Sudhakaran of deliberately staying off the election campaign in Alappuzha to spite his successor H. Salam. It allegedly felt Mr. Sudhakaran had done little to counter the propaganda that Muslim fundamentalists backed Mr. Salam. Nevertheless, Mr. Salam won the Ambalappuzha seat, widely reckoned as Mr. Sudhakaran’s home turf. The CPI(M) had reportedly denied Mr. Sudhakaran an Assembly seat in adherence to a State committee decision. It had mandated that workers who have contested in more than two elections consecutively should focus on organisational responsibilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sudhakarans-poem-generates-a-buzz/article35807072.ece

On Sunday, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies G.R. Anil visited Karthika Food Products in Kottukal panchayat that manufactures banana chips and sarkara varatti (jaggery-coated chips) for the Onam kits.

Developed through sustained research at the CTCRI’s experimental farms, the technologies have been validated in the fields of about 60 farmers across the country. Apart from helping farmers produce safe, organic tuber crops, they are designed to ensure waste recycling, soil and water quality and encourage climate resilient farming, CTCRI scientists said. Elephant foot yam, the most ideal tuber crop for organic farming, has given a 20 per cent higher yield besides reducing calcium oxalate by 20 per cent, the chemical which causes itching. The most popular variety of elephant foot yam, Gajendra, has also been found best-suited to organic farming, CTCRI Principal Scientist Dr. G. Suja who has been spearheading organic farming research at the institute for the past 17 years, said. The newly-released virus-resistant tapioca variety, Sree Reksha, which is also suitable for organic farming, has given high per-acre yields with nine per cent higher starch content.  The institute plans to organise a one-day training programme on organic farming on August 12 as a part of its mass awareness campaign. Mayor Arya Rajendran will inaugurate the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/organic-farming-packages-for-cultivating-tuber-crops/article35807237.ece

The association urged the Chief Minister to ensure workplace safety and boost the morale of healthcare workers who are working round-the-clock despite pandemic fatigue. The KGMOA listed a set of suggestions which they think can help improve workplace safety. One suggestion is that all government healthcare institutions be recognised as special security zones under Section 83 of the Kerala Police Act 2011 and aid posts be established in all hospitals with casualty/emergency services. Security cameras should be established and adequate security staff be posted in all institutions. All cases of hospital attacks must be charged under the Kerala Health Service Persons and Healthcare Services Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act 2012 and prompt action taken against the culprits. Mandatory provisions such as defining time frame for filing charge sheet and ensuring speedy trial must be incorporated in the Act. The KGMOA said the police should include all relevant provisions in the FIR. The FIR should be ready within 24 hours of the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kgmoa-writes-to-cm-seeks-workplace-safety/article35807068.ece

Yediyurappa, he declined to accept them on Sunday. The order had raised eyebrows as the veteran leader holds no statutory post and is only a legislator now. In a letter addressed to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Mr. Yediyurappa requested the withdrawal of the order giving him a Cabinet-rank status coterminous with Mr. Bommai’s term as Chief Minister. “I would like the State government to give me only those facilities that any former Chief Minister is given,” he said in the letter. Such an order was unprecedented, and had been issued to keep Mr. Yediyurappa placated by the current regime, sources in the government said. It was a way to help him continue to stay in the ‘Cauvery’ bungalow of the government that he is keen on, sources said. Though the order was issued after consulting him, Mr. Yediyurappa is learnt to have changed his mind after the adverse reactions it elicited from sections of society and his own party. “The order was ill-advised and damaging to the stature of a veteran leader like B.S. Yediyurappa, so he has turned it down,” a leader close to him said. In particular, the timing of granting such a status when the State has enforced austerity measures had raised many eyebrows in political circles. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said while the new Chief Minister was talkingof cutting down “unwanted expenditure” through austerity measures, according Cabinet rank on the former Chief Minister did not augur well. “I thought of advising Mr. Yediyurappa to not accept the offer, but he has done so himself and I welcome it,” the Congress leader said on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/yediyurappa-turns-down-cabinet-rank-status/article35806566.ece

Eshwarappa has triggered a controversy by making a provocative appeal to party workers. Addressing the BJP’s Shivamogga city wing executive committee meeting on Sunday, he said the party had strengthened its base in the country so much that nobody would dare to touch its workers any more. “Earlier, when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers went to open a unit in Kerala, they were assaulted. Then our leaders used to tell the workers to ‘be calm at all costs’. But, now the situation has changed. Our strength has gone up. If someone attacks our worker, we tell our workers to face them with the same stick and take two for one,” he said. Further, speaking to the media, he defended his statement by saying he would stick to his words and they were not intended to provoke anybody. “My intention was to convey how the party has grown over the years. Do you expect us to sit quietly when our workers are attacked? We have lost many of workers till the recent years. Our workers were killed when they went to protect cows. The Congress lost the election because of such murders,” he said. Mr. Eshwarappa’s remarks drew sharp criticism from the Opposition Congress, which demanded that the Governor immediately sack him. The Congress said his remarks went against the spirit of the Constitution. Congress leader V.S. Ugrappa said Mr. Eshwarappa may have made such remarks to draw the attention of the RSS in the wake of him not getting the Deputy Chief Minister’s post. When journalists wanted Home Minister Araga Jnanendra to react to this speech, he evaded giving a reply.  Now, [the BJP’s] strength has gone up.

The new facility would provide ample employment opportunities to several medium, small and micro enterprises to come up as ancillary units. Presently, BDL has three manufacturing units — two in Telangana and one in Andhra Pradesh. New manufacturing facilities are upcoming at Amravati in Maharashtra and Ibrahimpatnam in Telangana, which means Jhansi would be the sixth, he explained. The BDL firm has been investing in acquiring futuristic technologies in the field of missiles, underwater weapons and airborne products to meet the requirements of the Indian Armed forces by collaborating with some leading major foreign manufacturers. These include the Naval Group-France, Rafael Advanced Defence System Ltd Israel; Thales-UK, STE ‘SPETSTECHNOEXPORT’-Ukraine, MBDA-France/UK for various missile and underwater weapon programmes, said a press release. The CMD signed the MoU in the presence of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and senior officials from both sides participating.

Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command (SNC), on Sunday progressed as planned, and system parameters proved satisfactory. “The successful completion of maiden trials sorties, despite challenges posed by the pandemic and the protocols in place, is testimony to the dedicated efforts of large number of stakeholders for over a decade [to construct the IAC]. This is a major milestone and a historical event. The carrier would undergo a series of sea trials to prove all equipment and systems prior to its delivery in 2022,” the release said. The delivery of Vikrant is being targeted to coincide with the celebrations to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India’s independence, Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. The delivery of the IAC to the Navy will also strengthen India’s position in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and its quest for a blue-water Navy. “The maiden sea trial of the vessel was a complete success, and we have tested all the parameters. Our focus is on completion of the rest of the sea trials and delivering the vessel to the Indian Navy in 2022,” said Madhu S. Nair, Chairman and Managing Director, CSL.

09 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Call to roll out tech courses in Malayalam||As the country takes baby steps towards adopting regional languages for higher education, the State Institute of Languages (Kerala Bhasha Institute) has urged the State government to expedite preparatory steps to employ Malayalam as the medium of instruction in colleges and universities. With the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) giving its nod to offer BTech programmes in 11 regional languages, including Malayalam, 14 engineering colleges across eight States have decided to offer select courses in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu and Tamil. The Karnataka government too has revealed its plan to offer all professional courses, including engineering, in Kannada from the 2022-23 academic year. State Institute of Languages Director V. Karthikeyan Nair has written to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to implement it in engineering colleges after holding a preparatory meeting with the Higher Education Minister, Additional Chief Secretary (Higher Education) and the Vice Chancellor of the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU). Curriculum, textbooks He also urged the KTU to convene its Boards of Studies to initiate steps to evolve curriculum and textbooks for the first two semesters in Malayalam in the initial phase. Teachers who handled subjects of these semesters should be imparted orientation courses in Malayalam, Prof. Nair opined. He added that the institute was willing to collaborate with the KTU to translate textbooks required for the transition to Malayalam. In his representation, Prof. Nair also urged the government to extend the endeavour to universities that offered arts and science courses. The Kerala State Higher Education Council should oversee the efforts. While Malayalam transliterations were available for reference books required for subjects such as history, economics and political science, the institute could take up the challenge of preparing textbooks for other subjects. Arguing that adopting Malayalam widely as the medium of instruction was not an insurmountable task, Prof. Nair pointed out that several English words originated from Greek, Latin and even Arabic. A teacher adept at the subject should be able to convey the relevant concepts in any language. The medium should not become a hurdle, he said. ‘Words can be retained’ He added that the State need not adopt a rigid policy while promoting the use of Malayalam. “Several household words like computer or table can be retained as such, even while we focus on expanding our bilingual glossaries in a phased manner,” he said. According to Prof. Nair, scientific usages in the language should be ideally taught among first-semester students through a mandatory add-on course similar to those taught in China and Germany.

They had been protesting against the government’s decision to set up three capitals, shifting the main seat of administration from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam (Executive Capital) and the State High Court to Kurnool (Judicial Capital), and making Amaravati the Legislative Capital. On the occasion of reaching the milestone, the Amaravati Joint Action Committee (JAC) had given a call for a rally from Thullur to the Mangalagiri temple. But the police foiled its attempts. Even the media personnel were not allowed into the villages. The police allowed only the locals after they produced their identity cards. The opposition parties condemned the police action. They also lauded the JAC members and the farmers for remaining firm in their stance “despite all odds.” TDP national general secretary N. Lokesh lauded the ‘Save Amaravati' agitators for making the protest rally from “nyayasthanam to devasthanam” a success despite the “suppressive arrests and threats from the police.” He described as “courageous” the steadfastness of the Amaravati farmers, women, youth, party leaders and farm workers in their fight “without yielding to the persecution of the ruling YSRCP leaders.” “The day is fast approaching when the capital city protesters will bury the YSRCP government in the ditches it dug up on the roads developed as a part of the Amaravati project,” Mr. Lokesh said. CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna extended his support to the JAC members and the farmers.

09 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three capitals will be a reality: Kannababu||Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu has reiterated that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s decision to have three capitals is intended to develop all the regions of the State through decentralisation. “Having passed the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill-2020 in the Assembly, the government will eventually make it a reality,” Mr. Kannababu said while addressing the media at the YSRCP central office on Sunday. “Development was concentrated in Hyderabad in the unified State. Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu repeated the same mistake of pooling up everything in Amaravati. He is now provoking the farmers against the three capitals to put the YSRCP government in a tight spot and not out of genuine concern for their well-being,” Mr. Kannababu observed. He further alleged that Mr. Naidu was more interested in real estate and that the agitation going on in Amaravati was stage-managed. He asserted that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced the three capitals after a serious consideration of the recommendations of various expert committees, whereas Mr. Naidu made the people believe that Amaravati was shaping up into a world-class capital when his plans were all flawed. He said Mr. Naidu and his son Lokesh should have come to terms with the realities after their defeat in the 2019 elections. “Unfortunately, they have not so far realised their follies.” he added. The TDP’s rout in the elections for the Guntur and Vijayawada municipal corporations ought to be a lesson for them, , he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-capitals-will-be-a-reality-kannababu/article35807172.ece

Narayana addressed the CPI State Council meeting on Sunday. He said the CBI should respond to the apex court’s comments and change its style of functioning. “The CBI is a constitutional body and it needs to function independently.

Mr. Venkata Rao said Andhra Pradesh topped the country in availing loans. In the last 25 months, the YSRCP government had borrowed Rs. 1.49 lakh crore against Rs. 1.30 lakh crore by the TDP government in five years. Also, the YSRCP government had given sureties worth Rs. 60,000 crore for loans taken through various corporations in the last two years, he said. The government must explain why it was unable to pay salaries and pensions on time and why the economic growth indicators were showing it in poor light, he said. The crisis would not have been there had the government made proper use of the loans, he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kala-lashes-out-at-govt-for-poor-fiscal-management/article35807179.ece

09 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Call to draw inspiration from Alluri||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paid tributes to revolutionary freedom fighter Alluri Sitarama Raju and his followers Gantam Dora and Mallu Dora at their memorial at Krishnadevi Peta (KD Peta)` of Golugonda mandal in the district on Sunday. She planted saplings at the Alluri Memorial Park and said that it was her good fortune to have visited the region where ‘Manyam Veerudu’ and revolutionary leader Alluri and his followers had fought against the British about a century ago. Interacting with some children, who were present at the programme, Ms. Sitharaman asked: “Do you know why I have come here?” She told them: “The ‘Rampa rebellion’, under the leadership of Alluri Sitarama Raju, was carried out against the British rulers 100 years ago from this place. The prominent places, which were associated with India’s freedom struggle all over the country, are being identified by the Centre to organise ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Utsav’, as part of 75 years of Independence.” Draw inspiration She called upon the children to draw inspiration from the courage and fearlessness of our leaders, who fought against the British rule. Earlier, girls presented a ‘kolatam’ to welcome the Finance Minister. State Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, MPs B.V. Satyavathi and Goddeti Madhavi, MLC P.V.N. Madhav, MLA Petla Uma Sankar Ganesh, Joint Collector P. Arun Babu, ASP Manikanta and DCCB Chairperson Ch. Anita were among those who participated. At Tallapalem in the district, Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman inspected a PDS centre and spoke to the Civil Supply officials. She said that the 5 kg free rice/per head being given under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) should be distributed only at the ration shops and not through PDS vans at the homes of beneficiaries. The free rice should be given from April to November 2020 and from May 2021 to November 2021. Later speaking to the beneficiaries in Telugu, she asked them whether they were getting the free rice. When they replied in the affirmative, she said: “I have no objection, if vehicle comes to your doorstep to deliver rice but you (beneficiaries) should ensure that it should, at least, have a photo of the Prime Minister.” She expressed happiness when a beneficiary replied: “unnadandi” (It is there). Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath, who was beside her, said: “Madam, due to COVID-19, we are delivering rice at the doorstep of beneficiaries”. When she asked him about the free rice scheme, he said: “Pradhan Mantri Grameen (instead of Garib) Kalyan Yojana” and, perhaps, realising his mistake, quickly changed it to PMGKY. Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman wondered how the rural beneficiaries would understand it. Mr. Amarnath said: “If you want me to tell about our Anna (CM Jagan), I can tell”. She said, “Pradhan Mantri ee desamlo andariki anna (Prime Minister is the anna (elder brother) for all citizens of the country)”. She said: “Ye anna photo pettina naku abhyantram ledhu. Pradhan Mantri photo undali” (I have no objection if you display any anna’s photo but the PM’s photo should be there on the vehicle.)” MLC P.V.N. Madhav, BJP State president Somu Veerraju, MLA Karanam Dharmasri, Joint Collector M. Venugopal Reddy and RDO Seetharama Rao were among those who were present. The Union Finance Minister did not participate in the party meeting held at Tallapalem as she had to catch the evening flight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nirmala-sitharaman-pays-tributes-to-alluri/article35806761.ece

Narasimha Rao said that both the TDP and the YSRCP believe in vote bank politics and it would not be surprising to see both the parties having a tacit understanding to stop the growth of BJP in the State. Addressing the media after a two-day visit to the districts of Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam along with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he alleged that both the parties were playing politics with religion and he alleged that there may be an understanding between them. He was referring to the recent issue relating to the move to install the statue of Tipu Sultan at a public place and the comments made by Deputy Chief Minister Amzath Basha. He said Mr. Basha should not try to install the statue at any public place, as this will force the BJP to come on to the streets to take up a fight. “We do not mind if he (Basha) erects the statue in a private place or at his home, but not at a public place,” Mr. Narasimha Rao said, adding that the comments of some of the senior leaders and Ministers on the tour of the Union Finance Minister were in bad taste. The Union Finance Minister can visit any State and there is no need to give it a conspiracy angle. Their comments were not only insulting for Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman, but they were also against the Hindu religion and the ideology of Hindutva. “This is not how you welcome the Union Finance Minister,” he said, adding that in this State people who speak for the Hindu religion do not find a place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-ysrcp-may-have-a-tacit-understanding-gvl/article35807187.ece

Mr. Sanyasi Raju said that the State government would be in a debt trap as the loan amounts had reportedly gone up to Rs. 3.73 lakh crore which means the per capita debt had gone up to nearly Rs. 80,000 debt and blamed it on the ‘poor’ financial administration. “The BJP is not against welfare schemes. But at the same time, the government must help the people to be self-reliant instead of making them to depend on freebies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stop-borrowing-for-unproductive-schemes/article35807215.ece

The women fiercely resisted the police but were taken into custody. Protests continued at Mandadam and police personnel were deployed on Karakatta too. Several leaders including former Ministers Devineni Umamaheswara Rao, Nakka Ananda Babu and TDP leaders including Ganji Chiranjeevi were confined to their homes. The Joint Action Committee has been holding protests since December 2019 when Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said in the Assembly that the decision to have three capitals would ensure equal development of all the three regions of the State. Govt.’s stand Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had said that the State government could not afford to spend Rs. 1 lakh crore to just create basic infrastructure facilities in Amaravati. The location of the capital in villages, far away from the National Highway and located in farm fields between Guntur and Vijayawada, was not an ideal choice as it involved a huge expenditure. The previous TDP government had failed to construct even a single permanent structure during its tenure, Mr. Jagan said then. TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, on the other hand, rebutted the theory and said that the location of the capital at the centre of the State would be advantageous and added that basic infrastructure had already been put in place. The construction of access roads, Assembly and Secretariat complexes and the High Court had involved huge expenditure, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/amaravati-jac-march-to-mangalagiri-temple-foiled/article35807168.ece

Rama Rao distributed custom-made vehicles to the differently-abled as part of ‘Gift a Smile’, a novel initiative that he had started on his last birthday (July 24). The vehicles were handed over to several beneficiaries at a programme held in the city on Sunday by the Minister, who later had lunch with the beneficiaries. More vehicles under this initiative will be given to the identified beneficiaries soon both in Hyderabad and other parts of the State. On his birthday this year, Mr Rama Rao had announced that he would distribute 100 custom-made vehicles to physically-challenged persons and had urged his supporters to do the same if they wished to celebrate his birthday. Several people’s representatives including MLAs and MPs as well as TRS leaders came forward to donate vehicles to the needy. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Rama Rao said that this year, more than 1,000 vehicles would be donated under the “Gift A Smile” initiative with many elected representatives coming forward to donate them following his clarion call. The Minister stated that the vehicles not just make the lives of the differently-abled comfortable, but also provide them a livelihood. Some vehicles donated by his admirers were also distributed to the needy on Sunday. The Minister also recalled his last birthday when he donated six ambulances in Sircilla constituency under the initiative, and how many other public representatives had come forward to donate ambulances. Overall, more than 100 ambulances were donated under this noble initiative last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-gives-gift-of-mobility-to-the-differently-abled/article35807004.ece
09 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘TRS promises remained samples’||“Show me one promise that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has fulfilled for dalits and girijans since he came to power, and all that he had done is to take them for a ride,” claimed Telangana Congress president A. Revanth Reddy while explaining the reason for launching the Dalita Girijana Dandora from Indervelli on August 9. Promises of first dalit Chief Minister in Telangana, three acres land to dalits, 12% reservations to girijans, development fund of Rs. 10,000 crore to dalits and Rs. 50,000 crore to STs promised in the TRS manifesto, and job recruitment for SCs and STs were all yet to be honoured, he said. Similarly, double bedroom houses, Rs. 10,000 support before the GHMC elections, job notifications before the Graduate MLC polls, and hordes of assurances given before the Dubbaka and Nagarjunasagar bypolls were all forgotten once the elections were over. The Congress chief said that if job recruitment was done on time thousands of dalit and tribal families would have been settled by now. Nearly 9 lakh applications from SC and ST youngsters were pending for financial support. Besides, the self-respect of dalits and girijans had been severely hit with dalits tortured at Nerella and tribal farmers handcuffed for demanding support price. “Aren’t these enough to reflect the attitude of this government?” he asked. Mr. Reddy also termed the TRS government a “Sample Government” and went on to accuse it of offering some samples before the elections to attract the voters like a sweet seller inducing the customers with a small piece of sweet. “KCR looks for new samples in every election and Dalit Bandhu is just one of those,” he claimed. “The meeting is precisely to expose the government on how it induces poor communities rather than working with commitment.” “Given the track record of this government, we will pressure it to extend Dalit Bandhu scheme to girijans in all the 119 constituencies,” he said, adding that the TRS MLAs were already facing the heat in several constituencies with demands for resignations so that the scheme could be implemented as it was being promised for Huzurabad. “This reflects the lack of confidence in this government more than the trust that the Chief Minister has been claiming,” he said. On choosing Indervelli for the launch of the programme, he said the place was inspirational given its history against suppression and atrocities. “The dandora will inspire people to fight against repressive policies. More so, when August 9 is celebrated as World Tribals Day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-promises-remained-samples/article35806799.ece
09 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Tribal lifestyle through a hairdresser’s lens||Chasing the changing contours of Adivasi lifestyle has been his passion for close to a decade now. And, the fact that he brushes aside his poor financial background (he is a hairdresser by profession) is testimony to the unbridled joy he feels in ‘discovering the hidden treasures’ of the forests in Adilabad is something truly remarkable. The 43-year-old lensman L. Krishna is planning a photo exhibition to showcase some of the rare pictures of Adivasis that he has shot in the last decade, including some from his latest trip. “It is an amazing experience even to watch them from a distance. Yes, some aspects of their lifestyle have changed for good, but other things like having their own electricity and still preferring to drink the clean stream water are some features which showcase their decades-old culture and traditions,” he says. On his recent visit to some of the Adivasi households deep inside the forest like Khandala, Pothaguda, Dahiguda, Kheregama and Molalagutta, Mr Krishna captured some images which truly depict the richness of their history and how they continue to retain their own identity despite challenges on many fronts. “What is most impressive about them is their honesty and integrity and the smile on their faces clearly depicting their genuine warmth and affection,” he explains. “Mainly thriving on agriculture and staying away from the hustle-bustle of town culture, they are clearly at peace with themselves, far away from the madding crowds,” the passionate lensman says. A visit to their households will transport anyone into a world of fantasy given the way they are blessed by mother nature, Mr Krishna avers. “Hemmed in by the huge trees all over and some of the birds including peacocks frequenting their places, is something which only they can enjoy. For me, there is no better joy than portraying their great culture even in this rapidly changing hi-tech world,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tribal-lifestyle-through-a-hairdressers-lens/article35806996.ece

09 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Last-minute repair work on Badshahi Ashoorkhana||Days to go before the beginning of Muharram, the Telangana Department of Archaeology and Museums is carrying out emergency repair works on the 400-year-old Badshahi Ashoorkhana. “Large cracks have appeared on two of the wooden capitals capping the columns and one of the beams is showing signs of sagging along with signs of leakages,” informs Mir Abbas Ali Moosavi, the caretaker of the Ashoorkhana. For the first 10 days of the Muslim calendar month of Muharram, the Ashoorkhana or house of mourning becomes a site of Ziyarat (pilgrimage) as alams (battle standards) are installed and people from all faiths offer prayers. “We are applying Tapecrete, a polymer-based waterproofing coat, on the 20th century cement concrete covering the original lime concrete layer to prevent water seepage during monsoons. We expect to finish the work in three days so that Muharram observances are not interrupted,” says Prashant Banerjee of Aga Khan Trust for Culture, which is carrying out the repair work. Three years earlier, the DAM carried out temporary measures to protect the building. “The western wall with the tile work has no seepage thanks to that repair work. But portions of the ceiling have become wet affecting the wooden roofing,” says Mr. Moosavi, pointing to the damaged portions of the ceiling. The wooden ceiling is at a height of 27 feet and a single wooden column holds up the four interlocking beams above the capital. “We are doing anti-termite treatment in crevices of the interlocked wooden beams placed above the capital. New 6 mm thick and 90 mm wide metal strips being welded along the octagonal profile to brace the capital from further bulging out,” informs Mr. Banerjee. A 27.2-foot high metal truss column is also being temporarily-deployed to take the structural load of the wooden beam which is sagging. The Badshahi Ashoorkhana is among the 27 heritage sites in Hyderabad that are being monitored by the Telangana High Court for their conservation effort. The ashoorkhana (the 10 day of Muharram is known as ashoora) is an important landmark in the growth of Hyderabad as it was commissioned by the builder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. For many years, encroachers occupied the open area of the ashoorkhana and other buildings in the complex collapsed. Now, the main Ashoorkhana building has become a tourist destination, where visitors get a glimpse of medieval architecture and knowledge of chemistry used to create the haft-rang (seven-coloured) tiles and calligraphy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/last-minute-repair-work-on-badshahi-ashoorkhana/article35807009.ece
09 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Gaddiannaram fruit market to be shifted to Batasingaram||The fruit market at Gaddiannaram, the only wholesale fruit market in the city, will be shifted to the logistics park at Batasingaram, 25 km away, by month end. Meeting with agents The marketing department held a meeting with 340 commission agents a couple of days ago where they were told that the government had transferred the 21-acre facility to the health department for construction of a super speciality hospital. The hospital was one of the five for super speciality healthcare proposed by the government in the city. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet recently. Arguments galore At the meeting with the commission agents at NTR vegetable market, which ended abruptly amid arguments and counter arguments, senior grade market secretary Padma Harsha faced stiff resistance to the move to shift the fruit market as adequate facilities were lacking at the alternate site at Batasingaram. She explained to them that Batasingaram was only a temporary market till the market at Koheda over 170 acres was constructed. She set a deadline of August 23 to vacate but the agents insisted that they were willing to go to Koheda anytime and not Batasingaram if adequate facilities were provided at the former. They also highlighted that Batasingaram was too small for farmers to bring their produce and store. The layout at Koheda was being prepared and, then, the detailed project report submitted to the government. Marketing director G. Lakshmi Bai told The Hindu that there was no court litigation to stop the shifting of market from Gaddiannaram to Batasingaram as the government had already filed its reply to the petition moved by commission agents. ‘Facilities adequate’ She said a shed over 50,000 sq. ft. which was constructed at Batasingaram was sufficient for commission agents to carry out their transactions. There was also a dormitory, cold storage facility and a huge parking space. Of the 340 commission agents at Gaddiannaram, only 174 had permanent accommodation while the others traded on auction plots. There were also 35 retail shops. The market was established in 1986. Three other markets for vegetables and other perishables were also set up in city at Gudimalkapur, Bowenpally and Malakpet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gaddiannaram-fruit-market-to-be-shifted-to-batasingaram/article35807011.ece
09 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Registration dept. turns major source of revenue||The Registration and Stamps department is turning out to be a major source of revenue generation to the State government thanks to the rising real estate transactions after fully lifting the COVID-induced restrictions. The department registered close to Rs. 1,200 crore revenue, the highest since the incidence of COVID-19 last year, during July reporting registration of 2.13 lakh documents. This amounted to achievement of over 70% of the target set for the month by the department and officials are hopeful that the revenue will rise further on account of the approaching festival season considered auspicious for land transactions. The magnitude of transactions can be seen from the fact that growth in the revenue continued in spite of the revision of market values of lands and registration charges from July 22. The department registered revenue in excess of Rs. 2,800 crore during the first four months of the financial year against the target of Rs. 12,500 crore set for the fiscal. Senior officials said the growth was in tune with the targets set except in the month of May when the sub-registrar offices were closed for some time and worked under tight restrictions for most part of the month. The department reported revenue of Rs. 234.50 crore during May as compared to Rs. 716.89 crore in April and Rs. 674.43 crore during June. The situation in July however changed following the talk of steep hike in land values as well as registration charges and there was a flurry of activity in the offices of the sub-registrars, especially those located in the HMDA limits. The enthusiasm among buyers/sellers was no less in other regions as land sales picked up in the areas abutting irrigation project sites and they were not deterred by the hike in prices when it was actually implemented going by the scale of transactions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/registration-dept-turns-major-source-of-revenue/article35807019.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao and several States were emulating Mission Bhagiratha which envisaged supply of safe drinking water following the standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation. While States like West Bengal and Maharashtra designed schemes on the lines of Mission Bhagiratha, the scheme was the inspiration behind the Jal Jeevan Mission scheme launched by the Centre.

Praveen Kumar told The Hindu . He said that around 6.30 a.m., the kidnappers entered the victim’s apartment complex and an hour later, forced Mr. Deshpande into a car and took him away. Soon after getting information, police alerted all toll gates and instructed them not to allow the suspecting cars. However, the cars managed to breach Nirmal toll gate and went towards Hyderabad. “Initially, we suspected that he was being taken to Maharashtra, but movement of vehicles at Nirmal toll gate confirmed that the victim was being taken to Hyderabad. We alerted all police stations en route,” Mr. Kumar said. By 10.30 a.m., Nirmal police in association with their counterparts at Gajwel managed to intercept the vehicles at Toopran toll gate and rescued Mr. Deshpande, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/realtor-rescued-in-less-than-3-hours-of-kidnap/article35806802.ece
09 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Empowering adivasis||Mission Bhagiratha, the prestigious project launched by the State government for supply of safe drinking water to households, received praise from the Union government yet again. Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat appreciated the Telangana government for leading the country in providing drinking water connection to all households across the State. The Minister tweeted that the Union government too was nearing completion of its ambitious project to provide safe drinking water to all. He said Goa was the second State to achieve 100% drinking water connections to all households. Puducherry (87.32%), Haryana (85.11%), Andaman Nicobar islands (83.76%) and Gujarat (81.63%) were catching up with Telangana in providing safe drinking water to the people, he tweeted. Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Minister E. Dayakar Rao thanked the Union Minister for his comments on Mission Bhagiratha. He said the project was the brainchild of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and several States were emulating Mission Bhagiratha which envisaged supply of safe drinking water following the standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation. While States like West Bengal and Maharashtra designed schemes on the lines of Mission Bhagiratha, the scheme was the inspiration behind the Jal Jeevan Mission scheme launched by the Centre. Mission Bhagiratha had received several awards at the national level, he recalled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/union-minister-praises-mission-bhagiratha/article35806968.ece
09 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Reader’s Mail - Hyderabad||Though GHMC is in denial mode over the death of two labourers while cleaning drain silt with their hands, it is shocking that neither the Municipal Administration Minister, Mayor nor any official of GHMC visited the site and consoled the families of victims. Here, it is not the question of who was responsible and how the works were carried at night as further inquiry will reveal the facts, but consoling the bereaved families was important, and any assistance from Chief Minister’s relief fund or any other fund from people’s representatives can be promised. But there was no such move from GHMC nor from public representatives, which shows an iron heart. Jayaprakash Reddy, Nalgonda   During monsoon or water supply on alternate days, the manhole on the main 40 feet road opposite Fazal Hospital in Muradnagar (near Mehedipatnam) in the middle of the road overflows. The drain water mixed with buffaloes dung dumped by the dairy farms situated nearby is spread all over the road causing a stench and aiding in mosquito breeding. This has been going on despite complaints by local people for years. Unfortunately, the problem is continuing despite the replacement of drainage pipelines with larger one nearly two years ago. I request the officials concerned to attend to this serious problem before it goes out of control. Syed Ilyas Basha, Muradnagar   I would like to draw the attention of the authorities concerned to the present insanitary condition of West Anandbagh. The lane beside Cinepolis and its adjacent lane is especially pathetic as sweeping is not done for weeks despite complaints lodged over phone and social media. Heaps of garbage have been lying on both sides of the roads for days together. There is no dustbin and refuse of neighbours is thrown on the roads. The number of flies and mosquitoes has naturally multiplied. Suresh Kumar, Anandbagh   On Srinagar Colony main road near HDFC bank, there is a bus stop with a big shelter indicating the bus numbers thar go to Yousufguda, Borabanda etc. from this point. Even though lockdown was lifted a few months ago and buses are going towards Mehdipatnam, Charminar etc. in the opposite direction at the same place, there are no buses going towards Borabanda as on date. Consequently, we are forced to go to Ameerpet by either bus or share-auto to board a bus. I, therefore, request the TSRTC authorities to immediately direct some buses towards Borabanda through this point as well. K Durga Prasad Rao, Srinagar Colony   I managed to renew my car driving license in a smooth fashion this time. I am sharing this good experience with the Hyderabad North Zone RTA office to express my appreciation and balance out the many complaints that often appear in this column. The online application, payment and booking of slot was smooth. Experience at the RTA office was nice with the staff giving proper directions and the entire process was completed in 10 minutes flat. My renewal application was approved the same day, but the license was not printed even after two weeks. When I sent an e-mail seeking speedy processing, within minutes the response said shortage of stationery has been causing delay, but one could use the soft copy downloaded from the mobile app. This was impressive. Congrats to the positive-minded staff at RTA. Sreekumar Nhalur, Tarnaka  (Readers are welcome to write to us about the civic issues in their respective areas to be highlighted in these columns.

On August 5, a woman approached the cyber team stating that she was duped when she tried to transfer money to an account through a link offering ‘work from home’. Police seized two mobile phones, five cheque books, four debit cards, five rubber stamps and Rs. 21,500 cash, and froze Rs. 19 lakh in the bank accounts of the accused duo. Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said that the accused colluded with the Chinese to cheat people.

09 August 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Ryots to step up stir against dump yard||Hardening their stand on their demand for shifting the dump yard from a 10-acre site at Mallemadugu near here to a distant place, aggrieved farmers of Kamanchikal and its adjoining villages in Raghunadhapalem mandal have warned that they will intensify their ongoing stir if the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) failed to relocate the dump yard. The aggrieved farmers from Kamanchikal and its surrounding areas have been organising protests in the form of dharna and deeksha on the outskirts of Kamanchikal for the last 17 days to press for their demand to relocate the dump yard to somewhere far away from residential localities and water bodies. Meanwhile, the relay hunger strike by protesting farmers entered its fifth day on Sunday. Cutting across political affiliations, several leaders of various political parties and mass organisations visited the protest site and extended their support to the farmers’ stir on Sunday. Vyavasaya Karmika Sangham mandal president P Venkateshwarlu alleged that the unabated dumping of tonnes of garbage and hospital waste from the 60 divisions of KMC at the Mallemadugu dump yard was causing soil and water pollution in the villages under the Kamanchikal gram panchayat. He deplored that the unbearable stench emanating from the dump yard was keeping the farm labourers at bay from agricultural fields and exposing local farmers to potential health hazards. He demanded that the authorities take urgent steps to shift the Mallemadugu dump yard to protect the water bodies from pollution and safeguard public health.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryots-to-step-up-stir-against-dump-yard/article35807224.ece
09 August 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||‘Will you be slaves or administrators?’||Former Secretary of Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society R. S. Praveen Kumar officially joined the Bahujan Samaj Party, in the presence of Rajya Sabha member and party’s national coordinator Ramji Gautam, at the iconic N.G. College grounds here on Sunday. At the Rajyadhikara Sankalpa Sabha, he was also declared BSP’s Telangana coordinator. Mr. Gautam expressed the confidence that bahujans in Telangana would achieve the dream of B. R. Ambedkar through Mr. Praveen Kumar, the former IPS officer, starting 2023. ‘Pragati Bhavan is near’ Mr Praveen Kumar, without mincing words, began his address with ‘Jai Bhim’ and said dalits and bahujans in Telangana would not remain slaves, but occupy Pragathi Bhavan, the official residence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and become administrators. “Pragathi Bhavan is very near, we will go there,” he said, acknowledging shouts of people calling him ‘CM’. Taking a direct shot at the Chief Minister’s Dalit Bandhu, the latest Rs. 10-lakh direct benefit transfer scheme, and other schemes, Mr. Praveen Kumar called them “a dominant caste’s conspiracy of distributing the loot from bahujans in the form of schemes, in turn to buy bahujans’ votes.” “If you (KCR) love Dalits, distribute your assets. Dalits will work hard and decide their own future,” he said, adding education, quality health care and employment with skills were the ingredients of progress. Flagging the poor state of health care, universities, recruitment (about 35 lakh children were away from quality education in the State), he said the TRS government’s assurances were hollow, “and still people are worse than slaves in this bangaru Telangana.” However, with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Telangana, he said, bahujans would get their equality, right of reservation in the private sector, quality education and avenues away from caste-based occupations and in varied fields of interest. Describing the Dalit and bahujan population as “bahujan tsunami”, Mr. Praveen Kumar said social justice would only be achieved with the BSP and asked people to be aware of the power of the vote to change lives. He asked the gathering, “Will you want to be crushed by the car (Telangana Rashtra Samithi election symbol), or ride the elephant (Bahujan Samaj Party election symbol) to plant the blue flag on the Red Fort? What would you want to become, slaves or administrators?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/will-you-be-slaves-or-administrators/article35807023.ece
09 August 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Nalgonda echoes with ‘Jai Bhim’||The Bahujan Samaj Party, the national political party representing bahujans and dalits, was last talked about in Nalgonda in the 2018 Assembly elections, and even before it had faded when it came to numbers. But on Sunday, Nalgonda town immersed in BSP’s vast blueness and relentless slogans of ‘Jai Bhim’ only appeared to be giving life to what the organisers espouse ‘Bahujana Rajyadhikaram’. Nalgonda’s N.G. College grounds, the choice of former IPS officer R. S. Praveen Kumar to officially mark his political entry into the BSP, did not remain just a venue but became platform to display consolidated strength and objectives. Attendees, according to permitted seats, was about ten thousand, but participants from across Telangana and neighbouring States touched tens of thousands. In contrast, past BSP meetings in Nalgonda had been held at the clock tower centre. From balloons to caps to flags, scarves and shirts, the town’s arterial Hyderabad road, from Ambedkar’s statue at Marriguda bypass to the venue, was filled with blue, the only other colour replacing rose-pink of the ruling TRS in recent years. And all along the way, “Jai Bhim, Jai BSP, Jai RSP,” rented the air. Although the organisers had planned parking arrangements, district-wise, at private function halls and colleges, the slow pace of the rally, traffic congestion and SUV failure on the way allowed the main vehicle to reach the venue only around 7 p.m. The rally was marked by ‘kolatam’ by women, Kommu Koya and dappu artistes’ performance, ‘chindu bagotham’ and Banjara dance. It was also the ‘Swaeroes Force’, alumni of the social welfare institutions formed into a network under Mr. Praveen Kumar, that added to the BSP cadre and drove the entire programme. At the venue, at least half a dozen book stalls, predominantly selling Dalit literature, masks, umbrellas and merchandise, large cut-outs of B.R. Ambedkar, Jytotirao Phule, and Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, and hundreds of activists and social justice practitioners, added to the ‘exclusively bahujan’ meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nalgonda-echoes-with-jai-bhim/article35807021.ece

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Doubts over scope of a survey||The State government is conducting a comprehensive survey to assess the economic backwardness of Scheduled Caste families for extending benefits under the first of its kind Dalit Bandhu, billed as the biggest direct benefit transfer scheme, announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. No one is questioning the intentions behind the scheme which is aimed at providing Rs. 10 lakh to eligible families to nurture entrepreneurship among aspiring people from under privileged sections without bank linkage. But doubts are rife over the scope for utilising the survey, considered baseline for implementing Dalit Bandhu, to understand political leanings of the families concerned. The timing of the survey assumes significance as it comes in the light of resignation of Indian Police Service (IPS) officer R.S. Praveen Kumar who formally joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Sunday. With Mr. R. S. Praveen Kumar said to have considerable sway over dalit community, a section of people do not rule out the scope of utilising the survey to assess the impact of Mr. Praveen Kumar if he really enters the political fray.     After Dalit Bandhu, demands have cropped up from different sections of people for similar schemes to them in the same name and style. The teachers have demanded `Teachers Bandhu’, Backward Castes (BCs) wanted `BC Bandhu’ and the latest to join the chorus is `NRIs Bandhu’. Migrant workers from Gulf have voiced the demand for the same Rs. 10 lakh direct benefit transfer as it was the promise of the government in this year’s budget to frame a suitable policy for them. They recalled Finance Minister T. Harish Rao acknowledging in the Assembly that the migrant workers contributed to the economic growth of the country and the State immensely. Therefore, the government owed it to them to come up with a decent livelihood programme for them.   Industries and Information Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s words that he was touched by the book written by a story writer and novelist Peddinti Ashok Kumar raised eyebrows. Ever busy with official engagements as a Minister, party work as working president, attending on-stage programmes and also taking to Twitter frequently, Mr. K. Taraka Rama Rao revealed one more side of his multi-tasking personality. He said he read some stories in Mr. Ashok Kumar’s book “Gundelo vana” (rain in heart) which appeared as if they chased man. The writer reflected the village life and documented the societal changes over the last two decades. Mr. Rao finally paid a modest compliment to the writer calling him “anna”.  (M. Rajeev and N.

09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||DDMA orders implementation of GRAP for COVID-19 management||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday issued an order to bring into force a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for effective COVID-19 management. The plan was devised by a State-Level Expert Committee and approved last month in a DDMA meeting chaired by the Lieutenant Governor. Three parameters The GRAP consists of three parameters — positivity rate, cumulative new positive cases and average oxygenated bed occupancy for lockdown/unlock in the Capital. The government has introduced four levels of colour-coded alerts to kick in when the parameters are met. The Level 1 or yellow alert will come into force when the positivity rate is over 0.5% for two consecutive days or cumulative new positive cases for seven days is above 1,500 cases or the average occupancy of oxygenated beds for seven days is 500 beds. Under the alert, cinema halls, banquets, barbershops, salons, gyms, entertainment parks, schools and religious places will be shut. A night curfew will be imposed. The Level 2 or amber alert will come into force when the positivity rate is over 1% for two days or cumulative new positive cases for seven days is above 3,500 cases or the average occupancy of oxygenated beds for seven days is 700 beds. Restaurants and public parks will be shut and a weekend curfew will kick in. The Level 3 or orange alert will kick in when the positivity rate is over 2% for two days or cumulative new positive cases for seven days is above 9,000 cases or the average occupancy of oxygenated beds for seven days is 1,000 beds. Many construction activities will shut along with shops and malls. The Delhi Metro will also shut down. A Level 4 or red alert will be sounded when the positivity rate is over 5% for two days or cumulative new positive cases for seven days is above 16,000 or the average occupancy of oxygenated beds for seven days is 3,000 beds. All government offices, apart from those providing essential and emergency services, will shut and a total curfew will be imposed. 66 new cases, 0 deaths As per the health bulletin, the Capital recorded 66 new cases and zero deaths on Sunday. There are 536 active cases in the Capital. The bulletin added that 1,19,942 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the last 24-hours out of which 60,097 received their first dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ddma-orders-implementation-of-grap-for-covid-19-management/article35806910.ece
09 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi Police intensifies patrolling, anti-sabotage checks ahead of Independence Day||Ahead of Independence Day, the Delhi Police has tightened security across the Capital by intensifying patrolling, conducting anti-sabotage checks and deploying extra pickets at the border areas to thwart any untoward incident, officials said on Sunday. As part of the anti-terror measures, enhanced police presence, intensive checking at vulnerable points, checking of hotels and guest houses, SIM card and second hand car dealers, sensitisation of cyber cafe owners and verification of tenant and servant drives are being intensively carried out by all the police stations, they said. Security has been also intensified at the Indira Gandhi International Airport after the Delhi Police on Saturday received an e-mail which claimed two people, allegedly operatives of terror-outfit Al Qaeda, were coming to India from Singapore to carry out multiple bombings in the country within one-three days, according to officials sources. The information was passed on to the control room but after examination, the threat was termed ‘non-specific’ since a similar e-mail had been received in March this year, they said. However, the security remained tightened at the IGI in view of Independence Day. At his first crime review meeting on Saturday ahead of Independence Day, Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana directed officials to draft the cooperation of street vendors, small shop keepers and auto drivers in a “big way” for them to act as “eyes and ears” against terrorist or criminal designs. “These common people on ground can be vigilant to act as our ‘force multipliers’ and form a part of our community policing to keep the city safe and secure with greater public cooperation and participation,” he had said. Officials said police said legal action have been initiated against those house owners who did not get the verification of their tenant or servant done. DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “Security at malls and vital installations have been increased. There is constant foot and motorcycle patrolling being done by senior officers. Network of CCTV cameras are being strengthened. Those CCTVs which are found non-operational are being repaired and new CCTV cameras are also being installed in vital areas. Anti-sabotage checks are being carried out in malls and markets.” The police said vehicles are being thoroughly checked and strict vigil is being maintained while meetings are also being conducted with members of MWAs and RWAs. In the southeast district, around 500 police personnel have been deployed to carry out verification drives and anti-sabotage checks at vital locations and heavy footfall areas, including market areas of Nehru Place and Lajpat Nagar, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-police-intensifies-patrolling-anti-sabotage-checks-ahead-of-independence-day/article35807095.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||CIABC welcomes Delhi liquor licence allotments||The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) on Sunday welcomed the allotment of retail liquor vends through bidding but cautioned against high prices of alcohol licences in Delhi. The CIABC said it hoped that high auction prices are not passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices or to manufacturers in the form of demands for undue discounts. CIABC Director-General Vinod Giri said passing on the burden of high auction prices to consumer or to the manufacturers will not be good for long-term health of the industry. “We hope that the bidders have made realistic estimates of revenues and expenses and are able to achieve that without undue stress to themselves or to other stakeholders,” Mr. Giri said. In the auction of liquor licences in 20 out of 32 zones in the National Capital after the announcement of new liberalized excise policy, the Delhi government has earned Rs. 5,300 crores while another Rs. 3,000 crores are likely to be earned from the remaining auction of licences. “The new liquor policy has opened up Delhi trade to experienced retailers, not only from the city, but also from other parts of the country. It should help bring in new ideas and innovation to uplift the quality of liquor retailing in Delhi. Distribution of licenses among diverse groups should also weigh in against formation of trade cartels which was and remains one of our major concerns,” said Mr. Giri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ciabc-cautions-against-high-liquor-licence-prices-in-city/article35806900.ece

Before this, samples used to be sent to other States that have animal DNA testing facilities for the test results. Sometimes, the process delayed investigations. It will be helpful for the Delhi Police for timely disposal of cases related to cow slaughter, illegal trade of animals and other animal-related cases. Director Deepa Verma said, “The types of evidence analysed by our forensics lab include any part of an animal, including blood and tissue samples, carcasses, hair, teeth, bones contents.” She added: “Our experts shall analyses DNA to provide information about the identity of a sample. Some answers that DNA tests may provide identification, characterisation of the relationships between animals, and evaluation of two different samples in order to determine if they originated from the same individual.” Now, the laboratory can examine and identify the animal species of meat products, frozen meat packing, slaughter cases and more. Asst. PRO, Dr. Rajnish Singh said: “The main challenge witnessed by a forensic scientist is identifying a particular species from crime scene evidence. It is very difficult for a scientist to distinguish if a piece of flesh is found at the scene of crime is from a protected animal like an elephant or tiger, etc. or if it comes from a non-protected animal. Now this new wing of Animal DNA shall address these requirements.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-gets-its-first-animal-dna-lab-set-up-in-rohini/article35806914.ece
09 August 2021||New Delhi,||Respond to plea alleging insurance firm did not reimburse entire amount: HC||The Delhi High Court has asked the Delhi government and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to respond to a plea of a woman challenging an insurance company’s decision not to reimburse entire amounts spent on the treatment of her late husband for COVID. Justice Rekha Palli also issued notice to the National Insurance Company Limited and Fortis Hospital at Shalimar Bagh, where the woman’s husband died during COVID treatment last year. The court has posted the case for further hearing on December 12. The plea filed by Delhi resident Sunita Goel and her two minor children said her husband held a mediclaim policy, Parivar Mediclaim Policy, and the sum insured was Rs. 5 lakh. The petition said the woman’s husband, Gulshan Kumar Goel, contracted the infection in the last week of June 2020 and was hospitalised days later on June 30 at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh. He expired on July 7, 2020. The plea contended that the insurance company has not reimbursed the entire amounts spent on the medical treatment of the late husband on the premise that once Delhi government had by its June 30, 2020 circular fixed the rates chargeable by hospitals in Delhi, only the said amount was payable. The plea argued that the insurance company has failed to appreciate that once the hospital has charged at rates higher than the approved rates, she cannot be faulted and denied reimbursement of the entire amount spent on the treatment of her late husband. The plea stated that though the hospital raised a bill of Rs. 5.33 lakh, the insurance company reimbursed Rs. 1.31 lakh only.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/reply-to-plea-alleging-insurance-firm-did-not-reimburse-covid-treatment-amount/article35806905.ece

Mr. Kejriwal said the poorest of the poor people reside in the shelter homes operated by the Delhi government and as most of them do not possess voter cards, and since they do not make up the vote-bank of any political party, they are hence ignored. “Not just in Delhi, but throughout the country no government tried to care for this section of the society.

09 August 2021||Kunduz,||Afghan forces fighting to retake cities: govt.||The Afghan Ministry of Defence said on Monday that government forces were fighting to retake key installations after the Taliban captured three more provincial capital on Sunday in quick succession. The insurgents have taken control of five provincial capitals in Afghanistan since Friday. Kunduz, Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan in the north fell within hours of each other on Sunday. On Friday, the militants captured Zaranj, and followed it up by taking Sheberghan the next day. “The commando forces have launched a clearing operation. Some areas, including the national radio and TV buildings, have been cleared of the terrorist Taliban,” the Ministry said. Spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Mirwais Stanikzai, said later that reinforcements, including special forces, had been deployed to Sar-e-Pul and Sheberghan. “These cities that the Taliban want to capture will soon become their graveyards,” he added. Kabul’s ability to hold the north may prove crucial to the government’s survival. Northern Afghanistan has long been considered an anti-Taliban stronghold that saw some of the stiffest resistance to militant rule in the 1990s. The region remains home to several militias and is also a fertile recruiting ground for the country’s armed forces. ‘Prisoners freed’ “The capture of Kunduz is significant because it will free up a large number of Taliban forces who might then be mobilised in other parts of the north,” said Ibraheem Thurial, a consultant for International Crisis Group. Vivid footage of the fighting was posted on social media over the weekend, including what appeared to be large numbers of prisoners being freed from jails in captured cities. The Taliban frequently target prisons to release incarcerated fighters to replenish their ranks. Fighting was also reported on the outskirts of Herat in the west, and Lashkar Gah and Kandahar in the south. The pace of Taliban advances has caught government forces flatfooted, but they won some respite late on Saturday after U.S. warplanes bombed Taliban positions in Sheberghan. “U.S. forces have conducted several air strikes in defence of our Afghan partners in recent days,” Major Nicole Ferrara, a Central Command spokesperson, said. Sheberghan is the stronghold of Afghan warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, whose militiamen and government forces were reportedly retreating east to Mazar-i-Sharif in Balkh province. Mr. Dostum has overseen one of the largest militias in the north and garnered a fearsome reputation fighting the Taliban in the 1990s — along with accusations his forces massacred thousands of insurgent prisoners of war. Thousands displaced A retreat of his fighters dents the government’s recent hopes that militias could help the overstretched military. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have been displaced by the recent fighting, and on Saturday, 12 people were killed when their bus was struck by a roadside bomb as they tried to flee Gardez in Paktia province.“ I lost my mother, father, two brothers, two sisters-in-law and other members of the family,” said Noor Jan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-forces-fighting-to-retake-cities-govt/article35806514.ece
09 August 2021||Yangon,||Myanmar protesters mark 1988 uprising anniversary||Myanmar protesters on Sunday marked the anniversary of a 1988 pro-democracy uprising that brought Aung San Suu Kyi to prominence, with flash mobs and marches of defiance against the ruling junta. The country has been in turmoil since the generals launched their February putsch and subsequent crackdown on dissent that has killed more than 900 people, according to a local monitoring group. But protesters remain undeterred, taking to the streets daily in lightning-quick rallies to demand the end to the State Administration Council — as the junta’s so-called “caretaker” government has dubbed itself. On Sunday, flash mobs popped up across Yangon and second city Mandalay to commemorate the 1988 uprising — a pro-democracy movement which the military violently quelled by opening fire on protesters and jailing thousands. Following the calls of an online campaign, red-clad protesters on Sunday flashed an eight-finger salute and carried banners that read “Let’s return the old blood debt of 1988 in 2021.” “In 1988, our country sacrificed a lot — many people lost their lives. But the dictatorship is still alive,” said Ko Sai Win, in Mandalay. “It is like a black shadow on our country.” The 1988 uprising heralded the rise of Ms. Suu Kyi, who had returned to Myanmar just before protests kicked off to care for her ailing mother.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-protesters-mark-1988-uprising-anniversary/article35806509.ece
09 August 2021||Beirut,||Will respond to Israel strike: Hezbollah||The head of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, on Saturday vowed a “suitable and proportionate” response to any Israeli air strikes on Lebanon after a flare-up at the border this week. Israel carried out its first air raids on Lebanese soil in years on Thursday, prompting Hezbollah to fire rockets back at the Jewish state the following day. “Our response was linked to the Israeli strikes that occurred in south Lebanon for the first time in 15 years,” he said in a televised speech ahead of the anniversary of the end of the last war with Israel in 2006. “We wanted to tell the enemy... that any air strike by the Israeli air force on Lebanon will inevitably draw a response, though in a suitable and proportionate way, because we want to serve the purpose of protecting our country,” he added. Nasrallah described the air strikes this week as a “very dangerous development”, but said Hezbollah did not want war. “We are not looking for war and we do not want to head towards war, but we are ready for it” if necessary, he said, echoing similar comments by the Jewish state this week. Before Thursday, Israel’s last air strikes on Lebanon dated back to 2014, when warplanes struck territory near the Syrian border. Hezbollah’s volley of rockets at Israeli positions on Friday morning prompted retaliatory shelling from Israel, prompting UN peacekeepers to warn of “a very dangerous situation”. U.S. on Friday urged Lebanon’s government to prevent Hezbollah from firing rockets into Israel. The 33-day conflict in the summer of 2006 killed 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hezbollah-will-respond-to-israel-strike/article35806506.ece

The one in the north is driven by blasts of wind to the beach settlements,” he added. In all, 17 firefighting aircraft — planes and helicopters — were fighting the fires on Evia, he added. Evia lies just northeast of the capital Athens. To the southwest is the Peloponnese region where Hardalias said the situation was stable. Fires in a northern suburb of Athens have subsided, the Minister added. “The situation in Attica (which encompasses Athens) is better but we are afraid of the danger of flare-ups”, said Mr. Hardalias. Greece and Turkey have been battling devastating fires for nearly two weeks as the region suffered its worst heatwave in decades, which experts have linked to climate change. So far, the fires have killed two people in Greece and eight in neighbouring Turkey, with dozens more hospitalised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hundreds-flee-homes-destroyed-as-wildfires-ravage-greek-island/article35806507.ece

The death has sparked widespread anger on social media and among children’s rights activists. A petition to the police commissioner has attracted nearly 58,000 signatures since it was launched on Thursday. Police at the weekend said they had opened an investigation into the death, which occurred last month. In a statement on Saturday, the United Nations said it “notes with deep concern and condemns strongly the surrounding circumstances leading to the untimely death of 14-year-old Memory Machaya... who died while giving birth at an apostolic sect shrine. “Sadly, disturbing reports of the sexual exploitation of underage girls, including early forced marriages, continue to surface and this is indeed another sad case,” the agency added. The UN said the trend of cases of violence perpetrated against women and girls in Zimbabwe, “including marriages of minors, cannot continue with impunity.” Official statistics show that one in three Zimbabwean girls are married off before the age of 18. Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda, head of Rozaria Memorial Trust, a Zimbabwean charity fighting the practice of child marriages, says that is an underestimation. “We saw the spike with COVID-19,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-slams-child-marriages-after-zimbabwean-teen-dies-in-labour/article35806516.ece

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||The looking glass of history in Afghanistan||Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985. By then Soviet forces had been in Afghanistan for over five years. They had failed to successfully combat the mujahideen groups, most of whom were based in Pakistan. The mujahideen received crucial support from the United States but the critical factor was their Pakistan base. Secure with the U.S. fully behind it, Pakistan knew that the Soviet Union would not risk crossing the Durand Line to take armed action on Pakistani territory. In his insightful book, The Great Game in Afghanistan: Rajiv Gandhi, General Zia and the Unending War, Kallol Bhattacherjee records that immediately after becoming the Soviet Union’s supreme leader, Mr. Gorbachev had met the Pakistani dictator in Moscow. He had warned him that “Moscow would ensure that Pakistan faces the consequences of backing the mujahideen”. Zia was unfazed by the threat because he knew that the new Soviet leader was posturing. From the USSR to the U.S. Thirty-two years later, the wheel of history had turned. It was the United States which was bogged down in Afghanistan. For 16 years it had, despite a military surge, failed to quell the Taliban insurgency even though the group merely had the support of Pakistan. The reason for the U.S.’s failure was no different from that of the Soviets. It could not carry the war into the territory of Pakistan, now armed with nuclear weapons; destabilising such a state would have incalculable consequences. Now, a new U.S. leader, President Donald Trump announcing his Afghanistan policy in August 2017, said, “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbo[u]r criminals and terrorists (https://bit.ly/3fIgiLP).” He followed this with a tweet on new year’s day 2018 accusing Pakistan of “lies and deceit”. For sometime, the Pakistani leadership was concerned by the mercurial Trump but then realised that his were empty threats, signs of the U.S.’s frustration. It continued with its Afghan policy as before. A thread in these approaches Within a year of taking over, Mr. Gorbachev was convinced that the Soviet Union’s Afghan quest was futile. In February 1986 he told the Communist Party that Afghanistan had become a “bleeding wound”. He now decided to prepare for the retreat of the Soviet forces. His aim was to have an orderly withdrawal. He also abandoned the idea of leaving behind a “socialist” government and sought to have a broad-based one which would include the mujahideen. Fourteen months after warning Pakistan of serious consequences in his August 2017 policy announcement, Mr. Trump too caved in and authorised talks between U.S. diplomats and Taliban representatives in Doha. In these talks, the U.S.’s principal objective was to secure a Taliban guarantee that it would not harbour international terrorist groups in territories under its control. And, like the Soviet Union over three decades ago the U.S. too accepted the idea of an Afghan interim administration which included the Taliban. The February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement (https://bit.ly/3xw1yFG), which Mr. Trump’s successor President Joe Biden has honoured, marked the strategic defeat of the world’s pre-eminent global power. It was reminiscent of the Geneva Accords of 1988 which were a strategic defeat of a then superpower, the Soviet Union. They both paved the way for the safe withdrawal of foreign forces. From 1986 to 1988, the Soviets tried hard to put in place an inclusive government in Afghanistan. Najibullah, a forceful if brutal Afghan leader of Pashtun ethnicity, became President in 1986. He virtually abandoned communist ideology for Afghan nationalism and stressed the country’s Islamic heritage. He reached out to all sections of Afghan society. The U.S. and Pakistan seemed to go along with the idea of an inclusive government as long as the final assurance of Soviet withdrawal was not gained. The Indian initiative Significantly, India too advocated a broad-based government and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was in the forefront in advocating it. India took active measures, including contacting the former King Zahir Shah, living in exile in Rome, to lead it. This annoyed the U.S. and Pakistan. Both wanted India to assume a non-operational position on Afghan developments and restrict its role to pressing the Soviets to leave. Once it became clear that Pakistan wanted a mujahideen government without Najibullah’s participation or Zahir Shah’s leadership, India decided to fully support the Najibullah government. This even before the last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan in February 1989. As part of its outreach to all Afghan parties in 1987 and 1988, India was also in contact with the mujahideen. In February 1988, Rajiv Gandhi met Peter Galbraith, a staffer with the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and whom he had known from his youth. Mr. Bhattacherjee records, “To Galbraith’s surprise, Rajiv said that India had reached out to all sections, including the mujahideen inside Pakistan and Afghanistan and was now assessing the entire formula for a broad-based government in Kabul”. This shows that Rajiv Gandhi pursued the requirements of realpolitik: even while firmly supporting Najibullah he was not averse to acknowledge, at the highest political level, that if Indian interests demanded so, India would not hesitate to do business with any Afghan group howsoever regressive its ideology. India’s 2021 Afghan dilemma mirrors, to an extent, the one it faced post the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. There is a major difference though. In 1989, Kabul was led by a strong Afghan leader, Najibullah, who had the capacity to hold the situation together with Soviet assistance. That was forthcoming, for while the Geneva Accords provided that neither side would help their protégés, they continued to do so. Thus, for three years, Najibullah kept the mujahideen at bay. It was with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the political unity of Kabul frayed. With that the army fragmented, paving the way for the mujahideen to take over in April 1992. Soon enough, intra-mujahideen conflict resulted in complete instability in the country. That set the stage for the rise of the Taliban with Pakistani assistance. The internecine mujahideen hostilities, fortunately, provided India strategic opportunities to influence the ground situation in Afghanistan along with Iran and Russia. But fortune does not smile at all times. Afghanistan today Now, like Rajiv Gandhi in the 1986-1988 period, Indian foreign policy and security managers are advocating the formation of an inclusive government. So, ostensibly are the western powers including the U.S. The problem is that Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani is no Najibullah. His capacity to hold Kabul together is questionable. Besides, the Kabul political elite is at odds with itself and if it frays, will the Afghan National Security Forces remain united? The extent to which the U.S. will be willing to support Kabul post August 31 (the date of complete withdrawal) remains to be seen. This situation of total flux could have been easily foreseen. Equally, the need for maintaining open and direct contacts with all Afghan political parties could also have been anticipated only if pragmatic and correct strategic attitudes had guided Indian policy. Notwithstanding all the appropriate diplomatic noises India may make, it has now no real capacity to impact the ground situation in Afghanistan. And, even if the best option for India comes to pass — the formation of an inclusive government — its absence of open contacts with the Taliban will place it at a great disadvantage.

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||The sovereign right to tax is not absolute||An important bill introduced in Parliament last week aims to nullify the regressive 2012 amendment in the Income Tax Act. The 2012 amendment overturned the Supreme Court’s decision in Vodafone International Holdings v. Union of India and made the income tax law retroactively applicable on indirect transfer of Indian assets. The retroactive amendment resulted in Vodafone and Cairn Energy suing India before Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) tribunals of India-Netherlands and India-U.K. bilateral investment treaties (BITs). Both the tribunals held that India’s retroactive amendment of tax laws breached the fair and equitable treatment provision of the two BITs. The proposed amendment, long overdue, is a welcome development. However, it is being presented as a domestic legal reform undoing a past mistake. It appears that this amendment hasn’t been proposed to comply with the two adverse ISDS decisions rendered against India or to comply with India’s international law obligations contained in BITs. This is because there is an erroneous belief in the bureaucratic and political circles that since taxation matters are part of sovereign measures, they cannot be challenged before ISDS tribunals. Sovereign right to tax Several ISDS tribunals have recognised the fundamental principle that taxation is an intrinsic element of the state’s sovereign power. For instance, in a case known as Eiser v. Spain , where foreign investors challenged a tax imposed by Spain on electrical producers under the Energy Charter Treaty, the tribunal held that the power to tax is a core sovereign power of the state that should not be questioned lightly. Likewise, in El Paso v. Argentina , where the investors challenged several facets of Argentinian tax measures as breaching the United States-Argentina BIT, the tribunal held that the tax policy of a country is a matter relating to the sovereign power of the state, and thus “the State has a sovereign right to enact the tax measures it deems appropriate at any particular time”. Not just this, the ISDS tribunals have also held that whenever a foreign investor challenges states’ taxation measures, there is a presumption that the taxation measures are valid and legal. For instance, an ISDS tribunal in Renta 4 v. Russia said that when it comes to examining taxation measures for BIT breaches, the starting point should be that the taxation measures are a bona fide exercise of the state’s public powers. Limits on the right Notwithstanding the state’s sovereign right to impose taxes and the presumption about the validity of taxation measures, there are certain limits on the exercise of this public power. The two most used BIT provisions to challenge a state’s taxation measures are expropriation and the fair and equitable treatment provision. In the context of expropriation, one of the key ISDS cases that explained the limits on the state’s right to tax is Burlington v. Ecuador . In this dispute, investors challenged Ecuador’s windfall tax imposed on excess profits resulting from oil exploration under the United States-Ecuador BIT. The tribunal held that under customary international law, there are two limits on the state’s right to tax. First, the tax should not be discriminatory; second, it should not be confiscatory. In another ISDS case, EnCana v, Ecuador , a Canadian corporation sued Ecuador for value-added taxes under the Canada-Ecuador BIT. The tribunal held that a state’s tax measures would amount to an expropriation of foreign investment if the tax law is extraordinary, punitive in amount, or arbitrary in incidence. In the context of the fair and equitable treatment provision, foreign investors have often challenged taxation measures as breaching legal certainty, which is an element of the fair and equitable treatment provision. Although legal certainty does not mean immutability of legal framework, states are under an obligation to carry out legal changes such as amending their tax laws in a reasonable and proportionate manner. The tribunal in Cairn Energy v. India said that taxing indirect transfers is India’s sovereign power and the tribunal would not comment on it. However, such matters are not of “absolute, unquestioning deference and there are limits on it”. Thus, India’s right to tax in the public interest should be balanced with the investor’s interest of legal certainty. In the context of amending tax laws retroactively, such an action should be justified by a specific purpose that could not be accomplished by applying taxes prospectively. The tribunal held that the public purpose that justifies the application of law prospectively will usually be insufficient to justify the retroactive application of the law. There must be an additional public purpose to justify the retroactive application of the law. For example, India argued that the 2012 amendment was to ensure that foreign corporations who use tax havens for the indirect transfers of underlying Indian assets pay taxes. However, the tribunal held that this objective could be achieved by amending the income tax law prospectively, not retroactively. It is critical to bear in mind that the tribunal did not rule against retroactivity of tax laws per se but against the retroactive application that lacked public policy justification. Carving out taxation measures India in its 2016 Model BIT carved out taxation measures completely from the scope of the investment treaty. Nonetheless, carving out taxation measures from the scope of the BIT does not mean that states are free to do as they please. As it was held in Yukos Universal v. Russia , if states act in bad faith towards foreign investors or abuse their right to tax or adopt mala fide taxation measures, they won’t be able to take the benefit of the carve-out provision. The biggest takeaway from this nine-year-long sordid episode of retrospective taxation is that India should exercise its right to regulate while being mindful of its international law obligations, acting in good faith and in a proportionate manner. ISDS tribunals do not interfere with such regulatory measures. In sum, the debate never was whether India has a sovereign right to tax, but whether this sovereign right is subject to certain limitations. The answer is an emphatic ‘yes’ because under international law the sovereign right to tax is not absolute. Prabhash Ranjan will soon join Jindal Global Law School, O P Jindal Global University as professor and vice dean.

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Revisit the idea of ‘aging out’ India’s coal plants||As part of the Union Budget address for 2020-21, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said that the shutting down of old coal power plants, which are major contributors to emissions, will aid the achievement of India’s Nationally Determined Contributions, an idea which has been endorsed by the Power Minister, R.K. Singh (https://bit.ly/3jQnQxl). Some studies cite advantages Some research studies have also argued in favour of it, citing the economic and the environmental benefits of shutting down coal plants older than, say, 25 years. It is argued that the availability of under-utilised newer (and presumably more efficient) coal-based capacity means that shutting down older inefficient plants would lead to improved efficiencies, reduced coal usage, and hence, cost savings. Further, it is argued that it would be uneconomical for old plants to install pollution control equipment required to meet the emission standards announced by the Environment Ministry, and hence it would be better to retire them. The recent order from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) allowing Delhi’s BSES distribution company to exit its concluded 25 year old power purchase agreement with the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited’s Dadri-I generating station, also lends some credence to this (https://bit.ly/3lJymZQ). Since plants older than 25 years make up around 20% of the total installed thermal capacity in the country and play a significant role in the country’s power supply, decisions regarding their retirement merit finer scrutiny to see if the claimed benefits really accrue. The benefits How significant are the potential benefits? While there are some old plants tied up in expensive power purchase agreements, as in the case of the CERC order, there are also several old plants, which generate at lower costs. For instance, plants such as Rihand, Singrauli (both Uttar Pradesh), and Vidhyanchal (Madhya Pradesh), are all over 30 years old and have very low generation costs of around Rs. 1.7/kWh, which is lower than the national average. This may be due to locational advantage rather than efficiency, as older plants are likely to be located closer to the coal source, reducing coal transport costs. However, this just highlights the complexity of the issue, since efficiency does not naturally translate to savings. A savings analysis Indeed, our analysis (https://bit.ly/3jDat3a) suggests that the total savings in generation cost from shutting down plants older than 25 years would be less than Rs. 5,000 crore annually, which is just 2% of the total power generation cost. These savings may not be sufficient to even pay for the fixed costs (such as debt repayment) that would have to be paid anyway, even if the plants are prematurely retired. Similarly, savings in coal consumption by replacing generation from plants older than 25 years with newer coal plants are also likely to be only in the 1%-2% range. The argument about older plants finding it uneconomical to install pollution control equipment to meet environmental norms is a stronger one, as all coal plants should indeed reduce emissions. However, even here, the argument is not black-and-white. There are some old plants that may continue to be economically viable even if they install pollution control equipment as their current fixed costs (which would increase with pollution control equipment installation) are very low. Indeed, about half the coal capacity older than 25 years has already issued tenders for pollution control equipment installation. Risks with retirement The question then becomes whether these limited savings are worth the risks associated with early retirement of coal plants, especially given the current trends in the country’s power sector. To support the growing intermittent renewable generation in the sector, there is an increasing need for capacity that can provide flexibility, balancing, and ancillary services. Old thermal capacity, with lower fixed costs, is a prime candidate to play this role until other technologies (such as storage) can replace them at scale. Further, the capacity value of the old capacity is critical to meet instantaneous peak load, and to meet load when renewable energy is unavailable. There is also a political economy risk, as aggressive early retirement of coal-based capacity, without detailed analyses, could result in real or perceived electricity shortage in some States, leading to calls for investments in coal-based base-load capacity by State-owned entities. About 65 gigawatts (GW) of thermal capacity is already in the pipeline, of which about 35 GW is in various stages of construction. This is likely in excess of what the country needs, and further addition to it, driven by State political economy considerations, will lead to stranded assets and locked-in resources. This is not to say that no old plant should be retired. However, using age as the only lever to drive these decisions is too blunt an instrument, and can prove counter-productive. Instead, a more disaggregated and nuanced analysis, considering the various technical, economic and operating characteristics of individual plants and units, while also accounting for aspects such as intermittency of renewables, growing demand, and need to meet emission norms, would be appropriate to make retirement-related decisions. Hence, it may be prudent to let old capacity fade away in due course, while focusing on such detailed analysis and weeding out the needless capacity in the pipeline, to derive long-term economic and environmental benefits.

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Recusal of a Readers’ Editor||In the judiciary, judges sometimes recuse themselves from hearing cases listed before them. The reason for their recusal is either conflict of interest or prior association with one of the parties involved in the case. It must be kept in mind that there are no written rules on the recusal of judges from hearing cases listed before them. Judges use their discretion in making the decision of whether or not to hear the case. As the Readers’ Editor of this newspaper, I have often wondered what would be the case from which I would recuse myself. The individual views of journalists I have participated in protests defending freedom of expression and the rights of journalists to perform their work without fear of intimidation. I have been part of teams that defended democratic rights, raised voices against jingoism, and supported the idea of pluralism. I am aware of editors and media managers who are wary of journalists expressing their views publicly. On the other hand, there are also editors who have taken the view that individual views, as long as they conform to the foundations of ethical journalism, should not be curbed. The Society of Professional Journalists has distilled journalistic ethics to four operational principles: seek truth and report it, minimise harm, act independently, and be accountable and transparent. In the case of public media organisations such as the NPR of the U.S. or the BBC of the U.K., the rules for public engagement and demonstrations are more stringent but layered. For instance, the BBC makes it clear that accuracy, evidence, facts, transparency and informed judgments are constituent parts of an impartial approach. The NPR, which started as a national radio but has now transformed into an important news media organisation across multiple platforms, tweaked its long-standing policy last month. Its new ethics policy, which was unveiled on July 7, has given more elbow room for journalists to express their personal opinions on a range of issues. The policy, in part, reads: “NPR editorial staff may express support for democratic, civic values that are core to NPR’s work, such as, but not limited to: the freedom and dignity of human beings, the rights of a free and independent press, the right to thrive in society without facing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, disability, or religion.” NPR’s policy has already become a subject of debate. The public media organisation has been a witness to some of the defining developments in the U.S. such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the Pride parade. NPR’s chief diversity officer Keith Woods explained the factors that led to the changes. While he agreed that it is important for journalists to keep many of their personal views private, he also argued that “there are things in the world where we are not torn about where we stand. We are against bigotry, we are against discrimination and unfairness.” NPR Public Editor Kelly McBride said the recent policy “confronts the generations-old question in newsrooms: Where does the journalist end and the citizen begin?” NPR lists its guiding principles: “honesty, integrity, independence, accuracy, contextual truth, transparency, respect and fairness”. It adds a new reference to its “democratic role as watchdogs”. NPR also has a section on universal values such as human rights, a free press, anti-discrimination and anti-bigotry. The question that haunts Ms. McBride is the one that forces me to retain my ambivalence. She asked: “What if a journalist wants to picket an abortion clinic or demonstrate in support of women’s autonomy over their bodies? What about a journalist who wants to express her general support of the Second Amendment?” The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms”. A blurred line In the Indian context, the line that divides the professional creed of a journalist from her democratic anxiety as a citizen is getting blurred by the day due to executive excesses. When institutions that are supposed to provide checks and balances become an extension of the executive or an apology for it, is it fair to expect journalists not to express their anguish as citizens? When constitutionally guaranteed rights are abrogated, and bills are pushed through without any discussion in Parliament, silence becomes an unbearable burden. As the Readers’ Editor, I would recuse myself from hearing any case that asks me to draw the line that divides journalism from citizenry. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/recusal-of-a-readers-editor/article35806501.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||The many hurdles for students||Students from China and India accounted for 47% of all active foreign students in the U.S. in 2020, as per the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme, part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Indian students comprised the second largest student community in the U.K. and Australia in 2019-2020. In recent years, Canada has emerged as a sought-after destination for Indian students. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the Donald Trump administration’s restrictive student visa policies was Canada. Indian students are now the largest group within the international student community in Canada. But in spite of their role in enhancing India’s soft power internationally, through their excellent academic performance as well as seamless integration into these countries, Indian students face several problems. These are often overlooked. However, in recent years Indian student associations have been trying to draw attention to these concerns. Three major challenges Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian students already studying overseas as well as those seeking to go abroad have faced several challenges. First, most Indian students were forced to delay their plans in 2020 due to the imposition of lockdowns, disruption of flights, and embassies not issuing student visas. This led to a drop in the number of Indian students going abroad to study in 2020. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, while in 2019 nearly 5.9 lakh students went overseas for higher education, in 2020 only 2.6 lakh were able to go. While the first two months of 2021 saw 72,000 students going overseas, the devastating second wave impacted the career plans of students. This is not to say that the enthusiasm to go overseas has waned; embassies and high commissions are unable to deal with the backlog of applications. Furthermore, many countries have closed their borders and/or restricted flights from India. As a result, students have to look for circuitous routes and end up paying higher air fares. While students are able to make it to Canada through expensive and indirect routes right now, Australia is likely to keep its borders closed well into 2022 given the surge in cases there. The U.K. and the U.S. have tried to make exceptions to their rules for international students, but there remain a number of rules and regulations which have made it very cumbersome to enter these countries, if not impossible. The second problem is that of vaccination. As universities abroad open up for international students and begin allowing in-person classes from fall 2021, many require students to get vaccinated before they go. Covaxin and Sputnik V are yet to be recognised by the World Health Organization. Countries like the U.S. do not accept students who have been inoculated with these vaccines and have told them to get re-vaccinated. Many students who have been vaccinated with Covishield are waiting for the 12-week gap to pass in order to get their second dose. To help them, States which send a large number of students abroad have prioritised vaccines for international students. Third, due to the disruption caused by COVID-19, students overseas are finding it difficult to get jobs. Addressing issues In a post-COVID-19 world, there are likely to be numerous disruptions, but it is important for officials and universities to work jointly to address the challenges which overseas Indian students face. It is impossible to predict when things will get back to normal and when logistical issues relating to Indian students seeking to study overseas will be addressed. While there are certain issues which specifically impact students, there are others such as policies pertaining to air travel and recognition of Covaxin which need to be addressed at the earliest to facilitate smooth travel for tourists seeking to go overseas.

09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Golden arm||India took on a golden glow at Tokyo on Saturday as Neeraj Chopra hurled the javelin to fetch the country its first Olympics gold in track and field. Neeraj’s winning effort at 87.58m capped the finest ever performance by Indian sportspersons in the quadrennial global stage. India won seven medals — one gold, two silvers and four bronzes — and cumulatively edged past the previous best of six at the 2012 London Games. For a country resigned to a meagre yield or none at the Olympics since its debut in 1900, the latest edition was laden with riches. At 23, Neeraj has the world at his feet and the skies to aim for. The Indian Army man has grown in stature, and to supplant German Johannes Vetter, until now the world’s best javelin thrower, was no mean task. Neeraj’s golden tryst was special at many levels; it was India’s maiden gold in athletics at the Olympics while Norman Pritchard had won two silvers in 1900. It was also India’s second individual gold at the Games after shooter Abhinav Bindra hit bullseye at Beijing in 2008. That Neeraj had previously won golds in the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games are all pointers to a journey that is on cruise-mode while his coach Klaus Bartonietz keeps a close watch. Neeraj’s dash of magic seasoned in sweat and muscle, found mirror-images within the Indian contingent. Wrestler Bajrang Punia won bronze in the men’s freestyle 65kg bout, pinning down Kazakhstan’s Daulet Niyazbekov. It also bolstered India’s medals’ kitty that had prior contributions from Mirabai Chanu, Lovlina Borgohain, Ravi Kumar Dahiya, P.V. Sindhu and the men’s hockey team. What stood out was the Indian contingent’s belief that they can compete on level terms with their fancied rivals. It showed in Aditi Ashok’s golfing endeavour as she came tantalisingly close to silver before a rain-marred day out at the greens undid her rhythm and the Bangalorean finished at the fourth spot. When the curtains were lowered on the latest Olympics on Sunday, the India-story was largely driven by Neeraj, hockey-renaissance and women-power while shooting proved under-whelming. Among the rest, it was status quo as the United States of America and China led the medals tally with host Japan and Great Britain following while India was placed 48th in the table. Usain Bolt’s stardust was missed but Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah added zest while setting a new Olympic record of 10.61 seconds in the women’s 100m sprint. The pandemic delayed the Games by a year but it marches on unhindered while the fans look forward to the 2024 version at Paris.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/golden-arm/article35806487.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Tightrope walk||Governor Shaktikanta Das’s statement accompanying the RBI’s latest policy announcement highlights the bind that monetary authorities find themselves in. While the central bank’s growth supportive actions — maintaining the benchmark interest rate at a decade low, ensuring ample liquidity and an accommodative policy stance — are yet to help engender a meaningful recovery, inflation continues to disquietingly hover around the 6% upper bound of its mandated target. Governor Das acknowledged the RBI’s predicament when he said: “Before the onset of the pandemic, headline inflation and inflationary expectations were well anchored at 4%, the gains from which need to be consolidated and preserved. Stability in inflation rate fosters credibility of the monetary policy framework and augurs well for anchoring inflation expectations. This, in turn, reduces uncertainty for investors... increases external competitiveness and, thus, is growth-promoting.” It is this vital inflation targeting remit that the Monetary Policy Committee has temporarily set aside in the wake of COVID-19 and its brutal impact, while the central bank focuses its efforts on using all available policy tools to simultaneously preserve financial stability and support a durable economic revival. Still, the central bank’s outlook for growth and inflation shows it is cognisant of the ground realities and the limits to its policy options. Asserting that domestic economic activity has started to recover with the ‘ebbing of the second wave’, the MPC is hopeful of a bounce back in rural demand on the back of agricultural output remaining resilient, coupled with urban consumption recovering as the manufacturing and service sectors rebound with a lag, and as increased vaccinations help release pent-up demand. However, given that underlying conditions are still weak and the Current Situation Index of consumer confidence in its own July survey is still stuck near the all-time low polled in May, the RBI has retained its full-year GDP growth forecast at 9.5%. The fact that it has at the same time lowered the Q2, Q3 and Q4 growth projections it made just two months ago, by between 0.5 and 0.9 percentage points, belies the uncertainty in its outlook. With the monsoon rainfall deficit once again widening to minus 4% as on August 8, latest kharif sowing estimates revealing an almost 23% shortfall and composite PMI data for July showing a persistent contraction in business activity and continuing job losses, it is hard to see either a near-term revival in demand or an easing in inflationary pressures from cereal and edible oil prices. Admitting the price pressures, the RBI has also raised its fiscal-year inflation projection by 60 basis points to 5.7%. Also, with one of the six members of the MPC dissenting and voting against the language of the policy stance, it seems clear the central bank may sooner than later have to bite the bullet and start normalising rates if it wants to avoid undermining its own credibility by delaying steps to rein in inflation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tightrope-walk/article35806488.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Site where Socrates was sentenced||A team of American archaeologists has completed piecing together the site where Socrates stood trial and was sentenced to death in Athens 24 centuries ago [Athens, August 8]. The site is the royal stoa, or arcade, which according to ancient writers was Athens’ seat of religious and judicial affairs. It was discovered and unearthed in the western corner of the agora (market) at the foothill of the Acropolis by a group of American archaeologists under Professor Theo-dore Shears Jr. of Princeton University. The stoa was a covered colonade, about 20 metres long. It was part of the marketplace and civic pulse of ancient Athenian life, a centre of public services, business establishments and gossip. In 399 B.C. it provided the site for the trial of the famous philosopher Socrates, found guilty of “corrupting youth and refusing to worship Gods.” Socrates boldly reiterated his beliefs before his judges, and was sentenced to drink a cup of poisonous hemlock. His last hours were spent discussing the immortality of the soul with a group of his disciples. “It is thrilling for an archaeologist to sit on the benches near the north wall of the stoa — where the Athenian judges sat and where such well-known and notorious events have taken place,” Prof. Shears said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/site-where-socrates-was-sentenced/article35806499.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||When expectation does not match reality||Many disappointments with insurance policies are a result of expectation and reality. But here’s the thing. All the clauses, the ifs and buts, in your policy are available for you to read before you buy. You just have to ask your agent for a policy schedule and see what clauses apply to you depending on the options you choose. In a typical motor insurance claim, for example, your cost of repairs/ spares/ replacement will not be given in full. The cost of plastic and fibre-glass parts will be adjusted for depreciation, and these rates will be stated right there in your policy. Depreciation will also apply on the entire claim depending on the age of the vehicle and can go up to 50%. You can usually purchase additional cover for the depreciation. Compulsory excess These days most policies come with a compulsory excess, also called a compulsory deductible. This is a specified flat amount, the first part of the claim that you have to bear yourself. In addition to this, you can opt for a voluntary excess or voluntary deductible and you will get a discount in your premium. In health insurance, there can be an excess and there can also be a co-pay. This will be a percentage of each claim that you have to bear, as different from a flat sum. Considering that the larger your claim, the larger your co-pay, it is worth being aware of this well ahead of time, before you sign up. Once you know you have to to look for these so-called small-print clauses, you can shop around for your policy with other insurance providers whose terms suit you better. Or, at the least, you will go in with your eyes wide open.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/when-expectation-does-not-match-reality/article35806486.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Ask Us August 1||Q.I am a software engineer, aged 29. My monthly salary is Rs. 1 lakh. Currently, I invest in EPF and in an LIC policy. I am not sure where else to invest to get financial relief after 15 years. Please give me suggestions. R. Muthuraja A.There are a number of investment options that you can consider beyond your EPF and LIC policy. If you are considering investments for a 15-year horizon, you can either invest in instruments with a shorter term and reinvest the proceeds on maturity or choose vehicles that you can hold for 15 years. If you prefer a safe investment with fixed returns, the Public Provident Fund, which is a retirement savings vehicle with a 15-year term, may be your ideal choice. You can open a PPF account with any post office branch or leading bank and make regular investments in the account. The interest on the PPF, which is declared every quarter, usually tends to be much higher than that on bank deposits and is also tax-free. The interest is credited to your balance every year and compounds until you seek to withdraw the money. You can also open an NPS account where you can make monthly investments towards retirement in market-linked instruments such as shares and bonds. For shorter horizons, you can consider the 5-year National Savings Certificate (NSC) where your interest compounds until maturity, or the Kisan Vikas Patra which doubles your money in 10 years and four months, too. You can also consider parking your periodic surpluses in the Government of India’s 7-year floating rate savings bonds where the interest rate offered is 35 basis points above the NSC and is announced every half year. The only ‘minus’ for these bonds is that the interest is paid out to you, requiring you to reinvest it. Cumulative term deposits with banks or leading NBFCs, which accrue fixed interest every year, is another option, though less safe than post office schemes. If you don’t mind volatility in your returns in the short run and are sure you won’t be needing your money within the next 5-7 years, you can invest in hybrid or index equity funds through monthly instalments (called Systematic Investment Plans or SIPs). While such funds offer anytime liquidity, their returns can be quite volatile depending on how bond and stock markets move. This entitles you to dividends from the company and share-price appreciation, if any, when you sell the share. With both mutual funds and shares, you can hold on for as long as you like, but also exit if you should need the money at any time. You face the risk of loss in your capital over shorter time frames, but if you hold on for more than 7 years, they can generate inflation-beating returns that are better than fixed deposits or bonds. Before making a start on these investments which require you to lock in your money for long periods though, do build up a bank deposit equal to about 6-9 months’ worth of your living expenses, as an emergency fund. Do buy a health insurance plan, so that your savings aren’t dented badly by a medical emergency. Q.I am a 24-year-old graduate. I have been offered a job at a private sector bank with an annual CTC of about Rs. 15 lakh. I need your advice on investments. D. Suzann A.There are three things to keep in mind as you begin your investing journey. One, to invest effectively and to stick to your planned course on investments, it would be good to write down your key financial goals and the timelines over which you would like to achieve them. For example, you may plan to travel, buy a vehicle or pursue higher education within the next three years, marry or buy a home over 5 to 7 years, nurture dreams of becoming wealthy or retiring early 10-20 years hence. If you have family members for whom you’d like to do something, include those objectives in your goals too. Mapping out your goals is important because they lend purpose to your savings and investments and helps you to choose investment vehicles that fit your goal and investment horizon. For goals up to 5 years, bank and NBFC deposits can be a good option. So can short-term debt, PSU and banking debt mutual funds. For 5 to 7-year goals, small savings schemes like NSC and GOI floating rate savings bonds would be a good bet. You can also consider hybrid mutual funds. For goals that are 7 years plus, Public Provident Fund, NPS and index mutual funds playing on the Nifty50 or Nifty Next50 would make for good choices. Two, before you start making the above investments, estimate your likely monthly living expenses and build a fund equal to 6-9 months’ worth of those expenses from your initial savings. It can help you tide over illness, job loss or other emergencies that require quick money. In addition, do buy a health insurance policy of Rs. 5-10 lakh to cover hospitalisation expenses. If you have parents or siblings dependent on you, get a term- insurance policy so that their financial interests are taken care of in the event of an unfortunate event happening to you. Three, get into the habit of saving before spending each month. Signing up for investment products that put your investments on autopilot, by channelling money out of your salary account at the beginning of each month, can help you get into a regular savings habit. Recurring deposits and Systematic Investment Plans of mutual funds are two good ways to do this. Strive to save a minimum 15-20% of your monthly pay towards investments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ask-us-august-1/article35806484.ece
09 August 2021||Chennai,||Shahrukh seals Kovai Kings playoffs spot||M. Shahrukh Khan led from the front with a brilliant unbeaten 64 off 29 balls (5x4, 5x6) to set up a seven-run win for Lyca Kovai Kings over Nellai Royal Kings and seal the final playoff berth in the Tamil Nadu Premier League match here on Sunday. Strong finish Electing to bat first, Shahrukh helped Kovai Kings come back strongly in the final five overs, scoring 69 runs, to post a score of 169/6. For the Royal Kings, the chase faltered in the middle overs with pacer V. Yudheeshwaran providing crucial breakthroughs. Needing 18 off the last over, top-scorer B. Indrajith (49 n.o.), could only manage 10 runs against Abhishek Tanwar. The pacer was brilliant in his final two overs and delivered three dot balls first up in the 20th over. The win ensured Kovai Kings pipped their opponents on Net Run Rate to progress to playoffs. Earlier, Kovai Kings started off well with V. Ganga Sridhar Raju continuing his good form as he took on left-arm spinner N.S. Harish. The diminutive left-hander played some glorious shots, be it using his feet to clear the off-side or slog-sweep over mid-wicket. Then skipper B. Aparajith got Royal Kings back into the game with three wickets including that of Raju and in the in-form Sai Suddarsan, with some clever variations of pace and length. Shahrukh walked in when his team was in a spot of bother at 76/4 in the 12th over. He first launched into Harish for a cover drive and a six straight down the ground before targeting the same areas for similar results against pacer Ashwath Mukunthan. In the last over, he swatted Ashwath around the park for two sixes and a four, to help finish the innings strongly that proved vital in the end. In the final league match, brilliant bowling by P. Saravana Kumar (3/24) and Nidhish Rajgopal’s unbeaten 66 helped Ruby Trichy Warriors beat Chepauk Super Gillies by seven wickets to finish on top of the table.  The scores:   Lyca Kovai Kings 169/6 in 20 overs (V. Ganga Sridhar Raju 30, J. Suresh Kumar 36, M. Shahrukh Khan 64 n.o., B. Aparajith 3/13) bt Nellai Royal Kings 162/8 in 20 overs (B. Aparajith 28, L. Suryapprakash 36, B. Indrajith 49 n.o., V. Yudheeshwaran 3/33, U. Mukilesh 2/6).   Chepauk Super Gillies 132 in 20 overs (S. Radhakrishnan 55, P. Saravana Kumar 3/24, Antony Dhas 2/23) lost to Ruby Trichy Warriors 136/3 in 19.1 overs (Nidhish Rajagopal 66 n.o., S. Santosh Shiv 25).

09 August 2021||Tokyo,||An unblemished show amidst intense scrutiny and raging pandemic||...and scene! The Tokyo Olympics, held during a raging pandemic, drew the curtains down on Sunday. The host nation finished third with 27 golds and a total of 58 medals, a vast improvement from its 12 golds and 41 medals in 2016. But it will take greater pride that its bio-bubble largely were intact. The Games were held under intense scrutiny and amid constant pressure from locals, but the organisers managed to pull off a clean show. Scores of people gathered around the Tokyo Olympic Stadium hours before the closing ceremony to witness the spectacle from the perimeters. Among the horde of people gathered in the narrow by-lane outside the stadium was Santosh from Pune, who has lived in Tokyo for three years. He brought his wife, and his child on a stroller, to watch the fireworks. But they were not able to catch a glimpse of Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia who carried the Indian flag for the closing ceremony. It was a carnival on the streets. People turned up in cosplay suits, one came in a Wonderwoman costume and was accompanied by an elderly citizen donning a Superman T-shirt. They were ready for a party but were confined to a morose evening on the sidewalks. The entry to the stadium was restricted to athletes, officials, VIP guests and members of the media. The policemen circling the stadium were watchful to sniff out any untoward incident. A group of stray cyclists took a wrong turn, and they were onto them in a split-second to redirect them. A few hundred protesters turned up with placards that read “Abolish Olympics” and “#GetOutBach”, but it ended peacefully. On the other side of the road, under the magnificent wooden roof of the stadium, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach thanked the Japanese authorities for their support. “These were unprecedented Olympic Games. It took us, the IOC and our Japanese partners and friends, an equally unprecedented effort to make them happen. This is why I would like to thank the Japanese authorities at all levels, in particular Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide and Governor Koike Yuriko, for their steadfast commitment. Thank you for staying with us on the side of the athletes, who were longing so much for these Olympic Games,” he said. Appreciation “Our deep gratitude and appreciation go to the organising committee. Nobody has ever organised a postponed Olympic Games before.” Tokyo, which will now host the Paralympic Games from August 24, officially handed the baton to Paris. And now we wait for three more years, in the hope that India, which won an unprecedented seven medals here, can script history yet again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/an-unblemished-show-amidst-intense-scrutiny-and-raging-pandemic/article35806720.ece

09 August 2021||Tokyo,||How Neeraj struck gold||Neeraj Chopra sits in a quiet space, imagines he’s walking into the Tokyo Olympics Stadium. He gets ready, makes his approach run and lets the javelin soar. The 23-year-old practised the art of visualisation and played this scenario in his mind for months leading up to the Tokyo Olympics. His focus in these sessions was purely on technique and not the outcome. On August 7, the outcome was an Olympics gold medal. He could barely sleep the night before the event. “I wanted to sleep early but couldn’t. I managed to sleep around 12:30 a.m. and I was wide awake by 5.30 a.m. I tried to sleep again because rest is essential for recovery, but I wasn’t able to. I had breakfast and tried again, but I was wide awake in an hour. Aisa lag raha tha ki mere shareer se aag nikal raha tha, aisa garam tha. Josh bahut tha (It felt like my body was radiating fire. I was very charged up).” Challenges aplenty There were challenges aplenty in the final stretch. For instance, getting the body and mind used to the seven-hour time difference between Tokyo and Sweden, where he trained for more than a month before the Olympics. “It took some time to get used to the time difference. I would sleep a little late, so, I was hoping to sleep longer in the mornings. But the doping control officers would show up at 5.45 a.m. or 6 a.m. for the past two days and whisk me away. Par maine haath jod ke request ki please 7 tareek ko itni jaldi mat aana (I requested them not to come this early on August 7),” he said with a smile. Neeraj’s coach Klaus Bartonietz said he never wanted the athlete to feel the pressure of winning the gold. The German’s last piece of advice to Neeraj was in Hindi: “ maje karo (have fun).” Klaus, a biomechanical expert, feels Neeraj’s biggest strength is athleticism and that sets him apart. While Neeraj is comparatively leaner and not as tall as his opponents, Klaus notes that his suppleness is a game-changer. “There are javelin throwers who are stronger, but don’t throw as far. You need to be like a bent bow, like a dhanush . You need to use body elasticity in your throws and not just brutal power.” Having harnessed all these striking physical attributes and mental fortitude for the Olympics, Neeraj basked in the glow of the gold on a memorable Tokyo night.  What a show, Neeraj! Dad waited so many years for this to happen. I am crying as I tweet this and I am sure dad is crying up above Jeev Milkha Singh||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/how-neeraj-struck-gold/article35806722.ece
09 August 2021||New Delhi,||Vikas undergoes shoulder surgery||Indian boxer Vikas Krishan, whose Olympic campaign ended abruptly after a dislocated right shoulder caused an opening-round loss, has undergone a surgery to fix the injury which will keep him out of action for the next three months. The 29-year-old, who was competing in his third Olympics, was forced out early after “fighting with one hand” in the opening clash against Japan’s Sewon Okazawa. The surgery on his dislocated shoulder was performed at Mumbai’s Kokilaben Hospital by renowned surgeon Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala, who operated and fixed a career-threatening shoulder injury that newly-crowned Olympic gold-winner Neeraj Chopra had suffered in 2019. Dr. Pardiwala has also operated top cricketers like Jasprit Bumrah and Shreyas Iyer along with shuttler Saina Nehwal, among others. “I will be back in three months, I have been assured by Dr. Pardiwala. My shoulder had dislocated and a crucial muscle, called Subscapularis, and a ligament had been torn,” the decorated boxer said after his surgery that took place on Thursday.  Vikas picked up the injury during the training trip to Italy before the Olympics. Unaware of the severity of the damage, he competed in the Olympics after taking painkilling injections. Dr. Pardiwala said given the scale of the injury, painkillers were never going to be enough. “It was quite valiant of him to have gone ahead and fought the bout,” Dr Pardiwala said. “He told me that he experienced a dead arm during the bout. It will take three weeks for the healing to be completed and another three months for rehab.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vikas-krishan-has-surgery/article35806762.ece
09 August 2021||Saitama,||The U.S. juggernaut rolls on||A rampant United States swept past Japan to their seventh straight women’s basketball crown on Sunday, with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi collecting their fifth Olympic gold medals to cap remarkable careers. Brittney Griner scored a game-high 30 points with five rebounds and two assists as the hosts were overpowered 90-75 by a team that stretched its Olympic win streak to 55 games dating back to the 1992 semifinals. Beating the Americans was always going to be a huge ask. They had won eight of the past nine Olympic titles. Their only blemishes in the history of the tournament were a silver behind the Soviet Union at the inaugural event in 1976 and bronze in 1992. The Americans’ seventh title equalled the longest ever streak by a team in any Olympic sport — matching the feat of the U.S. men’s basketball team between 1936 and 1968.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-us-juggernaut-rolls-on/article35806724.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. women finally get it right||They struck gold, finally! After winning three silver and two bronze medals from the previous nine Olympics, the United States women took the volleyball gold on Sunday. The US beat Brazil 25-21, 25-20, 25-14, in an hour and 22 minutes. It was also sweet revenge for the Americans; they were beaten by Brazil in the finals of the 2008 and 2012 editions. On Sunday at Tokyo’s Ariake Arena, Brazil was humbled by a team playing at the top of its game. Brazil missed the services of one of its key players, Tandara Caixeta, who had to return home following a positive dope test. But even her presence would not have been enough to stop the US women. Earlier, Serbia took the bronze beating South Korea 25-18, 25-15, 25-15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/us-women-finally-get-it-right/article35806726.ece
09 August 2021||Tokyo,||Brazil footballers draw controversy||The Brazilian Olympic Committee will take action against its men’s soccer national team after the players refused to wear the nation’s official Olympic uniform during the medal ceremony at the Tokyo Games on Saturday. The committee released a statement on Sunday condemning attitude of the players and the Brazilian soccer confederation after the team beat Spain in the final to win gold. “After the end of the Games the Brazilian Olympic Committee will make public the measures that will be taken to preserve the rights of the Olympic movement, of our sponsors and of other athletes,” the committee said. All athletes in the Brazilian delegation had been told in advance they had to wear the team’s IOC-approved official uniform, which is provided by Chinese company Peak Sport, but the players went to the podium wearing their Nike jerseys. Only their pants were part of the Peak uniform. Their jackets were tied around their waists. Players told Brazilian media they were only following orders from the Brazilian soccer confederation, which had not immediately made an official comment. Some reports said the confederation was not aware of the requirement that athletes had to wear the official Team Brazil uniform on the podium. Alienated Brazilian swimmer Bruno Fratus, a bronze medallist in the 50 meters in Tokyo, said it “was a clear message” that soccer players don’t feel part of the Olympic team and don’t really care about it. “They are also completely disconnected and alienated to the consequences that this may bring to the numerous athletes who are not millionaires like them,” he said on Twitter. Not following the rules could create problems for the Brazilian Olympic Committee with its current and future contracts with Peak or other sportswear companies. Team Brazil used Nike uniforms in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Criticism Former Brazilian openwater swimmer Poliana Okimoto, a bronze medallist in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, also criticised the soccer team. “One of the basic concepts of sports is discipline,” she said on Twitter. “Following rules shouldn’t be that hard. What the soccer team did, not wearing the official uniform on the podium, wasn’t good for Brazil’s image. It’s the Brazilian Olympic Committee that will be punished, not the Brazilian soccer federation.” It was the second consecutive Olympic gold medal for Brazil’s men’s soccer team. Before that, it had never won the Olympic title.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/brazil-footballers-draw-controversy/article35807048.ece
09 August 2021||Tokyo,||Coe concerned about climate change||The effects of climate change will force sports bodies to rethink their calendar of events, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said on Sunday. Coe, a two-time Olympic champion, was speaking on the final day of the Tokyo Games. The extreme heat and humidity in Japan forced changes to the track schedule, as well as tennis and women’s soccer. “You don’t have to be a devotee of climate change or a denier to know the world is getting hotter,” Coe said. “It probably will mean a global discussion around the calendar and how we stage events.” Coe noted the stress on his staff of “having to create field hospitals and having your team spending a year thinking about little else other than how you are going to be coping with the welfare of the athletes”. “Nobody wants to do that. That’s not what we came into the sport for,” he said, adding “we could well be confronting the same temperatures in Paris in 2024.” In July 2022, the track world championships will be held in Eugene, Oregon, where a record heatwave raised temperatures to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius) at the U.S. trials in June. Morning sessions were suspended. New norm “The new norm is, particularly in dealing with endurance events, really harsh climatic conditions,” Coe said. “The reality of it is, I think this a challenge we are all going to confront now,” said Coe, who is an IOC member. “If you are going to be intellectually coherent here, we are going to have to have that debate,” Coe said, predicting sports bodies will be ”revisiting what is possible and probably having to be more adaptable in future.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/coe-concerned-about-climate-change/article35806764.ece

09 August 2021||Nottingham,||Rain has the final say||England and India drew the first Test at Trent Bridge after rain meant no play was possible on Sunday, the final day. The match, which had already seen more than 100 overs lost to bad weather, was intriguingly poised with India 52/1 in its second innings, needing a further 157 runs to reach a victory target of 209. But rain prevented play resuming as scheduled at 11 a.m. local time and, after further downpours the umpires abandoned the match as a draw at 3:49 p.m., only for the sun to briefly burst through the overcast skies above Trent Bridge.  The scores: England 183 & 303 drew with India 278 & 52/1 in 14 overs.   Second Test: August 12-16, Lord’s.   Everything that we had prepared for over the last one and a half months sort of fell in place nicely. It was a great way to start the series for us.

Rao led the last team from the State to win the Santosh Trophy, the erstwhile Mysore State which beat mighty Bengal in the final in March 1969. It what was the Silver Jubilee edition of the National Championship and the victory marked successive titles for Mysore, which had also won the previous year’s competition in Cuttack.  He also turned out for CIL FC at the club level and enjoyed a distinguished career as a coach and mentor.

09 August 2021||New Delhi,||Monsoon blues||On July 19, less than a week after monsoon hit the Capital, several parts of the city were heavily waterlogged. Like many others, 27-year-old Ravi Chautala went to take photos of a waterlogged underpass in Pul Prahladpur. But he reportedly fell into the water and though fire brigade and divers were summoned to the spot, only his body could be retrieved from the waterlogged underpass. He left behind his wife and 10-month-old daughter. Sadly, Chautala’s is not a lone instance. On the same day last year, a 56-year-old driver died in a waterlogged stretch under Minto Bridge where his van got stuck. These deaths have yet again exposed the national capital’s dirty secret: urban flooding. Lost in implementation Despite the deaths, a Drainage Master Plan, commissioned nine years ago and largely seen as a solution, is yet to be implemented. It has now hit a roadblock of “data irregularities”, officials said. The last Drainage Master Plan of the city was prepared in 1976. “At a meeting of the Technical Expert Committee last week, various departments said that the data used for the master plan was found to have several irregularities. A decision has yet to be taken on how to go forward,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu . Experts said that while a range of problems with the storm water network is the major cause of the urban flooding, faulty sewage systems, rapid urbanisation, and climate change are intensifying Delhi’s woes. The Drainage Master Plan for NCT of Delhi was commissioned by the Congress-led Delhi government in 2012 and a final plan submitted to the AAP government in July 2018 by IIT-Delhi. “The Chief Minister has directed the departments concerned to take concrete steps for the implementation of the report, which mentions in detail the specific reasons for waterlogging and flooding during monsoon,” an official statement issued by the Delhi government on August 1, 2018 on the master plan said. It was then referred to a Technical Expert Committee, which is still going through the report. When contacted, R.K. Sinha, Member (River Management), Central Water Commission, who heads the committee, did not offer a comment. Data irregularity A.K. Gosain, Professor Emeritus of IIT-Delhi, who headed the team which prepared the master plan confirmed that the committee has flagged irregularities in data. “We used data which was given to us by various government departments to create the master plan. Now the committee asked departments to cross check 10% of the data with ground reality and in a large number of cases, the data given to us is not matching with the ground reality. This is not our fault. We had asked the departments many times to validate the data, but they never did it,” Prof. Gosain said. The master plan submitted in 2018 had also warned of such a possible irregularity. “Since it is possible that many of the data elements that have not been independently validated by the respective departments may be different on ground than the digital reality captured and used in the model,” reads the master plan. The last master plan was prepared when the population of the city was 60 lakh. Since then the population of the city has increased about four times. In the run up to the 2020 Assembly elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that if re-elected then the government will make roads in Delhi like that of Tokyo and London in the next five years. But currently, many parts of the city go under with half an hour to one hour of rainfall. ‘World-class’ facility On the day Mr. Chautala died in the waterlogged underpass, Mr. Kejriwal said that different agencies will make a “world-class” drainage system . “In view of the monsoon, a review meeting was conducted with PWD, MCD, DJB, I&FC chaired by the L-G on the drainage system of Delhi. Will implement a system like Minto Bridge at other vulnerable points. Drains and sewers will be regularly cleaned,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The fact that drains in the city are controlled by multiple agencies, some by AAP and the others by BJP, makes the task more difficult. Core problems At the centre of the urban flooding problem is the state of both natural and engineered storm water drains. Storm water drains are supposed to carry the run off rainwater and empty into a waterbody, which in Delhi is river Yamuna. Natural storm water drains are developed over the years as water naturally tries to find a way to flow and it depends on the terrain and slope of the land. In Delhi’s instance, many natural drains originate from the Aravalis. “When you take an area for development, you engineer street-level drains, which will join the roadside drain and it will join larger drains. Usually, all these are flowing under gravity and flow into a natural drain. This will then drain out into a waterbody,” Mr. Gosain said. Apart from this, there is supposed to be a separate sewage network, which is not connected to the storm water drain, and the sewage treated at plants. But in Delhi, sewage flows into the storm water network at many points and water in storm water drains, including Najafgarh drain (the largest), is blackish in colour and extremely polluted. Near Signature Bridge, where the about 10-metre-wide Najafgarh drain empties into the Yamuna, it changes the river’s colour to a darker shade and pollutes it. Experts said the waste and sewage also reduces the water-carrying capacity of these drains. Adding to the problem, the rainfall has also become erratic. As global temperatures have soared, air has become warmer and it can hold more moisture, leading to more intense spells of rainfall. “Studies have shown that in the last 3-4 years, Delhi has been getting intense rainfall in a short duration of time, which was not the case before. This is due to climate change,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, Head of the Regional Forecasting Centre of the India Meteorological Department. For instance, between 6.30 p.m. on July 31 and the same time on August 1, the ridge monitoring station received 126.8 mm of rainfall. This is unusual for Delhi. “Though this is 24 hour data, most of this rainfall was received in a 3-4 hour window on July 31 night,” Mr. Srivastava said. To contextualise, Delhi normally gets only 210.6 mm of rainfall in July. So, the ridge area got more than half of a month’s normal rainfall for the city in a matter of 3-4 hours in a day. Stuck in paper Mr. Gosain’s team, which took the help of over 900 students, inspected drains and collected data ranging from soil type and land use to rainfall and existing drainage network to come up with solutions. The master plan gives a set of recommendations such as ‘no encroachment to be allowed on storm water drains’, ‘no sewage should be allowed to enter storm water network’, ‘design of new storm drains should not be done in isolation’, among others. More importantly, the master plan used all the data collected to create a mathematical model which generated solutions for waterlogging problems in identified spots. The model generated four solutions — adjusting slope of the existing drain, diverting water to existing waterbodies, using additional storages, and other development works. These solutions considered the rainfall, slope of the drain, and many other factors and were done with the larger picture in mind to provide a comprehensive solution to the city, rather than isolated ones. But they still remain on paper. “I’m disappointed at how things have progressed. Nothing much has happened after we submitted the report,” said Mr. Gosain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/monsoon-blues/article35806904.ece
09 August 2021||August 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Has adland done justice to India’s sports queens?||Over the years, there have been quite a few commercials and ad campaigns featuring India’s female athletes. Arguably the most noticed was one that dazzled us in 2016, a piece of work for Nike by agency Wieden + Kennedy that had the nation going ‘Da-da-ding’. To be fair, it also featured Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone and a pulsating soundtrack by Gizzle & Gener8ion. But the athletes — be it Rani Rampal, then 21, who had broken into the team at the age of 15, or squash player Joshna Chinappa, who was ranked 10th in the world at the time — certainly did not play second fiddle. Yet other brands did not seize the opportunity. If they did, they did not do so with the skill and scale worthy of these achievers. And that trend seems to be continuing.  Shine before the win  There are some campaigns, however, that cut through, that married the brand with an athlete’s story or perspective. In the context of Tokyo 2020, even before Domino’s moment marketing went viral, there was an attempt to tell the story of fencer Bhavani Devi. It came from brand Rin, via agency Ogilvy. Her victory against patriarchy to qualify for the Games found alignment with the brand’s #AbWaqtHaiChamakneKa plank. JSW (think steel, cement), which started its #RuknaNahiHai campaign ahead of Rio 2016, carried forward the anthem in the context of the delayed Olympics, also conceptualised by Ogilvy. Is it a campaign featuring women athletes exclusively? No. But as do several campaigns urging India to cheer the national contingent, it features a good share of our sportswomen.  Mirabai’s meal, Lovlina’s road home  There is a lot of action with hashtags sans film on social media, but hardly anything has made an impact. Within integrated campaigns with films, the majority have played on patriotism. Very few have managed to delve into the lives and minds of the athletes. Beyond women athletes, who, in fact, find more screen time and are in general more sought after by brands (except in cricket), there is a larger factor at work — the divide between winners and the rest. One of the reasons for the lack of storytelling is brands trying to ride with the stars and play safe. Celebrity management firms are tasked with identifying the winners ahead of the Olympics, which is a big ask even if one has been tracking individual athletes’ progress regularly. Some of the managers, I am told, were in the Northeast seeking out the Chanus’ modest home before the first medal winner, weightlifter Mirabai, could return. Images of the Silver medalist’s family meal went viral soon after she won. Could that have happened prior? Elsewhere in the region, the local MLA called the father of Lovlina Borgohain, representing India in boxing at the Tokyo Games. The Public Works Department is ensuring that the road to their home is rendered motorable in time for her return because she is assured of a Bronze. So it’s not just advertisers, we in India have a bias for winners. But even if an athlete does not win, you still have a story. And the story of an Olympic dream is quite powerful by itself. If someone had hunted these stories down before the Games, the brands that told them would have been far richer in terms of RoI.  Trending like Sindhu  PV Sindhu has become the first Indian woman to win two individual Olympic medals, also only the second Indian athlete to do so (wrestler Sushil Kumar is the other). There is no dearth of endorsements in her kitty, but which are the ones that come across as having truly partnered with her? Gatorade signed her on in 2017 and the relationship went beyond acting in commercials. She went to the brand’s facilities and they tested her sweat to help arrive at the right rehydration for the star. It was clearly a long-term vision. The badminton ace had already won a Silver at the Rio Olympics and was a star, but the brand egged her (and her fans) on, in the #SweatMore work by Wunderman Thompson (2017). After she struck Gold at the World Championships 2019, they chronicled her #SweatForGold journey. After her 2021 Olympics Bronze win, when a fan tweeted asking for Sindhu to be given a Thar, Anand Mahindra replied: “She already has one in her garage.” It was gifted much earlier.  Lessons from around the world  Two international pieces of advertising for Olympics 2020 offer some pointers as to how advertisers could engage with our Olympians. The first comes from P&G, where a sustained campaign allowed it, in a sense, to own the Olympics. With #LeadWithLove, it followed up with a series of profiles on some special athletes, the ones who were shining beyond the arena with their actions. From Scout Bassett, a disabled Paralympics athlete, dedicating herself for those like her, to Tom Daley, a gay athlete, speaking up for the sake of those like him. Waking up a month before could not have delivered the impact some of these did. But the piece of work that took one’s breath away was #StrongerTogether, which underlined the spirit of the Olympic Games. It was from brand Olympics, but advertising on a theme like saluting the spirit of the Games could have come from anywhere. The film looks at what makes the Olympics special, through the eyes of athletes over the years — from 100-year old Olympics gymnastics veteran Agnes Keleti to 13 year-old debutante, skateboarder Sky Brown. The Olympics is perhaps the only sporting arena where, despite its commercialisation and expansion, the spirit of the Games stands tall. And that spirit goes way beyond medal-winning. If brands look beyond, they could well strike gold.

09 August 2021||Pune,||Local train services to resume from Aug. 15||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that Mumbai local train services would be reopened on August 15 for citizens who had taken both vaccine doses. Making the much-anticipated announcement during his address to the State, Mr. Thackeray, cautioning citizens to strictly adhere to pandemic norms, said the condition was that 14 days must have passed since the second dose. ‘Stagger work timings’ “We are setting up an app where citizens will have to apply for a pass. For those who don’t have smartphones, an offline facility will be made available. Till now, 21 lakh citizens have taken both the doses.” He said the government would also appeal to offices to stagger work timings and allow those who could continue working from home. He said while restrictions were being relaxed in a number of districts and cities, a comprehensive decision on removing curbs on hotels, malls and prayer halls would be taken only after the meeting with the State COVID-19 taskforce team on Monday. Exhorting the public not to give an invitation to the third wave, Mr. Thackeray pointed to the increasing cases in Kerala and other States in the wake of the Delta Plus variant of the virus. “In February this year, we thought that the pandemic was going away…but then, cases suddenly shot up in Vidarbha — the ‘Delta’ variant. So, even as we are relaxing rules, we need to be extremely careful about not crowding in places, especially during festivities,” he said. The CM singled out some districts where it was particularly important for authorities to ensure that the case surge was kept under check. “It is especially necessary to take care in the six districts recently hit by severe floods. Citizens in Pune, which has been reporting 900 cases daily, and Ahmednagar, which sees an average rise of more than 600 cases, also need to be very careful in following the norms.” Ramping up vaccination was the only means to check the spread of the contagion. The State had the capacity to vaccinate up to 15 lakh people a day and was already carrying out an average eight lakh vaccinations, Mr. Thackeray said. Possible third wave “We have already taken steps to prepare for a possible third wave and correct the lacunae in our health infrastructure that came into relief during the lethal second wave. The State has 600 testing labs while the number of isolation beds has risen to 4.5 lakh. We have 34,507 ICU beds and over 1.10 lakh oxygen beds besides 13,500 ventilators. At the peak of the second wave, we needed 80,000 oxygen beds,” he said. He said despite a steady decline in cases, the State’s active case number had still not dropped to the lowest levels before the second wave. “It is pointless merely remembering sacrifices of the freedom fighters on the occasion of Independence Day. We need to emulate them… Just as the 150-year British Raj was overthrown, we must steel ourselves to shake off the yoke of COVID-19.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/local-train-services-to-resume-from-aug-15/article35807088.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Passengers double at IGIA in 2 weeks||Since the reopening of Terminal 2 (T2) at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport nearly two weeks ago, the passenger volume at the airport has grown two-fold — from 42,000 to almost 85,000 passengers per day. “We will take a decision to reopen Terminal 1 (T1) once traffic reaches 1,20,000 mark per day,” CEO of Delhi International Airport Limited, Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, told The Hindu.  Delhi’s IGI Airport has three terminals, of which T1 is yet to reopen since the ban on flights last year in March because of low passenger volumes. While T2 also remained shut for a considerable amount of time, it was reopened in October last year — five months after flight operations resumed in May. However, T2 was shut down again on May 18 after a dip in passenger numbers during the second wave of COVID-19 and resumed operations on July 22. Over the past 18 months, the airport has introduced several technologies to ensure disinfection of surfaces, circulation of clean air and to monitor that passengers comply with social distancing norms. Luminometer Luminometer is used to clean high contact surfaces such as lifts, check-in counters and travelators. It ensures these are free from any living or dead bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms. After a surface is cleaned, a test swab is taken and put in a Luminometer. It measures the intensity of the light emitted from a sample, and displays the test result in Relative Light Units (RLU), which is used to determine if the sample has passed or failed. Delhi airport has also installed a UV tunnel at the baggage belt area of Terminal 3 that helps disinfect passengers’ bags. A live CCTV feed of the UV scanning process mounted at baggage reclaim hall allows passengers to see the disinfection process, which involves high intensity UV lamps. There are also mobile disinfecting towers that help to disinfect various locations of terminal buildings. Once disinfection is completed, UV power is switched off and these moveable towers are relocated to other areas for a similar exercise. DIAL has installed a system which replaces air inside the terminal buildings after every 10 minutes. The air inside the terminal is drawn into the AHU (Air Handling Unit), where it gets filtered after passing through UV light and HEPA filters, before being released again into the terminal building. Tracking system XOVIS Passenger Tracking System is used to manage passenger flow inside the airport and prevent crowding and long queues. The 3D sensors of the roof-mounted device record passenger coordinates as dots, based on which the software calculates and visualises passenger density index. If the index exceeds 1, this system generates auto-alerts and prompts airport officials to act swiftly and disperse the crowd. Mobile application The HOI mobile application helps passengers during different stages of their travel by providing them real-time alerts about gate change, weather forecast at their destination, indoor navigation with voice guidance as well as contactless ordering of foods and beverages as well as their delivery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/passengers-double-at-igia-in-2-weeks/article35806898.ece
09 August 2021||GURUGRAM,||Haryana govt. extends lockdown||The Haryana government on Sunday extended the lockdown in the State for a fortnight and lifted the restrictions on the timings to run shops, shopping malls, bars, restaurants, gymnasiums and spas. Extending the lockdown till August 23 morning, Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan, in a four-page order, said the restrictions on the timings for the shops, shopping malls, restaurants, bars, gyms, spas, club houses, and swimming pools were being removed and these establishments could run with adherence to the COVID norms. 50% capacity cap The maximum capacity for restaurants and bars, however, remains at 50%. The swimming pools are allowed to open after adopting requisite social distancing norms with all swimmers and visitors vaccinated with both doses of vaccine. In indoor spaces, gatherings up to 50% of the hall capacity are allowed with a maximum of 100 guests. Similarly, in open spaces, 200 guests are allowed with adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour. The earlier relaxations on conducting of exams, opening of universities for doubt classes, and opening of libraries, coaching institutes, training institutes and open training centres continue. Religious places are already allowed to open with maximum of 50 people inside the premises, but the corporate offices are permitted to open with full attendance. The sports complexes are also open for all outdoor sports activities, but the spectators are not allowed. Reopening of varsities As per the earlier orders, the Vice-Chancellors are advised to plan the re-opening of the universities in the State from the next academic session and share the programme with the department concerned of the government. The orders said that immediate action might be initiated by the university administration to fully vaccinate all the hostel students, day-scholars, faculty and staff, including those outsourced. The order said that “No Mask-No Service” would be strictly observed in the State. As per the order, people will not be allowed to board public or private transport and enter any government and private establishments for any services without a mask.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-govt-extends-lockdown/article35806893.ece
09 August 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha govt. go-ahead for coastal highway||The Naveen Patnaik Government has given its consent to the ambitious Rs. 8000-crore coastal highway project that would connect Odisha’s Tangi with West Bengal’s Digha, six years after mooting of the proposal. If everything goes as planned, the first tender for laying a portion of road could be invited by March next. “The State government has given consent for the coastal highway after much deliberation. We will go for different regulatory approvals required for the project as the proposed road will pass in the vicinity of various forests and Bay of Bengal and over rivers,” said Ram Prasad Panda, Chief General Manager of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), Bhubaneswar. Brushing aside environment concerns being raised over the project, Mr. Panda said the proposed highway would not intersect any ecologically sensitive areas. “Due care has been taken to evade the forest and sanctuary areas in the plan. The coastal highway will prove a key infrastructure milestone for transportation of port-related goods, boosting tourism and handling disaster crisis in the future,” said the head of NHAI’s Bhubaneswar office. Major traffic on National Highway-16 is likely to shift to the new coastal highway upon its completion. Ecologically sensitive Chilika, Balukhanda Konark Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhitarakanika Sanctuary Area and some of the important Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites were initially coming in way of the 382-km-long coastal highway. The project was modified following reservations by environmentalists over a long bridge proposed over the Chilika Lake. The crucial road project would originate from Tangi in Khordha district instead of Gopalpur in Ganjam district. As per road design, all major towns would be by-passed, said Mr. Panda. Except a stretch of road outside Puri town, all roads would be laid anew. “The project would require close to 2,000 hectares of land while 15-20% of the project cost would be spent towards acquisition of land,” he pointed out. Many bridges The coastal highway would cross 11 rivers and a number of water channels in six coastal districts for which the project would have large number of bridges and culverts than that of other road projects. From engineering point of view, special treatment of slushy areas would be required to take up the road project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-govt-go-ahead-for-coastal-highway/article35806891.ece
09 August 2021||GURUGRAM,||Need to increase marriageable age of girls to 21 years stressed||Participating in a series of webinars and physical meetings — “Lado Panchayats” — under the aegis of “Selfie With Daughter Foundation”, a non-government organisation working on gender issues, over the past few weeks, women, from across the country, have advocated the need to increase the minimum marriageable age of girls to 21 years from the present 18. “We have held a dozen webinars with participants from across the country and physical meetings with the women in different districts of Haryana to discuss the issue of marriageable age for the females. The participants have overwhelmingly supported that the marriageable age should be at par with the men,” said Sunil Jaglan, founder, Selfie With Daughter Foundation. Meetings in Haryana The foundation has held physical meetings in Haryana’s Gurugram, Nuh, Jind, Hisar and Sonipat districts so far. Mr. Jaglan said that the participants in the webinars presented poems, and articles to articulate their views on the issue. Some of the participants had offered to help the campaign with a digital support. In a recent webinar, the men from the families of the women participants, including fathers and brothers, also took part in the discussion and pledged their support to the cause. He, however, added that some of the posts of the women participants on the social media seeking support for their campaign had also evoked adverse comments. Seeking higher marriageable age, the women, in the Lado Panchayats, broadly argued that their studies were adversely impacted due to early marriage. Most of them were of the view that marriage at an early age also led to physical, mental and social exploitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/need-to-increase-marriageable-age-of-girls-to-21-years-stressed/article35806894.ece
09 August 2021||Agartala,||TMC workers get bail in Tripura||A court in Tripura on Sunday granted bail to 14 Trinamool Congress leaders and activists, including three youth functionaries from West Bengal, who were arrested for violating COVID-19 linked night curfew imposed under the Disaster Management Act. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who arrived here in the morning, spent the whole day at Khowai police station to seek the release of the workers. He was accompanied by MP Dola Sen, West Bengal Minister Bratya Basu and party leader Kunal Ghosh. Two of three youth leaders from Bengal – Sudip Raha and Jaya Datta – had sustained injuries due to stone pelting on their vehicle at Ambassa in Dhalai district yesterday. Presence of Mr. Banerjee triggered another phase of political tension in Khowai surrounding the local police station and the court complex. Protesters showed black flags and shouted ‘go back’. Paramilitary contingents of the Tripura State Rifles and the CRPF were deployed to maintain peace. Mr. Banerjee reportedly had heated exchanges with senior officers. He argued that the detention was unlawful and made at the behest of the ruling party. After the TMC workers were taken to a court in Khowai, not far away from the police station, vehicles of the State TMC leaders, including former MLA Subal Bhowmik who recently joined the TMC, and an advocate were vandalised near the court complex. Mr. Bhowmik received injuries on his arm. Mr. Banerjee cancelled his scheduled press conference here as his return from Khowai was delayed due to court proceedings. He, other leaders and the three youth activists from West Bengal returned to Kolkata in a special flight in the night. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb tweeted that a ‘group’ hatched a conspiracy to disturb the ongoing development activities and prevailing peace in the State to achieve political mileage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tmc-workers-get-bail-in-tripura/article35806896.ece
09 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two arrested for celebratory firing after video surfaces on social media||Taking cognisance of a purported video circulated on the social media platform in which a man was seen doing celebratory firing, Delhi Police said an FIR was registered and the man along with his friend were arrested in connection with the incident on Sunday. The purported video was shot on August 4 during a birthday celebration which was organised at the rooftop of a house in outer Delhi’s Paschim Vihar East and the man seen firing rounds in the air was identified as Sumit Tanwar, they said.

09 August 2021||Pune,||Patil rules out change in BJP State chief||Quashing speculation of a possible change in the post of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief in Maharashtra, BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Sunday said his party was the only one among all parties where internal democratic rules were adhered to and where leaders were appointed every three years. “There is no question or any discussion [within the party] of a change in the State president’s post… Such baseless talk has only surfaced in the media. In fact, the media has not really known what the BJP is about, and even common people must understand our party…it is the only party which functions in a democratic fashion,” Mr. Patil said. Taking potshots at the Congress, Mr. Patil said that the party had not been able to elect its national president for more than a year now. Speculation that Mr. Patil was likely to be shunted out as the BJP State president had surfaced in the Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana while suggestions were rife that Chandrashekhar Bavankule, an influential OBC leader, could succeed Mr. Patil with an eye on OBC votes in future polls. “There is no need to take seriously what either the Saamana or [chief Sena spokesperson] Sanjay Raut says regarding our internal matters,” Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/patil-rules-out-change-in-bjp-state-chief/article35807083.ece
