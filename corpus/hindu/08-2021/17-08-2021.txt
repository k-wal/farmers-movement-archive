17 August 2021||Kabul,||Taliban assert control over Afghanistan||Victorious Taliban militants patrolled Kabul on Monday after a stunningly swift end to Afghanistan’s 20-year war, as thousands of people mobbed the city’s airport trying to flee the group’s feared hardline brand of Islamist rule. President Ashraf Ghani flew out of the country on Sunday night as the insurgents encircled the capital, capping a military victory that saw them capture all cities in just 10 days. After police and other government forces gave up their posts in Kabul on Sunday, Taliban militants took over checkpoints across the city and entered the presidential palace. Militants with rifles slung over their shoulders also walked through the streets of the Green Zone, the formerly heavily fortified district that houses most Embassies and international organisations. The Taliban, however, sought to reassure the international community that Afghans should not fear them, and said they will not take revenge against those who supported the U.S.-backed alliance. In a message posted on social media, Taliban co-founder Abdul Ghani Baradar called on the militants to remain disciplined after taking control of the city. China ready for ties China was the first major nation to flag support for the Taliban, stating it was ready for “friendly relations”. There were desperate scenes at Kabul’s airport on Monday as people tried to board the few flights available. Senior U.S. military officials say the chaos at the airport left seven people dead, including some who fell from a departing American military transport jet, according to Associated Press.

17 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Name plaque unveiled on Mulki Sundaram Shetty Road in city||Nearly a year after notification for naming Ambedkar Circle-Light House Hill-Catholic Club Road stretch as Mulki Sundaram Shetty Road was issued, a plaque was unveiled by Mayor Premanand Shetty and Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath here on Monday. “It is a coincidence that this plaque is unveiled when the whole stretch is being widened,” said Mr. Kamath. With widening of the stretch and other connecting roads in the central part of the city, the plaque, which is installed at the traffic island opposite Catholic Club, will be clearly visible to road users, he added. It was on July 1, 2016 that the State government notified naming of the road stretch after Mulki Sundaram Shetty, whose work as the head of erstwhile Vijaya Bank (which is now merged with Bank of Baroda) is widely remembered. Following a furore and protest, including by staff and students of St. Aloysius College, the State government on May 24 of that year ordered status quo . The State government took up the issue once again following an order from the High Court Karnataka and after a report from the corporation commissioner and reissued a notification to name the road on September 5, 2020. A few days later, the then Mayor Diwakar placed a banner each at the either ends of the road stretch. At the formal function to unveil the plaque, Mr. Shetty said that steps are being taken to rename other road stretches and junctions. Ambedkar bust “A similar plaque will come up at the Ambedkar Circle where a bust of Babasaheb Ambekar will be installed,” he said. Mr. Shetty told The Hindu that the corporation has sent proposal to State government to name Lady Hill Circle as Narayana Guru Circle. Process On the elaborate process involved in issuing notification for roads and circles, Mr. Shetty said that efforts are being made to keep alive the names of people who have worked for the development of the region. “The new names of roads and circles will be made more popular,” he said. President of International Bunts Welfare Trust Sadananda Shetty and General Manager and Zonal Head of Bank of Baroda R. Ghayathri took part in the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/name-plaque-unveiled-on-mulki-sundaram-shetty-road-in-city/article35950171.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. dismisses snooping charges||The government in the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed allegations of snooping using Pegasus spyware as mere “conjectures and surmises” based on “unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material”. A two-page affidavit filed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in the Supreme Court, however, said the government would form a Committee of Experts to dispel the “wrong narrative” spread by “vested interests”. However, some of the petitioners termed the government’s response “skimpy” and “delightfully non-committal”. They urged a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana to have the Union Home Secretary clarify on oath in an affidavit whether or not the government used the military-grade technology to snoop on citizens. “The sum and substance is they [petitioners] are not satisfied with your limited affidavit. They want to know in clear terms whether the government has used Pegasus or not... If you want time to file a detailed affidavit, you can take time,” Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana addressed Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. ‘Sensitive issue’ But Mr. Mehta said even a “detailed affidavit” may not appease the petitioners. He asked whether the petitioners would swear to withdraw from court if the government said “no” to using the Pegasus in a further “one-page affidavit”. Mr. Mehta indicated that things were not “so simple”. Any discussion on this issue would involve national security. “We are dealing with a sensitive matter. Attempts are being made to make it sensational,” Mr. Mehta complained. “If the government is reluctant about filing a detailed affidavit, how can we compel them to?” the CJI turned to senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for veteran journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar. “Well, that would mean they don’t want to admit or deny [to using Pegasus]... Then I can argue that they have not denied. Then the matter gets more serious... We want a straight answer. Did the government or any of its agencies use Pegasus? That question does not deal with national security,” Mr. Sibal replied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/snooping-allegations-mere-conjectures-centre-tells-sc/article35949599.ece
17 August 2021||New Delhi,||Afghans in India fear for their kin||As visuals of fleeing residents dominated television screens, with the Taliban having wrested control from the Western-backed government of Ashraf Ghani, thousands of Afghans in India, including students across the country, watched in fear for the future of women, children and young men. For the 150 Afghan students studying in Osmania University in Hyderabad, the situation filled them with trepidation and concern. They don’t want to go back home and yet worry for the safety of those left behind. “Don’t come back home now!” is the plea from Afghans to their sons and daughters — a sentiment echoed by Afghan students in Hyderabad. “I told my family I will not come back if situation there becomes hostile,” said a 22-year-old Afghan student, who did not wish to be named. “We are worried about human rights, women’s rights, of our people. The Taliban are giving assurances, but only time will tell if they will stick to it. We don’t want to see what happened 20 years ago.” Another immediate concern is about rising prices of food and other resources, and loss of jobs. ‘Everyone is scared’ “Our families are not stepping out of home. There is silence now. But everyone is scared,” said Samiullah, another Afghan student pursuing psychology in OU. There are around 200 Afghan students in Telangana, including 10 to 12 women. Md Yousaf, president of the Afghan Students Association, said the visas of some students would expire by the end of August and others at the end of the year. “We request the Indian government to extend the visas and provide some financial help,” he said. Nightmare returns For many who fled the Taliban, the nightmare has returned to haunt them. The “Afghan colony” in Lajpat Nagar and Bhogal, New Delhi, that has grocery shops, medical stores, travel agencies and restaurants catering mostly to students, medical tourists and refugees from Afghanistan was abuzz with activity as people made enquiries about each other’s families back home. Matiullah, who runs a travel agency in the market, said over the past few days, he has been receiving hundreds of calls from Afghans here on how they can book flight tickets or secure travel documents to ensure safe passage of their family members to India. “I cried all night thinking about the situation. My entire family is back home. I came to India nine months ago after my father who was a soldier in the Afghanistan Army was killed by the Taliban outside our home,” said 24-year-old Matiullah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/afghans-in-india-fear-for-their-kin/article35949774.ece
17 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Two-child policy: U.P. law panel submits draft Bill||After reviewing over 8,000 suggestions from the public, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission on Monday submitted a report and draft Bill of a new population control law proposing two-child policy to the State government. Panel chairperson Justice Aditya Nath Mittal said the report and the draft of The Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021 were submitted to the Chief Minister. The Commission has last month uploaded the draft on its website and invited suggestions from people. The report said 8,200 of the 8,500 suggestions were in support of the Bill. Voting right intact The Commission adopted the suggestion that special facilities extended to BPL families who have only one child and undertake voluntary sterilisation would be extended to all couples irrespective of the BPL category. It, however, rejected suggestions that the right to vote of persons having more than two children be curtailed and that they also be barred from the benefit of reservation. “Right to vote is a constitutional and Fundamental Right. Therefore, the State government has no competence to make such law,” the report said. A person who has more than two children after the law comes into force would be debarred form several benefits such as welfare schemes. Ration card units would be limited to four and the person will be barred from contesting elections to local authority or any body of the local self-government, the draft Bill says. He/she would also become ineligible to apply for State government jobs, will be barred from promotion in government services and will not receive any kind of subsidy. The provisions would come into force one year after the date of the publication of the gazette, the draft said. Several incentives have been provided to people, including public servants, if they adopt the two-child norm by undergoing voluntary sterilisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-child-policy-up-law-panel-submits-draft-bill/article35949773.ece

The police arrested Ananda Gatty (50), a resident of Mudipu, who owned the place where the substances were stored. He was produced before a local magistrate who accepted the plea of the police and granted them custody of Gatty for two weeks. He has been accused of offences under the Explosive Substances Act and the Arms Act. The seized explosive substances include 400 kg of white sulphur powder, 350 kg of potassium nitrate, 50 kg of barium nitrate, 395 kg of potassium chlorite, 260 kg of aluminium powder of different grades, 161 boxes of the banned .22 air pistol pellets, 30 kg lead balls and 240 kg of charcoal. The police have also seized weighing scale and weighing stone. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that as the city is sensitive, the police have been closely monitoring movement of explosive substances. The police intensified the watch after the explosion cases were reported in Chikkaballapur and Shivamogga districts. Following a tip-off, the police raided the residential-cum-commercial building and recovered the explosive substances. In a recent case, the banned .22 air pistol pellets were used to kill a stray dog in the city. Investigation so far has revealed the use of these substances in quarries, fish ponds and for crackers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/man-arrested-1400-kg-of-low-grade-explosive-substances-recovered/article35950174.ece

Efforts are also being made to introduce a CIAL-owned solar ferry on the Kochi city-Muziris stretch. The vessel would have 12 seats in its AC cabin and 12 non-AC seats. Aimed at receiving guests in adherence to pandemic protocol, only boat employees, guides and staff of heritage locales who have taken at least the first vaccine shot are being posted, Mr. Noushad said. Visitors are now allowed entry into Muziris Beach spread over 35 acres near Azheekode, which can host up to 500 people at a time.

17 August 2021||Chennai,||Almost 90 % students return to campuses as government medical colleges reopen||Almost 90% of students returned to campuses as government medical colleges reopened across the State on Monday. Director of Medical Education R. Narayana Babu, who visited the Government Kilpauk Medical College and the Government Omandurar Medical College, said nearly 90% of students attended the first day of classes, while the remaining 10% were enroute. Guidelines The directorate had earlier issued guidelines to institutions to disinfect classrooms, libraries, laboratories, hostel mess, hostel, college and hospital premises, provide hand-washing stations wherever necessary, take up daily thermal screening of students at college and hostel premises and provide masks to students. While students were told to submit their status RT-PCR report taken not more than 48 hours prior to joining, colleges in Chennai made arrangements to test those who did not get tested prior to arrival. E. Theranirajan, dean of the Madras Medical College, said hostel students were advised to stay quarantined for 14 days before joining physical classes. Similarly, R. Jayanthi, dean of the Government Omandurar Medical College, said hostel students coming from remote areas or areas where there was high infectivity, were asked to quarantine themselves for two to three days. A. Jamila, vice principal of Government Stanley Medical College, said students were asked to produce negative RT-PCR test reports and vaccination certificates. “Instructions were given to organise classes in small batches of 25 to 30 students. Apart from individual lecture halls, the seminar hall can be used if a class should have more students. The seminar hall has a capacity of 400, and physical distancing can be maintained well,” she said. At MMC, almost 100% of students have received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Theranirajan added. A sick room was set up on the college campus and a nurse was posted. “We have readied a crash cart, bed and oxygen support as a first aid measure for students,” he said. “We had issued a circular to the students based on guidelines issued by the National Medical Commission and Tamil Nadu Health department. About 98% of them were vaccinated. We had set up COVID-19 desks to provide on the spot testing,” Dr. Jayanthi said. She said that a batch of 100 students was split into three, and classes and timings were staggered. “We are trying to accommodate one student in a room in the hostel, and two in bigger rooms. We have no group dining and have arranged for takeaways,” she added. She said that facilities for safe disposal of masks were made available on all floors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/almost-90-students-return-to-campuses-as-government-medical-colleges-reopen/article35949726.ece
17 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Schools in State reopen after 17 months||The schools that remained closed in the wake of coronavirus pandemic were reopened on Monday, after a gap of about 17 months. The schools, many of them renovated under the ‘Mana Badi Nadu-Nedu scheme, saw a thin attendance. The educational institutions in the State were closed after the Centre announced the Janata Curfew on March 23, followed by the lockdown announced to check the first wave of the pandemic last year. The schools were all set to reopened in March this year. However, the closure continued owing to the second wave. Only some junior, degree and PG colleges reopened this year. Many schools and colleges conducted online classes for over a year. They collected fees from students for online classes. Some educational institutions tried to begin classes at the beginning of this academic year. However, they had to shelve the plans due to the second wave. With the government directing to reopen schools from Monday, classroom teaching resumed in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols. The government vaccinated the teachers and non-teaching staff of all schools. However, many private and corporate schools are making arrangements for reopening their premises shortly. Around 44,500 government schools were reopened and classroom teaching resumed for the higher classes. Parents were seen accompanying their wards to the schools. Private school managements said that there was no clarity on whether classes should be conducted from first to tenth classes or for higher standards only. Books distributed Education officials distributed books, bags and other material to students under the ‘Jagananna Vidya Kanuka’. Parents and students received the ‘Jagananna Vidya Kanuka’ kits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/schools-reopen-after-17-months/article35949595.ece
17 August 2021||Vijayawada,||Govt. decides not to post G.O.s online||The State government on Monday decided not to upload the government orders (G.O.s) in the government portal, https://goir.ap.gov.in/. Principal Secretary (General Administration Department (GAD)-Poll FAC) Revu Mutyala Raju issued a note stating that the system of generating G.O. numbers and display of Government Orders should be done as per the A.P. Secretariat Office Manual and A.P. Government Business Rules. The system prevailing in other States with regard to government orders/Office Memoranda had to be followed, he said. The government, however, did not mention which States were not following the system of not uploading the G.O.s online. “Therefore, the system of generating numbers from ‘GOIR’ website is hereby dispensed with. All the Departments of Secretariat shall take necessary action accordingly,” he said. Uploading of G.O.s in the public domain was started during the tenure of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in combined Andhra Pradesh and has been continuing since 2008. Of late, the government has been facing criticism from the opposition parties and in social media for uploading blank G.O.s on the government portal. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) even submitted a memorandum to the Governor, Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, in this regard. The TDP said issuance of blank G.O.s was projecting the office of the Governor in poor light as they were issued in the name of Governor. TDP flays move Reacting to the development, TDP polit bureau member Varla Ramaiah said that a lack of transparency in the government policies could lead to manipulations, corruption, illegal activities and pose a threat to democratic governance in the long run. The TDP had submitted a memorandum to the Governor in this regard. The party also condemned the government’s decision, he said. In neighbouring Telangana State, more than a year ago, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in Telangana High Court against the Telangana government for not posting the Government orders. The petitioner complained that the people were put to a lot of hardship due to the non-posting of thousands of Government Orders in the government website. The Madras High Court, a couple of months ago, had directed the Tamil Nadu government to ensure that all the government orders and notifications related to COVID-19 were uploaded on its official website https://www.tn.gov.in as well as the special website https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in in a chronological order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-decides-not-to-post-gos-online/article35949600.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Alliance with DMK will continue for local body polls, says Alagiri||The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee will fight the upcoming local body polls in nine districts as part of the DMK alliance and there is no change in the plans, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri has said. The party held deliberations on the local body polls at Satyamurthy Bhavan on Monday. “We have decided to start the work from today itself to ensure a significant victory in the local body polls and to work in coordination with the alliance parties,” Mr. Alagiri told reporters. Asked about the seats it would seek, he said the party would put forth its views on the matter. “We got 25 seats in the Assembly polls and won 18. We had the highest winning percentage,” he said. Mr. Alagiri also criticised Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for claiming that the government was not able to reduce fuel prices due to the cost of oil bonds issued by the erstwhile UPA government. “There is no connection between selling bonds and the fuel prices. What Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman is saying is wrong. Governments normally take loans and there is a plan on how to repay it. [For instance] When the Tamil Nadu government takes a loan, there is a repayment schedule. The repayment is done as per the schedule,” he said. Mr. Alagiri said the Centre had raised cess on fuel and that was the reason for the hike in fuel prices. “The fact is that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has reduced the price of petrol which is benefiting a lot of people. Prime Minister Modi is unable to do it. Ms. Sitharaman must tell the Prime Minister that,” Mr. Alagiri said. He felicitated the TNCC human rights wing head Mahatma Srinivasan and 55 others who had undertaken an 11-day bicycle journey from Chennai to Kanniyakumari to protest against the historically high fuel prices in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/alliance-with-dmk-will-continue-for-local-body-polls-says-alagiri/article35949716.ece
17 August 2021||HUZURABAD (Karimnagar Dt.),||CM announces Dalit Bandhu for every dalit||Observing that Dalit Bandhu covers every dalit in the State including dalit government employees, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday announced that dalits would get reservations in government works and contracts. Addressing a public meeting on Huzurabad outskirts of Karimngar district while launching the scheme, the CM said the government was ready to spend Rs. 1.7 lakh crore for Dalit Bandhu scheme covering 17 lakh dalit families in the State. “You need not have any doubts...every dalit family would be covered under Dalit Bandhu”, the CM declared amid cheers from the crowd. Repeatedly observing that his government was keen on empowering dalits, Mr. Rao said that an IAS officer Rahul Bojja, who was presently SC Welfare Secretary, would be the Secretary in CM’s Office. A separate ‘protective fund’ (rakshana nidhi) would be created for dalits, the CM announced. “If a dalit dies due to some accident or ailment, the family should not slip into debt trap. To support them, this fund would act as safety net,” the CM said. A sum of Rs. 10,000 would be kept aside from the Rs. 10 lakh assistance to each family under Dalit Bandhu scheme. If there are 25,000 dalit families in Huzurabad asssembly constituency, an amount of Rs. 25 crore protective fund would be kept aside with Rs. 10,000 from each beneficiary. To this, government would add another Rs. 25 crore, making a fund of Rs. 50 crore. Entire Dalit Bandh scheme would be monitored by dalit public representatives through committees with six members at the village, 15 at mandal, 24 each at Assembly constituency and district and 42 members at the State level. There are about 25,000 dalit public representatives like village sarpanches, ward members, MPTC and ZPTC members. Thus, an army of over one lakh dalit soldiers would regularly monitor the scheme. KCR assured that no benefits accrued to dalits under different government schemes would be cut off even if they secure Dalit Bandhu. The CM called upon dalit employees, intellectuals, writers, students to take Dalit Bandhu campaign into every nook and corner of the State. “Dalit students and youngsters should go to villages with the theme of educating the masses”, he said. “It had been 75 years since we got Independence...why others have not thought of Dalit Bandhu,” he said. Noting “this scheme is going to trigger a discussion in the country and become a role model for others,” he said success of the scheme rests on the shoulders of different sections of dalits. Under the scheme, beneficiaries would not get cash. The amount would be deposited in the beneficiary’s account. For this, new Dalit Bandhu bank accounts need to be opened. Amount would not be deposited in old bank accounts as that might result in deduction of money for old debts. The beneficiaries would be given new cards with electronic chips. Transactions made using these cards would be monitored by the officials concerned. Dalits can use the money deposited in their accounts for purchasing tractor, machines, any other tools that can create livelihood. One can buy cattle and sell milk. “If you want, you can start wine shops or other businesses,” the CM added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chief-minister-announces-dalit-bandhu-for-every-dalit/article35950058.ece

Students who choose to come to schools should get a consent letter from parents stating that they have been given permission to attend classes and that they do not have any symptoms of COVID-19. The SOPs state that students should be divided in batches of 15 or 20 for the offline classes. Either one or two students should be seated on each bench, and there should be sufficient distance between the benches. One teacher needs to be appointed as nodal officer in each school to ensure guidelines are followed. School managements have been told to ensure that social distance is maintained inside the campus. To avoid crowding of students, multiple entry and exit gates should be used. If any child has cough, fever or cold, such students should be made to sit in a separate room and parents have to take their children back home. Child profile A child profile should be created to track the academic progress of students. This is to be used if examinations cannot be held due to the COVID-19 situation. School buses are allowed to ply but social distancing must be maintained. As schools are reopening after a long gap, schools should be cleaned and sanitised. Schools have been advised to take help of local civic bodies for cleaning. Besides this, they have been asked to rope in donors to provide students masks and sanitisers. All schools have to identify a doctor in the vicinity, the SOPs say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sops-for-reopening-of-schools-announced/article35949642.ece
17 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Police arrest man for cheating job-seeker||The police have arrested Jeri Ithiel Sikha (32), who has been accused of cheating a man of a work visa in Lithuania. According to a complaint, the victim, a nurse, was without a job and she wanted to work abroad. In the first week of April, she approached Sikha, who offered to arrange a work visa for a job for her in Lithuania. Sikha demanded Rs. 5.5 lakh for his work.

The complainant then got to know from his friends that Sikha was not an authorised agent and demanded that he return the money. When he refused, she filed the complaint with Mangaluru North Police. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that the police recently released a list of 15 authorised overseas recruitment agencies functioning in the city. “After this case, a few persons have come to us stating that they too have been cheated,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-arrest-man-for-cheating-job-seeker/article35950172.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Government medical colleges reopen||Almost 90% of students returned to campuses as government medical colleges reopened across the State on Monday. Director of Medical Education R. Narayana Babu, who visited the Government Kilpauk Medical College and the Government Omandurar Medical College, said nearly 90% of students attended the first day of classes, while the remaining 10% were on the way. The Directorate had earlier issued guidelines to institutions to disinfect classrooms, libraries, laboratories, hostel mess, hostel, college and hospital premises, provide handwashing stations wherever necessary, take up daily thermal screening of students on the college and hostel premises and provide face masks to them. While students were told to submit a report of RT-PCR test taken not more than 48 hours prior to joining, colleges in Chennai made arrangements for those who did not get tested prior to arrival. E. Theranirajan, Dean of Madras Medical College, said hostel students were advised to stay quarantined for 14 days before joining physical classes. Similarly, R. Jayanthi, Dean of Government Omandurar Medical College, said hostel students coming from remote areas or areas where there was high infectivity, were asked to quarantine themselves for two to three days. A. Jamila, Vice-Principal of the Government Stanley Medical College, said students were asked to produce negative RT-PCR test reports and vaccination certificates. Small batches “Instructions were given to organise classes in small batches of 25 to 30 students. Apart from individual lecture halls, the seminar hall can be used if a class should have more students. The seminar hall has a capacity of 400, and physical distancing can be maintained well,” she said. At MMC, almost 100% of students had received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Theranirajan added. A sick room was set up on the college campus and a nurse was posted. “We have readied a crash cart, bed and oxygen support as a first aid measure for students,” he said. “We had issued a circular to the students based on guidelines issued by the National Medical Commission and Tamil Nadu Health Department. About 98% of them were vaccinated. We had set up COVID-19 desks to provide on the spot testing,” Dr. Jayanthi said. She said that a batch of 100 students was split into three, and classes and timings were staggered. “We are trying to accommodate one student in a room in the hostel, and two in bigger rooms. We have no group dinings and have arranged for takeaways,” she added. She said facilities for safe disposal of masks were made available on all floors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-medical-colleges-reopen/article35949709.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Traditional priests not excluded, govt. tells HC||The State government has denied having excluded Sivachariyars (Saivite priests) and Bhattachariyars (Vaishnavite priests), who took to priesthood after traditional training under gurukuls, from the zone of consideration while appointing priests to various temples governed by the Agama sastras (ancient religious prescriptions). Appearing before Justice Anita Sumanth, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram on Monday said temples under the control of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department was accepting applications from traditional priests too, along with those who had undergone a certificate course in Agama sastras at government institutions set up to train people from all castes. However, advocate P. Valliappan, representing the All-India Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal Seva Sangam, said the government had recently “chased out” 24 traditional priests from various temples and filled the vacancies with those who had completed the certificate course. “The 24 priests are virtually on the streets now,” the counsel said, accusing the government of having violated court orders. He said Justice Sumanth had granted an order of status quo on the writ petition filed by the Sivachariyargal Sangam on August 8. But since only one temple had been made a respondent to the case, the government had gone ahead and appointed new archakars to 24 other temples, he said. The counsel said now the Sivachariyargal Sangam had taken out an application to include 37 other temples, including the Subramaniaswamy temple in Tiruchendur, the Prasanna Venkatachalapathi temple in Thuraiyur and the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai as respondents to the case filed by it and urged the court to allow the impleading petition. Opposing the plea, the A-G said Chennai-based advocate S. Sridharan had already filed a public interest litigation petition against the appointment of people from different castes as temple priests and had insisted upon continuing the traditional practice of appointing people from a particular sect as priests. That PIL petition was slated to be listed for hearing on Wednesday. Therefore, the present writ petition filed by the Sivachariyargal Sangam could also be tagged along with the PIL petition pending before the first Division Bench of the court, he insisted. Accepting his plea, and because the High Court Registry too had put up a note in that regard, the judge said she would order placing the present matter too before the Chief Justice.

17 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||No Opposition parties in Nagaland Assembly now||The 60-member Nagaland Assembly now has no MLA in the Opposition. The Naga People’s Front (NPF) — the State’s only Opposition party — was on Monday inducted into the State government, headed by Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, to “work collectively towards achieving a peaceful and amicable solution” to the protracted Naga political issue. The issue pertains to the peace process with several extremist groups, primarily the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, which has been hanging fire for more 24 years. The Nagaland House has an effective strength of 59 after the death of an MLA. The NPF had won 25 seats in the 2018 Assembly election but suspended seven MLAs for hobnobbing with the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). Nagaland United Govt. “The decision to accept the Opposition-less united government has been taken unanimously by the primary PDA partners, namely NDPP and BJP including 2 (two) Independent MLAs supporting the PDA government… Henceforth, the government shall be called Nagaland United Government,” a joint statement said.Apart from Mr. Rio, the 12 signatories of the statement included Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Yangthungo Patton and NPF veteran T.R. Zeliang, a former Chief Minister. The Core Committee of the Parliamentary Committee on Naga political issue had earlier resolved and affirmed the joint united approach in achieving a solution to the Naga political issue. The NPF legislature party had also endorsed the concept of Opposition-less government. “The political parties shall appeal to all Naga Political Groups (read insurgent groups) to make serious efforts towards unity and reconciliation. The political parties shall ensure unity of their members in the Assembly on the issue,” the statement reads. Mr. Rio was with the NPF before falling out with the party and joining the NDPP floated ahead of the 2018 Nagaland polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-opposition-in-nagaland-assembly/article35949603.ece

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Opposition blocking laws meant to spur economy, says Nirmala||Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday took on the Opposition for its obstructionist approach in Parliament on legislations aimed at boosting the economy’s revival and dismissed criticism of rushing through the passage of Bills. “They ask us — What have we done for the economy? But when we are doing it, they were there to obstruct. This is a sad, very sorry situation,” said Ms. Sitharaman, who steered seven Bills pertaining to her Ministries in the monsoon session, including changes to tax laws to scrap retrospectively applicable provisions. Some of the Bills were passed within minutes over persistent bedlam in both Houses, while the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021, was passed last Wednesday in the Rajya Sabha amid shocking scenes that are now being probed by Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu. The Opposition had demanded the Bill be sent to a select committee for scrutiny. “From the outside, it may look like we pushed the Bills through without discussion, but we were ready for a discussion. If the argument [against passing the Bills] is that greater scrutiny is required, I am not sure that was the desire [of the Opposition], because there was huge hungama [ruckus] even over the Factoring Bill, where a Parliamentary Standing Committee had examined it and sent recommendations,” she pointed out. “I was looking forward to a session where the Opposition would discuss the Bills and standing up and answering them… But in most Bills, only some members could participate [in the debate],” she said. “The economy is now clearly coming out of the challenges posed by the second COVID-19 wave — core sectors are seeing substantial growth, power consumption is growing and even the private sector is coming around well… We are here to hear and will keep responding,” she said, adding that timely legislative support was necessary for the economy.

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Evacuation paused as Kabul airport shuts||Concern about Indian diplomats, security personnel and citizens grew on Monday, as the Afghanistan airspace was shut down for commercial flights and thousands of Afghans seeking to flee the country overran the tarmac at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. In meetings led by the Cabinet Secretary, officials of the Union Home and External Affairs Ministries and the National Security Council held briefings about the “deteriorating” security situation in Kabul and the plans for evacuating Indian nationals, Sikhs and Hindus and Afghans who have been India’s “partners”, indicating for the first time that the government may be open to accepting Afghans of all religions. According to sources, India is hoping to use its military C-17 Globemaster aircraft to bring back diplomats, security personnel and 15 to 20 remaining Indian nationals from Kabul, but this is contingent on access to the road to the Kabul airport, manned by the Taliban, access into the airport, which is being secured by the U.S.-led NATO forces, and the permission to land flights. A C-17 landed at the airport’s military area on Sunday night, and brought back about 40 Indian nationals on Monday morning. Officials said another C-17 stands “ready” to bring back the rest, including Embassy staff, personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police that guard the Embassy, and other Indian nationals. “Commercial operations from Kabul airport have been suspended today. This has forced a pause in our repatriation efforts. We are awaiting the resumption of flights to restart the process,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement after no Air India flights were able to land and take off from the airport, a day after gun-toting Taliban militia took control of the city. According to videos of the incident, three Afghans were killed when they tried to cling on to the wing of a U.S. military plane taking off from the airport and fell to their deaths, adding to the panic among the crowds gathered there. Meanwhile, the MEA said it was “in touch” with members of Afghanistan’s Sikh and Hindu communities and would facilitate their “repatriation” to India if they wished to leave. “There are also a number of Afghans who have been our partners in the promotion of our mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours. We will stand by them,” the MEA statement added. Officials did not confirm the numbers, but the Indian Embassy in Kabul, which has remained operational through the developments in Kabul, had issued dozens of visas in the past week. Asked about how many Indians remain in Afghanistan, an official who did not wish to be named said most Indians working on various construction and infrastructure projects in Afghanistan had left already as the Embassy had put out several advisories asking all workers, engineers, and media personnel to take commercial flights and return to India. This number is down from about 1,500 Indians that were working in Afghanistan, according to a reply by the government in Parliament in early August. “We had circulated emergency contact numbers and had also been extending assistance to community members. We are aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them,” the MEA statement said.

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||2.89 cr. doses available with States: govt.||Nearly 3,250 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to those who have been recorded on the CoWIN portal as people with disabilities. Additionally, 1.87 lakh vaccine doses have been administered to prisoners across the country, according to information submitted by the Health Ministry in the Rajya Sabha during the recently concluded Parliament session. It has noted that this data is as per the information available on the portal as on August 4. While the Ministry is yet to take a decision on the mixed use of COVID-19 vaccines, officials confirmed to The Hindu that talks were on to ensure speedy availability of foreign vaccines cleared by the government for use in the country. It said on Monday that 56,81,14,630 vaccine doses had been provided to the States and Union Territories so far, through all sources. “Of this, the total consumption, including wastage, is 54,22,75,723 doses (according to data available at 8 a.m.). More than 2.89 crore (2,89,47,890) balance and unutilised COVID vaccine doses are still available with the States and private hospitals to be administered,” the Ministry said in its release. The Ministry said that it had issued directions to all stakeholders on near-to-home COVID vaccination centres (NHCVC) for elderly and differently abled citizens earlier this year, making the vaccination programme more accessible to them as they may not be able to travel to the vaccination centres. Community approach “The NHCVC follows a community-based approach where the sessions can be conducted nearer to home, e.g. at community/resident welfare association (RWA) centres, panchayat ghar, school buildings etc. for the elderly and differently abled citizens. States have been again issued advisory regarding facilities to be provided to differently abled persons for COVID-19 treatment, management and vaccination, stating that vaccination can also be prioritised for differently abled persons,” the Ministry said. It said the Central government had made all arrangements to secure COVID-19 vaccines for the eligible beneficiaries as per production and availability. “The Central government has been providing free supply of COVID vaccines in enough quantity to States for administration to prioritised beneficiaries as recommended by NEGVAC. It is also providing 15 days’ advance visibility of vaccine availability to States, with an advice to prepare and publicise in advance district-wise plan for acceleration of vaccination coverage while being cognizant of the total availability of Covid vaccines,” said the Health Ministry. Giving an overview of the vaccination drive in the country, the Ministry said the pace of vaccination had improved significantly from an average 2.35 lakh doses administered a day in January to an average 43.41 lakh a day in July. The Central government has issued detailed Standard Operating Procedures to facilitate vaccination of people without identity cards, including prisoners,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/289-cr-doses-available-with-states-govt/article35949532.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘NDA left paying for UPA bonds’||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said States gained more than the Centre from higher fuel prices as they charged ad-valorem taxes while the Centre’s taxes were fixed. Referring to the recent Tamil Nadu Budget announcement cutting State taxes on petrol, Ms. Sitharaman said, “It is very interesting — the taxes were hiked by Rs. 7 a litre and now brought down by Rs. 3… I am not pointing a finger. It’s a decision of the State government,” she said. “The present dispensation of Tamil Nadu was also in power when oil bonds worth Rs. 1.44 lakh crore were issued by the UPA to show reduced oil prices in 2013. Who is paying for it, the Modi 2.0 government,” the Minister said. Ms Sitharaman also referred to the white paper issued by the new Tamil Nadu administration, which indicates the State has about Rs. 5 lakh crore of debt to contend with. “If (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji had released such a paper in 2014, we wouldn’t have to explain this (high fuel prices)... a white paper should have been issued to say what we inherited as oil bonds from the UPA, ” she said. “Look at the way governments have handled such a delicate issue. Look at the trickery… they say they reduced prices so we should do it too,” the Minister concluded. “Today, you are asking me why we are not reducing the prices. I am subsidising the reduction they had offered. So far, Rs. 70,195.72 crore has been paid as interest on outstanding bonds worth around Rs. 1.31 lakh crore,” she added. Ahead of the elections, the DMK in Tamil Nadu had promised that the price of petrol will be reduced by Rs. 5 per litre and diesel by Rs. 4 per litre.

Conceding that consumers were justified in wishing for lower fuel prices, Ms. Sitharaman, however, didn’t signal any imminent relief from the Centre on the excise duties and cess it levies, stressing that fuel prices are “a very difficult issue” and “the Petroleum Ministry is seized of the matter”. “It need not always be the case, that the Centre should cut (taxes) and then States will follow… A taxpayer is only looking at the price and wants it to come down, (they) don’t care whether it is Central taxes or State taxes,” she said. Arguing that States gained more than the Centre from higher fuel prices as they charged ad-valorem taxes while the Centre’s taxes were fixed, Ms. Sitharaman alluded to the Tamil Nadu Budget announcement to cut State taxes on fuel. “It is very interesting — the taxes were hiked by Rs. 7 a litre and now brought down by Rs. 3… I am not pointing a finger. It’s a decision of the State government. The present dispensation of Tamil Nadu was also in power when oil bonds worth Rs. 1.44 lakh crore were issued by the UPA to show reduced oil prices in 2013. Who is paying for it... the Modi 2.0 government,” the Minister said. White paper Ms. Sitharaman also referred to the white paper issued by the new Tamil Nadu administration, which indicates the State has about Rs. 5 lakh crore of debt to contend with. “If (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji had released such a paper in 2014, we wouldn’t have to explain this (high fuel prices)... a white paper should have been issued to say what we inherited as oil bonds from the UPA. ” “Look at the way governments have handled such a delicate issue. Look at the trickery… they say they reduced prices, so we should do it too,” the Minister concluded. “Today, you are asking me why we are not reducing the prices. I am subsidising the reduction they had offered. So far, Rs. 70,195.72 crore has been paid as interest on outstanding bonds worth around Rs. 1.31 lakh crore,” she added. “Another Rs. 37,840 crore is payable as interest till 2025-26, taking the interest alone close to Rs. 1 lakh crore,” she asserted, adding this is also taxpayer money.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finmin-slams-tns-stand-on-fuel-taxes/article35949580.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI/KOLKATA,||Sushmita Dev joins Trinamool||Sushmita Dev, former Lok Sabha member from Assam and president of the All-India Mahila Congress, joined the Trinamool Congress on Monday in the presence of the party’s national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee, and leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien. She also met Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the State Secretariat ‘Nabanna Building’. “Will give it all I have got..@MamataOfficial thank you # Khela Hobe,” Ms. Dev replied to a tweet from the party’s official handle that welcomed her into the Trinamool family. With yet another high-profile exit, the spotlight is back on the leadership issue within the Congress. Kapil Sibal, one of Congress’s group of 23 dissenters (G-23), tweeted that the “oldies” are blamed for trying to “strengthen” the Congress while the party continues to “move with eyes wide shut”. Lok Sabha member Karti Chidambaram said the party needed to reflect why people were leaving and there was “no point in being blasé about it”. Ms. Dev was once considered a close aide of former party chief Rahul Gandhi. Her exit may have implications for Opposition unity. A section of Congress leaders have often accused the Trinamool of “poaching” their leaders in Bengal and the high-profile exit comes barely four days before Congress president Sonia Gandhi virtually interacts with Ms. Banerjee. The first indications of Ms. Dev’s exit came in the form of a change in her bio on her Twitter handle where she called herself a “former member of the Indian National Congress”. Then her letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, dated August 15, surfaced on social media. In the letter, she expressed her desire to start a new chapter in public service. Ms. Dev did not mention a reason, but her comments after meeting the West Bengal Chief Minister may hold a clue. “It was an excellent discussion and clearly, she [Mamata Banerjee] has excellent future vision for the party and I hope to be helpful in that regard,” said Ms. Dev. Stunned by the development, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala first claimed that Ms. Dev’s letter had not reached Ms. Gandhi, and then wished his former colleague the “very best” for her future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sushmita-dev-joins-trinamool/article35949504.ece
17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Broader representation must: India||The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) held its second meeting on Afghanistan in 10 days, as the country witnessed chaotic scenes over the weekend, with the Taliban taking over Kabul. Addressing the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asked the insurgents to protect the rights of Afghans. “The world is following events there with a heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead,” he said. “I remind all parties of their obligation to protect civilians,” he said. “I call upon the Taliban and all parties to respect and protect international humanitarian law and the rights and freedoms of all persons.” Mr. Guterres said there were “chilling” reports of “severe restrictions on human rights” emerging from across the country. He said he was particularly concerned about the rights of women and girls and that their “hard-won” rights must be protected. Afghanistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ghulam Isaczai said, “We are extremely concerned about Taliban not honouring their promises and commitments made in their statements at Doha and other international fora.” India’s Permanent Representative T.S. Tirumurti said the situation was of great concern to India. “As a neighbour of Afghanistan and a friend to its people, the situation is of great concern to us in India. Everyone is concerned about the increasing violations of the fundamental rights of Afghan citizens,” he said. Saying a dispensation with a broad representation would gain more “acceptability’ and ‘legitimacy”, Mr. Tirumurti called for the voices of Afghan women, the aspirations of its children and the rights of its minorities to be respected. The Ambassador did not refer to the Taliban by name during his speech. Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer if there was zero tolerance for terrorism and if Afghanistan did not become a base from which terrorists could attack other countries, he said. American Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said civilians, including journalists and non-combatants, must be protected. The U.S. said Afghanistan cannot ever again be a base for terrorism. It was joined by China in this. Beijing’s deputy representative Geng Shuang said terror groups had developed in Afghanistan and named the IS, the Al-Qaeda and the ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Movement) as examples. “China takes note of what was said by the Afghan Taliban on Sunday that war in Afghanistan had ended and that it would negotiate to establish an open inclusive Islamic government and it will take responsible actions to ensure the safety of Afghan citizens and foreign missions,” Mr. Geng said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/broader-representation-must-india/article35949581.ece
17 August 2021||New Delhi,||Afghans in India fear for their kin||As visuals of fleeing residents dominated television screens, with the Taliban having wrested control from the Western-backed government of Ashraf Ghani, thousands of Afghans in India, including students across the country, watched in fear for the future of women, children and young men. For the 150 Afghan students studying in Osmania University in Hyderabad, the situation filled them with trepidation and concern. They don’t want to go back home and yet worry for the safety of those left behind. “Don’t come back home now!” is the plea from Afghans to their sons and daughters — a sentiment echoed by Afghan students in Hyderabad. “I told my family I will not come back if situation there becomes hostile,” said a 22-year-old Afghan student, who did not wish to be named. “We are worried about human rights, women’s rights, of our people. The Taliban are giving assurances, but only time will tell if they will stick to it. We don’t want to see what happened 20 years ago.” Another immediate concern is about rising prices of food and other resources, and loss of jobs. “Our families are not stepping out of home. There is silence now. But everyone is scared,” said Samiullah, another Afghan student pursuing psychology in OU. There are around 200 Afghan students in Telangana, including 10 to 12 women. Md Yousaf, president of the Afghan Students Association, said the visas of some students would expire by the end of August and others at the end of the year. “We request the Indian government to extend the visas and provide some financial help,” he said. Nightmare returns For many who fled the Taliban, the nightmare has returned to haunt them. The “Afghan colony” in Lajpat Nagar and Bhogal, New Delhi, that has grocery shops, medical stores, travel agencies and restaurants catering mostly to students, medical tourists and refugees from Afghanistan was abuzz with activity as people made enquiries about each other’s families back home. Matiullah, who runs a travel agency in the market, said over the past few days, he has been receiving hundreds of calls from Afghans here on how they can book flight tickets or secure travel documents to ensure safe passage of their family members to India. “I cried all night thinking about the situation. My entire family is back home. I came to India nine months ago after my father who was a soldier in the Afghanistan Army was killed by the Taliban outside our home,” said 24-year-old Matiullah. “The Taliban would come to our homes and shops if we were not at the mosque for namaz and women were not allowed to go out of their homes. Even wearing jeans, the pair of jeans that I am wearing right now, was considered a crime. My country is now finished. I do not know what the future holds for Afghanistan or me,” said a distraught Matiullah. There are students stuck in Kabul who want to return to India. Ahmed Qasemi (name changed) is desperate to get back to finish his research work at the Central University, Kerala. “We now face an uncertain future and fear for our safety,” he said. With the Indian Embassy shutting down, the students are waiting for a window to escape. Qasemi along with others returned to Afghanistan during the first of the wave of the pandemic. Omar Tariq, 22, at the Cochin University of Science and Technology sits glued to his TV screen worried about the fate of his family. Tariq is among the many Afghan students pursuing academic programmes in India as part of an initiative under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Students studying in Mumbai too, had returned home following the pandemic, and are now desperate to return. Around 92 Afghan students studying in the University of Mysuru have requested the Director’s assistance in extending their student visas. Interestingly, out of the 2,000 applicants from international students, over 1,300 belong to Afghan students. The sudden withdrawal of the U.S. from Afghanistan has led to an exodus of people from their homeland fearing violent reprisal. Canada, Britain, Europe, Turkey are suddenly faced with the prospect of providing a safe haven for the fleeing refugees. India, too, will have to take a hard look at the looming crisis.

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||ESIC notifies relief scheme for COVID-hit||The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation has notified a relief scheme for the dependents of ESI insured persons in case of their death due to COVID-19 that would give a minimum of Rs. 1,800 a month. The ESIC had published the details of the scheme for inviting objections and suggestions from the public on June 18 for 30 days. On August 11, the ESIC notified the scheme, saying the suggestions had been considered and the scheme was being notified. The scheme would cover the families of the insured who had been registered on the ESIC portal for at least three months before being diagnosed with COVID-19 and had been in employment on the date of diagnosis. In case of death due to COVID-19, the spouse, son up to 25 years of age, unmarried daughter and widowed mother of the insured would be eligible for the relief. The scheme, which would be effective for two years from March 24, 2020, would provide for 90% of the average daily wages of the insured to be paid to dependents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/esic-notifies-relief-scheme-for-covid-hit/article35949525.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘We fear for our families back home’||Safely seated in a packed Kam Air flight that left Kabul at 11.45 a.m. on Sunday, a 27-year-old man from Afghanistan was overcome not only with a feeling of relief as he had managed to flee his country in the nick of time but also with fear as he wondered what would happen to his family that he was leaving behind. Behind the counter of a medical store in the bylanes of Lajpat Nagar here 24 hours later, the man, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the scene at the airport in Kabul was one of chaos and desperation as thousands tried to leave the country. “I had a business visa for India and my father is a political figure who could use his influence to get me out. I was lucky to be able to board the flight. At the airport, people were trying to use medical visas and any other documents they had to try and fly out before the city fell into the hands of the Taliban. The flight I was on was packed beyond capacity and there were people even sitting on the seats reserved for the crew and on the aisle,” he said. Many Afghan nationals living in colonies such as Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar said they were afraid to speak about what was happening in their country and also to disclose their identity. “The Taliban rules by instilling fear and they have managed to do that. I am here as a refugee and I don’t know what will happen to me or where I will go but I know that going back to Afghanistan is not an option. The progress that the country had made in the last 20 years is all over,” said a 35-year-old who runs a mobile recharge shop in Bhogal. Farshid Mohamaddi, who works at a grocery store in Lajpat Nagar, said thinking about the situation was like living in a nightmare. He came with his family to find employment and a better life in India but is finding it hard to find employment. “My dream is to somehow reach Canada where I will be able to give a better life to my children. Here, over the past few days when many people from Afghanistan started coming, rents which were very low due to the pandemic are also rising. Our lives are now in the hands of governments that are willing to help us as we have lost our home. The question of going back does not arise,” he said. Several Afghans could be seen arriving from various parts of the country to the colony in Lajpat Nagar with suitcases and families in tow to find out what they could do about extending their visa to stay on in India. Saddam, who arrived from Rajasthan, said: “I am here with my entire family. We do not have permits to stay on. I have come to Delhi with the hope that we can secure some arrangements and stay on in India or go to another country that will welcome us.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-fear-for-our-families-back-home/article35949513.ece
17 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Two-child policy: U.P. law panel submits draft Bill||After reviewing over 8,000 suggestions from the public, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission on Monday submitted a report and draft Bill of a new population control law proposing two-child policy to the State government. Panel chairperson Justice Aditya Nath Mittal said the report and the draft bill of The Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021 were submitted to the Chief Minister. The Commission has last month uploaded the draft on its website and invited suggestions from people. The report said 8,200 of the 8,500 suggestions were in support of the Bill. The Commission adopted the suggestion that special facilities extended to BPL (below poverty line) families who have only one child and undertake voluntary sterilisation would be extended to all couples irrespective of the category. It, however, rejected suggestions that the right to vote of persons having more than two children be curtailed and that they also be barred from the benefit of reservation. “Right to vote is a constitutional and fundamental right. Therefore, the State government has no competence to make such law,” the report said. A person who has more than two children after the law comes into force would be debarred from welfare schemes. The person will be barred from contesting elections to local authority or any body of the local self-government, the draft Bill says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/two-child-policy-up-law-panel-submits-draft-bill/article35949539.ece

The Security Council, whose President is India, met for an open meeting for over an hour on Monday, following which it went into closed consultations. Mr. Guterres’s remarks were made in the open segment. “I remind all parties of their obligation to protect civilians,” he said. “I call upon the Taliban and all parties to respect and protect international humanitarian law and the rights and freedoms of all persons.” Mr. Guterres said there were ‘chilling’ reports of “severe restrictions on human rights” emerging from across the country. He said he was particularly concerned about the rights of women and girls and that their “ hard-won” rights must be protected. “They are looking to the international community for support — the same international community that assured them that opportunities would be expanded, education would be guaranteed, freedoms would spread and rights would be secured,” he said. The Secretary-General asked the international community to unite to ensure that Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terrorist organisations. “I appeal to the Security Council — and the international community as a whole — to stand together, to work together and act together — and use all tools at its disposal to suppress the global terrorist threat in Afghanistan and to guarantee that basic human rights will be respected,” he said. Mr. Guterres sad he was relieved that U.N. staff and premises had largely been respected and he called on the Taliban to “honour the integrity and inviolability” of diplomats and diplomatic premises. “In a statement issued on Sunday, the Taliban said they would work with existing institutions. It is crucial that civil servant salaries continue to be paid, infrastructure is maintained, airports are reopened and health and education services continue,” he said. He also asked Afghanistan to comply with international agreements to which it is a party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/taliban-must-protect-human-rights-of-afghans-guterres/article35949520.ece
17 August 2021||New Delhi,||SC raises query on Tribunal Reforms Bill||The Supreme Court on Monday challenged the government to produce material showing its reasons for introducing the Tribunal Reforms Bill, 2021, which abolishes nine appellate tribunals and revives provisions of an ordinance struck down by the Supreme Court, in Parliament. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, put the government in the dock about the complete absence of material justifying the Bill and the lack of proper debate in Parliament before it was made into law. The Bill replaced the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021. The provisions in the ordinance regarding conditions of service and tenure of Tribunal Members and Chairpersons were struck down by the Supreme Court. However, the provisions re-appeared in the Tribunal Reforms Bill introduced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on August 2 in the Lok Sabha. The Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha by voice vote without a debate amid protests by the Opposition parties over the Pegasus controversy and other laws. The Rajya Sabha cleared the Bill on August 9. “In spite of the ordinance being struck down by the court, the Bill has been passed. There was no debate. We did not see any. We are not questioning the wisdom of the Parliament… We are not saying anything about the Parliament’s power.... But at least we must know the reasons of the government in introducing the Bill… the Honourable Minister has but just one word… Please show us the debate which took place on the Bill. This is a serious issue,” Chief Justice Ramana said. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta submitted that the Bill had matured into an Act. It was passed by Parliament in its wisdom. “Can you show us the records giving the reasons for which the Bill was placed in the Parliament? Can you show us what was discussed about the Bill before it was passed,” Chief Justice Ramana asked. The CJI said that despite the Supreme Court’s observations in an August 6 hearing and production of a note showing over 240 vacancies in key tribunals where thousands of cases were pending, not a single appointment had been made. Mr. Mehta insisted that some appointments had been made to the Central Administrative Tribunal. The rest of the appointments were “under process”. “Show us one appointment that you have made… Whenever we ask the Ministry about tribunal appointments, you say it is ‘under process’... If you want to make appointments, nothing prevents you from appointing… Till yesterday, we did not hear anything about any appointments to tribunals,” the CJI voiced the court’s scepticism. The CJI repeated his question whether the government was moving towards closing down the tribunals. The court scheduled the hearing on August 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-raises-query-on-tribunal-reforms-bill/article35949537.ece
17 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks Centre’s response to petition on data breaches||The Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to respond to a petition highlighting the inaction of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) over reports of alleged cybersecurity breaches and data leaks on online platforms of BigBasket, Domino’s, MobiKwik and Air India. Justice Rekha Palli granted time to the Centre’s counsel to seek instructions on the issue while posting the case for hearing on September 23. The petition filed by Yarlagadda Kiran Chandra, general secretary of the Free Software Movement of India, said that despite numerous representations to CERT-In to investigate the alleged data breaches nothing had been done so far. CERT-In is the nodal agency operational since 2004 for responding to computer security incidents. The petition stated that there was no law governing data protection in India currently. “Thereby, the aggrieved users do not have any legislative recourse against such breaches. Therefore, an investigation by CERT-In on frequent data breaches at mass level becomes important to safeguard the privacy of users,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-seeks-centres-response-to-petition-on-data-breaches/article35949493.ece

A three-judge Bench headed by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said Mr. Deshmukh was free to access other remedies available to him under the law. Mr. Deshmukh’s counsel said the case was a classic “political witch-hunt”. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Enforcement Directorate, countered that there were serious allegations of money laundering in the case. The top court was hearing a batch of pleas, including those challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED had earlier issued summons to the 71-year-old Nationalist Congress Party leader in connection with a criminal case registered under the PMLA related to an alleged Rs. 100-crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to his resignation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-declines-to-hear-anil-deshmukhs-plea/article35949534.ece

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Snooping allegations mere conjecture: Centre||“We are dealing with a sensitive matter. Attempts are being made to make it sensational,” Mr. Mehta complained. “If the government is reluctant about filing a detailed affidavit, how can we compel them to?” the CJI turned to senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for veteran journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar. “Well, that would mean they don’t want to admit or deny [to using Pegasus]... Then I can argue that they have not denied. Then the matter gets more serious... We want a straight answer. Did the government or any of its agencies use Pegasus? That question does not deal with national security,” Mr. Sibal replied. “Again, if the government has used Pegasus, did they use it through the Home Secretary. That again does not concern national security... So, let them file an affidavit,” he added. IT legislation hailed The Solicitor General clarified that there was no reluctance of any kind on the part of the government. “The truth must come out,” Mr. Mehta said. He referred to the Information Technology Act, which dealt with the regime of interceptions, monitoring, etc, of digital communications, as a “beautiful legislation”. Mr. Mehta said the Act came into effect during the tenure of Mr. Sibal as Minister. “Mr. Mehta, beauty over the years becomes no longer beautiful. It was once beautiful, but is no longer so the way you are using it,” Mr. Sibal retorted. At one point, Justice Aniruddha Bose, on the Bench, asked whether there was any material other than news reports to suggest ‘violation’ had taken place. To this, Mr. Sibal said the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had stated in the Lok Sabha in 2019 that social media messaging platform, WhatsApp, had informed the government about attempts to breach the mobile phones of 1,400 users globally, including 121 users in India, using Pegasus. The court stood over the arguments in the case to Tuesday, while at the same time asking Mr. Mehta to mull over with officials the point of filing a detailed affidavit. The two-page affidavit, containing just about six paragraphs, was filed by an Additional Secretary in the MeitY. The official said he could not ‘deal’ with “all the facts and contentions” in the petitions due to “limited time”, but he nevertheless went on to ‘unequivocally’ deny the allegations in them. He said a “bare perusal” of the petitions revealed that they were based on “conjectures, surmises” drawn from “unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material”. However, the Ministry affidavit, in its fifth paragraph, said the government would form a Committee of Experts to dispel the “wrong narrative” spread by “vested interests”.Senior advocate Shyam Divan found the affidavit ‘skimpy’ while senior advocate Meenakshi Arora termed it “delightfully non-committal”. Sibal’s rebuttals Mr. Sibal rebutted the affidavit on five points. One, he said it was filed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and not the Ministry of Home Affairs which authorised surveillance under the law. Secondly, the affidavit skips the part on whether the government or its agencies used Pegasus at all. Thirdly, he said if the government did not get the time to study the petitions and reply to them, then the court should give them the time. The court agreed to this view. Fourthly, the senior lawyer countered that the affidavit did not even say whether the “facts and contentions” in the petitions were right or wrong. “Finally, and most importantly, we do not want a government who might have used Pegasus to form a Committee of Experts to inquire into the issue. As far as I am concerned, the issue is simple. If the government says they have used Pegasus, there is no need for a Committee. If the government says they have not used Pegasus, then too, there is no need for a Committee,” Mr. Sibal said. “For what purpose is this Committee?” the CJI asked. Mr. Mehta said the offer to form a Committee of Experts was a “bona fide gesture” from the government to clear the air. The law officer even invited the Supreme Court to frame the terms of reference of the Committee. He said the Committee’s task would be “highly technical”. He said it would be peopled by “neutral experts”. “A government-appointed committee should be trusted... You must know that everything on this issue is based on news reports, but let the Committee go into it...” Mr. Mehta submitted. Mr. Sibal submitted that France has initiated a national level investigation into the Pegasus surveillance. Israel has raided the offices of the NSO Group, which is the creator of Pegasus. The U.S. courts are seized of the issue. “But India still says everything is alright... This is wholly unacceptable,” Mr. Sibal submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/snooping-allegations-mere-conjecture-centre/article35949494.ece
17 August 2021||Mumbai,||Pawar underlines need to lift 50% cap on quota||The Central government’s hasty move to pass the Bill giving rights to States to identify OBCs without lifting the 50% reservation limit is to deceive the OBC community, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Monday. Addressing a press conference on a wide range of issues at the NCP headquarters, Mr. Pawar also targeted Union Home Minister Amit Shah over the Pegasus spyware issue, saying that it could be the Home Ministry which had got involved and a probe may reveal the truth. “All States in the country have already crossed the 50% reservation limit, including Maharashtra. Giving rights to the States to identify OBCs will not serve any purpose, because the reservation limit has not been lifted. All of the Opposition members raised this issue in Parliament, which went unanswered from the government’s side,” Mr. Pawar said. Rallying OBCs Till the reservation cap is lifted, even Marathas cannot be given benefits of reservation, Mr. Pawar pointed out, adding that his party will be uniting all OBC forces to create public opinion demanding the removal of 50% reservation limit. Mr Pawar said a caste census must be held, empirical data should be provided to the State governments and 50% reservation limit should be lifted. “Only then OBCs will get actual benefits, otherwise they will continue to be misled,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pawar-underlines-need-to-lift-50-cap-on-quota/article35949495.ece
17 August 2021||GUWAHATI/KOLKATA,||TMC’s ambitions may get a shot in the arm||Former Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev’s entry could give a boost to the national ambitions of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) via some north-eastern States, specifically Assam and Tripura that have a sizeable Bengali population. Ms. Dev, a former MP from southern Assam’s Silchar constituency, quit the Congress on Sunday night and joined the TMC in Kolkata on Monday. She later met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. “I had a fruitful discussion with the CM. She clearly has an excellent vision for the party and I hope to be helpful in that regard,” Ms. Dev said in a video sent via WhatsApp, indicating the role the TMC expects her to play in strengthening the party in Assam. The TMC had in the past 30 days made it clear that it had set its sights on the northeast, by befriending Assam’s firebrand activist-turned-MLA Akhil Gogoi, and sending senior party leaders to Tripura, to the visible annoyance of the ruling BJP there. Mr. Gogoi wields influence in some pockets of the Assamese-dominated Brahmaputra Valley that is geographically and psychologically separated from the Bengali-dominated Barak Valley comprising three southern Assam districts and 15 of Assam’s 126 Assembly seats. Ms. Dev was considered the tallest Congress leader of Barak Valley, having taken over from her father and former Union Minister Santosh Mohan Dev. A senior TMC leader in Kolkata said the party was looking for a credible face to extend its influence in the northeast, and there “cannot be anyone better than Ms. Dev who brings the legacy of her father with her”. There is an air of hope in Tripura, primarily because of her father’s role in installing a Congress government in 1988 and winning the Tripura West parliamentary constituency in 1999. “Tripura has a long association with the Dev family, and there is no reason why Sushmita cannot replicate her father’s success for TMC. Disgruntlement with the BJP-led government has already seen many people joining our party,” Subal Bhowmik, a former Congress veteran who joined the TMC recently, told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tmcs-ambitions-may-get-a-shot-in-the-arm/article35949497.ece

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India should prepare for security threats: Madhav||The BJP on Monday did not put out any official statement on the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan but two former general secretaries of the party cautioned that the development did not portend well for India and that the country should brace itself for terror attacks. Former BJP general secretary and current executive member of the RSS Ram Madhav tweeted that the Pakistani mentoring of the Taliban would lead to severe security challenges in India. “Taliban has over 30,000 mercenaries trained in Pakistan by ISI, in power in Kabul. Taliban leadership will now deploy them ‘elsewhere’ with the help of mentor Pakistan. India should brace for serious security challenges. Taliban may eventually consume Pakistan and China too, but the immediate threat is for India.” Another former general secretary and current in-charge for Madhya Pradesh P. Muralidhar Rao declared that a “war” had in fact just begun rather than concluded. “Unfolding events in #Afghanistan are ringing alarm bells all over including India. If anyone believes ‘war is over’ — [they are] living in a fool’s paradise. New war has begun. We Indians should not get caught ‘off guard’!” he tweeted. Privately too, party leaders said the short-term outlook was “quite bad” for India as it might soon become the focus of terror attacks from a secure Taliban and a Pakistan in control of Afghanistan and the militia there. The Taliban had sheltered the hijackers of Air India flight IC 814 during the tenure of the NDA government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leading to the death of one passenger and the release of three terrorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-should-prepare-for-security-threats-madhav/article35949507.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Agencies brace for rise in drug trafficking||The anti-drug law enforcement agencies are suspecting a steep surge in cross-border trafficking of heroin and crystal methamphetamine with the rapid Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Drugs have been a major source of revenue for the Taliban. With the collapse of Afghanistan’s economy, the Taliban will rely heavily on drugs money to maintain control over their cadres. In the recent past, we have already noticed an increase in drug trafficking in the region, mostly through maritime routes,” said a senior Customs official. According to the latest World Drug Report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Afghanistan reported a 37% increase in the extent of land used for illicit cultivation of opium poppy during 2020 compared to the previous year. Heroin is manufactured using the morphine extracted from opium. The country accounted for 85% of the global total opium production last year. Despite the improved capabilities of Afghan specialised units over the years, drug seizures and arrests had minimal impact on the country’s opium-poppy cultivation and production. “The economic crisis brought on by the pandemic will only increase the appeal of illicit crop cultivation,” said the report. This apart, Afghanistan is also turning out to be a major source for methamphetamine. In the neighbouring Iran, the proportion of Afghan-origin methamphetamine seizure increased from less than 10% in 2015 to over 90% in 2019, while seizures in Afghanistan increased almost sevenfold that year compared to 2018. The drug is prepared using ephedrine extracted from Ephedra plants in Afghanistan. The report stated that going by the best estimate, illicit cultivation of opium poppy in 2009 was spread across 1.23 lakh hectare, which increased to 2.24 lakh hectare in 2020. Based on the findings, it said the potential production of over-dry opium was 6,300 tonnes last year compared to 4,000 tonnes in 2009. Afghanistan’s southwestern region (Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan, and Zabul Provinces) continued to dominate opium-poppy cultivation and accounted for 68% of the national total in 2020, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/agencies-brace-for-rise-in-drugs-trafficking/article35949510.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. abdicating duty to rescue citizens: Congress||Terming the situation in Afghanistan as “alarming”, the Congress on Monday questioned why the Narendra Modi government “refused” to set in motion a plan to evacuate Indian citizens and protect India’s strategic assets there. At a press conference, chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it was a gross abdication of duty not to have an evacuation plan and asked the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister to clearly spell out “our policy for safe return of our citizens, Embassy personnel as also our future relationship”. “The Congress party stands solidly behind protecting India’s interests and expects a mature political and diplomatic response from our govt. over the complete collapse of the govt. in Afghanistan and Taliban takeover ... The stunning silence of Narendra Modi govt. is deeply disturbing and highly intriguing, which is beyond any reasonable understanding,” Mr. Surjewala said. “Modi government’s refusal to set in motion a well-thought-out plan to evacuate our citizens is a gross abdication of its duty and is totally unacceptable.” He said the “unexplained silence” would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the government was hiding something from the country. “We are still in the dark over Modi government’s role in Doha talks. Need of the hour is that the Modi government wakes up from its slumber and protects Indian citizens in Afghanistan and tells the country how it will tackle the dangerous situation in the neighbourhood.” “There is an urgent need to revisit our geo-political interests in this background and its impact on J&K.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-abdicating-duty-to-rescue-citizens-congress/article35949518.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||ED attaches assets linked to key NSCN(IM) cadre||The Enforcement Directorate has attached movable properties linked to some alleged key functionaries of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). The accused persons have been identified as Rayilung Nsarangbe, a self-styled colonel and treasurer of the NSCN (IM), his wife Ruth Chawang and Apam Muivah, secretary to the outfit’s Ato Kilonser (prime minister). The assets worth Rs. 6.88 crore are in the form of bank balances, mutual funds and insurance products. The ED probe is based on an FIR and chargesheet filed by the National Investigation Agency in December last year. It was alleged that the terror outfit ran a well-organised extortion racket in Manipur and Nagaland, resulting in diversion of government funds. It had been criminally intimidating the companies involved in road construction projects in Manipur and collecting huge sums as illegal “tax”. According to the ED, the outfit’s in-charge of four administrative districts in Manipur reported to Rayilung Nsarangbe, as he was the treasurer of the “collective leadership”. They would submit the extorted money along with details of the collections to him. Huge amounts were being directly collected by him. While a major part of the funds was spent on the direction of the “collective leadership”, the rest was being deposited in the bank accounts maintained in the name of Rayilung Nsarangbe, that of his wife and Apam Muivah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-assets-linked-to-key-nscnim-functionaries/article35949533.ece

Minister for New and Renewable Energy and Environment Hardeep Singh Dang also proposed a collection of Rs. 500 per month from those employees of the State government getting a monthly salary of more than Rs. 25,000 for the protection of cows and law to ensure that all sections of society contribute for protecting cows. The Minister said he has made all suggestions in his personal capacity. Mr. Dang said elected representatives are a part of society and they should work for protecting cows. “I demand that the EC make cow rearing mandatory for contesting elections. Forms of those candidates not involved in cow-rearing should be cancelled. I will write a letter to the EC in this regard,” he said. Mr. Dang said cow rearing should be made mandatory for people involved in farming or buying and selling agricultural products under a proposed agriculture law.

17 August 2021||Mumbai,||Over half kg hair removed from girl’s stomach||Doctors at a hospital in Kalyan in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) removed 650 grams of hair that had accumulated in a 12-year-old girl’s stomach. The girl had been pulling out and eating her own hair since she was a toddler and over the years this had turned into a large ball making her sick and causing intense pain in the stomach. This condition is seen in people with psychological disorder Trichophagia – a compulsive urge to eat hair — said Rohit Paryani, general & laparoscopic surgeon from Starcity Multispeciality Hospital, Kalyan (East), where the procedure was conducted. “The parents said she started eating hair from the age of two. Initially they didn’t take it seriously until her stomach was so tightly packed with the hair that she was unable to eat normal food, had pain and recurrent vomiting causing significant weight loss,” said Dr. Paryani. “Her weight is only 20 kg which is less than half the normal weight for her age. CT scan revealed that the whole stomach was filled with tightly packed hair,” he said. Surgeons ruled out minimally invasive laparoscopic surgeries because they feared locks of hair may entangle in the instrument used for the procedure making the situation worse. “Two days ago we conducted open surgery and pulled out the hair which weighed about 650gm and occupied all of the space in the stomach. That explains why she is malnourished and hasn’t been having a good appetite,” Dr. Paryani said. A small amount of hair ingested accidentally generally comes out of the body, but when there is constant ingestion, the hair settles in the stomach causing trichobezoars (hair in the stomach).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-half-kg-hair-removed-from-girls-stomach/article35949812.ece
17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Commitment to truth||Throughout Rama avatar, Valmiki establishes the nobility of human conduct that is shaped by dharma. Rama exemplifies the significance of the core values of truth, courage and love in the life of human beings, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. Rama’s adherence to satya is unimaginable. He shows that one can conquer the entire universe with satya which is synonymous with the omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent Supreme Brahman. Rama’s mind is peaceful since He knows He has been truthful at all times. Rama knows that good and bad are manifestations of the same atma. Virtue and vice do not affect him. So, when Kaikeyi has doubt about His willingness to fulfil the king’s plighted word to her and she explicitly demands assurance from Him, He frankly speaks about Himself. He feels for Dasaratha’s sorrowful plight. A king should keep his word and a son should obey the father. Dasaratha had promised Kaikeyi two boons in the past. He is tied down by the dharma to fulfil the pledge to her, and though he now repents for it, on no account can he go back on what had been promised. Rama regards Dasaratha as His teacher, father and friend. Whatever be the bidding of His father, be it to swallow deadly poison or jump into the fire or plunge into the ocean, He would do it without any hesitation. At this point, He says He will never break His word. He is one who does not speak twice. Later on in the Aranya Kanda, Rama, unable to bear the loss of Sita, would often break down in great grief. On one such occasion, lamenting most pitiably, He even contemplates taking His life. But then, He realises that such an act would tarnish Dasaratha’s commitment to truth, for then Rama would not have fulfilled the 14-year period of exile in forest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/commitment-to-truth/article35949526.ece

17 August 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||‘Translating research to improve lives of people is key’||Scientific research must be, at the end, relevant to society and translating it to improve lives of the people is key, said Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu. “Every scientist should strive to excel and innovate to improve the lives of people. In other words, scientists should come up with out-of-the-box solutions to address various challenges faced by mankind from climate change to agriculture to health and medicine, among others,” he said. He was addressing scientists and students at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) after unveiling the foundation stone for Innovation and Development Centre coming up at the Arkavathi Campus of the institute. The IDC will be a facility where laboratory inventions will be taken forward for scale up and technology transfer, said JNCASR in a statement. Mr. Naidu lauded steps initiated by JNCASR to promote few start-ups on indigenous activities in line with the ‘Make in India’ programme. “I am glad to note that this institution has generated over 300 patents and promoted establishment of a few startups based on indigenous inventions. I am also happy to note that the IDC would promote incubations and translational research, and would host startup companies initiated with in-house inventions,” he said. Mr. Naidu suggested scientists undertake research in new emerging areas of science like synthetic biology, computational biology, high performance engineering materials, and artificial intelligence. However, he was quick to add that it was the need of the hour to bring cutting-edge science and the solutions it offered to agriculture that he termed “the basic culture of our country” and appealed to the scientific community to focus on addressing problems faced by the farming community. “Science is the backbone for the progress and technological advancement of any country. India is uniquely blessed with a huge demographic dividend with a young population. The need of the hour is to inculcate scientific temper from a young age and promote world-class scientific research that addresses societal problems,” Mr. Naidu said. The National Education Policy 2020 will ensure that students have access to new teaching and learning strategies across all segments. This will create the right educational ecosystem and enrich their knowledge base as also honing their skill sets, he opined. "A number of new IITs, IIMs, Central Universities and Skill Development Centres have come up across the length and breadth of the country in the last few years to achieve this objective. I understand that the Government of India proposes to set up a National Science & Technology Research University bringing the Department of Science and Technology’s R&D institutes under its umbrella,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/translating-research-to-improve-lives-of-people-is-key/article35949586.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Madras’ tryst with epidemics and vaccination||Chennai, erstwhile Madras, has an extensive history when it comes to taking vaccination to its people. From smallpox vaccine to pulse polio immunisation, and now, COVID-19 vaccines, the city has come a long way in not only in handling disease outbreaks but also in overcoming challenges in vaccinating its population. A leaflet on ‘Vaccination against Influenza’ from a document at the library of the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine, draws similarities between the past and present : “The vaccine against influenza has been prepared and tested by doctors both in Europe and in this country. This vaccine tends to prevent you from being attacked by influenza. Inoculations which have been carried out in India indicate that those who are vaccinated are less likely to get influenza than those who are not vaccinated and even if they do get influenza, the danger from the disease will be less.” In the late 19th century when the British wanted to eradicate smallpox, the city turned home to premier institutes such as King Institute of Preventive Medicine (1899) and BCG Vaccine Laboratory, Guindy. Compulsory vaccination It all started with smallpox, ostensibly. The government had made preventive vaccination compulsory and even terminated unvaccinated employees who got infected. In 1884, the municipal commissioners of Madras city amended bye-laws to make vaccination compulsory. The amendment was publicised through local dailies in English, Tamil, Telugu and Hindustani languages besides being gazetted. The copies of the printed bye-laws were displayed prominently in the municipal office. “We have always had a history of opposing vaccination. In 1802, when the smallpox vaccine came, people expressed their opposition by not getting vaccinated. There were a lot of rumours...The government had to employ Indian vaccinators to go around and convince people that they had to get vaccinated. Incentivisation of vaccines had to be done. They were given a reward based on the number of people they vaccinated. Similarly, people had to be enticed. They were given a bag of rice if they came for vaccination. All of this happened in 1802 and 1803. There were reports of vaccinators and doctors being attacked, people saying that vaccination was only a method of collecting data of where you live so that later they will come and serve a tax notice,” V. Sriram, historian, said. The Communicable Diseases Hospital (CDH) at Tondiarpet was world famous for work on smallpox under Dr. A. Ramachandra Rao, according to T. Jacob John, retired professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore. Great breakthrough It was at the CDH that a great breakthrough in the eradication of smallpox happened, Mr. Sriram said, adding: “Dr. Rao, an authority on the subject, was the first person to identify that smallpox came in tri-annual cycles — first year it would be a major pandemic, second year a medium grade pandemic and third year, it would hardly be there. He said that every time when it comes to the year where the numbers are falling, we need to vaccinate a lot more so that we need to prepare for next year’s pandemic.” At that time, it was believed that newborns did not benefit from the smallpox vaccine. Internationally, this was the opinion. But Dr. Rao instructed that all babies born in corporation medical centres and hospitals should be compulsorily vaccinated. When that happened, they found that there was a huge drop in smallpox cases. He went on to become a consultant to the World Health Organisation (WHO), travelled around the world, lecturing about smallpox, he added. This was not all. There is a memorial to W.S. Swamy Naick, who really made smallpox popular in 1802 in Harris Road, Pudupet, now Adithanar Road, he said. Aruna Palaniappan, who headed vaccine production at King Institute, recalled that when she and her team went in the late 1970s to promote smallpox vaccine in villages people were ready to take it as by then awareness of its benefit had grown . The BCG Vaccine Laboratory was established in 1948 with assistance from Statens Serum Institut (SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark. The seed strain used at the laboratory was initially obtained from SSI through the WHO for production of liquid BCG vaccine against childhood tuberculosis and supply for the immunisation programme. Later, the laboratory started preparing its own BCG seed called Madras Working Seed Lot, according to the website. Between 1953 and 1957 influenza occupied much public discourse. In 1953, the King Institute, which was one of the three WHO research centres in the country, transferred its “virus section” to Pasteur Institute in Coonoor citing lack of research facilities. In 1957, a passenger ship from Penang arrived with 1,800 passengers of which 250 were found to be infected with the influenza virus. Researchers from Coonoor’s Pasteur Institute went aboard the ship and took samples which were to be used to prepare the vaccine. In just a span of five days as many as 5,000 people were infected, the government said. But the vaccination drive for flu did not take off. For decades, King Institute was the only centre in Tamil Nadu to give Yellow Fever vaccination to prospective travellers to Northern African countries, Dr. John added. In 1979, measles vaccination was rolled out in Vellore, Salem, Coimbatore and Madras, in that sequence under the Rotary Movement. The programme was led by Rotary Club of Madras, supported by its wing in Vellore, he recalled. “After pulse polio immunisation in Vellore in 1982 and 1983, Madras was the second city to do pulse polio immunisation with three doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in 1985. In 1986, Tamil Nadu adopted a five-dose OPV schedule based on the Vellore and Madras experiences. Tamil Nadu became the very first State in India to achieve zero wild virus polio in 1999,” he said. There was resistance to polio immunisation as well. Nalini Ramamurthy, former director of King Institute, recalled: “It was people in high rise buildings, the middle and upper class people who were against the vaccine. The people in villages did not resist it,” she said. “Chennai is a trendsetter because of the population, risk, exposure and size. It witnesses issues early. The proportion of urban slums here is high when compared to other parts of the State. It faces numerous challenges and always gets visibility. From having the first exposure to COVID-19, the city has taken the lead in vaccination,” T.S. Selvavinayagam, DPH, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madras-tryst-with-epidemics-and-vaccination/article35949702.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Irregularities in farm, gold loan waiver schemes’||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin informed the Assembly on Monday that irregularities to the tune of several crores of rupees had been reported in the schemes for waiving farm loans and gold loans. The government would implement these schemes only after the irregularities are rectified, he said. Intervening while AIADMK legislator R.B. Udhayakumar (Thirumangalam) was speaking during a debate on the revised Budget 2021-22 and the agriculture Budget in the House, Mr. Stalin said Cooperation Minister I. Periyasamy would provide details of where such irregularities had been reported in his reply to the debate on the demand for grants for his department. “We will implement them [the schemes] after the irregularities are rectified,” Mr. Stalin said. Though his government intended to implement the gold loan waiver scheme, several irregularities were found in the programme. As for the scheme to waive farm loans, irregularities to the tune of several crores of rupees were reported, he said. Mr. Stalin said the DMK government will implement the promises made by the party in its election manifesto. “There is no need for any doubt about that,” he added. On the White Paper During his speech, Mr. Udhayakumar pointed to the White Paper on the State’s finances, released by Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, and said the document raised doubts on whether the DMK was going back on its manifesto commitments. It may be recalled that the Finance Minister, too, while presenting the revised Budget for 2021-22 last Friday, said several irregularities were reported in the implementation of the schemes for waiving farm and gold loans. He said that in certain districts, a suspiciously large amount of loans were disbursed just before the announcement of the scheme. He said there had been violations at the individual beneficiary level, including the disbursal of loans without crop details as per the adangal , and sanctioning of loans in excess of the cropped area or the approved scale of finance. At the co-operative society level, some societies had disbursed loans without obtaining sanction or without the release of cash credit from the district co-operative credit banks. In the case of agricultural jewel loans, the Finance Minister said it was found that jewels were not valued properly and were lower in weight or of poorer quality than recorded. “Writing off such loans amounts to rewarding wrongdoers. Hence, a detailed inquiry is required before the scheme is fully implemented,” he said.  There have been violations at the individual beneficiary level, including the sanctioning of loans in excess of the cropped area or the approved scale of finance Palanivel Thiaga Rajan Finance Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/irregularities-in-farm-gold-loan-waiver-schemes/article35949697.ece

Bharathi in 2017 against the then Tamil Nadu State Election Commissioner P. Seetharaman and a few other bureaucrats for not holding local body polls in the State despite specific directions issued by the court. Justices M.M. Sundresh and S.M. Subramaniam of the court closed the contempt plea after Raja Srinivas, counsel representing the Greater Chennai Corporation, informed the Bench that the present DMK government was keen on conducting the civic polls at the earliest. He said the issue was under contemplation though the dates were yet to be announced. The judges recorded the submission and closed the case. Apart from Mr. Seetharaman, the contempt plea had been filed against the then TNSEC secretary T.S. Rajasekhar, Rural Development Secretary Hans Raj Varma, Municipal Administration Secretary K. Phanindra Reddy, Director of Town Panchayats K. Maharabushanam and the then GCC Commissioner D.

17 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt., Opposition question each other||The Assembly on Monday witnessed a heated debate between the ruling DMK and the Opposition party, AIADMK, on unfulfilled poll promises during their respective regimes. During the debate in the House, AIADMK legislator R.B. Udhayakumar said the White Paper presented by Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan raised questions as to whether the DMK was going back on its election promises. Mr. Rajan intervened to say that the value of the rupee was not the same then and now. He said many suo motu announcements made by former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had not been implemented. While he said his government would implement the promises, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin asked why the erstwhile AIADMK regime did not implement many of its electoral promises, such as free cell phones, supplying Aavin milk for Rs. 25 a litre, bottled mineral water, groceries at nominal price, establishing an Amma bank, Rs. 500 coupons from Co-optex to beneficiaries, free Wi-Fi at public places, setting up of an Ambedkar Foundation and the launching of monorail in Chennai. Mr. Palaniswami, the Leader of the Opposition, questioned the DMK over its 2006 poll promise of giving lands to landless farm labourers. “You had promised to give two acres of land to landless farmers. But you did not complete the scheme. You also promised to provide Rs. 1,000 to homemakers in your [2021] election manifesto, but after coming to power, you are saying it is only for the poor. So you have taken a stand before the election and differed from it now,” he said. PWD Minister E.V. Velu said the AIADMK promised to set up satellite towns and provide jobs to at least one member in every family, but had not implemented them. Food Minister R. Sakkarapani asked why the AIADMK had not implemented its poll promise to provide free bus passes to the elderly. When Mr. Udhayakumar mentioned the implementation of the old age pension scheme for the poor and the downtrodden, Mr. Rajan said several hundred senior citizens had been removed from the list of beneficiaries during the AIADMK regime. Responding to Mr. Palaniswami, Cooperation Minister I. Periyasamy said the erstwhile DMK government, under then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, had launched a scheme for giving land to landless farmers. Information Minister M.P. Saminathan pointed out how the AIADMK government did not distribute free colour TV sets under a scheme launched by the DMK government. Mr. Stalin reiterated that his government would implement the promises made during the DMK’s election manifesto once Tamil Nadu’s finances were restored.  Why did the erstwhile AIADMK regime not implement many of its electoral promises, such as free cell phones and supplying Aavin milk for Rs. 25 a litre? M.K.

17 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK govt.’s goals realisable, but hurdles lie ahead||Several challenges lie in the task of realising the DMK government’s goals of transforming 11.75 lakh hectares of fallow lands into productive lands and doubling the double-cropped area, in 10 years, say veteran agricultural experts and farmers. Pointing out that the goals can be realised, they feel the key to success lies in drawing up a comprehensive plan and “sustained interest” of the authorities in implementing the plan. In view of the scarcity of water in the State, the thrust should consistently be on raising crops like pulses, millets and oilseeds, all of which consume less water and are more nutritious than paddy and sugarcane. Greater facilities for processing, value addition and marketing should be provided to the farmers than what is currently available. Stressing the need for enhanced production of pulses, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) says the crop can be raised by adopting rain gun irrigation along with the available moisture in the soil due to rainfall. Line sowing and the use of multi-purpose seed drill, which places seed, fertilizer and mulch simultaneously, resulting in about 50% cost reduction, can be followed. Considering the sheep population of nearly 4.8 million in the State, there is enormous scope for making use of other fallow lands (which remain unutilised for up to five years) and “culturable waste” (where there is no cultivation for over five years) for livestock farming alongside crop farming, he says. A retired civil servant says that while attempting to bring new areas under cultivation, especially in dry lands, the authorities should draw lessons from what happened in Rajasthan, which suffered waterlogging and salinity following the implementation of the Indira Gandhi canal project. As regards marketing, the authorities should make all farmers tech-savvy for updating themselves on the market situation and planning their activity accordingly. K. Ramasamy, another former TNAU Vice-Chancellor, says farmers should take to raising vegetables and fruits in a big way. The model of the Philippines, which has emerged as a major exporter of the horticulture crops, can be replicated by Tamil Nadu by utilising the proposed areas for the purpose of production, which will be followed by strict monitoring of quality control, value addition and packaging, he adds. V. Sathyanarayanan, a veteran farmer from Tiruvarur district, says the government should think of ways to use the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for farm work. Arupathy Kalyanam, of Mayiladuthurai, says the State government can revamp several subsidy schemes so that the cash assistance for every farmer goes up by Rs. 3,000 every quarter, over and above what is given under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme. K.M. Rama Gounder, of Krishnagiri district, says the government should liberalise the norms for the coverage of agriculturists under drip irrigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govts-goals-realisable-but-hurdles-lie-ahead/article35949695.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro Rail planning to relocate 7 bus stops closer to stations||The Metro Rail has been trying to shift seven bus stops closer to its stations to help commuters transfer seamlessly from one mode of transport to the other. Officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) said they had been in talks with the Metropolitan Transportation Corporation (MTC) authorities for a few weeks and hoped to move stops closer to stations at the earliest. So far, bus stops near the Central Station, Teynampet, LIC, Saidapet and Washermenpet stations have been moved. “Further, we want to move more bus stops closer to five stations — two each at the Airport and Thousand Lights stations and one each at the Government Estate, Nehru Park and Pachaiyappa’s College stations. At CMBT, the station is located on the premises of the bus terminus. We are also holding discussions with officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation and the Highways Department as well,” an official said.  Growing ridership Metro Rail’s weekday ridership is slowly touching 80,000 without any last-mile connectivity, and if it is made available, then more people would be willing to use the service. Officials said commuters should have a few options like share cars and buses to travel from stations. Recently, the Delhi Metro has begun dedicated electric buses to serve as feeder services for commuters to reach their final destination, and commuters in Chennai said this should be implemented here as well. Jeyanthi S., a resident of Arumbakkam, said there were no buses or share car services between the station and her area of residence. “While the cost of the train ride would be Rs. 30-Rs. 40, I would have to pay another Rs. 40 for a five-minute ride,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-rail-planning-to-relocate-7-bus-stops-closer-to-stations/article35949704.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC directs Bar Council to get data on lawyers, their family for extending health insurance||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP) to write to 250 plus Bar associations in the State and obtain details of their members, the latter’s spouses and two dependent children so that quotations could be obtained from insurance companies for providing health insurance cover to them. Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Pongiappan issued the direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by activist advocate Sudha Ramalingam, who pointed out that many lawyers and their families faced a harrowing time during the first and second wave of COVID-19 in the absence of health insurance. The lawyer suggested that the government could contribute a part of the premium to provide insurance cover to around 60,000 lawyers and their family members, and the remaining amount could be collected from all lawyers through sale of stamps to be affixed in every Vakalatnama (authorisation given by litigants to their lawyers). Accepting her submission, the judges had constituted a committee, headed by the Advocate General, to work out the modalities in consultation with insurance companies and come up with a concrete proposal to be forwarded to the government. On Monday, the court was informed that the insurance companies were able to give a tentative quote of Rs. 100 crore because the Bar Council was not in a position to provide exact data regarding the lawyers and their family members. The judges were informed that collection of proper data alone would help in obtaining a final quote of the premium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-bar-council-to-get-data-on-lawyers-their-kin-for-insurance/article35950049.ece

Stalin, who is firm in his opinion that it will remain an autonomous institution, Minister for Tamil Official Language, Thangam Thennarasu, informed the Assembly on Monday. Responding to DMK legislator N. Eramakrishnan in the House, who cited reports that the Union government was attempting to remove the autonomous status of CICT, Mr. Thennarasu said it was Mr. Stalin who had asserted the DMK’s stand against the National Education Policy proposed by the Union government. Mr. Stalin was strongly opposed to any move to shift the institution out of Chennai. “The Chief Minister had also strongly said that that the Central Institute of Classical Tamil should remain autonomous,” Mr. Thennarasu said. As for Mr. Eramakrishnan’s concern over the library attached to the institution, the Minister said it would continue to be a part of the institution, and would be set up on the new campus in Perumbakkam. Earlier, Mr. Eramakrishnan noted that Tamil was one of the five classical languages, and it was former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi who was instrumental in establishing CICT.

Alagiri has said. The party held deliberations on the local body polls at Satyamurthy Bhavan here on Monday. “We have decided to start the work from today itself to ensure a significant victory in the local body polls and to work in coordination with the alliance parties,” Mr. Alagiri told reporters. On seats it would seek, he said the party would put forth its views on the matter. “We got 25 seats in the Assembly polls and won 18. We had the highest winning percentage,” he said. Mr. Alagiri also criticised Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for claiming that the government was not able to reduce fuel prices due to the cost of oil bonds issued by the erstwhile UPA government. “There is no connection between selling bonds and the fuel prices. What Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman is saying is wrong. Governments normally take loans and there is a plan on how to repay it. [For instance] When the Tamil Nadu government takes a loan, there is a repayment schedule. The repayment is done as per the schedule,” he said. Mr. Alagiri said the Centre had raised cess of fuel and that was the reason for the hike in fuel prices. “The fact is that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has reduced the price of petrol which is benefiting a lot of people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unable to do it. Ms. Sitharaman must tell the Prime Minister that,” Mr. Alagiri said.He felicitated the TNCC human rights wing head Mahatma Srinivasan and 55 others who had undertaken an 11-day bicycle journey from Chennai to Kanniyakumari to protest against high fuel prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alliance-with-dmk-will-continue-for-local-body-polls-alagiri/article35950159.ece
17 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Residents demand subway near Perungalathur railway station||Commuters and residents protested at Perungalathur railway station on Monday, demanding the construction of a foot overbridge (FOB) on Monday. Southern Railway closed the level crossing to facilitate the construction of a third line, resulting in the residents and commuters facing hardships in moving between east and west Perungalathur. Social activist S. Indiran said the railway gate was used by thousands of residents and the sudden overnight closure with a concrete wall had caused severe inconvenience to those on both sides of GST Road. Residents would be forced to take a detour of more than a kilometre to reach Irumbuliyur bus stand.  Police intervention Police personnel stopped the protesting residents from getting on the tracks. Senior railway officials, along with revenue officials of Chengalpattu district, assured them that a FOB or a pedestrian subway would be constructed. A senior official of Southern Railway said that the railway gate had been closed permanently to prevent trespassing at the Irumbuliyur portion. The railway official said though there was a road overbridge near Tambaram railway station and another at Perungalathur, the public were demanding a pedestrian subway or FOB in this particular area. A mini-subway had also been proposed by the State Highways Department, he added. However, train services were not affected on the Tambaram–Chengalpattu section due to the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-demand-subway-near-perungalathur-railway-station/article35949710.ece

17 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corporation migrates to new IT system||In a first step towards abandoning its isolated path in information technology management, the Coimbatore Corporation has started migrating to a system adopted by the other municipal corporations and urban local bodies. The work to migrate its data to the Urban Tree Information System, used by the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration, began a week ago, said Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. During the migration, a few of its services would be unavailable, the Corporation had said. Though municipal corporations in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and a few other places had migrated to the System way back in 2017, the Coimbatore Corporation continued to maintain a separate information technology system and server. Now, with the Coimbatore Corporation migrating to the Urban Tree Information System, it would be an integrated service, said sources overseeing the migration. The Corporation was migrating the new system in two phases. The first migration was of the revenue system. With it, the Corporation would adopt a new revenue accounting system – one that would be under the monitoring of the senior officers in the office of the Commissioner of Municipal Administration. The migration would also help the Corporation better monitor its property, water charges and other revenue collection. In the first phase, the Corporation was also improving its file management system and work flow management, the sources said and added that now senior officials would monitor file movement to ensure better efficiency. In the second phase, the Corporation would also migrate to the new building plan approval software, bringing about a total integration with the other municipal corporations. This would help the Corporation save money on server and data maintenance. And, for the city’s residents it would mean easy payment of property tax or water charges or use of online services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-migrates-to-new-it-system/article35949727.ece

17 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to start issuing building completion certificates||More than two years after the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department framed the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, the Coimbatore Corporation has started issuing building completion certificate. The Rules mandate local bodies to issue completion certificates to those buildings that were constructed as per the approved plan and those are necessary for availing of power and water connection. This was aimed at keeping a check on illegal construction. After the Department framed the Rules, the Corporation did not start issuing the completion certificate and when the Tangedco told its applicants that such a certificate was mandatory, the Corporation had said that its assessment of a property for tax was as good as completion certificate and that the public could use its property tax book for getting power connection. As for water connection, the Corporation did not make the completion certificate mandatory as both fell within its domain. But after backlash and activities pointed out violation of rules, the Corporation had to withdraw the order it issued equating property tax assessment with building completion certificate. In the meanwhile, the Corporation and Tangedco provided water and power connections to buildings without completion certificate. But now the Corporation had said that it would start issuing the completion certificates to stop illegal construction. The Corporation had also said that it would start issuing continuance certificates after inspecting under construction buildings at plinth, lintel and roof stages to ensure that no violation of the approved plan happened at any stage, said S. Kanagasundaram of the association of Registered Engineers. In ensuring that that there were no violations, the Corporation had also sought the help of engineers who would have to report violations, he added. Further, the Corporation would also start refunding deposits to the owners of those buildings who had constructed in conformity with the approved plan. Thus far, the Corporation had not had any demand for return of the deposits, the sources added. The completion and continuance certificates would apply to all buildings for which the Corporation was authorised to issue plan permission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-start-issuing-building-completion-certificates/article35949740.ece

17 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Action against illegal buildings to resume||After almost 10 years, it appears that the Coimbatore Corporation is all set to act against buildings built without permission or in violation of the approved plan. Sources in the civic body said action against such buildings was a part of streamlining the operations of the town planning wing and this time the Corporation would not stop with issuing notices, but take the issue to the logical conclusion – either seal or demolish the buildings and if necessary take the owners to court. The last time the Corporation initiated such an action was sometime in 2010-11 when the then Commissioner Anshul Mishra sealed more 50 buildings as the owners had built them by deviating from the approved plan. It was the last time that the Corporation took such an action and thereafter there was hardly any, said consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon. Even in issuing notices to the owners of illegal buildings, the Corporation would follow a standard procedure, said Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. There would be a record of notices sent and that would reflect in the property tax number in the Corporation’s database, said sources. Such a system was necessary because there were plenty of instances where officials issued notices on their whims and fancies and those notices were never on record, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said and added that the Corporation should number the notices just as first information reports in police stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/action-against-illegal-buildings-to-resume/article35949743.ece

17 August 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Women workers under MGNREGS seek increase in number of working days||Women working under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in Gundri Panchayat here have urged the Central and State governments to increase the number of working days from 150 to 250. The panchayat in Sathyamangalam Union has 15 habitations with a population of over 6,200. The people living here depend on rains for cultivating ragi, millets and other dry crops in their small holdings. The habitations are located 15 km from Kadambur and 80 km from Erode and can be reached only through the Guthiyalathur Reserve Forest in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR). In the absence of local job opportunities and transportation facilities, many families move to plains for work and return home on weekends. Wages received under the MGNREGS is the only source of income for over 300 families. In 2020-21, a total of 1,173 persons were provided job cards and were involved in executing 75 works related to natural resources management, including clearing bushes and forming waterways. The daily wage was fixed at Rs. 273 and workers were paid between Rs. 220 and Rs. 250. “There is no other work for us in the hill area and working days should be increased to 250 or 300,” said C. Devaraj of Kovilur habitation. He said that only one person in a family was allotted job and wanted the norms changed so that both husband and wife were employed. While many wanted work provided throughout the year, a few women wanted jobs at least for 300 days a year. “If we want to educate our children in plains, we need more money. If we cannot earn, we have to borrow at high interest rates or discontinue their studies,” said a woman worker. Workers said that wages were credited to their bank account only once in a month and there was delay in uploading muster rolls due to lack of internet connectivity. V.P. Gunasekaran, State Committee Member, Tamil Nadu Tribal People Association, urged the government to provide additional 100 days of employment under the scheme. “They have no other income and their demands should be met,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-workers-under-mgnregs-seek-increase-in-number-of-working-days/article35949868.ece

17 August 2021||Karur,TAMIL NADU||Tension in Karur village as Dalit man dies during protest||Tension gripped Vedichipalayam near Karur on Monday after a 43-year-old man belonging to a Scheduled Caste died at the graveyard in the village, where a group was staging a novel protest of ‘residing at the graveyard’ for obstructing a pathway to carry the dead. According to sources, five years ago a few persons bought a piece of land on the pathway, which was being used by the Dalits to carry bodies to their exclusive graveyard. This had created discontent among the Dalits as they had to wade through a field to reach the graveyard for the last five years. The Revenue authorities allegedly expressed inability in solving the issue by claiming that the pathway was owned by two individuals and there was no such [common] path in the Revenue records. Urging the authorities to ‘retrieve the pathway’ residents of Adi Dravidar Street in Vedichipalayam, including women and children, began a ‘live in’ protest at the graveyard on Sunday evening. Some of them ate their dinner and slept at the graveyard. On information, the revenue and police officers rushed to the spot and urged them to withdraw the protest. But they did not budge. The officials resumed negotiation on Monday. While the parleys were on, S. Velusamy, a painter, who was among the protesters, collapsed, causing tension at the protest site. On seeing him swoon, other protesters and officials tried to revive him. Velusamy was immediately rushed to the Government Karur Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The body was subsequently shifted to the mortuary for autopsy. “We were forced to undertake the novel protest as the last resort as our repeated petitions evoked no response. It has ultimately claimed a life. We are shattered,” said M. Chinnaponnu, a protester and neighbour of Velusamy. An agitated Velusamy was believed to have entered into a heated argument with the Manmangalam revenue officials overnight when they had urged the protesters to give up the agitation. Meanwhile, Collector T. Prabhu Shankar and Superintendent of Police P. Sundaravadivel visited the village and held negotiations with the protesters. Upon the Collector’s promise, the protesters agreed to call off the agitation temporarily. Shortly after the visit, earth movers were pressed into service and a mud road was formed connecting Vedichipalayam and the graveyard. Later, the body of Velusamy was handed over to his relatives and it was taken in a procession through the newly laid path amid tight security for performing last rites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tension-in-karur-village-as-dalit-man-dies-during-protest/article35949823.ece

Of these, 15.285 km long roads at a cost of Rs. 7.733 crore have been completed. The State government has allocated funds to the maintenance of the roads and the same has been assigned to a contractor for a period of five years. The works under the Scheme is being monitored by the Union government through Emarg, a separate monitoring portal, according to the administration. According to the Collector, the works taken up under the scheme are subjected to three grade quality control.

A. Paal Murugan, district secretary of the association, said, “Right before the budget was about to be announced, we were very certain that the State government would announce an increase in DA for the government staff. It was very disappointing when it wasn’t announced.” There had been a delay of 27 months in increasing the DA. “The Central government had announced the DA in July.

17 August 2021||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||4 tonnes of illegally cut rosewood seized||In a daring raid conducted deep inside dense jungles of Kanniyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary at night, a team of forest personnel arrested three armed persons who had fallen rosewood illegally. Sources in the Department of Forest said District Forest Officer, Kanniyakumari, T.K. Ashok Kumar, received information about the illegal felling of rosewood in a private patta land in Velimalai North area inside the Kanniyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary. Subsequently, the team of forest personnel led by Veliamalai Range Officer A. Manimaran rushed to the spot. Since the people involved in the illegal felling would be alert during the day and unleash gruesome attack on the raiding forest personnel, the special team raided the spot around 9 p.m. last Thursday last and seized the 4 tonnes of rosewood from the spot. The team also arrested A. Stalin, 30, of nearby Valayaththuvayal under Keeripparai police station limit, A. Jegadesan, 28, of Thellanthi and P. Murugan, 32, Azhagiyapandiapuram. The hunt is on to nab owner of the patta land K. John Raj of Mundavilai as he is absconding ever since the personnel hired by him to cut down the rosewood were arrested. “The team, led by Mr. Manimaran, had to trek for a few km at night via dense jungle without using any torchlight as the noise or light from their vehicle would alert the criminals. Even though the movement of elephants and other wild animals is high in this range, the team has successfully completed the operation by nabbing the criminals with the rosewood. They had switched on the lights only on reaching the spot and overpowered them even before they could react,” said the sources. The seized timber, worth several lakhs of rupees, and the cargo vehicle on which the illegally fallen trees had been loaded were produced to Assistant Conservator of Forest Akhil Thambi. Felling of the highly-valued rosewood, known for very hard and durable wood, has been banned. The International Union of Conservation of Nature has accorded ‘Red List Status - Vulnerable’ to rosewood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-tonnes-of-rosewood-seized/article35949848.ece
17 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Spotlight on Keezhur||Keezhur, a small village on the Puducherry-Tamil Nadu border off Villianur, has an outsized role in the history of the freedom movement of erstwhile Pondicherry. An exhibition of panels featuring various events that eventually led to the transition of power from France to India was hosted at Keezhur on the occasion of De Jure Day celebrations on Monday as the Union Territory commemorated the struggles and sacrifices of its freedom fighters. In October 1954, Keezhur produced the definitive referendum in favour of the merger of French establishments with India. This formed the basis for a bilateral Treaty of Cession three days later ceding full sovereignty of the territories of Pondicherry, Mahe, Yanam and Karaikal from France to India. Though the treaty took effect on November 1, 1954, marking de facto transfer of power, it was not until August 16, 1962, that erstwhile Pondicherry was officially merged with the Indian Union. The panels showcase not only the significant events but also the heroes of the freedom movement from Keval Singh, first Governor and accomplished diplomat, and Edouard Goubert to P. Muthucoumarappa Reddiyar and Venkatasubba Reddiyar. Many of these stalwarts have statues, roundabouts and streets named in their honour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spotlight-on-keezhur/article35950048.ece
17 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry L-G, CM skip De Jure Day programme||The De Jure Day anniversary marking the legal transfer of French territories to India this day in 1962 was a low-key event at Keezhur, a hamlet on the outskirts of the capital, on Monday. Although Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan and Chief Minister N. Rangasamy were scheduled to participate, neither could make it to the event. Perhaps this is the first time since 2016 when the Puducherry government began to celebrate De Jure Day at Keezhur, that neither of the two Constitutional figures made it to the commemoration of a historic day in the freedom movement of erstwhile Pondicherry. According to sources, Mr. Rangasamy was indisposed in the morning while Dr. Tamilisaireportedly pulled out due to an unavoidable exigency about an hour or so before the event was to start. Agriculture Minister C. Djeacoumar hoisted the national flag at the Keezhur monument in the presence of Speaker R. Selvam. V. Aroumougam, K.S.P. Ramesh, MLAs, Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar and other officials participated. The dignitaries later paid floral tributes at the monument as a mark of respect to the freedom fighters. Freedom fighters were felicitated on the occasion. Earlier, on arrival at the venue, the Speaker and the Minister inspected a guard of honour of the Puducherry Armed Police. Surprise visitor Home Minister A. Namassivayam made a brief appearance just outside the venue to participate in a programme to distribute notebooks and food to schoolchildren as part of Independence Day celebrations hosted by party followers. Though the Minister was not on the list of invitees on the government invite for the De Jure event, his presence at Keezhur and exit without visiting the venue caused a flutter. The De Jure Day is among the triad of red-letter days connected to the freedom movement in the erstwhile Pondicherry. Along with celebrating Independence Day, Puducherry also celebrates August 16 as De Jure Day to mark the legal transfer of power over far-flung properties from France to India and November 1 as Liberation Day marking the de facto transfer of French territories to India on November 1, 1954. It was at Keezhur that witnessed a historic referendum rejecting French rule. India and France, following talks, had issued a joint statement on October 13, 1954 announcing a procedure for deciding the status of the French settlements. On October 18, 1954 the elected members of the Representative Assembly and the municipal councillors of Pondicherry and Karaikkal took part in a referendum at Keezhur. Of the 178 members voting, an overwhelming majority of 170 members favoured the merger of French Indian territories with India. This led to an agreement on the de facto transfer of the French territories to India signed in New Delhi between the two countries. Though De Jure Day is a public holiday in the Union Territory, it was after sustained pressure from the French Indhiya Puducherry Pradesa Viduthalaikala Makkal Nala Narpani Iyakkam, a political party, that the momentous occasion began to be commemorated at Keezhur since 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-remembers-freedom-fighters-on-de-jure-day/article35950046.ece

Worshippers should be allowed to celebrate the ‘Chathurthi’ on September 10 by installing the Vinayaka idols at public places as manufacturers of `Vinayaka’ idols have invested huge amount of money in the preparation of the idols, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-allow-vinayaka-chathurthi-celebrations/article35949831.ece

17 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Permanent building for Kendriya Vidyalaya||At long last, there are positive indications for Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ponmalai, that has been functioning out of temporary buildings since 2016-17, to move to its own campus, much to the relief of parents. Last year, the school had submitted all the required documents to the Central Public Works Department for construction of permanent building at the land provided free of cost by the Southern Railway. The initial request for the purpose was sent from the school to the Chief Engineer (SZ-1), CPWD, Chennai, during August 2016. As a first step towards start of construction process, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, New Delhi, has sanctioned Rs. 1.86 lakh to CPWD, Tiruchi Division, for the preliminary drawing/ preliminary estimate, removal of vegetation, and fixing of boundary stones around the 6.4 acres allotted by the Southern Railways at Ponmalaipatti. The work is currently in progress at the site that is close to the Tiruchi-Pudukottai National Highway. A detailed report on the work completion will be sent to the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan shortly, according to the Principal Naval Kishore. While the Southern Railway has been advocating start of a second section at the entry level in class I, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has not approved it for schools functioning in temporary buildings. The temporary buildings are sufficient only for continuity of single sections. Due to the increasing demand for seats in the school started under civil sector, there are already over 55 students per section against the permitted level of 40. The high demand for admission in this school is owing to its location in the city limits. In all likelihood, the site will be readied for construction from the start of 2022, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/permanent-building-for-kendriya-vidyalaya/article35949822.ece
17 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Kallakudi leads by example, bags Best Town Panchayat Award||Good solid waste management practices along with an overall improvement in civic amenities have helped Kallakudi bag the Best Town Panchayat award from the State government this Independence Day. Adopting an integrated approach towards solid waste management, the Town Panchayat situated near Lalgudi in Tiruchi district has converted a 1.33 acre once-reeking compost yard into a Resource Recovery Park, where residents can now take a stroll. The town with a population 13,461 spread over an area of 11 square km generates about 3.50 tonnes of solid waste every day. It has a good primary door-to-door collection and segregation system and a well planned disposal process. Bio-mining is also done to process the accumulated waste at the compost yard. “The Resource Recovery Park now produces different types of bio fertilizers, including vermi compost, from degradable waste. The bio fertilizers are sold to farmers at nominal rates. We also recycle and reuse various other non degradable wastes.” says Sakul Ameed, Executive Officer, Kallakudi Town Panchayat, who took charge as the administration head of the civic body about 18 months ago. Some of the non degradable wastes are being sent to a cement factory for use as fuel in their kiln, the rest are recycled and reused. For instance, plastic waste are shredded and used for laying roads and making paver blocks as an alternative to bricks. Discarded cloth material collected mostly from tailor shops in the town are used for making door mats, with the help of machines supplied by a voluntary organisation, according to Mr. Ameed. The town panchayat also rears a cow and a bull, besides a few goats and ducks. “We feed the animals with leafy waste and their dung is used to generate bio gas. The income generated from the park is being shared on a 75: 25 ratio between the sanitary workers/self help group members and the government,” he added. The town panchayat has also raised a dense urban forest adopting the Miyawaki technique in a portion of a three-acre park site in the town with walking tracks. About 24,000 tree saplings of native species have been raised, entirely with contributions from locals and voluntary organisations, and all the saplings have grown well. The remaining portion of the park site is being developed as a playground for kids and youth. The town panchayat also has a model rainwater harvesting structure and marriage halls have been instructed to go in for solar power units. “We also ensure adequate water supply, streetlights and good amenities in the town. The residents also respond positively and our tax collection is very healthy,” said Mr.Ameed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kallakudi-leads-by-example-bags-best-town-panchayat-award/article35949837.ece

Orders have been issued to the archakas who joined duty on Sunday. While some had alleged in social media that the serving Brahmin archakas were asked to leave compulsorily in some of the shrines in and around Tiruchi, officials refuted claims. The Department officials said three assistant archakas have been appointed at Samayapuram Sri Mariamman Temple; two archakas for the Sri Adhi Mariamman Temple at Samayapuram and one archaka each for Sri Ujjaini Kaliamman Temple and Sri Muktheeswarar Temple. The Adhi Mariamman, Ujjaini Sri Kaliamman and Sri Muktheeswarar temples are also situated at Samayapuram.

One of the newly appointed priests is a Brahmin and the remaining two were from non-brahmin communities. The temple has six approved posts of archakas of which three were already serving at the temple. Applications were called through advertisement for selection of three vacant posts. The appointments have now been made and the archakas have joined duty, he added.

Viswanathan Government Medical College were found to be COVID-19 positive after which they were isolated ahead of reopening of classes for the students on Monday. The students were subject to compulsory RT-PCR tests when the results returned positive, officials said.

Patrons can donate clothing and also food items which can be placed in the refrigerator installed there, senior officials of the civic body said.

Now, it is being revived in a systematic manner, with a small number of clothes being placed on the shelves. “We have cleaned up the large mounds of clothes and sorted them according to their condition. While there are well-meaning donors, we cannot place old or tattered clothes on the shelves. We dust and arrange it neatly,” a security guard posted at the site said. Speaking to The Hindu , Corporation Commissioner P. M. N. Mujibur Rahuman said that similar initiatives will also be planned at other vantage points in the city if the need arises.

17 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Low morale of temporary teachers affects online classes||Though the start of the academic year has not been delayed much for intermediate and final year students, vibrancy in online classes has apparently waned due to sagging morale of a large number of teachers appointed for consolidated salaries. As the proportion of permanent teachers is low, the managements run the show with the temporary teachers for whom the salaries were slashed after the lockdown took effect last year. Since a section of them had left their jobs, managements of very many colleges have appointed new teachers with only M.Phil qualification - the UGC specifies a minimum qualification of Ph.D. or pass in NET/SLET - for monthly salaries as low as Rs. 5,000, which, teachers receiving payments on time-scale basis say “is hardly sufficient even for hand-to-mouth existence.” The loss of self-esteem coupled with financial stress has caused the decline in morale of teachers appointed for consolidated pay, according to a Head of a Department in an aided college in Tiruchi. “Heads of Departments are the ones who find themselves in an unenviable situation of assigning work for these teachers knowing fully well that they are not in a state of mind to do justice to their tasks,” he said, adding that the lack of interest on the part of students attending the online classes makes things worse. So far, after the start of classes on August 9, there have been visible indications of lethargy and lack of seriousness on the part of students, perhaps, due to their awareness about the circular from the Directorate of Collegiate Education that their daily attendance need not be insisted upon. “Reduction of salary for teachers in self-supporting programmes by the college managements is unreasonable since the colleges continue to collect the prescribed fee from almost all the students even during the pandemic period,” S. Sahaya Sathish, State general secretary, Aided College Teachers’ Association, said. Some of the teachers who leave their jobs due to the meagre pay have not been able to find alternative livelihood. Their misery has only aggravated, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/low-morale-of-temporary-teachers-affects-online-classes/article35949826.ece

17 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Sit-in protest by traders of Gandhi Market||Traders of Mahatma Gandhi Market in Palayamkottai staged a sit-in dharna on Monday as they were asked to have their temporary shops at an “inaccessible area” to facilitate reconstruction of the market in contrary to the earlier decision of having the temporary shops on adjacent Jawahar Grounds and Police Quarters area. As the Corporation has planned to reconstruct the 60-year-old dilapidated Mahatma Gandhi Market under the Smart City project on an outlay of Rs. 14.90 crore, owners of the shops in the market covering on 1.22 acres were asked to move to the temporary shops to be created nearby. Once reconstruction is completed with basement and ground floor, the market will fetch a net revenue of Rs. 2.08 crore a year after gross expenditure of Rs. 48.23 lakh towards housekeeping. As per the proposal, the new structure will have the basement with a total built-up area of 3,877 square metres, and the ground floor with a total built-up area of 3,553 square metres. While the basement can accommodate 27 four-wheelers and 819 two-wheelers, the ground floor with the commercial area of 1,835 square metres will have 172 shops, which will collectively generate income of Rs. 1.18 crore per year to the Corporation. A 50-tonne cold storage facility will be created to store perishable items of traders and it will ensure revenue of Rs. 10.80 lakh. A pay-and-use toilet complex will be part of the project to augment the revenue by Rs. 19.35 lakh. While car parking will generate the annual income of Rs. 5.73 lakh, the two-wheeler parking lot will ensure Rs. 77.82 lakh. When the Corporation planned to shift the shops to the temporary units to be created on Jawahar Grounds and the old police quarters on Tiruchendur Road, the traders agreed to it. It was then decided to set up the shops selling grocery, vegetables meat, etc., on the police quarters spot and establish the shops dealing with all other products at Jawahar Grounds. However, the shop owners and van drivers, who were given the option of parking their vehicles at Erumaikida Ground behind Palayamkottai All Women Police Station, opposed it saying the ground being used during Dussehra celebrations should not be given for parking vehicles. Backed by a few Hindu outfits, they also protested and the officials held talks with them. The traders were then given a space behind Bell School to set up temporary units that triggered an instant protest. “They show some other inaccessible and insecure place, which is unacceptable. Hence, we are protesting,” said A.J.M. Solomon, president of Gandhi Market Traders’ Association. When the officials held talks with the traders, it was decided to discuss the issue in the presence of the Collector, the Corporation Commissioner and the Tirunelveli City Police Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sit-in-protest-by-traders-of-gandhi-market/article35950115.ece
17 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Kani tribal products on sale in an exclusive showroom||After starting coaching classes for Kani tribal youth to enable them to crack competitive examinations being conducted by the Union and the State governments, Collector V. Vishnu has established a showroom in Palayamkottai for exclusively selling the products of ‘Kani’ tribal farmers living in the Western Ghats at four settlements. The shop with native flavour has been created near Anna Stadium in Palayamkottai. As the Kani people grow and harvest from the forest and sell 40 varieties of products, including honey, amla, cashew, pepper and jackfruit, Mr. Vishnu created facilities for them in Maharaja Nagar ‘Uzhavar Sandhai’ to sell these products. When the Kani farmers kept their products for sale at the farmers’ market, they could sell the entire lot, worth about Rs. 20,000 in just three hours. The second leg of the sale also enjoyed excellent patronage from the consumers. The Collector’s efforts also secured them an ‘organic product’ tag after due inspection was done in the Kani tribes’ farms in the Western Ghats. Sensing the market potential, Mr. Vishnu has created a shop in Palayamkottai to sell exclusively the Kani tribes’ products. “The Kani tribal youth are very much interested in getting trained in the coaching classes we organise for the competitive examinations. Hence, we’re now taking them to different places as ‘exposure visits’. Besides getting trained in the coaching classes, they should see the world outside the forest and equip themselves with the qualities the world is in now need of. I firmly believe that good number of Kani tribal youth getting trained in the coaching centre will certainly crack the competitive exams in near future. Now, to help the Kani tribal farmers, we’ve opened this shop with their native flavour,” said Mr. Vishnu. After bringing the farm produce in a mini cargo vehicle, sanctioned recently by the NABARD, the Kani tribes sell their produce, all carrying ‘organic tag’. “As we started selling our products from this new shop on ‘Independence Day, we sold products worth Rs. 14,000 on the first day. We expect excellent patronage in the days to come,” said Ganesa Moorthy, a Kani tribal youth who coordinates this business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kani-tribal-products-on-sale-in-an-exclusive-showroom/article35950117.ece

The new restrictions to combat the spread of COVID-19 will be in force till August 25. While all shops can function only between 6 a.m and 5 p.m., Hotels and tea shops can operate up to 5 p.m in the town but can provide parcel services till 9 p.m. Only 50% of patrons would be allowed in restaurants and tea shops.

Only 50% occupancy allowed in government buses. On Monday, District Collector B. Murugesh reviewed the compliance of the new restrictions by residents and traders. The restrictions were imposed after a consultation meeting at the District Collectorate last Saturday with various stakeholders, including vegetable traders, hawkers, flower vendors’ associations, hotel associations, revenue, police and health officials. The Tiruvannamalai municipality has 39 wards covering key areas such as Pallavan Nagar, Thenimalai, Samuthivam Kalani and Ajish Colony with a population of around 8 lakh. The easing of lockdown restrictions since July 11 had increased the flow of traffic in the town on arterial roads like Tiruvannamalai Road, Vellore-Thoothukudi High Road, Perumpakkam Road, Polur Road and Avalurpettai Road. In fact, most of these key routes connect the hillock temple to adjoining districts such as Vellore, Tirupattur and Villupuram. Spike in cases Municipal officials said that crowds in such public places, especially in the evening hours, had slowly increased the COVID-19 infection with around 50 cases on an average being reported daily from the district since last week. Apart from creating awareness among the public, the municipality organises door-to-door checks on symptoms of the SARS CoV-2 infection. Fever camps are being held every day. “We also conduct surprise checks in hotels and commercial establishments to ensure 100% compliance with the COVID-19 norms. Fines have been imposed in case of violations,” said R. Chandra, Commissioner, Tiruvannamalai Municipality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tighter-restrictions-to-contain-covid-19-in-tiruvannamalai/article35950126.ece
17 August 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Forest Dept. plans conservation of swamps used by elephants in Gudalur||A comprehensive “vayal” management plan is being formulated by the Forest Department to help preserve crucial elephant habitats in Gudalur and Pandalur taluks. “Vayals,” essentially grassy swamps, are used by a variety of wildlife, and most importantly by Asian elephants. B. Ramakrishnan, assistant professor at the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology at the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam, who is also a principal investigator assisting the Forest Department in studying the “vayals” in the Gudalur landscape, said that a three-month study showed 84 of the 86 “vayals” studied were being used by elephants, while leopards were seen in 79, and the presence of tigers was noticed in 13. “These results show the importance of ‘vayals’ not just for elephants, but for the wildlife in general,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan, who is a member of the Asian Elephants Specialist Group of the IUCN. The studies also pointed to a correlation between the number of “vayals” in a forest range and the prevalence of problematic human-elephant interactions. Between 2007 and 2019, 79 human deaths were recorded in the Gudalur division, out of which 22 were recorded in Cherambadi range, which has the most “vayals” in the landscape. Casualties were also higher in Pandalur and Gudalur forest ranges. “Elephants from Karnataka and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve pass through the region, and use the ‘vayals’ as stopping points where they browse for food and water. The problematic interactions result from people who also share the ‘vayals’ with the elephants and accidentally encounter them while going to work or while returning home,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan. As many of the “vayals” in the five forest ranges in Gudalur used by elephants are outside notified reserve forests, they are under serious threat of being encroached upon by people looking to set up farms. I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle, said the Forest Department was in the process of formulating a comprehensive strategy for managing and protecting the swamps. “We are assessing the number of vayals and are going to safeguard these ecologically-important areas through the ambit of the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forests Act, as many of the ‘vayals’ are not inside declared reserve forests,” said Mr. Anwardeen. “The plan will involve all relevant stakeholders. The protections will ensure that there is no further erosion of the ‘vayals’ due to cultivation and narrowing of elephant pathways through fencing” added Mr. Anwardeen. Both the Forest Department and local conservationists hope that the move to protect the swamps will reduce problematic human-elephant interactions in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-plans-conservation-of-swamps-used-by-elephants-in-gudalur/article35949729.ece
17 August 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||School teachers in the Nilgiris to check on welfare of children||The Nilgiris district administration and the School Education Department have established a “mentorship” model involving school teachers and students to check on the welfare of students in the district. The number of children reporting cases of abuse was increasing in the Nilgiris. As a step towards ensuring that the welfare of children was monitored, the 3,000 teachers in the district had been appointed as “mentors” for ten children each, Collector J. Innocent Divya told reporters recently. They had been assigned the role of regularly checking on the welfare of the children either via phone or by individual visits to the homes of the children, officials said. The District Child Protection Officer, Social Welfare Department as well as the police were also involved in organising awareness programmes in “hotspot villages” where they received complaints of abuse, harassment or violence against children. The awareness programmes were aimed at spreading information among children as well as adults about what constituted abuse and also mechanisms which were in place for children to seek help from children’s welfare authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/school-teachers-in-the-nilgiris-to-check-on-welfare-of-children/article35949735.ece

Sources told The Hindu that summons had been issued to K.V.

The men are alleged to have stolen valuables from the bungalow. K. Vijayan, one of the lawyers representing the accused in the Kodanad case, said the prosecution had filed a memo in the district sessions court here in Udhagamandalam, seeking to gain some clarity on new information that had come to light after the initiation of the trial against the accused in the case. Sources remained tight-lipped on what exactly the “new information” pertains to. Police sources confirmed that Mr. Sayan had been asked to appear before them but added that an exact date had not been fixed.

17 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Government employees, pensioners demand hike in dearness allowance||The Tamil Nadu All Government Departments Pensioners Association, Tamil Nadu Revenue Officers’ Association (TNROA) and Tamil Nadu Government Employees' Association (TNGEA) on Monday staged demonstrations, urging the State government to implement 11% increase in dearness allowance (DA). Virudhunagar TNROA unit district secretary G. Kannan said the State government had frozen DA since January 1, 2020. The Union government increased the D.A. to 28% with effect from July 1 and implemented it. However, the State government said that it could give the revised D.A. only from April 1, 2022. “We stand to lose heavily due to this announcement,” said Mr. Kannan. TNROA members wore demand badges. The pensioners association staged a protest in front of the Collectorate pressing for the same demand. Its district president V. Gurusamy said the Centre had frozen the D.A. in April 2020. However, it had restored it in July 2021. However, the State government had committed itself to implementing the D.A. hike only from April 2022. Besides, the State government had increased the contribution of pensioners towards Family Security Scheme from Rs. 80 to Rs. 150 with effect from July. However, the assistance given to the family in the event of death of the pensioner had not been raised proportionately. “We want the government to increase the Family Security Scheme assistance to Rs. 1 lakh from Rs. 50,000,” he added. The association also wanted the DMK government to implement the party’s poll promise of providing 20% additional pension to pensioners aged above 70 years. “Now, this benefit is extended in Tamil Nadu only to those pensioners aged above 80,” he said. Meanwhile, TNGEA members staged demonstrations in over 20 locations in the district seeking increase in D.A. with immediate effect. The association said that postponing the D.A. hike to April 1, 2022 would mean that the State government would deny five increments in dearness allowance. D.A. hike was not an assistance extended by the government, but a right earned by the employees through continuous struggle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-employees-pensioners-demand-hike-in-dearness-allowance/article35949847.ece
17 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||‘Farmers can augment their income by selling solar power’||Virudhunagar district administration has invited applications from farmers for installion of solar-powered motorpumps used for lift irrigation through which they can get electricity supply for 24 hours and also generate income by selling solar power to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The benefits under PM-KUSUM scheme will be jointly implemented by TNEB, Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA) and Agricultural Engineering Department, said Virudhunagar Collector, J. Meghanath Reddy. “This is an on-grid scheme through which the solar power that remains unused can be sold to TNEB, which will pay the farmer at the rate of Rs. 2.28 a unit along with an incentive of 50 paise per unit,” said Assistant Engineer, TEDA, M. Chithradevi. As of now, farmers who are also provided with free power scheme and those who have applied for free power under tatkal scheme will be eligible for the solar-powered motor. “Farmers who have 2HP to 7.5HP motors will get solar panels that can produce double their power requirement for motors,” she said. “A 11 KV solar unit can produce 55 units of power a day and farmers can sell at least 50% of the power each day to TNEB. Whenever, they are not using the motor, they can sell the entire power generated through the solar panels,” she added. This will be an additional income generating source for farmers, the Collector said. According to Ms. Chithradevi, while free electricity is available only for six hours a day, farmers can make use of solar power during the day and free power for nights. Subsidy available  While the cost of the solar-powered motor is Rs. 5 lakh, farmers can get 30% subsidy from the Centre and 30% subsidy from the State government. Another 30% of the 40% contribution of the farmers can be raised through bank loans. They will be ble to generate up to Rs. 40,000 a year through sale of power to TNEB. The supplier will give five-year warranty for maintenance and 25 years of warranty for the solar panels. Interested farmers can approach the District Rural Development Agency and register themselves. For further details farmers can call 93852-90545.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-can-augment-their-income-by-selling-solar-power/article35949857.ece

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||At least 3.94 lakh missed Covaxin 2nd dose in 6-week window||In other words, 22%, or roughly one in every five persons who took the first dose six weeks ago, failed to take their second dose. According to the data available on vaccination done through government-run centres and camps, 17,72,296 people had taken their first dose of Covaxin as of July 4. Ideally, all of them should have taken their second dose by August 15, which marked the end of the six-week window. However, only 13,78,779 people had taken their second dose as of August 15. The difference of 3.94 lakh is only the minimum number of people who had missed their second dose. The actual figure could be higher, as the number of second doses administered as of August 15 may include those who took their second dose in the past four to six weeks as well. While people may have missed their second dose of Covishield as well, it was difficult to ascertain the number as the window advised by ICMR for Covishield kept changing. Chennai was the only district that improved its performance in closing the gap with people missing their second Covaxin shot. Only 12% of the people who took their first dose as of July 4 missed their second dose by August 15, when compared to the State’s average of 22%. It was also the only district where the number of people who missed their second dose declined from around 60,000 in mid-June to roughly 50,000 on August 15, despite a sharp increase in the doses administered. J. Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, said the vaccine supply constraints faced by the State earlier had considerably eased. The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine recently asked all districts to conduct exclusive camps for administering the second dose of vaccines every Sunday. Another senior official said that while more people came forward to get vaccinated soon after the second wave, the momentum seemed to have reduced of late. He said even those who failed to take their second dose within the stipulated window shouldn’t bother about the delay and take the shot as soon as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/at-least-394-lakh-missed-covaxin-2nd-dose-in-6-week-window/article35949699.ece

Due to COVID-19, the meeting was cancelled for many months now and people have been asked to drop their petitions at a box kept on the Collectorate premises. Earlier, volunteers at the Collectorate entrance helped people write petitions for a nominal charge of Rs. 10 or Rs. 20. After the meetings were cancelled, volunteers stopped coming and the people were forced to depend on a few persons sitting outside the Collectorate. The petitioners have to spend more than an hour for their turn to get the petitions drafted.

17 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Belagavi corpn. polls will see a departure from the past||After decades of language-based campaigns, the Belagavi City Corporation may be heading for an election that would be fought on party affiliations. Polling is on September 3 and counting of votes on September 6. The poll notification was issued on Monday. Leaders of all the three major parties held meetings on Belagavi on Monday, about the polls. This is probably the first time in decades that the Congress, the BJP and the Janata Dal(S) plan to field their candidates in the urban local body elections, say political observers. Some even say the that polls were never fought on party ticket. “This is probably the first time that the big parties are entering the fray openly,’’ said Uday Kinjwadkar, writer and a chronicler of Belagavi. “The only thing that mattered for the council elections was language. Candidates identified themselves as members of Kannada, Marathi and Urdu groups and that is what seemed to have swayed the voters,’’ he said. BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel addressed leaders and members of the party city unit. In a meeting at Dharmanath Bhavan, the leader asked workers to ensure that the next Mayor of Belagavi was an ordinary BJP worker. “It is true that we have not fought the city corporation polls on party ticket till now. But we should not worry about what happened in the past. We have to focus on the future,’’ he said. He asked workers to highlight the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government and the BJP government in the State. Despite the apparent confidence shown at the meeting, it is believed that the BJP is worried about the negative impact of the presence of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) and the Shiv Sena. “At least some BJP leaders are worried that the MES and Shiv Sena may be trying to bite into the BJP’s voter kitty. That is one reason why senior leaders Mr. Nalin Kumar Kateel, Govind Karjol and Umesh Katti were invited to speak at the party workers meeting in Belagavi on Monday. City-based legislators Abhay Patil and Anil Benake were asked not only to motivate their workers but also to announce a target for the number of seats they will win for the party,’’ said a BJP leader who is in-charge of the city unit. Congress leader M.B. Patil and Members of Parliament L. Hanumanthaiah and Syed Naseer Hussein held meetings with local leaders. KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi, Member of Legislative Assembly Lakshmi Hebbalkar and the former MLA Firoze Sait and others were present. Party sources said that some workers, however, spoke against fighting the polls on party ticket. Janata Dal (Secular) district president Pramod Patil held a meeting with senior leaders Faizulla Madiwale, Murugesh Hiremath and Santosh Upadhyaya. He announced later that the party will field its candidates from all 58 wards. Two other players, the Aam Admi Party and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, want to enter the hustings too. AAP leaders from Bengaluru and Dharwad have held meetings in the past. AIMIM is planning ward level rallies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-corpn-polls-will-see-a-departure-from-the-past/article35949885.ece

17 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Unable to conduct both online and offline classes: Schools||With high schools and PU colleges all set to reopen on August 23, the State government has directed all schools and PU colleges to conduct both offline as well as online classes so that students can opt for either. However, most private school managements and PU colleges say that it will be difficult to conduct both classes as it would be a huge expense. They also pointed out that the schools do not have adequate teachers to conduct both classes. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that it would be impossible to conduct both classes as schools do not have adequate infrastructure. “Teachers who conduct offline classes will have to manage students in the class and it would be difficult to hold a conversation with those online,” he said. Lokesh Talikatte, State unit president, Recognised Unaided Private Schools’ Association, Karnataka, said that while they would conduct both online and offline classes for a week, it would be difficult to sustain the classes for a longer duration. “Conducting both classes simultaneously will have a huge impact on our finances. But we will do this for a short duration to build the confidence of the students until the attendance for offline classes improves,” he said. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, DPS Group of Schools, said that they have been holding discussions with teachers on how to conduct online and offline classes. “We cannot overburden our teachers to conduct both the classes. Conducting livestreaming of classes will not be efficient as teachers will not be able to pay attention to students who are logged online,” he said. He also pointed out that most central board schools have highly qualified teachers and they do not have any extra teachers who can teach students online V. Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that private schools who could not conduct online classes with offline classes reopening had to devise some means where students could get access to education. “There are various ways in which schools can engage with students online and can have pre-recorded classes or ask students to watch DD Chandana,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/unable-to-conduct-both-online-and-offline-classes-schools/article35949658.ece
17 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Baby cobras released into forest||As many as 30 baby king cobras (Ophiophagus Hannah) returned home as Kalinga Foundation successfully incubated and released them into the forest in Chikkamagaluru district on August 11. The hatchlings were handed back to the Forest Department in the presence of officials and the WildCat-C team. It all started on May 17 when coffee workers in Bilagali, Chikkamagaluru district, spotted a female king cobra sitting on a pile of leaves. They understood that she was guarding her nest. They called Rizwan, a local snake rescuer, to relocate the snake and the nest from the area. At the same time, Shreedev and Prateek from WildCat-C, an NGO, sought help from Gowri Shankar, a king cobra biologist, to ensure that the cobra and her eggs are safe. Due to pressure from locals, Rizwan had relocated the female king cobra and had already opened the king cobra nest. King cobras build a well-engineered nest to guard the eggs against heavy rains in the monsoon. The nest chamber is tightly packed and covered with layers of dry leaves to ensure the right temperature and humidity to keep the eggs dry. A disturbed nest is as good as killing the progeny. On Mr. Shankar’s advice, Rizwan and the Forest Department team shifted the eggs into a cardboard box. Early the next day, Mr. Shankar and Prashanth from Kalinga Foundation connected with officials in the Forest Department. As many as 38 eggs were gently transferred into cushioned compartments in plastic boxes and carefully transported to the Kalinga Foundation field site at Guddekere, Agumbe. At Kalinga Foundation, an artificial incubator was set up. Temperature and humidity were monitored throughout the day. The Forest Department was updated at regular intervals. On July 25, the first baby king cobra popped its head out of its eggshell. Over the next one week, 30 eggs successfully hatched. Of the eight eggs that did not hatch, four were infertile, while another four had not developed, possibly due to early disturbances at the nest site. Under natural conditions, baby king cobras remain close to the nest, surviving on remnants of the yolk. They shed their skin and then disperse into the forest. To simulate similar conditions, the hatchlings were kept until they shed their skin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/baby-cobras-released-into-forest/article35949657.ece

Kumaraswamy has sought time from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to discuss irrigation-related issues. “The announcements by the BJP have remained merely statements. If they intended to start the projects, they would have done so. The government is facing political problems. I have submitted a memorandum to the Governor seeking the President’s intervention to direct the government to provide approvals,” the former Chief Minister told reporters at Channapatna on Monday. “The cost of the Yettinahole project, which is meant to provide drinking water to Kolar and Chickballapur districts, was Rs. 8,000 crore. It has now escalated to Rs. 23,000 crore. There are delays in problem solving. The Yettinahole project cost might eventually escalate to Rs. 50,000 crore.” On the delay in caste census report submission and the accusation by Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah that it was due to Mr. Kumaraswamy, he said, “Siddaramaiah has no work. In fact, the report is not even authored by Backward Classes chairman Kantharaj. It has been authored by Siddaramaiah and Kantharaj has lent his seal.” He added that Mr. Siddaramaiah did not raise this issue as chairman of the coordination committee, and nor did Mr. Kantharaj ever mention that the report was ready. Accusing Mr. Siddaramaiah of working against the interest of Dalits, the former Chief Minister said that there were several irregularities in the allotment of houses meant for Dalits during the Congress leader’s tenure. “I have documents of the original list of beneficiaries and the changes made to the list. I have these details village-wise. I will also speak politics when the time comes. He [Mr. Siddaramaiah] speaks about Dalits and OBCs and is trying to be their leader.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-seeks-meeting-with-bommai-to-discuss-irrigation-related-issues/article35949676.ece
17 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Car carrying gelatin sticks explodes in Kanakapura||A 48-year-old man was killed after his car, with gelatin sticks, exploded near Marale Gavi Mutt in Kanakapura on Monday evening. The explosion was such that the sound of the blast echoed in the entire area and villagers panicked. The deceased has been identified as Mahesh, a resident of Kanakapura, who was working as a mining tools dealer. The police said that he was driving the car when the explosion took place and in the impact his body was torn apart and was found a few metres away from the car. The car was mangled and gutted, making it difficult for the police to identify it for some time. Initial probe revealed that Mahesh was taking the gelatin sticks to the crushing site, reportedly belonging to the Marale Gavi Mutt where a lot of labourers were working. As the incident took place a few metres away from the quarry, a major disaster was averted. The Sathanur police rushed to the spot and have initiated investigation to ascertain the reason behind Mahesh carrying gelatin sticks in the car without precautionary measure. According to a senior police officer, the road was uneven and friction between the sticks could have caused the blast. This is the third such incident reported in the state this year. As many as a dozen people were killed in two separate incidents of gelatin stick explosions in Shivamogga and Chickballapur. This February, six people were killed while trying to dispose of gelatin sticks at a stone quarry site in Hirenagavalli village in Chickballapur district. This January, a truck carrying explosives meant for blasting stones at the quarry exploded killing six people in Hunasodu village in Shivamoga district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/car-carrying-gelatin-sticks-explodes-in-kanakapura/article35949649.ece

The scheme, submitted to the High Court on Monday, also states that a panel, comprising deputy directors of the departments of Public Instruction and Women and Child Development, as well as representatives of NGOs working for the welfare of blind children, would select the beneficiaries in each district every year. Taking the scheme on record, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda disposed of a contempt of court petition filed alleging the non-framing of such a scheme despite a court direction issued in March. It was alleged in the petition that the free talking laptop scheme, though announced in the State Budget of 2014-15, was not reaching eligible students still. Under the scheme, visually impaired students, who have been residing in Karnataka for the past 10 years and have not availed themselves of the benefit of talking laptop under any other scheme, are eligible along with the recommendation of the heads of their educational institutes. The benefit under the scheme can be availed only once by a student.

The Narendra Modi government has come up with several policies and laws to help promote crony capitalism and the interests of real estate folks,” the former Chief Minister said in a letter to Congressmen. “The unemployment rate is high and average household expenses have more than doubled.” He said that the BJP’s mismanagement continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic and many people have died because of the lack of medical resources as a direct result of inefficient and corrupt governance. “The Modi government has launched an attack on language, culture, power, and finances of Karnataka. While Rs. 2.5 lakh crore goes to the Union government in the form of various taxes and cess, only Rs. 38,000 crore is given back to us. If we consider 42% devolution to the State as per the 15th Finance Commission, we should have got Rs. 1.1 lakh crore,” he said, adding that Karnataka was turning into a debt State. “We have to effectively counter the lies of the BJP. Our office has released three booklets explaining the damage done by the Modi government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/study-bjps-policies-to-counter-them-ex-cm-tells-cong-workers/article35949675.ece

17 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Idea of Hubballi-Dharwad as skilling capital mooted’||Union Minister of State for Skill Development, Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Monday said that idea of developing Hubballi-Dharwad as the skilling capital of the State had been mooted during discussions at Hubballi and further steps would be taken on receipt of suitable proposal from the State government. Addressing presspersons after launching the ‘Janaashirvad Yatre’ in Hubballi on Monday, the Minister said that the twin cities had great potential in terms of skill development and could emerge as a hub of skill development programmes as already adequate training facilities were in place. He said that under the National Education Policy (NEP), focus was on skill development unlike the earlier system. And also the students would get various options in specialising in other fields apart from the one being pursued by them. To a query, he said that in the field of Information Technology too, Hubballi-Dharwad had great potential. The issue of making the Infosys Campus in Hubballi functional had been brought to hisMnotice and he would take it up with the concerned. On RSS chief Mohan Bhagavat’s statement regarding dependency on China in terms of technology, Mr. Chandrasekhar said that it was for the same reason that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’ campaign to promote indigenous developments in science and technology and also in manufacturing. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has shown that it was capable of indigenous production in various sectors,” he added. Defending the hike in fuel prices, the minister said that it had become essential to maintain the economical balance during the tough times of COVID-19. He said that apart from the burden of oil bonds transferred by the UPA regime, the Union government had to mobilise funds required for vaccine, free ration and other social commitments of the government. Disruptive politics Mr. Chandrasekhar alleged that the Opposition parties had engaged in disruptive politics even when the Centre was ready to debate issues like Pegasus and the farmers’ protest. “The government was ready to discuss. But the Opposition tried to dictate terms, which cannot be allowed. The primary objective of the Opposition parties was not debate but disruption,” he said. On why the Prime Minister or the Home Minister did not clarify on the allegations of the opposition regarding Pegasus, he said that issuing a statement outside, when the Parliament was in session would be a breach of privilege. Regarding the meeting of the Standing Committee on IT headed by Shashi Tharoor on Pegasus and non-participation of the BJP members, he said Mr. Tharoor did it for publicity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/idea-of-hubballi-dharwad-as-skilling-capital-mooted/article35949892.ece
17 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Afghan student in Dharwad says he was initially tensed but relieved now||Nasratullah Kakar, a research student from Afghanistan, is a concerned man these days, because of the developments unfolding in his country. Just a month ago he sent his family back to his native place because he needed more time for his research work at the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) in Dharwad. Of the 15 Afghan nationals pursuing their higher education in agricultural sciences at UAS Dharwad, five returned to their native places in Afghanistan because of the COVID-19 situation, while 11 are now in the international hostel of the university here. Kakar is in the second year of his three-year Ph.D programme in Agricultural Extension. An employee of the Ministry of Agriculture in Afghanistan, Kakar is pursuing his research under the programme of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Like him, the remaining students are also employees of Afghanistan Government and are pursuing various courses under the ICAR programme. They all are married and have joint families back home. “We all live in joint families with over 20 members staying under a single roof. I have three daughters and a son and we live in a joint family of 21 members,” Kakar told The Hindu . As the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan began, these students living several thousand kilometres were a worried lot. “Yes, we were all very much tensed initially. We frequently called our families to know about the situation. We are a bit relieved now as they are safe,” he said. Just like him, the other Afghan nationals in the university were anxious. On Monday, they had a meeting with Vice-Chancellor of UAS-Dharwad M.B. Chetti, who assured them of all help. Prof. Chetti told The Hindu that he had a meeting with the Afghan students and wanted to know whether they had any issue which required his intervention. Some of these students are about to complete their post-graduation courses in a few months. “But our return would depend on the further developments in our country,” Kakar said. Meanwhile, a senior intelligence official of the State Police said they had received no information of anyone from the State being stuck in Afghanistan. The official said that they had not come across anyone from the State, among those who have returned from the strife-torn country over the last few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/afghan-student-in-dharwad-says-he-was-initially-tensed-but-relieved-now/article35949886.ece
17 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘BJP changed course of development’||Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Skill Development Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said that after coming to power BJP changed the course of development through corruptionless governance and by launching schemes and programmes that reached those at the bottom of the pyramid. Launching the ‘Janashirvad Yatre’ in Hubballi on Monday, Mr. Chandrasekhar said that the governance of the BJP-led Centre in the last seven years would lead to big change in the next 25 years. “BJP has put a full stop to the corruption of the six decades of Congress rule, divide and rule policy and exploitation,” he said. He added that as said by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this was the right time for country’s development and already, measures taken by the BJP had made the world to look at India with respect. Representation State president of BJP Nalin Kumar Kateel said that apart from giving good governance, the PM had ensured social justice in all fields. “As per the vision of social justice of B.R. Ambedkar, Prime Minister Modi has given representation to all communities in his Cabinet,” he said. The former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar said that Hubballi-Dharwad was prominent centre for BJP right from the days of Jan Sangh and had continued to be because of the good governance of the party. Many programmes District-in-charge Minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa listed out the various development programmes and said the party had changed the course of development in Hubballi-Dharwad and would come to power again in the municipal corporation election. Making introductory remarks, BJP State General Secretary Mahesh Tenginakai said that the party had come up with programmes understanding the pulse of the people. Some few COVID-19 warriors were honoured. A delegation of IT professionals appealed to Mr. Chandrashekhar to take steps to attract more IT companies to the region. Norms flouted Earlier, the Union Minister visited the Siddharood Mutt and offered prayers. Accompanied by BJP leaders, he distributed foodgrain at a PDS shop in Heggeri and visited a vaccination centre, where the staff aired their grievances. At all these places, the COVID-19 guidelines went for a toss as people showed least regard for physical distancing and even workers gathered around the Minister for selfies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-changed-course-of-development/article35949894.ece
17 August 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Legal action against derogatory remarks sought||Condemning the derogatory remarks made about social reformer Basaveshwara and father of Indian Constitution B.R. Ambedkar on social media in the United Kingdom, a group of people led by social activist Ayyappa Ramateerth staged a protest in Kalaburagi city. Both Basaveshwara and Dr. Ambedkar fought against untouchability and caste discrimination in Indian society and were strong advocates of freedom of speech. Basaveshwara pioneered the idea of democracy in 12th Century and Dr. Ambedkar was the architect of the Indian Constitution. Two Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) – Vijayendra Rao and Kumar Kuntikanamath on a WhatsApp discussion have raised the questions about the contribution of Dr. Ambedkar in writing the Constitution of India and also ridiculed Basaveshwara. Mr. Rao from Harrow in London has said “Ambedkar didn’t give Constitution to me as his good friend. I don’t think just because of Ambedkar India got Constitution if not him someone else would have done the job, India is not because of Ambedkar.” Adding insult to injury he has even posted a message with a caption to deliberately annoy British Indians and further alleged that “Ambedkar was one among many capable people”. Mr. Kuntikanamath had falsely alleged that VIPs in Karnataka are being felicitated with worn and torn shawls and Mysore caps at the Basaveshwara statue by the British Kannadiga community. Mr. Ayyappa said that both of them made defamatory remarks on social media groups in March and April 2020, and a police complaint was lodged against them at both in India and United Kingdom after they refused to apologise for their derogatory remarks and have continued their defamatory attacks on followers of Basaveshwara and Dr. Ambedkar. The protesters sought legal action against Mr. Kuntikanamath and Mr. Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/legal-action-against-derogatory-remarks-sought/article35949893.ece

Janbaz told The Hindu that the continued restrictions on timing and vehicle category allowed through the stretch was to study the results of the restoration work.

17 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||From ‘Koots’ to anti-British armed struggles||The mass insurrection against the British administration began in the coastal belt two decades prior to the First War of Independence in 1857 and nearly a century ahead of the Civil Disobedience Movement that began in 1930. Peasant uprisings, which the British called “Koots”, that broke out against the East India Company in the coastal belt during 1830-31, reached the stage of an armed struggle in 1837. The revolt by peasants was not related to the freedom movement, though, but against the high land revenue (tax) assessment and the absence of a lucrative market for farm produce. But it didmotivate people to join the freedom movement after 1850, say researchers. Shaping consciousness In an article titled ‘A Peasant Uprising in South Canara’, published by the Indian History Congress, its author N. Shyam Bhat said that the farmers fought against the British, but not on the political grounds. “... Political consciousness of the peasants had to be shaped from above. It came gradually under the impact of the nationalist movement. The intelligentsia acted as a catalyst in bringing radical ideas to them.” “The peasants were mainly agitated over the company for introducing a system that mandated that taxes should be paid only in cash and not in kind,” said Prabhakara Neerumarga, principal of MAPS Evening College, Mangaluru, who obtained his Ph.D from Mangalore University for his thesis titled ‘1837 Ryot Movement – A Historical Study’. “As farmers were not familiar and comfortable with cash transactions, the new rule gave scope for the birth of middlemen who exploited them.” As the Dakshina Kannada DistrictGazetteer puts it, the uprisings, which began in Bellare in the last week of March, 1837, spread to Sullia, Puttur, Bantwal, Kumble, Kasaragod, and finally Mangalore (now Mangaluru), the headquarters of thethen Canara District. Quoting Lewin’s and Cotton’s reports, Peter Wilson Prabhakar, author, researcher and a retired professor of history, said that in a fight against the British troops in Puttur on March 30, 1837, the peasants fought back. British flag lowered The gazetteer says that the revolutionaries lowered the British flag at Bavutagudda, now in the heart of Mangaluru, on April 5, 1837, and hoisted their own flag. It had made the then Collector in Mangalore, Lurve, summon British soldiers from Bombay, Dharwad, Belgaum, and Harihara to suppress the revolt, which was short-lived. Some leaders captured by the British soldiers were later hanged, a few were put under life imprisonment, and some deported. The peasants had captured Mangalore for 13 days, according to Mr. Neerumarga, who is also the author of the Kannada book ‘Mangalurua Kranti’. They had ransacked the administrative offices under the Company in Mangaluru, Puttur, and Sullia. “The two armed struggles did not have leaders. They were a mass movement against the British,” Mr. Prabhakar said. The impact of the first freedom struggle in 1857 even reflected in the coastal belt, with some people who revolted against the British in 1858 making Darshani Gudda, in Supa taluk of Uttara Kannada (which was part of the then Canara District), a centre of their activity or launch pad. The British divided the Canara District, which was under the Bombay Presidency, on April 16, 1862, as North Canara and South Canara, retaining North Canara under Bombay Presidency and bringing South Canara under the Madras Presidency. Some historians believe that it was to curb the continued revolts against the Company, especially in the North Canara region. (Udupi district was carved out of Dakshina Kannada on August 25, 1997). Salt Satyagraha   Another major milestone in the freedom movement in the belt was the Salt Satyagraha of 1930. It took place in Ankola, Mangalore, Padubidri, Kundapura, Malpe, Mulki, and Kasaragod, said Mr. Prabhakar. According to the Uttara Kannada District Gazetteer, a mass procession at Ankola on April 13, 1930, had attracted people from the princely Mysore area, Hubli, Belgaum, Mangalore and the like. Many volunteers came by foot. The coastal belt actively took part in the freedom struggle later in the 1940 individual civil disobedience movement, the Quit India Movement in 1941, and in the celebration of Independence on Nehru Maidan in 1947, said Mr. Prabhakar.

Delivering the Independence Day address after hoisting the national flag at the divisional headquarters in Palakkad, Mr. Kothari said that the 2.39 km single track stretch near Kulashekara tunnel has been a hindrance for smooth operation of trains in the section.

The pit line work at Mangaluru Central will be completed shortly paving the way for construction of two more platforms at the station. This will help handling more trains from Mangaluru Central. One more foot overbridge, a lift and additional shelter were provided at Mangaluru Junction, Mr. Kothari said. The division has planned to provide sliding booms at 60 level crossing gates this year further enhancing safety at level crossings and reducing detention of trains due to vehicle-hit incidents. Mr. Kothari said that despite COVID-19-related travel restrictions, the division handled 29 lakh originating passengers in the first four months of the fiscal and the overall revenue earning was Rs. 212.15 crore. It handled 1.416 million tonnes of originating freight, 60% higher over the first four months of the last fiscal. He gave away certificates and cash awards to COVID-19 warriors of the division and awarded select staff members for their outstanding performance.

Citing pandemic regulations, Mr. Devadas said, officials called him and three other activists to take part in the event in the city on August 12. They were given a book on Mankutimmanna Kagga to be given to the Chief Minister. “There was a huge crowd at the venue and we were waiting for the Chief Minister to call us.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Khader said it was unfortunate that SDPI activists blocked the procession that was being held to mark the 75th Independence Day celebration on Sunday. There are differences over the role of Veer Savarkar in the Indian freedom struggle and he is accused of conspiring in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. “There are legal ways to question the inclusion of Veer Savarkar’s photo (on the cutout on the vehicle). They could have carried out a public campaign. But, instead, they blocked the movement of Ratha, which is a stupid act,” he said. ‘Failure of administration’ Senior Congress leader and former Bantwal MLA B. Ramanath Rai held the district administration and SDPI responsible for the incident. Mr. Rai told reporters that the district administration had failed in taking precaution to avoid confrontation during the Independence Day celebration. Without naming the SDPI, Mr. Rai said, “The fundamentalist forces are also equally responsibility for creating unrest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/khader-rai-condemn-sdpi-act-in-kabaka/article35950189.ece

It is not just Mysuru district which has no Ministerial berth, even the neighbouring districts of Hassan, Kodagu and Chamarajanagar do not have representation in the Ministry, he rued. He argued that Mysuru was a politically strong region, which had given two Chief Ministers to the State – D. Devaraj Urs and Siddaramaiah. Many development works for the State started from here. It is not that there was no suitable candidate for a Ministerial berth in Mysuru, he said, and referred to Mr. Ramdas, a senior BJP leader, who had already served as a Minister. Mr. Vishwanath also hoped that Mysuru would be represented during the next expansion of the Ministry as there were four more vacant slots in the Ministry headed by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Mr Vishwanath displayed his displeasure over the short notice at which MLAs and MLCs of the district were invited to meetings by Minister for Co-operation S.T. Somashekar, who was also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ministerial-berth-sought-for-mysuru-region/article35949993.ece
17 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vishwanath slams C.T. Ravi, Priyank Kharge||A.H. Vishwanath, former Minister an BJP MLC, on Monday came down on party colleague C.T. Ravi and Congress leader Priyank Kharge for drawing the names of former Prime Ministers of the country - Jawaharlal Nehru and A.B. Vajpayee - in their political tirade and speaking derogatorily about their personal habits during the public debate over naming of government schemes after political leaders. Showering praise on . Nehru as the ‘pride of India’, Mr Vishwanath lashed out at Mr. Ravi for speaking lightly about the late Congress leader, who he said, had spent more years in jail during the freedom struggle than as PM of free India. He said the entire family of Pandit Nehru had not only plunged into the struggle, but also propagated secularism and the message of peace to the world. Their contribution to laying and protecting the secular and democratic foundations in the country can never be forgotten, he said while condemning the utterances of Mr. Ravi, the national general secretary of BJP. While advising Mr. Ravi to read and learn about the leaders of the yore and their speeches in the Upper and Lower House of the Parliament, Mr. Vishwanath called upon him to withdraw his statements. He also did not spare Congress leader Priyank Kharge also for his remarks against the late BJP stalwart A.B. Vajpayee. He asked Mr. Kharge to learn how to speak from his father M. Mallikarjun Kharge, who is now the Congress leader in Rajya Sabha. Mr. Ravi and Mr. Kharge, both former Ministers, should realise that they should maintain decency and decorum in public debates. “Nobody has a right to talk about the private lives of public figures,” he said. To a question on BJP’s opposition to naming of Indira canteens after late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the BJP MLC wondered what was in a name. He said Indira Gandhi had strived to remove poverty in the country with a call for ‘Garibi Hatao’. He described the demand for change of name as ‘pettiness’. “Has anybody asked for removal of the name of Mr. Vajpayee from the health schemes,” he questioned. Portfolios Mr. Vishwanath trained his guns against the Ministers in the State government, who were demanding this. “Are the Ministers, who are demanding a change in portfolio, experts in the departments they were hankering after? Do you want particular departments because there is a lot of money involved,” he questioned before pointing out to them that all portfolios were good and there was lot of work to be done in each department. He recalled that he also started with a small portfolio like Department of Kannada and Culture before he was elevated to the Cabinet rank and allotted with portfolios like Forest, Education and Co-operation. He called upon the Ministers to extend support to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vishwanath-slams-ct-ravi-priyank-kharge/article35949995.ece

Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that schools will be opened in districts where positivity rate is less than 2% as of Sunday. He said the district commissioners would have to take a final call on reopening of schools and a meeting with all DCs would be convened by Mr. Nagesh on Wednesday. Students who choose to come to schools should get a consent letter from parents stating that they have been given permission to attend classes and that they do not have any symptoms of COVID-19. The SOPs state that students should be divided in batches of 15 or 20 for the offline classes. Either one or two students should be seated on each bench, and there should be sufficient distance between the benches. One teacher needs to be appointed as nodal officer in each school to ensure guidelines are followed. School managements have been told to ensure that social distance is maintained inside the campus. To avoid crowding of students, multiple entry and exit gates should be used. If any child has cough, fever or cold, such students should be made to sit in a separate room and parents have to take their children back home. Child profile A child profile should be created to track the academic progress of students. This is to be used if examinations cannot be held due to the COVID-19 situation. School buses are allowed to ply but social distancing must be maintained. As schools are reopening after a long gap, schools should be cleaned and sanitised. Schools have been advised to take help of local civic bodies for cleaning. Besides this, they have been asked to rope in donors to provide students masks and sanitisers. All schools have to identify a doctor in the vicinity, the SOPs say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sops-for-reopening-of-schools-announced/article35949662.ece

After initially working as an employee in a vessel, he had bought a houseboat. The business, he says, was going smoothly until the great deluge of 2018. “What the 2018 and 2019 floods could not do, has been done by COVID-19. The pandemic has brought the houseboat industry to its knees and upended the lives of people like me,” Mr. Babu says. The 44-year-old man from Thathampally in Alappuzha has temporarily handed over his boat to a cousin ‘due to irregular houseboat operations’ and is engaged in online fish delivery to make ends meet. While a number of houseboat owners and employees have migrated to new pastures over the past one-and-a-half years, others who still cling on despite all the hardships are hoping for better days. The pandemic-hit sector, which is desperate for recovery, is pinning its hope on the Onam festival season. “In the last 15 months, houseboats had remained anchored for a total of 10 months. Whenever it resumed services after two lockdowns- in October 2020 and earlier this month, the houseboat operations remain a fraction of pre-pandemic times. The sector is aiming for a gradual recovery and this Onam is all about survival. We have announced packages and discounts, but are yet to get the traction we are expecting,” says Kevin Rozario, general secretary, All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Samiti. Zero arrivals With ‘almost zero arrivals’ from outside Kerala, the business largely depends on tourists from the Malabar region. Only around 40% of the registered vessels are currently conducting services as the rest remain unfit after being anchored for several months. According to M. Malin, secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC), 202 boats conducted services on Saturday, 130 on Sunday and 88 on Monday. “We are expecting an increase in tourist footfalls during the Onam holidays, which will be a boon to the struggling industry,” says Mr. Malin. Both doses Only employees who have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are allowed to operate the boats. Tourists arriving in Alappuzha for backwater cruises should either produce a COVID-19- negative certificate after an RT-PCR test taken not more than 72 hours prior to their visit or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate of at least one dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/houseboats-look-to-onam-for-revival/article35949939.ece
17 August 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Nerekadavu bridge work to resume||The construction of the Nerekadavu- Makkekadavu bridge over Vembanad Lake connecting Kottayam and Alappuzha districts will be resumed. Officials said here on Monday that the issues pertaining to land acquisition had been resolved. The Revenue Department has started the process of acquiring land for the construction of approach roads by paying compensation to landowners before September. “After completing all the process, the land will be handed over to the Public Works Department in September. It will help restart construction of the bridge,” said an official. Hit a roadblock Although the bridge was partially constructed, the project had hit a roadblock due to an inordinate delay in land acquisition. It was put back on track after Revenue Minister K. Rajan chaired a meeting recently. The Nerekadavu- Makkekadavu bridge is part of the Thuravoor-Pampa highway. The bridge, once completed, will have a length of 800 meters. Of the total 22 spans, two are navigation spans in the middle each having a length of 47.16 meters. The construction of navigation spans has almost been completed. The bridge will have footpaths on both sides with a width of 1.5 metres. The approach roads each will have a length of 60 metres. The government had sanctioned Rs. 151 crore for the Thuravoor-Pampa road in the 2011-12 budget. The construction of the Nerekadavu-Makkekadavu bridge was started during the tenure of the previous Left Democratic Front government, but the work came to a halt couple of years ago. Last year, the Kerala High Court directed the State government to immediately acquire land for the construction of approach roads on both sides. The Thuravoor-Pampa highway passes through Thycattussery, Udayanapuram, Vaikom, Kaduthuruthy, Kuruvilangad, Pala, Ponkunnam, and Erumely. It will connect pilgrim centres of Thuravoor temple, Vaikom, Kaduthuruthy, Ettumanur, and Erumely. Besides, the Nerekadavu-Makkekadavu bridge will provide connectivity between the National Highway 66 at Thuravoor and the State Highway 15 at Udayanapuram. Bridge completed The construction of another bridge connecting Thycattussery and Thuravoor, part of the highway project, was completed some time ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nerekadavu-bridge-work-to-resume/article35949944.ece

Excessive socialisation means that many bubbles converge,” T.V. Ravi, president of IMA, Kochi, said. Dr. Ravi said that it becomes possible for a virus located in a bubble far away to find its way to our home or workplace unless we are consciously aware of multiple bubbles around us. “Socialisation increases this risk. For people who work in healthcare/public places, the bubble is large,” he said. High-risk areas “The risk of spread is much lower in open spaces. The risk of spread is greater indoors. Therefore, systematic efforts must be made to improve ventilation and air circulation after consulting experts such as architects/engineers,” he said. An advisory issued by the association on the possible COVID-19 surge post-Onam pointed out that the timing of opening of shops and other public places must be extended so that people have the option of shopping when it is less crowded. Reducing opening hours will only increase crowding, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ima-warns-of-surge-in-cases-post-onam/article35950153.ece
17 August 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Greens slam move to redevelop road||The moves afoot to redevelop the old Aluva-Kothamangalam-Thattekkad-Munnar road, to lessen the distance between Ernakulam and Munnar, has been welcomed by residents of the area, even as it has attracted flak from environmentalists who say that this would prove death knell for the evergreen dense forests and allied ecosystems en route. The corridor, which was once the only way to access Munnar, was built by erstwhile kings of Travancore. It was abandoned following the devastating floods of 1924 and the Department of Forests took over considerable parts of the corridor, especially areas in Idukki district. The existing road through Neriamangalam and the hairpin curves that lead to Munnar was subsequently developed. Many say that the recent moves to revive the old corridor is not absolutely necessary from the connectivity point of view, since NHAI is expected to ready a greenfield NH linking Kochi with Theni. The NH corridor would be readied as part of augmenting connectivity between Kochi and Tuticorin ports. Tourism potential Thattekkad-based nature guide Girish Chandran, who is also a lawyer, spoke of how reviving and developing the old road held the potential to improve the standard of living of people living in Pooyamkutty, Kuttampuzha (a vast region which also has a tribal hamlet) and nearby areas. “It will also lessen the distance from Dr. Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary in Thattekad to Munnar, to approximately 50 km, helping tourists who land at Kochi airport reach Munnar faster. They could even check out tourist locales en route,” he said. Interestingly, the Thattekkad-Pooyamkutty stretch of the road was recently resurfaced under a KIIFB initiative. Former chairman of Kothamangalam Municipality Biju Thomas said care ought to be taken to prevent damage or disturbance to forests and wildlife, by fencing either side of the road. It would also be ideal if curbs are imposed on night traffic. In addition, personnel could be posted at frequent intervals to ensure that tourists and others do not litter the stretch, nor halt in groups, Mr. Thomas said. Sources in PWD (Roads wing) said the road’s revival plans are yet to be finalised. “There could be hassles since much of the stretch is under the control of the Department of Forests. There are encroachments by traders and others in many other parts.” Environmental hazard The development of the road would severely impact flora and fauna on the corridor which is part of Western Ghats, said John Peruvanthanam, chairman, Save Western Ghats Movement. “The government’s ultimate aim seems to be to develop the stretch as a four-lane one, well beyond Kuttampuzha. This would in turn result in resorts and other tourism ventures coming up in large numbers and destroy the pristine ecosystem there. The decision makers seem unmindful of the fact that upper Pooyamkutty-Aanamudi alone has about 2,000 Asiatic elephants. Incursion into their habitats could result in them venturing into human settlements.” Stakeholders in the government and tourism sectors do not seem to have learnt lessons from resorts and hotels propping up in violation of rules in Munnar and many other ecologically fragile areas. Wild animals could even be hunted down under the garb of tourism, while destruction of forests could affect the Periyar, from where much of Ernakulam district sources drinking water. It is sad that people have not learnt much from the 2018 deluge and severe climate changes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greens-slam-move-to-redevelop-road/article35950148.ece

Initial works will involve strengthening the banks of the Kadambrayar and the Edachira stream, situated in the heart of Infopark, the information technology hub in Kakkanad. Besides strengthening the banks of the two waterbodies, works, once approved by the District Planning Committee, will include laying of tiles and beautification of the area.

17 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||In Kerala, governance seeped into the grassroots in 25 years||The Onam of 2018 was at its collective best in Kerala’s flood relief camps. Little troops of children, some with their mothers in tow, had gathered around the spots marked for science, drama, games and the like at S.N. College, Cherthala. The atmosphere looked festive, belying the shock the people sheltered there suffered. This prompted a visiting delegation to wonder which NGO ran the camp. “It took me a few minutes to register the thought behind the query. I pointed to the man, the president of the panchayat in the area, standing at a distance, and said, ‘that’s the NGO’,” recalls T.M. Thomas Isaac, who as Alappuzha MLA and State Minister of Finance, was at the camp then. According to Dr. Isaac, the biggest achievement of the people’s planning movement (initially People’s Plan Campaign), which turns 25 on Tuesday, has been its success in pulling down the wall between civil society and the government, which at the local level became as informal as an NGO and remained close to the people. As a social scientist and a member of the State Planning Board, Dr. Isaac was among the captains of the movement. “With the creation of a system at the grassroots, we have enlarged the democratic space for people to intervene,” he says, citing the local self-governments’ stellar role in post-flood rescue, relief and rehabilitation and in COVID-19 management. Alternative to TINA Devolution of powers was something that the Left has always strived for and for E.M.S. Namboodiripad, Left ideologue and Kerala’s first Chief Minister, it was as fundamental as the land reforms, which required decades of peasant mobilisation. Therefore, he wanted a mass movement in which the people would demand decentralisation and create the political will instead of a top-down approach. In the 1990s, TINA (There Is No Alternative) was the neo-liberal buzzword and the Left, it was argued, was without a plan to address the new aspirations of the people enjoying better lifestyle, life expectancy. But, joining hands with the Left were civic organisations, academics and civil servants to help gather data, map resources, and devise plans at the local level. The effects of decentralisation and the central interventions like the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board aiding it is the theme of the book, ‘Kerala, Another Possible World’ being written by Dr. Isaac.  The movement produced splendid results in most areas — public education, health, sanitation, housing, women empowerment, and poverty alleviation — where powers were transferred to local governments. But the showing was not up to the mark in the production sector, in agriculture or creation of small and medium enterprises. Integration of schemes was not good enough, either. These are being addressed now with four missions. “We have also declared that in the 25th year, every local body will create five jobs in the non-agriculture sector for every 1,000 persons. Each local body will grow a Miyawaki forest as the anniversary souvenir,” he says. Area of concern An area of concern is the waning participation of people in the planning process. To make deliberations meaningful, several ideas are being contemplated, including making Kudumbashree units sub-sets of the grama sabha where people can discuss things with a representative presenting it at the grama sabha. While the local bodies today make their own disaster management plans, Dr. Isaac believes that they can be trained to make watershed-based planning to address the looming danger of climate change.

The Bench recently directed district collectors to periodically convene meetings of local self-government departments and NGOs, identify issues and ensure that the homeless are provided with sufficient night shelters with basic amenities for their day-to-day requirements. The orders were issued while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by late Basil Attipetty seeking a directive to the State government to construct night shelters for those who spend nights on the streets, footpaths, and pavements. According to the petitioner, the inaction on the part of the State government and local bodies to construct night shelters was a violation of the rights conferred on citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution. ‘Shelters established’ The State government informed the court that night shelters had been established in nine districts and in addition to these institutions, there were 574 orphanages run by non-governmental organisations for different categories of inmates with financial support from the State government. Besides, shelter homes existed in different names under the Kerala Social Security Mission. On labourers It pointed out that as per Section 16 of the Kerala Inter-State Migrant workmen (Regulations of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 and Rules, 1983 of the Act, it shall be the duty of every contractor/employer of inter-State migrant workers to provide and maintain suitable residential accommodation to such workmen during the period of their employment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-directive-to-govt-a-relief-for-street-dwellers/article35950141.ece

The deliberations of the Synod will be conducted online in the background of COVID-19. A total of 61 Bishops from India and abroad will participate in the Synod, said a spokesperson for the Syro-Malabar church. The Synod will continue up to August 27 with each of the days having two hours of interactions among the Synod members in view of the differences in the time zones of the participating Bishops. One of the key issues that will come up before the Synod is the way Mass should be celebrated. There have been differences of opinion over the issue. While there is a group that has argued for the Mass being celebrated facing the people, there is another group that advocates the more traditional celebration of the Mass with the celebrant facing away from the congregation. A group of 466 priests from the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese has written to the Vatican demanding that the Mass should be celebrated with the celebrant facing the people. The group of priests said that the practice had been on in the archdiocese for the past 50 years and it should be continued. Similar petitions are learnt to have been sent to the Vatican from dioceses where “people-facing” Mass is celebrated. Protest by laity forum Meanwhile, Almaya Munnettam, a group of reform-minded Catholics in the Archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly, demanding more transparency in church administration, has protested against Cardinal Alencherry heading the Synod. The group staged a protest in front of Mount St. Thomas, the headquarters of the church at Kakkanad on Monday. A spokesperson for Alamaya Munnettam said that since the Kerala High Court had said that the Cardinal should face trial, he should step down from his position. The group also reiterated its demand that the Cardinal should make good the loss suffered by the archdiocese on account of the sale of lands that belonged to the archdiocese.

A report on flood mitigation, prepared by the department and submitted to the State government and civic authorities the other day, pointed out that the Revenue Department regularised the encroachment at Kumaranasan Nagar in Punchathodu and fixed the boundary into the canal. This has led to the shrinkage of the width of the canal to about two metres from the original six metres. There are also other instances of legalising encroachments, which have in turn reduced the water-holding capacities of the canal system. The departments concerned have to take a relook into the issue and recapture the waterways, suggested the report prepared by a team led by R. Baji Chandran, Superintending Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Central Circle) Ernakulam. The report warned that the canal system will disappear in near future and the flooding of the city during rainy season becomes inevitable if the issue is not addressed. A 400-metre stretch of the Rameswaram Canal in West Kochi has vanished as it has been reclaimed and occupied. Earlier, all the canals in West Kochi were navigable ones. However, they have been covered with concrete slabs and silted up, it pointed out. Nearly 10 per cent of the water-spread area of Chilavannoor lake has been reclaimed, which has contributed significantly to the city flooding, the report noted. The department had looked into the issues plaguing the 39 main canals which passed through the Kochi Corporation limits for the assessment. The study was conducted by a team of irrigation engineers by assessing data including history of each canal. Maps of the canal network were made and analysed in the process. The study revealed that waste water, including septic tank drainages, were opened into the canal. The public was found using the canals for dumping waste. The unauthorised encroachments and covering the canals with RCC slabs had reduced the capacity of the canals and led to the cleaning of silt difficult, it was pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/canal-encroachments-regularised-report/article35950149.ece

(BPCL) for support under its corporate social responsibility fund. The project had hit a roadblock after the forty education volunteers, who remain the backbone of the project, were not given their monthly salary of Rs. 10,000 from November last to March this year for paucity of funds. The innovative project was launched by the district administration in 2017 with the corporate social responsibility fund of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Roshni project had also found mention in the Governor’s policy address last year. However, the revised project proposal in tune with the requirements of the online mode of education was pending before the district administration since August last. “It is a socially relevant project and we hope that the project would get the support from BPCL. The revised proposal has earmarked the pending salary for the educational volunteers and the expected expenditure till March next,” said Jafar Malik, District Collector. As many as 1,250 migrant children enrolled in Classes 1 to 7 across 40 government and aided schools in the district had received the benefit of the programme amidst the pandemic situation in the previous academic year.  The Hindu report, ‘Educational project for children of migrant workers in Ernakulam district hits a roadblock’, published on June 9 had stated that about Rs. 20 lakh was required to clear the salary arrears of the 40 educational volunteers since November. The salary for the first five months of the previous academic year was given using the balance fund available in the academic year 2019-20. The heads of the schools partnering the programme had sought the help of the educational volunteers to interact with migrant children after online sessions began on June 1. They had extended their services despite not receiving the salary arrears to ensure that the students did not miss out on online classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/roshni-project-for-migrant-children-to-be-revived/article35950156.ece

Justice Sathish Ninan issued the directive recently while allowing a plea of a single mother who got pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF), seeking a directive to the government to strike down the column requiring details of the father of the child from the birth certificate. The court observed that the right of a single parent/unwed mother to conceive through ART having been recognised, prescriptions of forms requiring to mention the name of the father whose details had to be kept anonymous was violative of the fundamental rights of privacy, liberty, and dignity. Having conceived through ART procedure, the identity of the sperm donor could not be disclosed except in circumstances as may be compelled, under the law.

A pilot project has now been launched in the Pullampara grama panchayat in the capital district, where a wide-ranging project aimed at recharging groundwater will be implemented. The MGNREGS is taking up watershed-based projects as parts of efforts to reorient the scheme from a mere job-giving one to one that would contribute towards environmental protection, improvement of biodiversity and agricultural production, and creation of durable assets. According to MGNREGS State mission officials, there have been individual works on groundwater recharging or improvement of streams under the project in some areas. But till now, there has not been a comprehensively planned project for a larger area. Scientific methods “Under the project, the watersheds will be scientifically identified and projects for the whole area planned. For instance, if a canal is chosen, various kinds of water conservation activities will be planned around it. This will be a much more intensive, result-oriented project than the existing individual ones. The planning process has already begun for similar projects in all the other thirteen districts. By focusing on such projects, we are also planning to reduce the amount of land-based activities now being carried out in individual plots,” said an MGNREGS State mission official. Under the pilot project titled ‘Neeruravu’ in Pullampara, a project worth Rs. 4 crore is being planned on 266 hectares, spread over 2-3 wards. Check dams will be built across the streams to control the flow as well as to increase the groundwater level. In the catchment areas of the canals or streams, rain pits and bunds will be constructed and afforestation will be carried out. Ponds will be made and wells in these regions will be recharged. As part of the project, revenue-generating assets including cowsheds and work sheds for self-help groups in the area will also be constructed. For scientific treatment of waste, compost pits and soak pits will be made. The mission estimates that at least 60,000 work days will be created in the region in the three years that the project will take for completion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mgnregs-to-focus-on-watershed-based-projects/article35950231.ece
17 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Naming species after politicians draws flak||What is in a name? Nothing much, one may argue. But from the point of view of science, it may not be that easy a question to answer. The naming of two newly discovered plant species from the State after former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan and K.K. Shailaja, former Health Minister, has, for instance, evoked sharp reactions from senior scientists. Scientific environment The practice has been relatively alien to the scientific environment in Kerala. The debate primarily surrounds the individual choice of the researcher and whether there is a line which should not be crossed. Naming new species after political leaders is an unhealthy and unethical practice that should have been avoided by researchers, according to Oommen V. Oommen, zoologist and former chairman, Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB). He feels that it has the potential to ignite an undesirable competition to have species named after politicians, ultimately leading to polarisation among scientists. “While there are no hard and fast rules for naming new species, scientists follow certain dos and don’ts. One of the principles to be scrupulously followed is avoid anything that would smack of political association or prejudice because that would set a bad precedent and leave scope for interpretation of the researcher's intention. There is, however, a general consensus on naming new species after scientists of good calibre,” Prof. Oommen said. A. Ajayaghosh, director, National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology under the CSIR in Thiruvananthapuram, concurs that naming new species after political leaders is not a good trend. “It could reflect the political affiliation of the researcher or his/her aspiration and not the desire for scientific pursuit. There are so many researchers who have contributed to science in a big way, naming a species after them would be an honour,” Dr. Ajayaghosh said. In the case under discussion, the researchers stated that the two politicians were chosen in one case for his contributions to environment conservation, and in the other for her tackling of epidemics/pandemic with a scientific temper, and not for their politics. Commonly, the names of individuals, regions/localities or a specific trait of the plant or animal in question are chosen as the specific epithets. While there are written guidelines to be followed in the naming process, unwritten guidelines also hold considerable sway in the scientific world. A. Biju Kumar, Professor and Head, Department of Aquatic Biology, University of Kerala, said a scientist had the liberty to choose the specific epithet (the second part in the binomial nomenclature following the generic name) for a species. “There are separate international codes governing the nomenclature of plants and animals. The researcher who makes the discovery has the freedom to choose a name. At the same time, the convention is subjected to misuse if the name is chosen specifically to please a higher-up,” he said. Even in big research institutions, the choice of the researcher is generally upheld.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/naming-species-after-politicians-draws-flak/article35949956.ece
17 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Praveen Nath, transman, is Mr. Kerala||Praveen Nath, a transman from Nenmara in Palakkad, has bagged a gold medal in the transgender category to become Mr. Kerala 2021. Praveen had won the Mr. Thrissur title in April this year to get selection to the Mr. Kerala event. His win at the two-day event in Kottayam on Saturday is especially significant as a special category for transgender persons was created by the Body Building Association of Kerala at the district and State levels to allow Praveen to compete. Twenty-four-year-old Praveen says the journey to the title has been challenging, especially as the association was initially reluctant to carve a new category for transgender persons. However, Vinu Mohan, a former Mr. Kerala who trained him, convinced the association that Praveen should be given a chance so that others from the transgender community too could come forward in bodybuilding. Sex surgery Praveen who underwent a sex reassignment surgery in 2019 had been working as an advocacy coordinator for the Thrissur-based LGBT community-based organisation Sahayathrika when his interest in bodybuilding led him to a nearby Ayyanthole gym, RS Fitness Hub, where Vinu Mohan was a trainer. Since he did not have any clue how to get started with bodybuilding, he joined the gym and confided to Vinu that he was a transman who was keen on the sport. Vinu then held discussions with the bodybuilding association, and within six months Praveen had competed in and won Mr. Thrissur. Praveen says he wanted to do something different in life, become a model for his community, and prove himself to society that tends to disparage transmen. He is looking forward to the Mr. India contest in February next year, and then many more events, provided he is able to raise the money without capitalising on his transman identity, says Praveen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/praveen-nath-transman-is-mr-kerala/article35950037.ece
17 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Plus One: existing quotas to remain||The State government has decided to continue all the existing reservations for Plus One admission under the single-window system for this academic year. It has also decided to continue the 10% reservation for students from the economically weaker sections (EWS) in the unreserved category. The clarity on reservation comes in a government order on proposals submitted by the Director of General Education on higher secondary Plus One admission. The 10% reservation was applicable to the total number of seats, including the marginal seat increase. This brought 58% of the total seats under various quotas. However, with the Supreme Court stating in the Maratha quota verdict that reservation could not exceed 50%, the government decided to seek legal opinion.

Prasad has said. Interventions in this regard will be strengthened so that surplus production does not cause hardships to the farmer, the Minister said, formally inaugurating the 2,000 ‘Onasamriddhi’ farmers’ markets opened by the Agriculture Department for Onam, at the Horticorp outlet at Palayam on Monday. Farm incomes The State government aims to improve procurement, processing and marketing of agricultural produce to increase farmer incomes. Farm-sector initiatives launched by the government in the farm sector are aimed at increasing the income of farmers by at least 50%, he said. Steps have been taken to form 25 farmer producer organisations under the 100-day action plan of the State government, Mr. Prasad added. Minister for Food and Civil supplies G. R. Anil presided. Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty, Transport Minister Antony Raju, District Panchayat president D. Suresh Kumar and Depauty Mayor P. K. Raju were present. The ‘Onasamriddhi 2021’ markets will be on till August 20. Agricultural produce procured at a 10% to 20% higher price from farmers are being sold at 30% subsidised rates at the markets. Of the 2,000 markets, 1,350 are run by Krishi Bhavans, 500 by Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp), and 150 by the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/2000-onasamriddhi-markets-opened/article35949949.ece

The crisis could not have come at a more inopportune time. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), an autonomous body under the Ministry of External Affairs that has been providing scholarships and facilitating admissions of foreign students, has been processing applications for enrolment to Indian universities. Like some other States, Kerala has been witnessing an increase in the number of Afghans enrolling for programmes in higher education institutions. As many as 38 Afghan students and researchers had joined the universities in Kerala last year. Among them, the highest enrolment was recorded in Mahatma Gandhi University. “There were high chances that the number would have gone up this year,” says K. Ayyanar, regional director, ICCR, Thiruvananthapuram. The tentative lists of eligible students prepared by universities were sent to the Indian Embassy in Kabul. The council provides 1,000 scholarships to Afghan students. Anxious moments Mustafa Salimi (27), a first-year MBA student at the Institute of Management in Kerala, struggled to prepare for his first-semester Kerala University exam on Monday with disheartening news trickling in from in Kabul. With telecom services down in Afghanistan, Mustafa’s family has been relying on a weak internet connectivity to contact him through WhatsApp. “We do not know how long we will be able to communicate. They have not been able to leave the house or purchase essentials from the market. The entire country has been locked down,” he says. With the education system in Afghanistan in tatters, he appealed to the Government of India to provide the Afghan youth with more opportunities to study here. Another Afghan, who has been pursuing MSc Computer Science at the university’s Karyavattom campus, feared for his family stranded in Helmand province that was captured by the Taliban over a week ago. “Unfortunately, we do not have a government that took responsibility of its citizens. We lost a chance to repair the country during the last 20 years and prevent another resurgence of the Taliban forces,” he said, requesting anonymity “in order to ensure my family remained safe.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/taliban-may-spoil-education-prospects-of-afghans-in-india/article35949941.ece
17 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Brahmapuram, Nallalam projects to switch to LNG||The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has decided to push ahead with a plan to convert the Kozhikode Diesel Power Project (KDPP) at Nallalam and the Brahmapuram Diesel Power Plant (BDPP), Kochi, into liquefied natural gas-fuelled power stations. Global tenders will be invited for the conversion and operation of both plants and supply of electricity to the KSEB under tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) norms, the KSEB director board has decided. As per the decision taken earlier this month, the successful bidder will be leased the existing plant infrastructure. Sources said on Monday that the KSEB had decided to inject fresh life into the gasification project citing the need to step up power generation within the State. High operational costs Commissioned in the 1990s, the projects had lost their charm due to high operational costs. The KSEB has been using low sulphur heavy stock (LSHS), a residual fuel processed from crude, for running them. Of late, the KDPP has been maintained as a stand-by for meeting emergency power requirements in north Kerala. “At present a bare minimum stock of fuel is only available at the KDPP as the production of the LSHS has been completely stopped by oil refineries in Kerala,” the KSEB noted in an August 10 order. The proposal to convert the plants into LNG-based facilities had begun doing the rounds after the construction of a Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) pipeline project. However, the high cost of LNG conversion and the availability of cheaper power from outside the State had prompted the KSEB to tread cautiously.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brahmapuram-nallalam-projects-to-switch-to-lng/article35949953.ece

The All Kerala Retail Ration Dealers Association has called for a hunger strike from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the first day of the Malayalam month of Chingam in the State capital, district centres and taluk centres. The ration dealers will observe betrayal day as part of the protest. Association State president Johnny Nellore and general secretary T. Mohammedali said that ration dealers would not resort to any measures that would adversely affect the public. Ration distribution would not be affected. They claimed the government owed them nearly Rs. 55 crore. They criticised the government for failing to compensate the families of 55 dealers and salesmen who succumbed to COVID-19. Though the government had planned to complete the Onam-kit distribution on Monday, only 39.71 lakh of the 90.96 lakh card holders got them.

It adopted a resolution to muster public opinion against the Central government’s bid to undermine democracy by denying parliamentary debate on issues that impacted the people. The CPI(M) also slammed Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan for belittling Left Democratic Front MPs who protested against the Centre’s anti-democratic conduct in the Rajya Sabha. CJI’s concern The CPI(M) pointed out that Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana had also lamented the lack of meaningful debate in Parliament in his Independence Day address. The void had caused avoidable litigations, he said. The Centre had muscled several laws through Parliament without discussion. It had used its majority in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha to silence dissenting voices. The Centre refused the leave of the House to discuss the targetting of mobile phones used by Opposition politicians with the aid of the Israel-made spyware, Pegasus. The Bills passed without debate included the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, ESMA amendment, the law banning strike, General Insurance Privatisation Bill, amendments to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, CAA and the latest farm laws, the CPI(M) said. The arbitrary passage of the laws had caused social upheaval, as in the case of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-to-muster-public-support-against-centre/article35950157.ece

17 August 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Why peafowl numbers are on the rise||A newly married couple on motorbike met with a tragic end in Thrissur on Monday after a flying peacock hit the rider on the chest. The man lost his life in the accident, while his wife sustained injuries. This is not an isolated case. Incidents of peafowls causing threat to motorists are frequent now, especially near paddy fields. Peafowls, whose appearances were quite rare in the State earlier, are now spotted even in densely populated areas. P.O. Nameer, Head of the Centre for Wildlife Studies, College of Forestry, Kerala Agricultural University, Thrissur, says the increasing sightings of the Indian Peafowl ( Pavo cristatus ), a dry-land species, are an indicator of the changing climate in Kerala. “Birds can be regarded as a bioindicator of environmental change as they are very sensitive to vagaries of climate. However, only limited analysis is available on the effect of climate change on the distribution of birds in India. In recent years, the Indian Peafowl, an arid-land species, has been found to be expanding in Kerala, a region falling under humid tropics,” notes Dr. Nameer, who conducted a study, along with Sanjo Jose V., Academy of Climate Change Education and Research, KAU. The study has attempted to understand the expanding distribution of peafowls, influence of climatic variables and their future extent of distribution. According to the study, currently 19.15 % area in the State provides a suitable habitat for the peafowl. Predictions suggest that this may expand from 41.44% to 55.33% by 2050. Central Kerala is found to be the hotspot for its expansion. Human-bird conflict The human-peafowl conflict often arises when the birds damage paddy crops. “The birds sometimes come in groups and finish paddy spikes in a large area,” says Sreeja, an organic farmer at Arangottukara. One of the earliest bird surveys carried out in 1933 by ornithologist Salim Ali did not record the Indian Peafowl in Kerala. Scientists say peafowl started making an appearance in large numbers here from the 80s. Due to its status as the National Bird, people often do not attack the birds. Its meat too is not consumed in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/motorist-killed-in-kerala-by-flying-peacock/article35949545.ece

While the restriction on social, cultural and political events remain, the Government has announced unlocking measures considering the festival season. As Onam sets in, these relaxations bring in tremendous hope for merchants, who are desperate to revive their lost business. Over the last couple of years, the festival sales have lost its sheen due to repeated floods and Covid. It was a tough decision for the Government to open up, especially as there is no respite for the infection spread. While this is a welcome move, it is also important that we safeguard ourselves and be responsible enough to ensure the safety of others. Onam marks the commencement of the festival season in India. The State generally has three major festival seasons and Onam is the biggest among that. This year Onam comes in a bit earlier than usual but the timing is perfect for some ‘’revenge spending’’ especially after being stuck indoors for months. The re-opening of malls in particular will create reasons for families to visit stores and purchase. Chingam (Malayalam month) apparently is also the wedding season which can trigger bulk purchases. It was a few days back, when the Chief Minister officially inaugurated the celebrations and most of it is going to happen virtually. Unlike the previous years, many consumer durable brands have done their home-work and are eyeing for a growth in sales. Several of them have already announced attractive offers to lure customers. Interestingly there are a few which record over 50% of their annual sales during Onam. The usual players – textiles, home appliances, automobiles and mobile phones are all pinning high hopes. Kerala consumers are highly aware and knowledgeable and this year they are safety cautious too. Businesses must devise out of the box ideas to make their shopping experience safe, joyful and most importantly memorable. Revival of the economy is not something for the Government alone to do. Citizens are equally responsible for getting it back on track. Consumer sentiments are usually high during this time of the year. It is true that the vaccination rate in Kerala is a matter of concern but consumers today are confident to venture out following protocols and this is sure to propel spending. Businesses too have learnt their way to survive the period and many of them today have improved their digital presence. To beat competition, even conventional traders are now proactively reaching out to their customers. For Malayalees, Onam is an emotion. Let us unanimously celebrate it beyond isolation, beyond distances and beyond borders.

The youth, Mukkera Purushottam, was one among the five persons from India who attempted to scale the volcanic mountain peak that stands in Southern Russia, in the Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. The peak rises 18,510 feet from sea level. The Elbrus has two summits, both of which are dormant volcanic domes. The taller, western summit is 5,642 metres (18,510 ft); the eastern summit is 5,621 metres (18,442 ft). Hailing from a weavers’ family, the 25-year-old, who had been practising mountaineering, could not take it forward due to his poverty. Mr. Purushottam lost his father but continued his family profession of weaving along with his mother and completed his undergraduate course last year.

17 August 2021||BENGALURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ensure that police adhere to juvenile justice law: HC||Observing that the police had, prima facie , violated the rights of children while probing a sedition case registered against a school in Bidar last year, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to issue directions to the police to ensure that they do not violate the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016, while questioning children. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda also asked the government to explain what action was taken against the police who were in uniform, and some even carrying their firearms, in the presence of children at a school, run by Shaheen Education Society, contrary to Rule 86(5) of the JJ Model Rules. The Bench issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by city-based advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and the South India Cell for Human Rights Education and Monitoring, an NGO. The Bench noted that Rule 86(5) mandates that police officers interacting with children should be, as far as possible, in plain clothes and not in uniform. Also, when dealing with girl children, women police personnel should be engaged. From the photographs produced on behalf of the petitioners, the Bench noted that some police personnel were not only in their uniform, but also carrying firearms. From the photographs, it can be said that prima facie it is a serious case of violation of the rights of children under the provisions of the Model Rules, the Bench said. The court, in February last year, had asked the government whether the police were in their uniform while questioning/counselling students in connection with the case. The government had replied that the police were in plain clothes, and the Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was in uniform while conducting spot mahazar and other investigation place, was in plain clothes at the time of counselling/questioning 17 students. Later, the petitioners produced the photographs in which some police personnel were found to be in their uniform, with two carrying their firearms. As the Deputy Superintendent of Police did not deny the correctness of the photographs produced by the petitioners, the Bench said it had to infer that he had accepted its validity. A criminal case was registered against Shaheen Education Society and others for allegedly enacting a play using schoolchildren to incite people to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and to give “negative opinion” on the laws enacted by Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ensure-that-police-adhere-to-juvenile-justice-law-hc/article35949587.ece
17 August 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||At least 3.94 lakh missed Covaxin 2nd dose within 6-week window||The number of people missing their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine remains a cause for concern in Tamil Nadu, with the latest data showing that at least 3.94 lakh missed their second dose of Covaxin within the Indian Council of Medical Research-advised window of a maximum of six weeks. A similar analysis done by The Hindu two months ago showed that 1.41 lakh people had missed their second dose as of second week of June. By then, the State had administered a total of 16.6 lakh doses of Covaxin, including the first and the second dose. Since then, the total number of Covaxin doses administered has more than doubled to 35.6 lakh as of August 15. Number has doubled Consequently, the number of people who missed their second dose within the six-week period has also more than doubled from 1.41 lakh to 3.94 lakh. In other words, 22%, or roughly one in every five persons who took the first dose six weeks ago, failed to take their second dose. According to the data available on vaccination done through government-run centres and camps, 17,72,296 people had taken their first dose of Covaxin as of July 4. Ideally, all of them should have taken their second dose by August 15, which marked the end of the six-week window. However, only 13,78,779 people had taken their second dose as of August 15. The difference of 3.94 lakh is only the minimum number of people who had missed. The actual number could be higher as the number of second doses administered as on Aug 15 may include those who took their second dose in the past four to six weeks as well. While people may have missed their second dose of Covishield as well, it was difficult to ascertain the number as the window advised by ICMR for Covishield kept changing. Chennai was the only district that improved in closing the gap on people missing their second Covaxin shot. Only 12 % of people who took their first dose as on July 4 had missed their second dose by Aug 15, compared to the State average of 22 %. It was also the only district where the number of people who missed their second dose declined from around 60,000 in mid-June to roughly 50,000 on Aug 15 despite a sharp increase in the total doses administered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/at-least-394-lakh-missed-covaxin-second-dose-within-six-week-window-in-tn/article35949665.ece

17 August 2021||KANNUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Century-old palace to be demolished||The century-old Pazhassi Padinjare Kovilakom, also called Kottayam Padinjare Kovilakom, near Mattannur in Kannur district, where the descendants of the legendary freedom fighter Veera Kerala Pazhassi Raja have been living, is set to be demolished, ending the long-drawn efforts to preserve the building. The local representative, municipality, and public representatives had formed a committee in an attempt to conserve the century-old palace, which was built about 118 years ago by the royal family. One of the owners of the Kolvilakom, Ravi Verma Raja, told The Hindu that they had initiated the move to demolish the building on a contract of Rs. 6 lakh. The decision to demolish the building was taken by the family members as they could not maintain it. However, they put on hold the decision after people raised the issue with the government. However, since the original palace of Pazhassi Raja was demolished by the East India Company and the road from Thalassery to Mysore laid over it, the government refused to support its conservation, citing that the present building was one where his descendants lived and did not have a direct link to the Raja. ‘Only solution’ “The building is weak and many portions of the building are in a dilapidated condition and falling apart. If it cannot be maintained, the only solution is to demolish it,” Mr. Ravi Verma Raja said. However, P. Jayarajan, convener of the regional chapter of the Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage, said the building had a lot of historical relevance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/century-old-palace-to-be-demolished/article35949549.ece
17 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mass culling of wild boar to begin shortly||Mass culling of crop-raiding wild boars that inhabit areas located away from forest boundaries will begin after Onam holidays. The intensive culling operation, the first of its kind in the State, aims to reduce its population considerably in two months. Divisional forest officers of the State have identified around 300 hotspots. The carcass of the animals would be burnt using kerosene to prevent the consumption of its meat, say officials. Farmers have been complaining about the crop loss caused by wild boars, and the efforts of the government to get the species declared as vermin have not succeeded. Recently, the Kerala High Court had asked the Forest Department to permit the killing of the animals in three districts based on a petition by 12 people. The department plans to seek the support of sharp shooters from rifle clubs for the culling, says Bennichan Thomas, Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala. Prolific breeders The animals that live in places far away from forest boundaries are of no ecological and conservation value. The population of the species, which are prolific breeders, has gone up exponentially in the absence of natural predators in these locations. They pose a serious threat to food security and farming, says Mr. Thomas. In the Kollam forest division, 76 hotspots have been identified. Culling is the only practical solution for controlling the population, says Sanjayan Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF), Southern Circle, Kollam. The presence of the marauding animals has been reported as far as 30 km away from the forest boundaries in the division, says D.K. Vinod Kumar, CCF in-charge of northern Circle, Kannur, where 74 hotspots are identified. On an average, there could be around 300 animals in a forest division. The elimination would begin from habitats located away from forest areas. The ones living in forest areas would be left untouched. The recent High Court order saw around 20 individuals being killed, say the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mass-culling-of-wild-boar-to-begin-shortly/article35949544.ece

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||One dedicated teacher for each class, says Jagan||Addressing the teachers, students and parents on the campus, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said, “In the existing system, one teacher has been taking 18 classes a day in primary schools, which is the prime reason for the poor academic standards. The system will be changed by appointing one teacher for each class up to Class XII.” Govt. school strength rises The schools would be grouped into six categories from Class I to XII, and made accessible for the students of third to 12th standards within a distance of three km. The Anganwadi centres would soon be designated as Pre-Primary schools. The current student strength was 43.43 lakh in the government schools as against 37.20 lakh in the 2018-19 academic year, he said. “A sum of Rs. 32,714 crore has been spent on the education sector for renovation of schools, scholarships, Amma Vodi and other programmes in the past two years. It is intended to bring about a change in the field of education and make quality education accessible to the poor,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Earlier, the Chief Minister, accompanied by Collector Ch. Hari Kiran, inspected the school and interacted with the differently-abled children. He enquired about the results of the speech therapy in the school. He also asked the other students about the facilities, kitchen, teaching methods and equipment procured for the school. Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh, B.C. Welfare Minister Ch. Venu Gopala Krishna, Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu, Social Welfare Minister P. Viswaroop and other officials were present on the occasion.     The Chief Minister announced that the academic year 2021-22 has begun with effect from August 16 in the State. The schools have been reopened as per the World Health Organisation and the Indian Council of Medical Research advisories. He said only 20 students would be allowed in each classroom and in case of excess strength classes would run on alternate days. “The Secretariats will monitor the schools and keep a vigil on the health of students.

All the Departments of Secretariat shall take necessary action accordingly,” he said. Uploading of G.O.s in the public domain was started during the tenure of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in combined Andhra Pradesh and has been continuing since 2008. Of late, the government has been facing criticism from the opposition parties and in social media for uploading blank G.O.s on the government portal. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) even submitted a memorandum to the Governor, Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, in this regard.

TDP flays move Reacting to the development, TDP polit bureau member Varla Ramaiah said that a lack of transparency in the government policies could lead to manipulations, corruption, illegal activities and pose a threat to democratic governance in the long run. The TDP had submitted a memorandum to the Governor in this regard. The party condemned the government’s decision, he said.

17 August 2021||HUZURABAD (Karimnagar District),TELANGANA||Chief Minister hits out at critics||He proved his political prowess, yet again. TRS supremo and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao answered his critics on some issues without naming a single of them at the massive public meeting held on the eve of launching his government’s ambitious Dalit Bandhu scheme. Soon after the scheme concept was announced, his political rivals started saying that he is trying to win dalit votes, throwing money as bait in the guise of the scheme. Interestingly, Mr. Rao did not utter a single word about the ensuing Huzurabad Assembly seat by-election. The seat fell vacant after one of his trusted aides Eatala Rajender resigned as MLA after Mr. Rao dropped him from his Council of Ministers. Mr. Rajender eventually joined the BJP. Both the BJP and the Congress made blistering attacks that he is trying to buy dalits by offering Rs. 10 lakh financial assistance in the name of the empowering dalits through the scheme. All that he said was “elections come and go” but government and development schemes are important. Referring to scheme’s critics, he said in past 75 years of Independence, there were several prime ministers and chief ministers but none of them conceived an idea like Dalit Bandhu. “The critics are raising a hue and cry saying how many dalits would get...We will cover every dalit, including dalit government employees,” he said. He added that none of the critics are able to bring any additional money but spend their strength only on targetting his government. A couple of days ago, protest demonstrations were held in Veenavanaka mandal of the constituency over selection of beneficiaries for the scheme. “I heard about this. Those inciting people will not give money,” he remarked. Instead of referring to the ensuing Huzurabad by-poll even remotely, he said the onus of making Dalit Bandhu successful lay with Huzurabad people. “If you execute it victoriously here, it would be successful all over the State and thus become role model for entire country,” he said. Stating that Dalit Bandhu is not a government scheme but a revolution, he ridiculed apprehensions over if all dalits can be covered under it. “If the government has will, can there be short of money?,” he said. The public meeting too was organised on a massive scale and a festive-like atmosphere was prevalent. In addition to usual flooding of the route to the venue with pink ribbons and flags, crowds dancing to drum beats came in processions. While the venue with nearly 75,000 chairs was completely packed, thousands continued to pour in buses (apparently arranged by organisers) and got stuck in traffic congestion for kilometres together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/chief-minister-hits-out-at-critics/article35950094.ece
17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC sets in motion property acquisition for nala widening||Property acquisition proposals costing over Rs. 80 crore have been prepared by the Nala Development wing of the GHMC, towards development and diversion of certain storm water drains in the city with an aim to prevent flooding in future. These proposals are not the exhaustive list and pertain to only 17 works from nine circles of the GHMC. A total of 260 properties with a combined extent of 23,127 square yards have been listed for acquisition through the legal route, for the Strategic Nala Development Programme. October deluge SNDP was announced by Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K. T. Rama Rao soon after the devastating floods in the city during October last year. Orders were issued establishing a separate wing under GHMC for execution of the programme. The works proposed by the wing include widening of the Balkapur Nala at two locations in First Lancer, Ahmed Nagar, in the Khairatabad Circle, which would require acquisition of 67 properties with an extent of over 2,200 square yards. Major portion of the acquisition, extending up to 164 properties covering an area of over 8,600 square yards, will be from Charminar circle. Other works include widening of nala between Madinaguda Lake and Gangaram Lake in Madinaguda, from Patel Cheruvu to Gangaram Lake at Deepthisri Nagar, remodelling of storm water drain between Fox Sagar Lake to Vennelagadda Cheruvu and from Petbasheerabad to Vennelagadda Cheruvu, widening of nala between Nacharam Pedda Cheruvu and Nalla Cheruvu, Uppal, widening of Jhirra Nala between Sarwar Nagar and Ganga Bowli, from Sunny Garden to Shivaji Nagar, from Safari Park of the Nehru Zoological Park to Kishanbagh road, among various others. Efforts are being made by the local GHMC officials to acquire properties through negotiations wherever possible under GHMC Act, and only in cases where the property owners are reluctant, the civic body is pushing forth for forcible acquisition through the Land Acquisition Act officials informed. Transferable Development Rights (TDRs) are being promoted in lieu of monetary compensation wherever the officials find scope for negotiating for amicable acquisition. Settlers getting paid Settlers on the government lands too are being paid compensation at prevailing market rates, if they have stayed there longer than 10 years, the official said. However, the 100 % solatium and 12 % interest as per the Act, will not be applicable to them. If the encroachments are shorter than 10 years in duration, they will be summarily removed, officials informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/property-acquisition-set-in-motion-for-nala-widening/article35950084.ece
17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR trying to deceive dalits again: Revanth||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has made his last attempt to deceive dalit and tribal communities before the next elections by announcing that the Dalit Bandhu scheme would be extended to every dalit family, alleged Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy. “On the one hand, he (Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao) did not implement the SC, ST Sub-Plan, did not give 3 acres of land each to all landless dalit families, did not give double-bedroom houses, besides not extending other welfare scheme -- and on the other hand, he is promising transformation of lives with Dalit Bandhu scheme,” Mr. Reddy said speaking to reporters here on Monday. Stating that the Chief Minister lied at the Dalit Bandhu launch meeting at Huzurabad, he sought to know why the promises made by him in the past were not being implemented. Alleging that the TRS government had denied even basic education to downtrodden, tribal and adivasi communities, he pointed out that 4,634 single-teacher schools in dalit and tribal habitations were shut. Even the fee-reimbursement scheme is not being implemented properly and the suicide of a dalit engineering student unable to clear fee has failed to open the eyes of the government. On the employment front, the TPCC chief said the C.R. Biswal committee (Pay Revision Commission) had put the number of vacancies at 1.91 lakh against 1.07 lakh at the time of State formation, in spite of the Chief Minister announcement on the floor of the Assembly during the first budget session in 2014 that the government would fill 1.5 lakh vacancies within a year itself. Had the government taken up recruitment, at least reserved posts would have gone to dalit and tribal candidates bettering their lives, he said. Alleging that the TRS government had taken back assigned lands from dalits distributed by the Congress government in the name of development, projects, highways and industries, Mr. Reddy said over 2 lakh acres land was taken back from dalits, including 16,000 acres in NIMZ in Sangareddy district, out of 18 lakh acres distributed across the State. On ‘podu’ (forest) lands, he said pattas were given for 2.5 lakh acres by the Congress governments but the TRS government did nothing. Further, the TPCC chief alleged that the TRS government had taken up Kaleshwaram, Mission Kakaitya and Mission Bhagiratha projects only for commissions by diverting the funds of SC, ST Sub-Plans to clear the bills of contractors, although several habitations in the remote areas still wait for drinking water connections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-trying-to-deceive-dalits-again-revanth/article35950091.ece
17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Occupancy ratio of RTC improves despite the losses||While the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation informed the media on Saturday of the heavy losses it incurred, there appears to be a glimmer of hope as the transport juggernaut’s performance parameters, till the end of July, have improved over the past few months. The TSRTC had stated that it posted a loss of Rs. 2,600 crore on account of the COVID–19 pandemic, and other liabilities such as interest payments, and an increase in provident fund payment. According to official data, the occupancy ratio (OR) had plummeted to 48% in May, a time when partial lockdown was in force, and was lowest since September last year. The OR improved at the end of July rising to 64%, indicating that growth in number of passengers, close to pre-lockdown figures. Similarly, the daily average kilometres operated too improved. The month of May was a low point on this parameter as only 8 lakh km per day were operated, the lowest since the lockdown was announced last year. However, at the end of July, the number rose significantly, to 22 lakh km per day. Data shows that the TSRTC had operated 28 lakh km per day in April, and 34 lakh km per day, the highest since the lockdown came into effect. The average traffic revenue per day too increased from approximately Rs. 2 crore in May to Rs. 7.55 crore at the end of July. In terms of newer routes, several were introduced since FY 2019-2020 in both Hyderabad and Secunderabad regions. According to data obtained by means of the Right to Information Act by transport researcher GSR Chaitanya, the TSRTC started as many as 16 new routes in Hyderabad Region and 10 in Secunderabad Region. These include 65m/123 from Afzalgunj via Mehdipatnam to Narsingi, 9M/9X from Chandrayangutta to Gandimaisamma via Sanathnagar, 19WH from Hitec Metro Station to Waverock via Mindspace, WIPRO and 277D/107 from Ibrahimpatnam to Secunderabad via Dilsukhnagar, 25S/290U from Suchitra to Hayatnagar via Secunderabad, 10JJ from Jagadgirigutta to JNTU via KPHB Colony. The good news is that, according to data, none of these new routes were suspended on account of the pandemic. Data also indicated that the funds allocated to the TSRTC are in line with the corporation’s requests. For example, in 2019-20, the transport juggernaut had requested Rs. 500 crore, and was allocated the same amount. The expenditure was Rs. 450 crore. The next year, a request for Rs. 600 crore was made out of which the same amount was spent. In the current year, Rs. 850 crore was requested, and the same was allocated. The expenditure thus far is Rs. 425 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/despite-losses-occupancy-ratio-of-tsrtc-rises/article35950074.ece
17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Tasty recipes to make millets palatable||There is a reason for people eagerly buying junk food for any meal of the day rather than opting for healthy food. Taste is one of the factors which dominates our food choice. Around 22% of 15,139 people in seven urban localities of India have cited taste as a reason for not consuming more millets. This is a finding from a study titled ‘Assessing Millets and Sorghum Consumption Behaviour in Urban India: A Large-Scale Survey’ published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems on Friday.Another barrier is the method of turning a healthy food tasty. The websitehttps://www.smartfood.o rg/recipes/lists out recipes using millets. Recipes according to millet such as finger millet, pearl millets, or type of meal: breakfast, main meal, soups, salads, is listed in the website. Little millets papdi, crispy multi-millet fingers, millets vermicelli falooda, are some of the options detailed there. The study’s first author and Assistant Director General (External Relations) and Executive Director of the Smart Food initiative at ICRISAT Joanna Kane-Potaka said that health awareness alone would not be enough to influence the population to consume millets. “The report emphasised these insights to show the need for tasty products and simple recipes made from millets as well as the need for changing the image of millets,” said Ms Kane-Potaka. A group of researchers who conducted a large study — led by the Smart Food initiative at ICRISAT-showed that people with diabetes who consumed millets as part of their daily diet saw their blood glucose levels drop 12-15% (fasting and post-meal), and blood glucose levels went from diabetic to pre-diabetes levels. The HbA1c (blood glucose bound to haemoglobin) levels lowered on average 17% for pre-diabetic individuals, and the levels went from pre-diabetic to normal status.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tasty-recipes-to-make-millets-palatable/article35950060.ece

Hanumantha Rao and registering a case under the PD Act against him, if need be, for attacking party corporator Shravan during the Independence Day celebrations on Sunday. Top leaders N. Manohar Reddy, N. Ramchander Rao and others met Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy and complained to him about the physical assault on the corporator and also lady activists by the MLA and his followers. “It is matter of great shame that when the country was celebrating the Independence Day, the TRS MLA chose to resort to rowdy behaviour and even abused our party president in most deplorable terms for no reason,” said Mr. Rao. The former MLC accused the police of playing a partisan role in this episode in taking timely action and not resorting to arrests so far. “It is not for the first time we have witnessed this kind of attitude as the police have been foisting false cases against the Opposition in the last few years as it has become a pawn to the ruling TRS party,” he charged. Mr. Reddy informed that the party had given the route map and programme sheet of the party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s proposed ‘Maha Sangrama Yatra’ scheduled to be taken up from August 24 to the DGP seeking permission. The first phase of the walkathon will be for 40 days till October 2 starting from the Bhagyalakshmi Temple at Charminar in the presence of top Central leaders and cover 300 km up to Medak via Sangareddy, Chevella and Vikarabad. “The programme is to wake up the people and make them ready for the electoral battle of 2023 against the current TRS government’s family, corrupt and dictatorial rule,” he said. Earlier, Mr. Sanjay Kumar criticised Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for disallowing journalists from covering the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ launch programme in Huzurabad and claimed it reflected the commitment towards the Dalits’ cause. “Mr. Rao and his government may have succeeded in putting putting shackles on the media but people are getting ready to get rid of this tyrannical regime,” he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-demands-arrest-of-trs-malkajgiri-mla/article35950080.ece
17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Afghan students seek extension of visas||The chilling images of distressed Afghans clinging on to flights to leave their country have shocked people. Students from the troubled country who are pursuing various courses at universities in Telangana say that they are safe here. The thought of going back at this point of time is not entertained by either the students or their families. However, some of them are worried that they might have to return to an uncertain future in their country in a few weeks. Some of the Afghan students have reached the fag end of their academic courses and their visas are set to expire by end of August or this year. Md Yousaf, president of Afghan Students Association, requested the Indian government to extend their visas and scholarships until the situation in their country stabilises. Around 200 Afghan students, including 10-12 women are pursuing courses in Osmania University, English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), and three more universities in Telangana. They receive scholarship amount of Rs. 24,500 per month from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). “The students have completed their examinations and documentation is pending. Some of their visas will expire in August and some more by December. We request the Indian government to extend their visas and scholarship,” requested Mr. Yousaf. Don’t come back - the Afghan students were told by their family members. The students are spending most part of the days watching international and their local news channels, scroll through Twitter, to know what Taliban has to say, besides following other developments. A 23-year-old student, Samiullah’s phone buzzes with one such update on Monday afternoon. His eyes popped wide open after watching a video of two people dropping to ground mid-air from a flight. “Did you watch this?” he asked in disbelief. Mr Samiullah’s family stay a little far away from the country’s capital Kabul. There is silence in their family’s neighbourhood. But the silence is chilling, said the young student pursuing second-year of psychology course from Osmania University. The top concern in minds of the students is safety of their family members and all citizens of their country. They are also pressing for securing women’s rights and human rights. The students said that though Taliban has asked people to get back to their jobs, business, and other works, the coming days will tell what the future holds. The Taliban’s rule in 1990’s bears heavily in their minds. “Human rights, women’s rights, have to be ensured regardless of who holds the power. We don’t want to see what happened in Afghanistan twenty years ago,” said another Afghan student who wished not to be quoted by name. The students are filled with opinions on how Taliban has grabbed power, how some political leaders from their country played a role in it, and countries which failed to respond. Now, they eagerly wait for peace to be restored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/afghan-students-seek-extension-of-visas/article35950092.ece

Fixation and finalisation of cadre strength of each local cadre and final allocation of employees into local cadres, according to officials, was supposed to have been taken up three years ago immediately after the receipt of the new Presidential Order in August 2018. The order which came into force on August 30, 2018, mandates the government to organise classes of posts in the civil services and classes of civil posts under the State into various local cadres for different parts of the State within 36 months from the date of notification of the order. Coupled with the delay is the creation of two more districts – Mulugu and Narayanpet – taking the total number of districts to 33. Employees voiced their concerns relating to seniority ranks in the process of finalising cadre strength, but officials said the fears are unfounded as the process of Organisation of Local Cadres is being done as per the Mandate of Presidential Order which safeguards the seniority of the staff. Problems, however, persist because of the posting of the employees on order to serve basis subject to final allocation during the reorganisation of districts. But final allocation is yet to be completed as the employees are not given any options on the proposed cadre strength or allocation so far. Moreover, there is no clarity on the number of posts in different categories earmarked for each district as the existing employees are made to work on the order for serve basis. The development comes in the light of the government’s announcement on filling up of vacant posts in different departments. Sanctioned cadre of strength of Telangana, according to the AP Reorganisation website, is pegged at 4.97 lakh of which 98,016 posts were vacant as on June 2, 2014. The government after detailed exercise in the recent months concluded that there are around 56,000 vacancies in the direct recruitment category posts and efforts had been started to fill them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/organisation-of-staff-into-different-local-cadres-may-take-time/article35950096.ece

17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State revises maximum/minimum insurable age of employees||The State government has enhanced the maximum insurable age for the employees under the Telangana Government Life Insurance Scheme from 53 years to 56 years. The minimum insurable age has simultaneously been decreased to 19 years from the existing 21 years. Under the existing rules, endowment insurance policies are being issued to the staff based on maximum insurable age of 53 years and these policies would mature on the insured attaining 58 years. The revision of the maximum and minimum insurable age follows the enhancement of retirement age from 58 to 61 years as also the implementation of the revised pay scales. All employees within the insurable age should increase their premiums as per the rates specified and submit the proposal form after the recovery of the first premium from the salary for taking a policy from the insurance department. Whenever the premium was recovered (fresh/enhanced), the proponent should submit the proposal form through the drawing and disbursement officer concerned and policies should be obtained. Worth of the total proposal forms submitted should be equivalent to the total premium paid and policy bonds could be downloaded from the department’s websitewww.tsgli.telangana.gov.in. The government said, in the orders issued, that unless proposal form was submitted and policies obtained, employees would not get insurance coverage for the premium paid. “In other words, at any point of time, total premium = worth of total proposal forms submitted = worth of total policies obtained = total insurance coverage,” the government said in its orders. Employees already holding policies of TSGLI and aged below 56 years could enhance the premium for additional policies. However, he/she should submit the application in the prescribed proforma before actually attaining the age of 56. Deduction of premium and submission of proposal form should take place before he/she actually attain the age of 56. Under any circumstances, proposal would not be accepted if the applicant had already attained 56 years on the date of submission of application notwithstanding the fact that the amount was already deducted in the monthly pay bills. Such amounts should be treated as unauthorised amounts and refunded to the individual following the usual procedure. Employees who put in three years of continuous service would be allowed to contribute upto 20% of the basic pay or Rs. 20,000 a month whichever was less subject the medical examination reports. Employees already subscribed but aged above 56 could not increase the premium for additional policies, the order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-revises-maximumminimum-insurable-age-of-employees/article35950097.ece
17 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Retail, e-com driving demand for warehousing||The warehousing sector in Hyderabad has recorded a visible shift in terms of quality as well as demand and supply dynamics on the back of a rapidly expanding industrial base coupled with rising demand from e-commerce and third party logistics (3PL) players, real estate consulting firm CBRE South Asia has said. Pegging the total warehousing stock of the city at about 21 million sq ft upto June, it estimated that an additional about 5 million sqft supply is currently under various stages of construction and expected to be completed over the next three years. In its report ‘Telangana – A bright spot in India’s industrial and warehousing, launched at CREDAI Hyderabad Property Show 2021, CBRE said warehouse space take-up in Hyderabad was about 11 million sq ft from 2018 to H1 2021. The leasing was predominantly concentrated in semi-investment-grade properties in the city. However, Western (Bachupally, Kukatpally, Manikonda, Pashamylaram IDA and Patancheru) and Southern Corridors (Adibatla, Attapur, Kothur and Shamshabad) witnessed a rise of warehouses launched by national developers post 2019. Occupier preferences thus slowly started to shift towards investment-grade warehouses in recent years. During the first half of 2021 the demand for warehousing was led by retail players seeking expansion opportunities in the Northern Corridor (Secunderabad, Sanathnagar, GundlaPochampally, Medchal, Dundigal, Balanagar and Pashamylaram) followed by 3PL and e-commerce companies expanding across micro-markets. Rental values during the six months increased by 5–14% across micro-markets in Hyderabad, primarily due to increasing demand and availability of better-quality warehouses. Behind the growth of the industrial and warehousing (I&W) sector is the fillip provided by the infrastructural intervention, policies of State government, including the TS-iPASS system of time bound approvals and self certification for new industrial projects, the report said. Factors expected to boost investments in the sector, including dedicated sectoral policies, emphasis on supply chain diversification, e-commerce-led demand and improving occupier, the report said. “Telangana’s policy initiatives along with a strong infrastructure impetus continues to augur well for the country’s overall development,” said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman, India and South-East Asia, Middle East and Africa of CBRE.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/retail-e-com-driving-demand-for-warehousing/article35950069.ece

17 August 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||IITH establishes astronomical observatory on campus||As a first step towards starting astronomical activities as well as a student’s training program, a large telescope facility has been established in the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IITH) campus. The telescope is equipped with a huge mirror with an optical diameter of 355 mm (second largest among IITs after IIT Kanpur) with a focal length of 1650 mm. Such a large mirror along with a Crayford focuser and elegant truss tube design will enable observation of the deep sky and faint objects which cannot possibly be detected with a small telescope. Small craters on the lunar surface, rings of Saturn are some of the small features that can be resolved with the telescope. An advanced digital camera will be used to record images and transient astronomical phenomena like meteor showers. Although the telescope would primarily aim for the outreach and night sky observational training programs, it has the capabilities of delivering research level performance which will be explored subsequently. With this Telescope, IITH will be a part of the Indian astronomical community hosting a large telescope for an effective outreach with high-quality deliverance. The project is funded by Director of the IIT Hyderabad B S Murty, and managed by Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics Mayukh Pahari. The facility was inaugurated by Padmabhushan award winner B. N. Suresh, Chancellor and Founding Director of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. “The enthusiasm and the curiosity of young students about objects in the sky are limitless. With this large telescope, we will provide them an opportunity to study celestial objects in greater detail than other small telescopes conventionally used for outreach programs. Activities like stargazing training programs, observing astronomical transients, working with celestial images will enhance their knowledge and add to their sense of human connection with space. We would also ensure that students from schools and various colleges in and around Hyderabad also get the advantage of this large telescope through various programs organized by the Astronomy Club of IITH,” said Mr Murthy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/iith-establishes-astronomical-observatory-on-campus/article35950087.ece

17 August 2021||Mumbai,||BJP Ministers begin Jan Ashirwad Yatra||Newly inducted Union Ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday kick-started Jan Ashirwad Yatra with Union Minister of State for Health Dr. Bharati Pawar slamming the State government for complaining over lack of supply of COVID-19 vaccines. “Maharashtra received the highest number of COVID-19 vaccines from the Central government.

Balaram Chander Patil and Nanda Thakur (42), both residents of Ovale village in Panvel, were known to each other. Patil used to visit the house of Ms. Thakur who had an eye on the jewellery he wore. On Saturday, when Patil visited her, Ms. Thakur called her accomplice, Mangesh Khetri (32), who worked as a driver. The duo then tied up Patil on a chair and put chilli powder into his nostrils before strangling him to death. The duo removed the gold jewellery from him and fled. Patil’s son approached the Panvel City police, and the body was found in Ms. Thakur’s house. The police on Sunday morning received information that Ms. Thakur was at a bus stop in Kalamboli, and she was nabbed.

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||How Taliban took Kabul without a fight||The U.S. seemed to have concluded long ago that they lost the war in Afghanistan. What they did not expect was the speed with which Kabul fell. The latest U.S. intelligence estimates said the Taliban could capture Kabul in 90 days, The Washington Post reported on August 10. But the city fell in a single day, without even a fight, on August 15. How did that happen? Trump-Taliban deal Though the Taliban overran most of the country within days, the road to their final victory started from the agreement they signed with the U.S. in February 2020. The Trump administration appointed a special envoy for Afghanistan, held direct talks with the Taliban bypassing the Afghan government and signed an exit agreement. In the agreement, the U.S. could not extract any concession from the Taliban towards a political settlement in Afghanistan. The Taliban did not even agree to a ceasefire. And the American focus was on getting their troops and diplomats out of Afghanistan safely. In the deal, the U.S. agreed to withdraw its troops by May 1, 2021 in return for assurances from the Taliban that they would not let terrorist groups operate from Afghan soil. This provided the Taliban a sense of victory, while demoralising the Afghan troops. Pro-Taliban channels immediately celebrated the Doha deal as their victory over America. They said if they could defeat the U.S., the world’s pre-eminent superpower, the Afghan forces would not be much of a challenge. During the war, the Taliban’s main challenge was the U.S. air power, which had caused devastating blows to the insurgency. Since the Doha agreement, the U.S. airstrikes went down drastically, in return for the Taliban stopping attacks on American forces completely. This allowed the Taliban to regroup across the country, plan for the next offensive and refurbish the supply lines. Legitimised by the U.S. deal, the Taliban also reached out to regional players such as China, Russia and Iran to neutralise their role in the coming big fight. And then they were waiting for the Americans to start going. The Ghani factor The Ghani administration was internally divided. The last two presidential elections — 2014 and 2019 — were disputed. After both elections, the U.S. had to interfere, striking a deal between Mr. Ghani and his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, to stitch together the unity government. Mr. Ghani, according to both his friends and rivals, was mercurial, impulsive and isolated. He projected himself as the rightful Pashtun leader of Afghanistan, alienating other ethnic leaders, who made up the erstwhile Northern Alliance that resisted the Taliban in the 1990s. Mr. Abdullah, half Pashtun and half Tajik, was a rival who was accommodated in the government. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the Uzbek warlord and Mr. Ghani’s former Vice-President who’s facing serious allegations, was living abroad. Atta Muhammad Nur, the Tajik “strongman” in the north, had publicly challenged the government. He was sacked as the Governor of Balkh province by Mr. Ghani in January 2018. Mr. Ghani, a former World Bank economist who has specialised on failed states, could not build an administration that commands over at least all the anti-Taliban forces. He tried to weaken the former warlords in the name of strengthening the national forces, as well as shore up his political base, but in the course, he weakened the anti-Taliban coalition further. So, well before the American withdrawal started on May 1, the Ghani administration looked like a loose confederation of different fiefdoms. What glued them all together was the American troops. And once it was clear that the Americans were leaving, the cracks in the administration started widening. All the Taliban had to do was to push it from outside. American withdrawal The Taliban launched their offensive on May 1, the day the remaining U.S. troops started withdrawing. The Afghan government had the provincial centres under its control and set up outposts across the rural areas, which were provided supplies by air. Mr. Biden withdrew not just American air support but also the intelligence agents and contractors who were serving Afghanistan’s war planes and helicopters. This has, besides the psychological and political impacts of the withdrawal, debilitated the Afghan air force, the only superiority the Afghan troops had in the war. Knowing this, the Taliban had also launched an assassination campaign, targeting Afghan pilots. According to a Reuters special report dated July 9, seven Afghan pilots were assassinated in recent months. As an overstretched and resource-limited air force came under pressure, the supply lines dried up. The Taliban could easily overrun remote government outposts and sweep through the country’s north, which was, in the 1990s, the epicentre of the anti-Taliban resistance. The Taliban strategy was to take the rural districts first and then lay siege to the cities, allowing them to fall. With cities under their control, they encircled Kabul. No fight The turning point came on August 6, when the first city, Zaranj, fell to the Taliban. The Taliban allowed the government troops to walk away if they surrendered with their equipment. In some cases, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal , surrendered soldiers, unpaid for months, were even given pocket money by the Taliban. Those who resisted were killed. So Afghan troops, lacking reinforcements, faced two choices — either surrender and save their lives or fight to death for a government that cannot get its act together and was abandoned by even the U.S. In most cases, they chose the first. So did several government officials. In Ghazni, the provincial Governor handed the keys to his office to a Taliban commander along with flowers. The Governor was escorted out of his office by the Taliban. In several cities, they overran prisons and recruited prisoners to their ranks. As soldiers surrendered without a fight, cities after cities fell to the Taliban. Within eight days after Zaranj fell, more than half of the provincial capitals were under their control. Kabul became an island in the Taliban sea. On August 14, even when the city was surrounded, Mr. Ghani tried to show a brave face, saying his focus was on remobilising Afghan troops. But it was practically impossible. The soldiers across the country knew that the war had been lost. And they were unlikely to fight for Kabul alone. Five of the seven Army corps of the Afghan National Army were already taken over by the Taliban. By the evening, Mazar-e-Sharif in the north, one of the most anti-Taliban cities, fell. Mr. Ghani knew the time was up. On Sunday morning, he left the Presidential palace for the U.S. Embassy where he spent a few hours. In the afternoon, with a group of close aides, he flew out of the capital. By nightfall, the Taliban were in Arg-e-Shahi (Citadel of the King), the Presidential palace built by the 19th century Emir Abdur Rahman Khan. Almost 20 years after the U.S. started its war on terror driving the Taliban out of power, life is back to square one for millions of Afghans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/how-taliban-took-kabul-without-a-fight/article35949489.ece
17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||China says it hopes Taliban will ‘ensure smooth transition’||China’s government said on Monday it hoped the Taliban would “fulfil its commitment to ensure a smooth transition” and “curb all kinds of terrorism” in Afghanistan following its rapid takeover of the country. “The situation in Afghanistan has undergone major changes and China respects the wishes and choices of the Afghan people,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in Beijing. “The war has lasted over 40 years. To stop the war and realise peace is the voice of the over 30 million Afghan people and aspiration of the international community and regional countries. We noted the statement from the Afghan Taliban yesterday [Sunday] saying the war is over and that they will start consultations for establishing an open, inclusive Islamic government, and will take necessary action to ensure the safety of Afghan citizens and the foreign diplomatic corps. We expect the Taliban to fulfill its commitment to ensure a smooth transition of the situation in Afghanistan, curb all kinds of terrorism and criminal acts, keep the Afghan people away from wars and rebuild their beautiful homeland.” The call to stop terrorism echoed the message from Chinese officials late last month when they hosted a Taliban delegation in the city of Tianjin, marking a new chapter in Beijing’s outreach to the group. With the unexpected speed of the Taliban takeover in the weeks since, Beijing is now hoping that early engagement will help secure its interests in the country, particularly with regard to its concerns over Jihadist groups with links to its western Xinjiang region that shares a border with Afghanistan. Asked if China will recognise the new Taliban regime, Ms. Hua said China “stands ready to develop good-neighbourly, friendly and cooperative relations with Afghanistan, and to play a constructive role in the peace and reconstruction of Afghanistan.” Taliban’s expectations “On many occasions, the Taliban has expressed the hope of developing sound relations with China, saying they look forward to China’s participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, and that they will never allow any forces to use the Afghan territory to endanger China,” she said. “We hope the Taliban will unite with all parties and ethnic groups in Afghanistan to establish a broad and inclusive political structure that suits its own national conditions to lay the foundation for realising a lasting peace in Afghanistan. China respects the right of the Afghan people to independently determine their own destiny.” While several countries have been evacuating their personnel and closing their missions in the country, Ms. Hua said China’s Embassy in Kabul was “still operating normally” and “most of the Chinese citizens in Afghanistan have already returned to China.” Beyond Monday’s statement and the recent outreach to the Taliban, Beijing has long had its own concerns over both the speed of the earlier announced U.S. withdrawal as well as the Taliban’s past links to terror groups, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) that has carried out attacks in Xinjiang. Putting aside those concerns, the immediate mood in the Chinese state-controlled press was largely one of schadenfreude, highlighting the failures of the U.S. rather than the security concerns that still loom for both China and the region. China’s state media exulted in the U.S. withdrawal, with official outlets slamming Washington for its “messy failure”, “humiliation”, and “impotence”. “United States troops entered Afghanistan two decades back in the name of a ‘war on terror’. The U.S. then attempted to build a modern Afghan state. While the former hardly qualifies as the victory President Joe Biden claimed, its attempts at the latter are an unmistakable, unfolding, messy failure,” the official China Daily said in an editorial. Chinese media exults The Communist Party-run Global Times , a tabloid published by the official People’s Daily known for its often nationalistic slant, noted that many online were comparing the U.S. exit from Kabul to the fall of Saigon and this was “a clearer demonstration of U.S. impotence than the Vietnam War” showing the U.S. was “a paper tiger.” In an editorial, the paper said the speed of the Taliban takeover was “undoubtedly a heavy blow to the U.S’ and “declared the complete failure of U.S. intent to reshape Afghanistan.” “In the meantime, the U.S.’s desperate withdrawal plan shows the unreliability of U.S. commitments to its allies: When its interests require it to abandon allies, Washington will not hesitate to find every excuse to do so,” the paper said. “The People’s Liberation Army is heavily deployed around the Wakhan Corridor, a key zone for China’s counter-terrorism mission that links China and Afghanistan,” the paper said. One consistent message from Chinese experts, underlined by the paper on Monday, was to state that China “has no will to fill the vacuum the U.S. has left behind in Afghanistan”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-says-it-hopes-taliban-will-ensure-smooth-transition/article35949484.ece
17 August 2021||Kabul,||7 dead in airport chaos as Afghans flee militants||Thousands of Afghans rushed into Kabul’s main airport on Monday, some so desperate to escape the Taliban that they held onto a military jet as it took off and plunged to their deaths. At least seven people died in the chaos, U.S. officials said. As the U.S. military and others continued evacuation flights, Afghans swarmed over the international airport’s tarmac. Some climbed into aircraft parked on the taxiway, while others dangled precariously off a jet bridge. U.S. troops took positions to guard the active runway, but the crowd stormed past them. Gunshots rang out. As one U.S. Air Force Boeing C-17 Globemaster III tried to take off, a helicopter did low runs in front of it to try to drive people off the runway. Videos showed a group of Afghans hanging onto the plane just before takeoff and several falling through the air as the airplane rapidly gained altitude over the city. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said U.S. forces killed two people he described as carrying weapons. All flights at the airport — both military and civilian — were halted until Afghan civilians can be cleared from the runway, Mr. Kirby added. Late Monday night, hundreds of people remained trapped between American forces trying to push them out of the airport and Taliban forces trying to keep them in, witnesses said. An Associated Press journalist also saw what appeared to be an airstrike target two vehicles near the airport. Shafi Arifi, who had a ticket to travel to Uzbekistan on Sunday, was unable to board his plane because it was packed with people who had raced across the tarmac and climbed aboard, with no police or airport staff in sight. “There was no room for us to stand,” said the 24-year-old. “Children were crying, women were shouting, young and old men were so angry and upset, no one could hear each other. There was no oxygen to breathe.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/7-dead-in-airport-chaos-as-afghans-flee-militants/article35949487.ece
17 August 2021||COLOMBO,||Amid virus surge, Lankan Health Minister replaced||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Monday replaced the country’s Health Minister in the wake of growing opposition and public criticism over the government’s “mismanagement” of the country’s fourth wave of COVID-19. Over the past week, health authorities reported over 3,000 cases a day and record daily deaths – 161 on August 14 – that they attribute to the rapidly spreading Delta variant. Despite medical professionals’ repeated calls for a country-wide lockdown to help the health sector cope, the government has minimally restricted mobility, mostly during the night. President Rajapaksa has asked health sector officials to expedite the ongoing vaccination drive. Sri Lanka’s Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, who earlier made headlines for endorsing a “potion” that she claimed would “cure” COVID-19, has now been given charge of the Transport Ministry, while Media Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella will be the new Health Minister, according to a statement issued by the Presidential Media Division. Education Minister G.L. Peiris and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena will swap roles. Mr. Peiris returns to the Foreign Ministry after six years. He held the post during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second term in office from 2010 to 2015, when Sri Lanka was under heightened international scrutiny over alleged war crimes. His appointment comes at a time when Sri Lanka faces pressure at the UN Human Rights Council over its rights record and promises on post-war reconciliation, also cited by the European Parliament in June, while recommending a temporary withdrawal of the GSP+ status given to Sri Lanka. In Monday’s reshuffle, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s nephew Namal Rajapaksa has been awarded a new cabinet portfolio – Development Planning and Monitoring.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-virus-surge-lankan-health-minister-replaced/article35949485.ece

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The message from the IPCC report||The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Working Group I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), titled ‘Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis’, is the first of four that the Panel will issue over the next one and a half years. The reports are eagerly awaited as they provide a summary assessment of all aspects of the challenge of global warming and past reports have heralded significant shifts in climate policy. This particular report has added significance as it is the only one of the four of AR6 to be ready before the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Glasgow in November. Findings of the report A significant section of the report reinforces what is already well known, though, importantly, with updated numbers, higher accuracy and specific regional assessments, including South Asia. Global surface temperature is now higher by 1.07oC since the pre-industrial era. The impact of climate change on the atmosphere, oceans and land is unmistakably of human origin and this impact is picking up pace. It is a striking fact that there is no part of the inhabited world that is now untouched by the impact of global warming. Carbon dioxide is the dominant source of warming. Aerosols contribute to reducing the impact of warming by other greenhouse gases, by almost a third. Methane reduction, while needed overall, is particularly significant only as part of the endgame as the drastic reduction of aerosols actually leads to an increase in warming. A major scientific advance in this report is the use of multiple lines of evidence (through precise technical methods) to pin down the values and trends of key climatic variables more accurately, and narrow their range of uncertainties. Climate predictions from models appear to be working better in many specific ways due to improved representation of basic processes and higher resolution, while the use of other evidence enables scientists to ensure that the modelling output is suitably filtered to match more closely the real world. Thus, the value of equilibrium climate sensitivity — the measure of how a specified increase in carbon dioxide concentration translates into long-term surface temperature rise — is now pinned down to the range of 2.5oC to 4.0oC, with a best estimate of 3oC, compared to the Fifth Assessment Report range of 1.5oC to 4.5oC. With the inclusion of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s Earth System Model among the climate models used in AR6, India too has joined the climate modelling fraternity. The report expectedly projects an increase in climate extremes due to global warming, with heat waves, extreme rainfall events and occurrence of extreme sea levels all expected to intensify and be more frequent. Coincidentally, the IPCC session for the approval and release of the report was held in the background of news of unprecedented disasters from the global North, including massive forest fires, unprecedented rain and flooding, and record heat. Restrict cumulative emissions A major finding of the report is that air pollution reduction and steep climate change mitigation are not complementary goals but require independent efforts over the short and medium term. This is particularly important as the claims of such a linkage have been used to argue that India, for instance, must cease the use of coal immediately, despite its continuing importance as the key element of the country’s energy security. The truly disconcerting news though, for the global North, is the report’s clear message that reaching net zero was not the determining factor for the world to limit itself to a 1.5oC , or 2oC, or indeed any specific temperature increase. The report is clear that it is the cumulative emissions in reaching net zero that determine the temperature rise. This obvious conclusion from past reports and scientific literature had become something of a casualty in the massive campaign mounted on net zero by the developed countries with the partisan support of the United Nations Secretary General and UN agencies. India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change was quick to note this point about net zero in a statement, adding that “historical cumulative emissions are the cause of the climate crisis that the world faces today.” It also noted that the “developed countries had usurped far more than their fair share of the global carbon budget.” The limitations of the remaining carbon budget for 1.5oC are so stringent — a mere 500 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide for an even chance of keeping to the limit — that they cannot be met by promises of net zero 30 years from now. The report is indeed a “clarion call for developed countries to undertake immediate, deep emission cuts,” as the Union Environment Minister, Bhupender Yadav, tweeted, especially if they are not to deprive the rest of the world, barring China, of any hope of future development. Developed countries must, in fact, reach net zero well before 2050. That Alok Sarma, the COP26 President, is not unaware of all this is seen from the shift in his discourse, appealing to “keep 1.5oC alive”.  Little cheer for Global South However, the exposure of the misleading character of the net zero campaign can bring little cheer to the global South, for an equally disconcerting finding is that the world is set to cross the 1.5oC limit within 10-15 years. If deep emissions cuts by the three big emitters — the U.S., the European Union and China — are not forthcoming, even the prospect of a mild overshoot of the limit followed by a later decline is likely to be foregone. After years of procrastination in real action, the constant shifting of goal posts to avoid immediate emissions reduction, and marking time with their obsession with Article 6 negotiations to pass the burden on to developing countries, the developed countries now have nowhere to hide. Regrettably, India cannot save the world from the consequences of the neglect of those whose responsibility it was to lead in taking credible action. India has contributed less than 5% of global cumulative emissions to date, with per capita annual emissions a third of the global average. India is also the only nation among the G20 with commitments under the Paris Agreement that are even 2oC warming-compatible. India needs its development space urgently to cope with the future, one where global temperature increase may be closer to 2oC. With India’s annual emissions at 3 billion tonnes in carbon dioxide equivalent terms, even the impossible, such as the total cessation of emissions for the next 30 years, with others’ emissions remaining the same, will buy the world less than two years of additional time for meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goals. The prospect of keeping almost a sixth of humanity in quasi-permanent deprivation for the rest of the century as a consequence cannoteven be contemplated. Focusing on definite cumulative emission targets keeping equity and historical responsibility in view, immediate emission reductions by the developed countries with phase-out dates for all fossil fuels, massive investment in new technologies and their deployment, and a serious push to the mobilisation of adequate climate finance is the need of the hour. This is the message that the IPCC report has sent to this year’s climate summit and the world. T. Jayaraman is with the M.S.

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S.-Pak. ties amid changes in Afghanistan||Pakistan’s annoyance with U.S. President Joe Biden is understandable. Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf could not hold back his frustration over Mr. Biden’s apparent unwillingness to talk to Prime Minister Imran Khan. Mr. Yusuf even went to the extent of saying that Islamabad also had “options” if the U.S. believed that a Biden-Khan phone call was a “concession”. Regardless of the consequences that were entirely predictable, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration signed an ill-conceived peace agreement with the Taliban in February 2020. Hypothetically, it was meant to pave the way for power-sharing negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. But it practically ended up legitimising the former and marginalising the latter. Pakistan consistently claimed that it had played the most important role in persuading the Taliban to talk peace. But no progress was made in the talks due to the Taliban’s determination to militarily capture Afghanistan. Not without reason The U.S.’s cold shoulder to Islamabad is, therefore, not without reason as whatever progress Afghanistan achieved over two decades is set to be reversed by the Taliban, Pakistan’s most notorious proxy. With the Taliban’s surprisingly swift entry into Kabul and the ignominious capitulation of Afghan institutions, politicians and militias, all grandiloquent talks of creating a stable, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan have vanished into thin air in the same way as the Afghan Army, which was trained and equipped by the U.S. Though the Taliban has made tall promises to the U.S., China, Iran and Russia that it will not permit terrorists to operate from its territory, an unmistakable sense of jubilation over defeating the U.S. tempts the Islamist insurgents to dishonour such commitments and become more radicalised. Pakistan’s official stand has been to prefer a politically negotiated outcome in Afghanistan, but even Pakistanis don’t believe this farce. The country’s recent attempts to distance itself from the Taliban, as manifested in Mr. Khan’s public statement that Pakistan did not speak for the Taliban, will fall on deaf ears. Notwithstanding Washington’s huge disappointment over Pakistan’s failure to convince the Taliban to discuss the terms of Afghanistan’s governance, the Biden administration probably believes that Pakistan will continue to play a critical role in a Taliban-dominated Afghanistan, requiring Washington to communicate closely with Islamabad. And despite many perceived humiliations and setbacks over the years, Pakistan’s ruling elite still values its relationship with the U.S. In the immediate aftermath of American withdrawal, Pakistan is trying hard to reinvent its value to the U.S. Mr. Biden has not found time to talk to Mr. Khan even after more than six months in the White House. The Pakistani Prime Minister is not amused with the U.S. President, who has more than once interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Though Mr. Yusuf has not disclosed his country’s “other options”, it is not too difficult to understand what he is referring to given the current geopolitical scenario. China is Pakistan’s number one option — Beijing has been one of the strongest pillars of Pakistan’s anti-India policies. Of late, Pakistan has attempted to draw closer to Turkey, supporting the latter’s ambition to assume leadership of the Islamic world. Moreover, Pakistan has taken steps to strengthen its ties with both Russia and Iran. But these relationships do not seem resilient enough for Pakistan to forge a stable regional security order because its effectiveness remains highly questionable. Significant symbolism Mr. Biden has not lost sleep over hurting Mr. Khan’s inflated ego, and this probably makes Pakistan’s security establishment somewhat restless. After all, Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad’s multiple visits to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, coupled with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s many telephonic talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, can’t be a replacement for a Biden-Khan conversation. For Pakistan’s security establishment, the symbolism has been as significant as the substance in its relationship with the U.S. If the prestige of a country’s rulers depends on the goodwill of another power, then the latter has the capacity to force the former to join hands with it. But Pakistan defies this conventional wisdom as its rulers have often disobeyed the wishes of the U.S, without having to suffer the consequences for such refusal. Pakistan’s close ties with the U.S. during the Cold War era have often allowed it to punch above its military and economic weight. Nevertheless, tumultuous changes in the global geopolitical scenario and Pakistan’s continued nonchalance toward the U.S.’s security concerns threaten Islamabad’s attempts to reset ties with Washington. Though Mr. Trump had publicly expressed his frustrations over Pakistan’s double-dealing in Afghanistan, Mr. Biden has preferred to remain largely silent thus far. However, this silence should not be interpreted as the U.S.’s eagerness to forget that its disgraceful defeat in Afghanistan had been facilitated by the Taliban’s sanctuaries in Pakistan, a fact conveniently ignored by Mr. Khan while arguing that the U.S. “messed it up in Afghanistan”. Despite public denial by the Pakistani Prime Minister that his country would not allow American bases in Pakistan for intelligence-led operations inside Afghanistan, there are reports that the U.S. has not given up its efforts to seek bases in Pakistan. But the problem is that in Pakistan’s popular discourse, sustained by media and politicians, the anti-drone narrative questioning the Pakistani establishment’s collusion with the U.S. has become so entrenched that American bases seem highly improbable, if not impossible. That is why Mr. Yusuf has been forced to deny any discussion over bases in talks with his American counterpart. While no progressive Afghan can forgive the U.S. for pulling out its troops unconditionally without waiting for a negotiated political settlement, it seems unlikely that Mr. Biden will announce any kinetic initiative to reverse the Taliban’s military victory. If Washington expects Islamabad to use its influence over the Taliban’s state policies and also provide counterterrorism cooperation in the post-withdrawal landscape, these hopes are patently unrealistic because Pakistan has become accustomed to being verbally condemned against its multidimensional support to the Taliban without suffering any serious damage to its material interests. And if the inexorable circumstances put pressure on the Biden administration to outsource Afghanistan to Pakistan, it will have ramifications over New Delhi’s enthusiasm in firming up the India-U.S.-Australia-Japan Quadrilateral, an outcome the U.S. cannot afford at the moment.

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Decoding the Tamil Nadu Budget||Expectations from the revised Budget for 2021-22 presented by the Tamil Nadu government were high since this is the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government’s first Budget after 10 years of being out of power. The Budget needed to stand out and reflect the ideological commitment of Dravidian politics. But did it succeed? Perhaps, but not in all respects. It could have addressed the pandemic-induced economic crisis more directly, which is important since Tamil Nadu’s economy has seen a decade of stagnation, slipping in its unique trajectory of high growth and relatively equitable development. In the run-up to this Budget, State Finance Minister P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan released a white paper, a comprehensive analysis of the State’s financial status and its economic condition. While the white paper offered a diagnosis of the ailing economy, the revised Budget was to provide prescriptions to revive the economy. As is by now well acknowledged, the pandemic has affected the urban poor, informal workers, and small businesses disproportionately, leading to declining wages and job losses. Tamil Nadu has been particularly badly hit by the pandemic. A study by Azim Premji University suggests that Tamil Nadu was among the worst-hit States in terms of the lockdown-induced economic distress leading to disproportionate job losses. Let’s first look at the positive aspects. The Budget has made allocations for many promises made in the DMK’s election manifesto. This is laudable. The reduction in the effective rate of tax on petrol by Rs. 3 per litre is certainly a relief to many. Similarly, schemes such as nine new SIPCOT parks in industrially backward areas and the establishment of Tidel Parks in Tier-II and Tier-III towns are welcome steps in building industrial infrastructure across the State. So are measures such as strengthening public education. The Budget promises to improve the quality of teaching in government schools as enrolment in government schools fell from 76% of the total student population in 2012 to 53% in 2020. Learning outcomes, it says, will be accorded the highest priority. Following the DMK’s historical legacy of federal assertion, the Budget’s proposal of establishing an advisory council to develop a Federal Fiscal Model, ostensibly to propose a new road map on revenue and taxation, including the Goods and Services Tax, again is welcome. Economic recovery However, the Budget’s prescriptions fall short of what the diagnosis in the white paper requires, particularly with respect to revenue mobilisation. The proposed property taxes mentioned in the white paper are missing in the Budget document. Besides the nitty-gritty of numbers, what is important is to offer a robust path for the economy to recover. As the white paper has shown, the State’s fiscal position is poor, particularly with rising revenue deficits and unsustainable public debt coupled with falling expenditure which has affected productive investment and the development sectors. The share of development expenditure in total disbursal was 62.9% in 2011-12 as against all States average of 63.1%. This came down to 57.5% in 2018-19 which was substantially below the all-States average of 62.9%. The ability of government intervention in any economy lies in its fiscal capacity, the size of government, measured by its ratio of revenue/ tax to the GSDP. The ratio of total revenue receipts to the GSDP has been declining. It was 12.49% in 2006, peaked at 13.35% in 2008-09, and came down to 8.7% in the year of pandemic. The most alarming figure is the falling tax GSDP ratio from 8.48% in 2006-07 to just 5.46% in 2020-21, a decline of 3.02 percentage points. If we look at the disaggregated figures, the only receipt which has not come down during the period analysed in the white paper is tax collection from TASMAC, a public sector network of liquor shops. It was 1.22% in 2006-07 and 1.40% in 2019-20. Such a trend is really disturbing given the fact that it is the poor who disproportionately contribute to such tax revenue. Union aggression While the State’s ability to levy tax has come down, its revenue mobilisation was further hindered by Union government policies. One, the State was hit the most by the declining share in a divisible pool of Union taxes, particularly after switching to the 2011 Census base from the 1971 Census by the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions. Its shares in the divisible pool came down from 6.6% during the 10th Finance Commission to 4.02% during the 15th Finance Commission. To put it differently, the State is paying a penalty for controlling its population growth. Two, with the arrival of GST, not only has the State lost its ability to generate revenue, but is also losing revenue from other sources. For instance, the Union government has imposed a cess on petrol and diesel which are not shared with the State governments. There are some sectors which ought to have received immediate attention. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), a key sector in the State’s inclusive growth trajectory, are in trouble now. Given their degree of informality as well as demand and supply constraints, MSMEs suffered the most during the lockdown while the companies listed in the stock market are doing relatively better. Many of them were charged the same rate of interest even during the pandemic. While the Budget mentions a tripartite agreement between MSMEs and their creditors to reach an agreement on restructuring loans, there is no comprehensive package for them. Similarly, the Tamil Nadu government was appreciated for its proactive measures during the second wave of the pandemic, including its COVID-19 assistance package to ration card holders, but the Budget does not have any specific programmes for the informal workers and urban poor. On August 3, 2021, a parliamentary standing committee recommended the institution of an urban employment scheme at the national level. While a similar scheme had a passing mention in the Budget, Tamil Nadu could have set a model by instituting one. Labour Welfare Boards for informal workers are in a shambles. Revitalising these boards would go a long way protecting informal workers. Finally, fiscal deficits matter only as numbers. What matters most is the strategy of revenue mobilisation efforts and expenditure priorities. The excessive focus on fiscal deficits and public debts in the time of a pandemic is undesirable. Instead, the focus ought to be on shoring up demand and enhancing people’s purchasing power. Experiences from the world over suggest that the path to recovery is well-timed stimulus. Tamil Nadu is no exception.

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The big opportunity||According to various international studies, the median age in India would be 28 years by 2022-23, in contrast to 37 in China and 45 in western Europe. This is not an ageist remark, but rather an enormous growth opportunity as India will have the highest number of people in the workforce. In other words, India’s non-working population would be outnumbered by the working population, leading to a favourable demographic dividend. Given the changing face of world economies over the past two years, it is important to juxtapose these statistics with the predicted challenges of a post-COVID world. As per an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study, the equivalent of five years or more of per capita income would likely be lost by the end of 2021. The World Bank notes that we would be witnessing deep global recessions fuelled by lowered investments, displacement of human capital owing to lost jobs and schooling, and a disintegration of global trade and supply chains. Effects of climate change In addition to this, increased use of non-degradable plastics, bio-medical waste and impediments to ongoing climate repair programmes have further exacerbated climate change deterioration. The effects of an increased use of plastics during the pandemic (which would end up in oceans or landfills) would cost fisheries, tourism and maritime transport industries an additional $40 billion, according to a UN Environment Program report. Hence, COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge that is further aggravating bigger concerns like economic recession and climate change. For most countries, these two predicaments would be bigger than the pandemic. Despite the gloomy outlook, there is a silver lining for India. Let us circle back to the demographic dividend or the economic growth brought on by a change in the structure of a country’s population. This leads to an increase in the labour force and, in turn, more people are working and being productive. This accelerates urbanisation and the growth of industries. Also, as the purchasing power of the populace increases, it opens up a bigger domestic market (which is already sizeable in the case of India), thus attracting more investment and increasing opportunities. Taking these factors into account, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicts that despite the pandemic, India will become the third largest economy in the world by 2030. Deutsche Bank cements this forecast with their own findings that India’s economy will grow to $7 trillion by 2030 (it is about $2 trillion now). The younger the population the more climate-conscious they are. This can simply be explained by younger generations seeing the real-time impact of climate change — from increasing natural disasters to lessening natural resources. This makes them more inclined to act towards a greener tomorrow. A UN report on climate change tells us that close to half a million youth around the world have taken (or are taking) action against climate change through initiatives at their homes, schools and communities. A decisive ‘Future of Work’ survey conducted by the Prince’s Trust and HSBC claims that 85% of India’s youth are interested in a green job as they believe that healing the environment is the only sustainable way forward. When we corroborate this with India’s performance on climate change mitigation (one of the top 10 countries to have made substantial efforts towards mitigating climate change), we can fully understand the clout of a younger demographic. The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), 2021, puts only two G20 (or Group of Twenty) countries — India and U.K. — in the top 10. India is often at the forefront of bringing about change. But to continue unhindered on the path of reaping the benefits of the demographic dividend, efforts will have to be made. Inequality is a pressing issue. COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns have further deepened this divide. While the Union government has rolled out various subsidies and employment schemes, dominance of the informal economy makes it difficult for all benefactors to reap the benefits. The need of the hour is for public–private partnership (PPP) models to work in conjunction to bridge the gap. Education and skilling are also key components in enhancing the capabilities of the growing young population and helping them realize their full potential. Moreover, labour-intensive sectors need to be better supported for further job creation. The rising young population provides India with a great opportunity for growth. To be able to best utilise this boom, policies must ensure that they comprehensively cover all aspects aimed at increasing human development and standards of living.

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Case for third party funding||Third party funding in arbitration, or litigation funding, is a concept where an unrelated party to a dispute finances the legal cost of one of the parties. The speculative investor receives part of the damages owed or recovered by the financed party in exchange for the funding. This form of funding is widely used in commercial arbitration and various litigations around the world. It is believed that this form of financing improves access to justice by providing advance funding and support against a lengthy and expensive litigation process. Historically, this form of funding was prohibited under the doctrines of maintenance and champerty. Maintenance deals with assistance to maintain litigation by an unconnected third party by providing finance. Champerty, a form of maintenance, refers to paying litigation costs by a third party for the objective of attaining a share of the proceeds of litigation. The need for such prohibition can be ascertained from its background. Feudal lords in medieval England would often trouble their enemies by financing frivolous lawsuits and thereby burdening courts. Need of the hour However, the current era seems to shrug off such concerns because the need of the hour is to increase our access to justice. Hence, rules against maintenance and champerty have been relaxed in various jurisdictions, including England, the U.S., Canada and Australia. In the context of India, interestingly, there was no bar on maintenance or champerty. However, many such arrangements where an advocate is a party are categorically precluded in view of Supreme Court decisions and the Bar Council of India rules. These arrangements would include ones where there is a personal interest of the advocate in the outcome of the dispute or agreements of contingency fees. To sum it up, “non-lawyer third party funding” is lawfully admissible in India. Even in the context of advocates, there was the controversial 2019 decision given by the Bombay High Court in the Jayaswal Ashoka Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd. v Pansare Lawad case, where the court decided that a contingent fee agreement entered by an advocate to represent his client before an “arbitrator” was not void. Therefore, what flows is a difference in how law deals with an arrangement of contingency fees between an advocate and client before a court where it renders it impermissible, and an advocate and client before an arbitral tribunal where such an arrangement is valid. The readers must, however, be informed that the above mentioned decision has been appealed against. Litigation risks The practice of third party funding must become prevalent in India. This is not only because third party funding plays an instrumental role in opening access to the court system but also helps businesses manage their litigation risks in a better manner. This risk can be managed because the third party may conduct an additional analysis of the case. However, while advocating for the enhancement of access to justice, we must also ensure that there are amendments. One of the most heated debates about third party financing in international arbitration is the disclosure of this kind of funding. We can take inspiration from the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre’s rules, the proposed changes in the International Bar Association rules and other such organisations, which stipulate that when a funding agreement is concluded, the funded party must notify the other party, the arbitral tribunal or emergency arbitrator in writing of the fact that a financing agreement has been concluded, along with the identity of the third party sponsor. In order to streamline the process in India, we are seeing the advent of organisations such as the Indian Association for Litigation Finance. Third party funding can definitely improve access to justice, but we must also ensure that scenarios like the ones that arose during the medieval period do not come up.

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Fall of Kabul||History came full circle on August 15 when the Taliban captured Kabul, almost 20 years after the U.S. launched its global war on terror. The city of roughly 5 million people fell to the Islamist insurgents without even a fight while Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, and the Americans abandoned their Embassy and rushed to Kabul airport. It was a surreal moment for the U.S., which had pledged to defeat the Taliban in every corner of Afghanistan, and a tragedy for the Afghans, who were left at the mercy of a murderous militia. The soldiers did not fight. Police abandoned their stations. Former Northern Alliance warlords left the country. And the government crumbled like the proverbial house of cards. There is already worrying news coming from the provinces that the Taliban are enforcing a strict religious code on the public and violence against anyone who resists. The last time the Taliban were in power, women were not allowed to work. They had to cover their faces and be accompanied by a male relative outside their homes. Girls were not allowed to go to school. The Taliban had also banned TV, music, painting and photography, handed out brutal forms of punishment to those violating their Islamic code, and persecuted minorities. The chaotic scenes from Kabul airport, where people are desperately trying to cling on to airplanes hoping to leave the country, bear testimony to their fear of the Taliban. This is a historic development that will have lasting implications for global geopolitics. Unlike 1996, this is not only about the Taliban taking power. This is also about an Islamist group with a medieval mindset and modern weapons defeating the world’s most powerful country. The U.S. can say in its defence that its mission was to fight al-Qaeda and that it met its strategic objectives. But in reality, after spending 20 years in Afghanistan to fight terrorism and rebuild the Afghan state, the U.S. ran away from the battlefield, embarrassing itself and leaving its allies helpless. The images from Arg, the presidential palace in Kabul, and the airport will continue to haunt President Joe Biden and the U.S. for a long time. In 1996, when the Taliban took Kabul, the government did not flee the country. Ahmad Shah Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani retreated to the Panjshir valley from where they regrouped the Northern Alliance and continued resistance against the Taliban. This time, there is no Northern Alliance. There is no government. The whole country, except some pockets, is now firmly under the Taliban’s control. The Taliban are also more receptive to regional players such as China and Russia, while Pakistan is openly celebrating their triumph. It remains to be seen what kind of a regime a stronger Taliban will install in Kabul. If the 1990s are anything to go by, darker days are ahead in Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fall-of-kabul/article35949472.ece
17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Beating plastic pollution||The Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules notified by the Centre on August 12 acknowledge the gravity of pollution caused by plastic articles of everyday use, particularly those that have no utility beyond a few minutes or hours. Under the new rules, the manufacture, sale and use of some single-use goods made with plastic, polystyrene, and expanded polystyrene, such as earbuds, plates, cups, glasses, cutlery, wrapping and packing films, are prohibited from July 1 next year, while others such as carry bags must be at least 75 microns thick from September 30, 2021, and 120 microns from December 31 next year, compared to 50 microns at present. The decisions follow recommendations made by an expert group constituted by the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals two years ago. In 2018, India won praise globally for asserting on World Environment Day that it would eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022, a theme that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed more than once. Yet, policy coherence to achieve the goal has been lacking. The Central Pollution Control Board has reported that 22 States have, in the past, announced a ban on single-use plastic, but this has had little impact on the crisis of waste choking wetlands and waterways and being transported to the oceans to turn into microplastic. At about 34 lakh tonnes generated in 2019-20, India has a staggering annual volume of plastic waste, of which only about 60% is recycled. What is more, a recent study of the top 100 global producers of polymers that culminate in plastic waste found six of them based in India. It is unsurprising, therefore, that in spite of the staggering problem, policymakers have been treading on eggshells. The international view is changing, however, and support for a UN Plastic Treaty is growing; the majority of G7 countries too are supportive of cleaning up the oceans through a charter in the interests of human wellbeing and environmental integrity. India’s policies on environmental regulation are discordant, lofty on intent but feeble on outcomes, and plastic waste is no different. State governments have felt no compulsion to replace municipal contracts, where companies are paid for haulage of mixed waste, with terms that require segregation and accounting of materials. Considerable amounts of plastic waste cannot be recycled because of lack of segregation, leading to incineration, while mixing newer types of compostable plastic will confound the problem. Patchy regulation has led to prohibited plastic moving across State borders. Now that the Centre has adopted a broad ban, further pollution must end. Microplastic is already found in the food chain, and governments must act responsibly to stop the scourge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/beating-plastic-pollution/article35949475.ece

In the morning, sitting as a Committee, they discussed the question of the status of the Indians in the Dominions, when, although there was good approach to it, complete unanimity was not arrived at. General Smuts was present in the morning and is understood to have joined in the discussion, which turned, in part on the position of South Africa in relation to Indian residents there. The Prime Ministers were agreed on the importance of encouraging wireless and air communications within the Empire, and on the duty of each Dominion to do its best in this matter. They will report in this sense to the Conference when it meets again as a whole. With regard to the question of reparations, there is reason to believe that agreement has been reached that the apportionment of the share received by the British Empire should be on the basis of the casualties pensions, expenditure, and losses of shipping by the various parts of the Empire. The total due to the British Empire is 22 per cent of £6,600,000,000, or 1,452,000,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/britains-share-of-the-reparations/article35949477.ece
17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Calcutta murders||The Union Minister for West Bengal Affairs Mr. Siddhartha Shankar Ray, at a meeting of 26 political parties today, rejected the demand for an all-party probe into Thursday’s mob frenzy at Cossipore and Baranagar in North Calcutta in which at least 50 persons are unofficially stated to have been killed. He also turned down a demand for an immediate suspension of the officers in charge of the two police stations. The parties had met yesterday and unanimously condemned the orgy and demanded “immediate action” against the police officers. At the end of the 90-minute meeting, representatives of different parties alleged that Mr. Ray had “gone back on his words” in rejecting their demands. Mr. Ray told newsmen that it had been decided that a retired High Court Judge would inquire into the incidents and submit a report in about a fortnight’s time. He contended that a non-official body would not be able to bring out the truth as it would have no access to police records and officials had given conflicting reports. “According to Congress (R), 50 persons were killed, while C.P.M. put the toll at 70 and the C.P.I. at 60.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/calcutta-murders/article35949478.ece
17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||July WPI inflation slows slightly to 11.2%||Inflation in wholesale prices slowed marginally to 11.2% in July, from June’s 12.1%, with the pace of price gains in primary articles, food as well as fuel and power moderating. Manufactured product prices, on the other hand, gained momentum last month. On a month-on-month basis, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), however, increased 0.6% in July from June 2021. Inflation in fuel and power at the wholesale level was at 26% in July, slowing from 36.7% in May and 32.8% in June, while manufactured products inflation accelerated from 10.9% in June to 11.2% in July. The Food Index saw 4.46% inflation compared with 6.66% in June. “The high rate of inflation in July 2021 is primarily due to low base effect and rise in prices of crude petroleum & natural gas; mineral oils; manufactured products like basic metals; food products; textiles; chemicals and chemical products as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year,” the office of the Economic Adviser in the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar attributed the deceleration in WPI inflation for the second month in a row, from 13.1% in May, to a favourable base effect and a softening of food price pressures. The uncertainty related to the variant of thel coronavirus had arrested the rise in commodity prices, which had also helped, she added. However, headline WPI inflation is expected to remain in double digits until October, giving little respite to the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee on the prices front, according to the economist. ‘Focus on growth’ Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that retail inflation was now well below the 6% ceiling for monetary policy and was expected to remain below it. “I wouldn’t allow it to worry me as I focus on growth, and we are constantly monitoring price trends and ensuring supply constraints are removed swiftly and if needed, import relaxations are being done so that the economy and consumers don’t suffer over essential items,” the minister said. “Reflecting the base effect and the supply-side measures taken by the government related to pulses and oilseeds, the primary food index was flat at the year-ago level in July 2021, after having reported a year-on-year inflation for the previous five months,” said Ms. Nayar. “With rising tomato prices posing some concern, we expect the wholesale food index to record a mild inflation in August 2021, before slipping into disinflation for the next few prints, aided by the base effect,” she noted. ICRA expects core-WPI inflation to have peaked at 10.8% in July, Ms. Nayar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/july-wpi-inflation-slows-slightly-to-112/article35949323.ece
17 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Demand for cans in packing rising: Ball Beverage Packaging||The demand for can-packed products would sharply rise, given the increasing emphasis on recycling and sustainable solutions, said Amit Lahoti, VP and GM, India and Southeast Asia, Ball Beverage Packaging. Pointing out that per capita can consumption in India is one per annum while it is 70 in Vietnam and about 40 in China, he said consumer behaviour and safety concerns in the wake of the pandemic were fuelling demand for aluminium cans in India. Ball Beverage Packaging India is a unit of American multinational Ball Corporation and supplies aluminium cans for FMCG, soft drink and beer firms. “There is increased awareness around how plastic packaging is adversely affecting marine life, polluting the rivers and oceans and ending up as non-degradable heaps of waste at landfills. More Indians are buying items based on social responsibility, inclusiveness and environmental impact,” he added. “COVID-19 has raised consumer awareness and commitment to buying sustainable products,” he added. To cater to growing demand, Bell is expanding its packaging offering to other segments such as sparkling water, wine and alcoholic drinks such as whiskey, rum and vodka. “Alcohol in 180 ml cans was recently introduced in Rajasthan [by a prominent spirits company]. We are looking to expand that into other States,” Mr. Lahoti said. “We have also worked on our technology around coatings inside the cans to enable us to package wine,” he said, adding that two firms had introduced wine in cans in India and for exports.  On a per-litre basis, emissions related to transporting and cooling aluminium cans are 7-21% lower than for plastic bottles and 35-49% lower than for glass bottles, depending on the size of the comparative bottles as well as the types of refrigerators, in which the beverage is cooled prior to consumption, company data showed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/demand-for-cans-in-packing-rising-ball-beverage-packaging/article35949317.ece

Since its launch in early June, many critical functionalities of the tax portal have been non-starters, and the Minister admitted that there are ‘still some issues’ with it. “Revenue Secretary [Tarun Bajaj] has been neutrally monitoring the progress on fixing the portal on a weekly basis. Nandan Nilekani [Infosys co-founder and chairman] keeps sending me messages saying: ‘This is where we are at’, ‘I assure you..’ and ‘we will sort it out.’ Hopefully, in another two-three days, it should be complete,” Ms. Sitharaman said, stressing that she had been pushing Infosys ‘not to let the taxpayers down’ with constant reminders. Asked about talks with Cairn over settling the retrospective tax dispute, she said the Finance Ministry is in the final stages of notifying the rules related to the taxation law amendment to scrap the retrospective tax clause. “The critical features are already mentioned in the amendments, but the rules are yet to be notified,” she said, indicating that Cairn may only be expected to take a call on settling the dispute after that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/income-tax-portal-to-be-fully-functional-in-2-3-days-says-fm/article35949321.ece

Speaking during an earnings call, the firm’s CEO Ravinder Takkar said although Kumar Mangalam Birla had stepped down as chairman of Vodafone Idea, “he as well as Aditya Birla Group and the Vodafone group are committing to providing support and guidance to the company, in line with the stated positions of both the groups”. The crisis-hit telco’s Q1 earnings announced on Saturday left analysts disappointed. A Goldman Sachs note cautioned that the company has large repayments due starting December, and at the current EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) run-rate, Vodafone Idea could have a Rs. 23,800-crore cash shortfall until April 2022. The total gross debt (excluding lease liabilities and including interest accrued but not due) as of June 30 stood at Rs. 1,91,590 crore. ICICI Securities said it saw “high risk and huge concern for VIL” and in the wake of growing uncertainties, it has put VIL’s estimates, rating and target price under review until further clarity. The risk-reward is “unfavourable” given limited clarity on tariff hike and funding, BofA Securities said in its report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/increase-in-tariff-key-to-sector-revival-vil-ceo/article35949314.ece

Cut and polished diamond exports have grown more than threefold to $8,522.34 million in the period. “Continued recovery in key export markets like U.S.A., China and Hong Kong as well as restocking of inventory have been the major reasons for the positive export growth of diamonds,” Mr. Shah said. Plain gold jewellery exports rose more than 7-fold to $858.83 million.

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Allow duty-free import of natural rubber: ATMA||The Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA) on Monday urged the government to allow duty-free import of natural rubber as shortage of the commodity in India has become a major deterrent for the tyre industry to support domestic manufacturing. According to the tyre industry body, natural rubber consumption is expected to increase further and the annual demand is expected to cross 13 lakh tonnes this fiscal. “With the production of 7,90,000 tonnes as projected [in normal scenario] by Rubber Board, natural rubber imports to the tune of at least 5 lakh tonnes are a must,” ATMA said in a statement. The tyre industry accounts for more than 70% of natural rubber consumed in the country, the association added. While the Rubber Board had projected much higher production figures for the ongoing fiscal, the tyre industry body claimed that “the ground realities are not in line with the Rubber Board’s guidance as market arrivals of sheet rubber have dried thin”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/allow-duty-free-import-of-natural-rubber-atma/article35949325.ece

The Andhra Pradesh bench of the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) has ruled — in the case of Vijayavahini Charitable Foundation — that since the organisation is supplying purified water, hence it is not fit for GST exemption. The Foundation had sought an advance ruling on whether the supply of groundwater after undertaking purification through reverse osmosis to the general public either through the dispensing unit, or mobile tanker, at a concessional rate is exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST). The AAR said the principal supply undertaken by the organisation is a supply of purified water, which is taxable at 18%, while the service of distribution through mobile units is an ancillary service and taxable at 18%. “It is invariably a composite supply and the rate of tax of purified water prevails, being the principal supply,” the AAR noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/purified-drinking-water-supply-via-tankers-taxable/article35949329.ece

Petrol sales are already above pre-COVID levels while diesel is 8% short. State-owned fuel retailers sold 0.98 million tonnes of petrol in the first half of August, 9.4% higher from a year earlier. Sales were 3.7% higher than pre-COVID petrol sales of 0.95 million tonnes in August 1-15, 2019. Sales of diesel — the most used fuel in the country — rose 18.5% to 2.11 million tonnes during August 1-15 over the previous year, but was 7.9% lower from August 2019. Last month, diesel consumption was 11% lower than pre-COVID levels. This is the third straight month that has seen a rise in consumption since March. Fuel demand had recovered to near-normal levels in March before the onset of the second wave of COVID-19 infections led to the reimposition of lockdowns in different States, stalling mobility and muting economic activity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/august-diesel-demand-nears-pre-covid-level/article35949337.ece

17 August 2021||Chennai,||TN has depth & options in T20||It’s no surprise that Tamil Nadu emerged triumphant in the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament last season. If the just-concluded Shriram Capital TNPL is any indication, the State has depth and options when it comes to T20 cricket. Quite a force In fact, in white-ball cricket, which would include the one-dayer, Tamil Nadu is quite a force. The test for the players would arrive in the Ranji Trophy, which would make greater demands on them technically, physically and mentally. But then, the TNPL provides a platform for several unsung cricketers who can be groomed for the longer format. More familiar names Then there are also more familiar names such as N. Jagadeesan of the champion side, Chepauk Super Gillies, a free-stroking batsman with a desire to influence games across formats. He can be such a fluent batsman in Ranji Trophy if he can work on his concentration and innings-building skills. Super Gullies played the key moments capably. Kaushik Gandhi was an attacking skipper and his chemistry with the wily coach, Hemang Badani, seemed just right. S. Radhakrishnan, laudably, was given a primary role in the batting order. The youngster, who has represented India under-19, is a delightful stroke-maker with footwork, balance and the ability to find gaps. Left-arm spinner M. Siddharth can be a handful in the longer format since he possesses one of the meanest arm balls in domestic cricket. He is a clever bowler, harnessing the angles. And how well the other left-arm spinner, Sai Kishore, bowled in high pressure situations. His tournament-clinching 20th over on Sunday night — he remarkably conceded just four — was a nerveless display of control and craft. The lanky spinner gets turn and bounce, probes batsmen. The ageless R. Sathish added firepower to the line-up. Fearless bunch Ruby Trichy Warriors might have finished second best, but fought with a tigerish resolve. They were a fearless bunch who bucked the odds, won admirers. In Saravana Kumar, the side has an all-rounder who can play a part for Tamil Nadu as well. He seams the ball both ways at a lively pace, can strike the ball a long way and is not daunted by adversity. And southpaws Nidhish Rajagopal and wicket-keeper batsman Adithya Ganesh coped admirably with pressure situations, read the flow of the game well, were judicious with their stroke-play, and won games. The underdog almost pulled off a heist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tn-has-depth-options-in-t20/article35949685.ece
17 August 2021||madrid,||No Messi, no problem for Barca||Barcelona started life without Lionel Messi by defeating Real Sociedad 4-2 in its LaLiga opener at the Camp Nou on Sunday even if fans admitted it felt like “a leap into the unknown”. Captain Gerard Pique gave it a 19th minute lead with his 50th goal for the club. Martin Braithwaite found the net in first half injury time and in the 59th minute. Sergi Roberto added a fourth in the last minute of the game. Just over 20,000 fans were in attendance as crowds returned for the first time since the pandemic. Brief comeback However, they had to hold their breath at one stage when Sociedad came back from 3-0 down to get to 3-2 thanks to goals from 20-year-old Julen Lobete in the 82nd minute and a 30-metre free-kick from skipper Mikel Oyarzabal three minutes later. Six-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi called time on his two-decade career at Barcelona last week and moved to Paris Saint-Germain. Messi’s memory lingered heavy over the Camp Nou on Sunday despite the removal of a giant photograph of the Argentine superstar from the entrance in the wake of his move to France. Venting their anger Some banners were in place well before kick-off venting the fans anger towards president Joan Laporta. One read “Laporta, Barca is not your business”, while another proclaimed “Barca yes, Laporta no!” “It was a big emotional blow,” said 23-year-old Barca fan Adria De Lucas. “I was in my room when I saw the news. I started sending messages to all my friends, and no one believed it. It was emotionally hard.” Leap into unknown The supporter added: “It’s a leap into the unknown (without Messi). We will see what happens.” Inside the Camp Nou, fans made the most of their return after 18 months, chanting “Messi! Messi!”. Banners expressed their “eternal gratitude”. “The supporters are with us, they want to see football,” said Pique. “We knew they were going to react that way. We all know what Leo represents, but everything changes and we have to keep going. “We will be very competitive and we will fight for titles to the end. We will not have his talent, but we have proven that we can all play together.” LaLiga champion Atletico Madrid got its season underway with a 2-1 win at Celta Vigo. Angel Correa gave Atletico the lead after 23 minutes after being set up by Thomas Lemar. Correa added a second goal in the 64th minute just five minutes after Iago Aspas had pulled Celta level from the penalty spot. Mass brawl However, the game was marred by a mass brawl in the closing stages following a foul on Atletico striker Luis Suarez. Red cards were brandished for Hugo Mallo of Celta and Mario Hermoso of Atletico. In Sunday’s late game, Sevilla defeated Rayo Vallecano 3-0 with Moroccan international Youssef En-Nesyri scoring a first-half penalty before new Argentine recruit Erik Lamela grabbed two. Vallecano played 75 minutes a man short after goalkeeper Luca Zidane, the son of French football legend Zinedine, was red-carded for bringing down Oussama Idrissi in the move which led to the penalty.  The results:   LaLiga: Celta Vigo 1 (Aspas 59-pen) lost to Atletico Madrid 2 (Correa 23, 63).   Barcelona 4 (Pique 19, Braithwaite 45+2, 59, Roberto 90+1) bt Real Sociedad 2 (Lobete Cienfuegos 82, Oiarzabal 85); Sevilla 3 (En-Nesyri 19-pen, Lamela 55, 79) bt Rayo Vallecano 0.   Bundesliga: Cologne 3 (Modeste 41, Kainz 52, 55) bt Hertha Berlin 1 (Jovetic 6).   Premier League: Tottenham 1 (Son 55) bt Man City 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-messi-no-problem-for-barca/article35949640.ece
17 August 2021||London,||Indian pacers pull off famous win after Shami-Bumrah show with bat||Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah starred with both bat and ball as India pressed for a dramatic win in the second Test at Lord’s on Monday following an England collapse on the last day. The hosts were 67/4 at tea, needing a further 205 runs in a minimum of 28 overs to reach a target of 272 after Jonny Bairstow was out to the last ball of the session. England captain Joe Root, fresh from his magnificent 180 not out in the first innings, was 33 not out. Need of support But he was in desperate need of support if his side were to deny India the seven remaining wickets required to go 1-0 up in this five-match series following a rain-marred draw at Trent Bridge. Shami, with 56 not out and Bumrah (34 not out) both hit their highest Test scores, and shared an unbroken ninth-wicket stand of 89, during India’s second innings 298/8 declared. Bumrah then had Rory Burns out for nought when the left-hander, trying to turn the ball legside, got a leading edge and lobbed a catch to Mohammed Siraj, running in from wide mid-off. The struggling Dom Sibley followed soon afterwards when squared up by a superb Shami leg-cutter, he nicked behind to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. First time It was the first time in 141 years of Test cricket in England that both home openers had been out for a duck in the same innings. There have only been three successful run-chases of over 200 in a Test at Lord’s — West Indies’ 344/1 in 1984 and England’s 282/3 in 2004 and 218/3 in 1965, both against New Zealand. And at 1-2, Root’s men did not look like joining that select list. The recalled Haseeb Hameed, in on a pair, was dropped in the slips on four before his dour nine off 45 balls ended when he was lbw to an Ishant Sharma nip-backer, despite a review. New batsman Bairstow had made 57 during a first-innings partnership of 121 with Yorkshire team-mate Root. But when on two he was lbw on the back leg to Ishant, although it needed an India review to overturn the original not out decision, with recalled paceman Ishant having taken 2/6 in four overs at tea. India resumed on 181/6, 154 ahead, after bad light had cut short Sunday’s play. England took the new ball in the second over of the day but left-hander Pant, renowned for his aggressive batting, charge down the pitch to drive James Anderson for four. But Ollie Robinson had dangerman Pant, ironically misjudging a defensive shot, caught behind for 22, to leave India 194/7. Shami, however, got off the mark with a square-driven boundary off Robinson before the Sussex seamer had Ishant lbw with a well-disguised slower ball. Bumrah, having exchanged some angry words with England wicketkeeper Buttler, cut Wood for four when he appeared to be attempting a leg-side pull. With Shami and Bumrah steadily adding runs against the quicks, Root brought off-spinner Mooen back into the attack. Bumrah, however, was dropped on 22 by first slip Root off Moeen. Shami went to his second fifty in 53 Tests in stylish fashion, driving successive Mooen deliveries for four and six off to reach the landmark in just 57 balls. This innings surpassed his 51 not out against England at Trent Bridge back in 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shami-and-bumrahs-batting-heroics-drive-indias-victory-push/article35949567.ece
17 August 2021||Kolkata,||Senior men’s National football camp gets underway||The selected names of Indian senior men’s national football squad assembled for a preparatory camp in the city on Monday after a fairly creditable showing in the 2022 World Cup / 2023 Asian Cup qualifiers in Doha in June. The present camp has been called to prepare the Indian team for two international friendlies against Nepal in the first week of September. This will be an important outing for the National side ahead of the SAFF Championship, which after multiple postponements is now scheduled to be played in the first week of October in Maldives. The All India Football Federation had devised the calendar for the remainder part of the season to lay out a robust engagement for the senior national team under its head coach Igor Stimac, who recently earned a contract extension. “We have made our best efforts in laying out a robust engagement for our Senior National team despite the ongoing pandemic situation and the different quarantine rules in different countries. India will play six international matches in the second half of 2021, and a possible seventh if we progress to the SAFF championship final,” said Kushal Das, the AIFF general secretary, in a statement. The preparatory camp in Kolkata, which is happening in the city after a break of 15 years, will be taking place under a secure bio bubble environment adhering to the parameters laid out in the current pandemic situation. The international class practice grounds developed at the Salt Lake Stadium during FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017 will be used for training. The entire contingent of players and coaching staff will be undergoing regular COVID screening tests during the camp, which will be on for a little over two weeks before the squad leaves for Kathmandu.  The present 24 players for the camp: Goalkeepers: Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem, Vishal Kaith; Defenders: Ashish Rai, Seriton Fernandes, Rahul Bheke, Adil Khan, Chinglensana Singh, Narender, Akash Mishra, Mandar Rao Dessai; Midfielders: Bipin Singh, Brandon Fernandes, Lalengmawia, Glan Martins, Jeakson Singh, Pronay Halder, Anirudh Thapa, Sahal Abdul Samad, Yasir Mohammed, Halicharan Narzary; Forwards: Rahul KP, Farukh Choudhary, Ishan Pandita, Rahim Ali.

17 August 2021||MADRID,||Laporta paints a grim picture of Barcelona’s finances||Barcelona’s president presented a grim picture of the club’s financial situation on Monday, saying its debt had risen to €1.35 billion. Joan Laporta blamed the previous administration of Josep Bartomeu for the club’s “dramatic” situation that ultimately led to Lionel Messi’s departure. Laporta accused Bartomeu of countless “lies” and said he and his board of directors must be held accountable. Laporta said the club had losses of €481 million and was left with a negative net worth of €451 million, making it difficult to negotiate with players. “Our salaries represent 103% of the club’s total income. That’s 20% to 25% more than our competitors,” Laporta said in a news conference. “We have found ourselves in a difficult situation to renegotiate the players’ contracts.” The club lost star player Messi to PSG this month because it could not give him a new contract that would fit within the league’s strict financial fair-play regulations. The club's debt included almost €390 million related to player salaries, Laporta said. More than €670 million was debts with banks, while some €40 million was linked to membership losses.  Gerard Pique said on Sunday he had to take a salary reduction so the club could register some of its new players and that other veteran players such as Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Sergi Roberto were expected to do the same.  We have found ourselves in a difficult situation to renegotiate the players’ contracts||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/laporta-paints-a-grim-picture-of-barcelonas-finances/article35949629.ece
17 August 2021||TOKYO,||Games not to have spectators||All fans will be barred from the Paralympics in Japan because of the coronavirus pandemic, just as they were from the recently-completed Tokyo Olympics, organisers said Monday. There were a few exceptions made during the Olympics with some fans allowed in outlying areas away from Tokyo. This time, all fans will be barred except the possibility of some children attending a few unspecified events. Organisers have also asked the public not to come out to view road events. The decision was announced after a meeting with International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons, organising committee president Seiko Hashimoto, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa. The Paralympics opens on August 24 with about 4,400 athletes, a far smaller event than the Olympics with 11,000 athletes. But the Paralympics come as new infections have accelerated in Tokyo, which may expose an athlete population that is more vulnerable to COVID-19. No complacency Parsons, speaking at a news conference, said there was no room for complacency in the wake of the Olympics. "In light of the current case numbers in Tokyo and wider Japan, everyone attending these games must be vigilant,” Parsons said. New infections in Tokyo tripled during the 17 days of the Olympics, although medical experts said the surge was not directly linked the Tokyo Games. Rather, experts suggested an indirect effect as the public was distracted and lulled into a false sense of security that staging the Games offered. With the situation growing worse, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Monday said a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas will be extended until Sept. 12. The state of emergency has been in force since July 12 and was to end later this month. The Paralympics end on Sept. 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/games-not-to-have-spectators/article35949631.ece
17 August 2021||Kingston,||Windies clinch a thriller||West Indies scrambled to a pulsating one-wicket victory over Pakistan on Sunday as the visitors self-destructed in the final session of the fourth day when on course to take the first Test of the two-match series at Sabina Park here. Defending a modest target of 168 after being dismissed in the morning session for 103, Shaheen Shah Afridi led the attack with figures of four for 50 in reducing the home side to 114 for seven at tea with only wicketkeeper-batsman Joshua da Silva and the tailenders left. However, in scenes reminiscent of a similar one-wicket loss in the deciding Test of the 2000 series in Antigua, the Pakistanis lost the discipline in their bowling and composure in the field. Three catches were missed to allow Kemar Roach and last man Jayden Seales to take their team to the target with a last-wicket partnership of 17. Roach, who was dropped twice, hit the winning runs off Hasan Ali to finish unbeaten on 30. Seales was named man-of-the-match for his match haul of eight for 125 which included five for 55 in the second innings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/windies-clinch-a-thrilling-win/article35949564.ece
17 August 2021||KOLKATA,||Push to prepare for Paris reason for success||The initiative to prepare youngsters for the 2024 Paris Olympics is the primary reason behind the Indian archers’ unprecedented success in the World Youth archery championships in Poland, says high performance director Sanjeeva Singh. The Indian archers claimed 15 medals, including eight gold, to record the country’s best-ever showing. Sanjeeva said comprehensive sports science support for the archers was crucial. “They trained with heart rate monitoring devices and practised breathing techniques to shoot with more control. We focused on finishing,” said Sanjeeva, an Arjuna and Dronacharya awardee, from Poland.  He said the young archers, who shot at 60 to 70% of their ability, needed to raise their level over the next three years. “The change in selection process, giving priority to archers doing well in one-on-one matches, was important. Talented young archers should get more opportunities. We are sending several juniors to the upcoming World Championships next month.” Purnima Mahato, a senior coach accompanying the archers, said it was a good exposure. “We have got good archers in cadet and junior levels. They shot with confidence and learnt how to handle pressure,” said Purnima. Komalika’s feat Komalika Bari, who had claimed the World cadet title in 2019, took the World recurve junior women’s individual crown this time to become the second Indian after Deepika Kumari to win both the gold medals. Komalika, who bagged the junior mixed team title with Parth Salunkhe, looked at bigger goals. “I was well prepared, mentally and game-wise. The international exposure at the senior level and the scientific support during training made a difference,” said Komalika. The youngster, who was part of two World Cup gold medal-winning teams this year, said the failure to make it to the Olympics hurt. “The pain remains, but I have to learn from the mistakes and improve,” said Komalika. Salunkhe, who also contributed to the junior men’s team’s gold medal victory, was delighted to prove his worth. “The preparation helped. Good to win gold medals at this level,” said Salunkhe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/push-to-prepare-for-paris-games-reason-for-success-sanjeeva/article35949559.ece

17 August 2021||Montreal,||Giorgi wins her biggest cheque yet||Italian underdog Camila Giorgi upset fourth seed Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 7-5 on Sunday to win the biggest title of her career at the WTA hardcourt event here. The World No. 71 completed a 2021 hat-trick of victories over the sixth-ranked Czech, who has now lost three finals this season. “I was very emotional inside,” Giorgi said. “Of course, I’m not the one that shows a lot. It’s just amazing.” Wimbledon finalist and Rome runner-up Pliskova had no answer for the inspired shotmaking of Giorgi, who also defeated Pliskova in the first round at Eastbourne and in the third round at the Tokyo Olympics. The Czech had won 12 of her past 14 matches coming into the final. But Giorgi’s seven aces, and four service breaks, were enough to again overcome Pliskova.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/giorgi-wins-her-biggest-cheque-yet/article35949570.ece
17 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Bino joins Kerala United as coach||When Bino George decided to leave Gokulam Kerala after being with the club since its inception, the future had looked uncertain for him. Not any longer. The coach, who is known for his keen eye to spot fresh talent, has joined Kerala United, the club bought by United World Group, which also owns the English club Sheffield United Club. “After leaving Gokulam I had been weighing my options, which included becoming an assistant coach at an ISL club,” Bino told The Hindu on Monday. “I felt the offer from Kerala United was the best for me at this stage of my career.” He said the club had been in touch with him for a long time. “Ever since they had decided to form a club in Kerala, they had been in talks with me,” Bino said. “I am glad that I am joining a young club and hope to achieve the kind of success with them that I had with Gokulam.” Bino has reasons to feel proud about his association with Gokulam, the reigning I-League champion. Though he was no longer the coach when the club triumphed in the I-League this past season, he was its technical director. Moreover, it was under his wings many of the young stars blossomed. Gokulam benefited from Bino’s knack to catch them young, and inexpensive. One of his last recruits for the club, Emil Benny, was a revelation at the I-League a few months ago and was named the tournament’s emerging player. “One of my main tasks at Kerala Untied too is to unearth and nourish fresh talent,” Bino said. “Rather than spending heavily on established players from other clubs, the management wants to create its own stars.” First challenge He said his first challenge would be to prepare the club for the second division of the I-League. “I am confident that I could put together a formidable side,” he said. “It would be great if Kerala United too could play in the I-League.” Bino took the first step towards that long journey on Monday. He had a session with the players of his new club at Manjeri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bino-joins-kerala-united-as-coach/article35949932.ece
17 August 2021||Ufa (Russia),||Balian, Deepak move into semifinals||Gourav Balian (79kg) and Deepak (97kg) entered the semifinals of the junior World wrestling championship, but three other Indians suffered defeats here on Monday. Baliyan, who had attempted to stake his claim in the senior Indian team in the 74kg trials last year, beat his rivals without any fuss. He began by defeating Tajikistan’s Abubakr Shukurov by technical superiority as his two four-point throws stood out. Baliyan then got past Russia’s Alik Badtiev 5-2 in the quarterfinals. He is now up against Iran’s Mohammad Ashghar Nokhodilarimi, who had won the senior title at the Yasar Dogu event in June this year. Deepak opened his campaign with a 5-1 win over Aliaksei Parkhomenka from Belarus and followed that up with a commanding 9-4 victory against Georgia’s Luka Khutchua. He will fight it out against America’s Braxton James Amos, who has switched to freestyle from Greco-Roman. In the 57kg competition, Shubham was no match for Russia’s Ramazan Bagavudinov, whose superior technical acumen was on display in the quarterfinal bout. Jaideep (70kg) and Rohit (65kg) won their opening bouts but later lost in the quarterfinals to Russians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/balian-deepak-move-into-semifinals/article35949639.ece
17 August 2021||LONDON,||Rashid Khan worried about his family, says Pietersen||Former England skipper Kevin Pietersen has revealed that Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan is worried about the situation back home and is not able to get his family out of the country because flight operations have been affected due to the ongoing turmoil in the country. Rashid is currently in the UK playing for Trent Rockets in the inaugural edition of the Hundred. “There’s a lot of things that are happening at home. We had a long chat here on the boundary talking about it and he’s worried: he can’t get his family out of Afghanistan and there’s a lot of things happening for him,” Pietersen said on Sky Sports . “For him to turn up and put on a performance like this under the pressure that he is currently under...for him to be able to forget that stuff and navigate his story and continue the momentum that he has — I think that’s probably one of the most heart-warming stories of this Hundred so far,” added Pietersen.

17 August 2021||London,||Nuno impatient for transfer window to shut||Harry Kane is in Tottenham’s squad for its Europa Conference League tie this week as manager Nuno Espirito Santo admits he cannot wait for the transfer window to close and end speculation over the striker’s future. Manchester City is keen to sign Kane and was reported to have tabled a bid of £100 million in June. Kane — who has three years remaining on his contract — stayed away from Tottenham’s 1-0 victory over City in its Premier League opener on Sunday. However, The Times claims it is expected Kane will remain for one more season due to City’s reluctance to meet Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy’s reported asking price of £160 million.  The 28-year-old on Monday was named in Tottenham’s squad for the Europa Conference League play-off against Pacos de Ferreira.   Nuno said he expected Kane to remain at the north London club, though he added he has enough experience to know Spurs should keep its options open regarding a move for a replacement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nuno-impatient-for-transfer-window-to-shut/article35949935.ece
17 August 2021||London,||On-field tension helped our bowlers, says Kohli||India captain Virat Kohli said that the verbal altercation between England players and the two Indian tail-enders Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah spurred them to go flat out at the home team. “Super proud of the whole team. The way we stuck to our plans after being put in. The pitch didn’t offer much on the first three days. First day was the most challenging,” said Kohli at the presentation. “The way we played in the second innings after being put under pressure — Jasprit and Shami were outstanding. We had the belief we can get them out in 60 overs. The tension in the field in our second innings, what happened there, helped us,” said Kohli. “Putting their hand up was something we were really proud of and we wanted to let them know (standing ovation for Bumrah-Shami). Batting coach has worked really hard with the boys. “They have the desire in them to do well for the team. We know how priceless those runs are. The belief (from lower-order) was missing for a while but now it is back,” said Kohli. “Have been a part of the winning Test last time under MS (Dhoni). That was pretty special. But this one, to get a result in 60 overs is quite special. Especially with someone like Siraj playing for the first time at Lord’s and he bowled superbly,” he said. England skipper Joe Root admitted they got their tactics wrong when Shami and Bumrah were batting. “We went from a very strong position where we looked like we would win the game than lose. More than anything, just got a few things wrong. That partnership, they did pretty well. But lots of things I’d do differently if given an opportunity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/on-field-tension-helped-our-bowlers-says-kohli/article35949591.ece

17 August 2021||August 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Writers’ rooms head South||If you have a favourite American TV show, it probably has a writers’ room. Where storylines are thrown about, episodes created, and scripts fleshed out. But in India, this collaborative model had less appeal, at least until recently. When global streaming giants such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ came down, they brought with them industry standards from the West. Today, not only are writers’ rooms fast becoming a staple in Hindi programming, web series with multiple seasons have also highlighted the indispensability of a writer. Interestingly, the trend is trickling down to the South now, especially in Tamil and Telugu, and increasingly Kannada. The pandemic, which created new interest in southern content — SonyLiv acquiring Tamil releases, Jio Cinema picking up Malayalam titles, and the big OTT players making more intense inroads — has only helped accelerate this. The concept isn’t new, though. Director Barath Neelakantan says that writers’ rooms were part of Tamil cinema, albeit informally. “They used to call it ‘script discussion’ or ‘scene sollaruthu ’, where the director would write a story, which would then get a ‘treatment’ where every scene was developed.” Sometimes, there wouldn’t even be a story, just the whiff of an idea. Like when Tamil neo-noir director Mysskin walked into his writers’ room — dingy and cluttered, filled with odd paraphernalia such as a DVD of Taxi Driver , a broken shower head, and a Salman Rushdie portrait on the walls — with only a vague notion, “A detective follows demons into hell, only to discover they are actually angels.” His team of writers thrashed out a screenplay from that seed, which eventually became the 2011 hit, Yuddham Sei . So, what has changed today? Writers’ rooms in the South are becoming formalised, with contracts, NDAs and salaries. Depending on the project, writers make anywhere between Rs. 2 and Rs. 20 lakh (usually around 10% of the budget is reserved for script development). Hierarchies are being broken, too. Where once only the director would be listed as the writer, today everyone involved gets credited.  Bringing in discipline  In this format — used in Netflix’s Sacred Games , which ran for two seasons, Amazon Prime Video’s Paatal Lok , now renewed for a second season, and in several upcoming Tamil and Telugu projects — writers sit together and formulate a script, dividing episodes, scenes, or character arcs among themselves, before finally tying it all together. “The reason most OTT platforms opt for a writers’ room is because it is faster. If they sign me up, for example, I can buy some time to finish a project. But with a team, they can nudge them towards a definite deadline,” says Neelakanthan. Kannada writer-director Hemanth Rao agrees that this is a more efficient model for long-form content. “You have one person coming in with a solid idea, getting on board like-minded people, and writing 10 episodes in half the time. It democratises the entire process, and creates more jobs.”  Balancing perspectives  With different perspectives also come different skill sets. People are being recruited for specific talents: comedy, writing dialogues, local referencing, in-depth thematic knowledge. Writer-director Bejoy Nambiar, who started a writers’ room last year as an experiment, says that he is always on the lookout for people. “When putting together a room, you have to think of who would be right for the subject, what are the strengths you need to make it whole,” says the director of Wazir, Taish , and most recently, the short Edhiri for Mani Ratnam-produced anthology, Navarasa . Another advantage is the fresh perspective brought in with multiple voices. This was why Kannada writer-director Rakshit Shetty began 7 Odds, his writers’ room — to polish a script he had written, which eventually became Kirik Party , the successful 2016 romantic-comedy. “For me, a writers’ room is very important. Once a script is ready, even if it is written by one person, the rest can come up with inputs. That opens a new dimension to the main writer. It’s also more of a feedback, which can be important.” Since then, the team co-wrote the 2019 fantasy-adventure, Avane Srimannarayana , and is working on new ideas now. However, there is still hesitance to adopt these formal rooms for feature films. This stems, perhaps, from the fact that production houses usually ideate movies around directors or film stars (and their tight schedules), while web series — that can take up to a year to develop a script — are built around the writing. “With films, there is often a compulsion to churn it out, start to end, within six months. So I see a bit of resistance,” says Abbhinav Kastura, a former supervising producer at mobile VOD (video on demand) service VuClip who is now independently developing commissioned Tamil web shows.  Heart of the matter  Does Tamil cinema need a writers’ room? According to Pushkar, one half of the Pushkar-Gayathri writer-director team (behind Tamil hits such as Vikram Vedha and Oram Po ), all writing is a synergy between the heart and the plot. “One thing Tamil cinema is really good at is the heart part of it — the depth of emotion, flavour, nativity. But we generally don’t have too many writers good at plotting.” He is working on two fairly large Tamil web series at the moment, adds, “With web series it is important to have a tightly structured plot to hold through eight episodes and possibly more seasons. It needs a build-up, a hook, a surprise; structural requirements that are very plot heavy. To get this combination, we think a writers’ room comes into play — with some focussing on the heart, and some focussing on the plot.” The Malayalam industry, meanwhile, is yet to pick up on the trend. However, industry insiders say change is imminent. “Writing is an independent, personal process in Kerala, being a small-scale industry compared to that in Tamil Nadu,” says Syam Pushkaran, one of the most prolific writers ( Maheshinte Prathikaaram , Mayanadhi , Kumbalangi Nights , Joji ). He prefers writing alone because “there is something lacking when two or three people are working together; that personal point of view is missing”.  A writers’ room must be created keeping the story in mind. If you are making something about a social minority, you need to make sure they are represented in the room. This is very common in Hollywood. [2002 drama] The Wire , for example, had a journalist and a cop writing, which is why it rings so true. — Pushkar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/writers-rooms-head-south/article35949922.ece
17 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Rapid response teams’ to tackle new variants||The Delhi government will be forming ‘rapid response teams’ to react when new variants of interest of COVID-19 are found in the city through genome sequencing, according to officials. Each such team will have a microbiologist or virologist and a clinician among others to monitor an area from which the variant of interest emerges in the city. “The team will collect data about the new variant of concern from the lab and quickly get into action. The team will visit the area from where it was found and do proper contact tracing and these samples will be sent for genome sequencing. Also, the area will be closely monitored,” a Delhi government official said. The move follows directions from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) last week. “There will be better monitoring and the Central government will also be kept in the loop about these developments. The Delhi government is yet to decide as to how many such teams will be formed, but most probably one team will be formed for three to four districts,” the official said. The NCDC has also told the Delhi government to investigate vaccine breakthrough cases from genomic surveillance and epidemiological perspectives and also sent samples for ‘whole genome sequencing’.  Meanwhile, the city reported 27 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,37,118, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi government. There was no new deaths reported and the total number of deaths stood at 25,069.

The Health and Family Welfare on Monday issued bulletin saying 104 out of 868 persons reported to be infected during the past 24 hours were in the age group of 0-18 group, accounting for 11.98%. On Sunday, 138 out of 1,058 were children aged below 18 and they had tested positive for the coronavirus, constituting 11.15%. Some experts had predicted that children could be affected more during the third wave. “Children in age group of 0-18 years are yet to be vaccinated. As per the prediction of the public health experts, there is possibility of increased incidence of COVID-19 cases amongst the population of this age group in the eventuality of a third wave,” Pradipta Mohapatra, Additional Chief Secretary (Health), wrote to all Collectors recently. Urging the Collectors and Chief District Medical Officers to be prepared for managing high number of cases, Mr. Mohapatra laid emphasis on the constitution of a district level task force for effective monitoring and supervision. District level committee The committee should be headed by the Collector while other members should be CDMO, public health officers, senior paediatric specialist, anaesthesia specialist and any other co-opted members. “This committee should regularly do the gap analysis, monitor and take steps for remedial action. The respective Collectors shall take a meeting in this regard within a week,” he said in his letter. All paediatric cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections need to be listed and swab collection of children of 0-18 age group should be ensured for RT-PCR testing in all healthcare facilities across the State. About 50% of the existing capacity of different intensive care units should be isolated and earmarked for paediatric COVID cases, Mr. Mohapatra said. The total COVID-19 cases have increased to 9,95,433 while 6,953 have so far succumbed to COVID-19 following death of 66 persons during past 24 hours.

17 August 2021||New Delhi,||Man accused in triple talaq case gets anticipatory bail from court||The Delhi High Court has granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of pronouncing ‘triple talaq’ on his wife subject to his joining the investigation of the case as and when directed. Justice Mukta Gupta also directed the man to deposit Rs. 4 lakh with the Registrar General of the High Court within six weeks, half of which will be set aside towards the upbringing of his two daughters. “The petition is disposed of directing that in the event of arrest, the petitioner be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety bond of the like amount subject to the satisfaction of the Arresting Officer/SHO concerned,” the court ordered. The High Court also directed the man to inform the court concerned in case of change of mobile number or the residential address. The man had on March 18, 2020 allegedly pronounced triple talaq and later performed a second marriage. His wife filed an FIR under Sections 498A (cruelty to a woman by her husband or any relative of her husband) and 4 (punishment for pronouncing talaq) of Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Act, 2019 registered at a police station in Mangolpuri. ‘Still his legal wife’ The man, in his plea, claimed that the allegations against him are “false and fabricated”. He claimed that the woman is still his legally wedded wife. He said his wife is “habitual in creating nuisance at her in-laws’ place and left the matrimonial home to go to her parental house and lodged this false and fabricated FIR”. The woman, in her FIR, said she got married to the man in October 2009 as per Muslim rites. She said in the marriage, her parents spent beyond their capacity to fulfil all the demands of her husband and in-laws. She claimed that at the time of marriage, she was informed that her husband was running a medical store. But after marriage, it was revealed that the medical store was of her brother-in-law and the husband was unemployed. The woman also claimed that she was asked to bring money so that the husband could do some work. When she gave birth to a female child, she was threatened to be killed. In order to save her matrimonial life, her parents gave her Rs. 2 lakh. On the birth of the second female child in 2013, things got worse and her father had to arrange for rented accommodation in Delhi and for all household expenses, the woman said. The woman had earlier also complained to the Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) and Superintendent of Police, Baghpat but no action was taken. The court ordered that the “remaining amount of Rs. 2 lakh, which would be lying deposited in fixed deposit before this court will be subject to the final outcome in the trial or any settlement, arrived at between the parties”.

The parents, in their plea, alleged that the crime was committed by four accused inside a crematorium located in Purani Nangal village. ‘Destroying evidence’ “Not only this, the body was thrown in the burning fire of the crematorium by the accused persons for the purpose of destroying the evidence of their sin,” the plea said. The petition said the parents belong to the “wretched and poor most section of the society and are totally illiterate”. “It has come to the knowledge of the petitioners that after committing rape with the deceased daughter of the petitioners, she was killed by the accused persons...When the mother of the deceased reached the crematorium in search of her daughter, she was told by the accused persons that her daughter died due to electrocution,” the plea said. “It is respectfully submitted that there were injuries on the hands of the deceased and there was bleeding from her nose. The petitioners were not allowed by the accused persons to touch the body of the deceased,” the plea added. “After hearing the heart wrenching crying of the petitioners, the crowd assembled there..put water in the burning pyre of the deceased and some of the remains of the deceased were obtained,” it said. “The police reached there but the total focus of the police was to hush up/ sabotage the case. The petitioners were taken to the police station and throughout the night they were kept in the police station where they were tortured and pressured by the police and its agents to compromise the case,” the petition claimed. Despite the fact that the case is now transferred to the Crime Branch of Delhi police, the petitioners have no faith in the present investigation, the plea said adding, “the truth can be proved only by a court monitored special investigation team (SIT)”.  ...the truth can be proved only by a court-monitored SIT Petitioners||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/parents-of-9-year-old-dalit-girl-demand-hc-monitored-probe/article35949789.ece

Mr. Sisodia said that he has also sent a letter to the Union Home Minister requesting him to direct the L-G to approve the inquiry committee constituted by the Delhi government. Responsible govt. “The courts and the Central government have asked States for the number of deaths due to lack of oxygen. A high-level committee of medical experts will be constituted by the Delhi government to probe into the deaths due to lack of oxygen in Delhi. We have sent the file for approval of the inquiry committee to the L-G in this regard and hope that the L-G will approve the committee soon,” the Minister said. Mr. Sisodia said that as a responsible government, it should not run away from the issue, but should fix the system and carry out reforms instead of “hiding the information”. “Hiding information is not the hallmark of a good governance model,” he said. He said that the L-G should pass the file so that the committee can complete its investigation and send its report to the Central government and the court so that correct data can be disclosed to the public. In July, the Central government had said that no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by States or UTs during the second wave. It has been a controversial issue since then with the Delhi government initially saying that data was not sought from the State and later changing its stand to not enough time was given to send the data to the Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-resends-file-to-l-g-for-panel-approval/article35949758.ece

17 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Petrol bomb hurled at Meghalaya CM’s residence||Masked miscreants hurled a petrol bomb at Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma’s private residence in Shillong late Sunday night as the law and order situation continued to remain tense. Officers said the Molotov cocktail landed inside the compound of the CM’s residence in the Laimer area in Shillong. It did not do any damage, they said. Shillong spiralled into unrest during Independence Day on Sunday, two days after the police gunned down Cheristerfield Thangkhiew, a former extremist leader, at his residence on August 13 morning. The East Khasi Hills district administration imposed an indefinite curfew from 8 p.m. on Sunday. The Home Department suspended Internet and mobile data services for 48 hours in four districts, including East Khasi Hills. Director-General of Police R. Chandranathan said the police fired at Thangkhiew in “self-defence after he pulled out a knife and attacked them”.

Mr. Bidhuri demanded that hospitals in all the 14 districts of the Capital be notified to ensure people don’t have to run pillar to post for treatment. This, he stated, was important since it was being said that children were expected to be “most impacted” by the third wave. Impact on children “Experts have time and again warned that the third wave is likely to badly impact the children and that is why it is even more important to take adequate measures to deal with any kind of situation or crisis,” he added. Of the total population impacted around the globe, nearly 10%, the leader said, were children. Keeping this in mind, he said the Delhi government should ensure that beds are reserved in a majority of the hospitals for children. Kept ready Paramedical staff, including doctors, nurses and adequate quantity of medicine and oxygen, he further said, was also to be kept ready since a vaccine for children was yet to be put in action making it very important to ensure that children were protected as they were now most vulnerable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/list-action-plan-to-deal-with-possible-third-covid-19-wave/article35949768.ece

Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the MHA and asked it to respond to the petition and listed it for further hearing on September 3. “While issuing notice to respondent no. 1 [MHA], it is directed that no coercive action be taken against the petitioner [NGO] till the next date of hearing,” the court said. Petitioner Shree Swaminarayan Mandir said it is an NGO carrying out social, devotional, medical and religious charitable activities and it is aggrieved by its inability to file its annual return for Financial Year 2019-20, as mandated under the FCRA due to the technical difficulties in filing form FC-4 electronically on FCRA portal of MHA. Advocates Manoj Khanna and Rajat Bhatia, appearing for the NGO, said it was impossible for the petitioner to fill out the form FC-4 and comply with the requirements of the law due to the technical issues on the portal. “A failure to file annual returns within the prescribed timelines, carries dire consequences under the FCRA. It can lead to heavy penalties and even cancellation of registration under the FCRA,” the plea said.

17 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||DUTA seeks one-time regulation for absorption of ad hoc teachers||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Monday demanded a one-time regulation for the absorption of ad hoc teachers at the university. The teachers’ body said there were around 4,500 ad hoc teachers currently in the varsity. Stating that the indefinite nature of ad hoc service was in violation of relevant guidelines of the university, the DUTA said: “The service conditions are discriminatory and exploitative despite fulfilling all requisite academic qualifications and contributing to the academic and the corporate growth of the university in the same way as their permanent colleagues. It is an extremely unfortunate situation and a denial of their basic rights to a dignified life.” In a letter to Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, the DUTA said a statement made in the Lok Sabha about the number of ad hoc teachers in the university was “inaccurate”. “It is really shocking that the annexure states that there are 58 ad hoc teachers in the University of Delhi as on April 1, 2021. This is far from the reality — close to 4,500 teachers are working ad hoc basis in DU with the number increasing every day as no recruitment have taken place for more than ten years now and with many teachers superannuating in the meantime. Though these these teachers perform the same duties as their permanent colleagues, they have been denied basic rights to a dignified life,” read the letter to the Minister. DUTA President Rajib Ray said specific regulations should be framed, which permits the regularisation of serving temporary or ad-hoc teachers on permanent basis through a one-time absorption. “Absorption of serving ad hoc and temporary teachers is the only way in which posts can be filled ion a permanent basis at such a large scale in a short period,” said Mr. Ray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/duta-seeks-one-time-regulation-for-absorption-of-ad-hoc-teachers/article35949803.ece
