23 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Afghan Sikhs, Hindus among 392 airlifted from Kabul||India on Sunday airlifted 392 persons from Kabul in an operation that covered Indian citizens as well as Afghan nationals, including Sikhs and Hindus. Those airlifted were flown in on three aircraft, including a heavy lift C-17. Air India and Indigo operated two flights via Tajikistan and Qatar. The evacuation operation is expected to continue over the coming days. Apart from workers and engineers employed at various India-backed projects, the evacuees included an infant, Iknoor Singh, the youngest to be airlifted from Kabul so far. A number of workers from Darjeeling, who were stuck in Afghanistan, were also among those evacuated. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier urged the Centre for help in bringing them back.  The Hindu has learnt that the largescale evacuation was facilitated by a small multi-agency Indian team, now based in Kabul airport. The cell has taken charge days after Government of India evacuated its India-based staff from the Embassy in Kabul. The Ministry of External Affairs has not yet commented on this development. Initial reports suggested that the team consists of seven officials from different sections of the government and is led by Indian diplomats at the U.S.-controlled airport. MP among evacuees Among those evacuated was Narender Pal Singh Khalsa, a member of Afghanistan's Parliament, who said the Taliban have been undependable since they took over Kabul. “They came to my office on Saturday and took away my computers, official vehicles and other personal vehicles. They said they were there to take away my official car that was given to me as MP but ultimately took away many personal items, including three watches,” he said, adding that there are a large number of Pakistanis among the fighters. “Those who came to my house could not speak Farsi and spoke in Urdu. There were some who spoke a language that I could not even understand. It’s quite clear that they were either from Pakistan or some other country,” Mr. Khalsa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/afghan-sikhs-hindus-among-392-airlifted-from-kabul/article36052131.ece
23 August 2021||NEW DELHI/ BENGALURU,||FinMin summons Infosys CEO over I-T portal glitch||With the new Income Tax filing portal becoming completely inaccessible over the weekend and yet to become fully functional 77 days after its launch, a furious Finance Ministry summoned Infosys managing director and CEO Salil Parekh to explain the mess to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in person on Monday. “Ministry of Finance has summoned Shri Salil Parekh, MD & CEO @Infosys on 23/08/2021 to explain to hon’ble FM as to why even after 2.5 months since launch of new e-filing portal, glitches in the portal have not been resolved. In fact, since 21/08/2021 the portal itself is not available,” the Income Tax Department stated on Sunday. And just hours after the “summons”, the Income Tax portal became accessible again late on Sunday. “The emergency maintenance of the @IncomeTaxIndia portal has concluded and the portal is live. We regret any inconvenience caused to taxpayers,” Infosys tweeted at 8.52 p.m. The Ministry launched the “taxpayer friendly” portal developed by Infosys on June 7, promising immediate processing of Income Tax returns to issue quick refunds to taxpayers, and a host of other features. However, many critical functionalities were non-starters from day one, and problems continued to fester despite a claimed course correction. On Saturday afternoon, Infosys said the portal was “currently inaccessible due to planned maintenance”. On Sunday, the company switched from the “planned maintenance” argument to say that the portal “continues to be under emergency maintenance”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/i-t-portal-glitch-finmin-summons-infosys-ceo/article36052139.ece
23 August 2021||CHITTOOR,||APSRTC to resume services from Chittoor region to Tamil Nadu||The APSRTC will resume bus services to various destinations in Tamil Nadu from the depots of Chittoor region from Monday, after a four-month lull due to COVID-19 lockdown. Deputy Chief Traffic Manager (Chittoor) M. Bhaskar said that in Chittoor division, 61 bus services would resume operations to Chennai, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Krishnagiri, Gudiyattam and other destinations. ‘Appropriate behaviour’ “We have instructed the crew to focus on implementing the COVID-appropriate behaviour. The number of services will be altered based on the passenger traffic,” he said. The resumption of bus services from the Chittoor region to Tamil Nadu was much awaited as thousands of devotees from the northwestern districts of Tamil Nadu reach Tirumala on RTC buses, after alighting at Vellore, Chennai and other destinations. As the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) was continuing with the restrictions on the number of devotees being allowed for darshan, the APSRTC would monitor the pilgrim rush accordingly, the officials said. Similarly, hundreds of devotees from Chennai and other parts of Tami Nadu visit the Srikalahasti temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-to-ply-buses-from-chittoor-to-tn/article36051969.ece
23 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Taliban takeover disrupts trade; prices of dry fruits, spices soar||The collapse of the Afghanistan government and the return of the Taliban is already making itself felt in Bengaluru. With trade between India and Afghanistan coming to a halt, several varieties of dry fruits and spices are in short supply, and prices have skyrocketed ahead of the festive season. The price of Mamra almonds from Afghanistan, which were selling for Rs. 2,100 per kg in July, shot up to Rs. 3,800 as on August 22. The price of pine nuts and apricots has almost doubled, while Kabul black grapes, which were selling for Rs. 38-400 per kg a month ago, are now going for Rs. 780-800. The prices of dry fruit and spice imports have gone up in the range of 60 - 80%, if not more since July. Mohammed Idrees Choudhary, a prominent dry fruit trader in the city, who regularly imports dry fruits and spices from Afghanistan, said there were several hurdles put up for the movement of consignments as the Taliban occupied more territories over the last six weeks, but all trade completely stopped once Kabul fell on August 15. “Most of our high quality almonds, black grapes, pine nuts, anjeer, apricots and spices such as saffron, cloves and elaichi come from Afghanistan,” he said. The shortage comes even as more people are consuming dry fruits, “to boost immunity during the pandemic” and amidst Muharram and Deepavali season, said Javeed Sait, another dry fruit trader. “Other dry fruits like cashew nuts, pista and dates are sourced from India, Iran and the Middle East respectively and hence its prices are not affected,” he added. The situation is reminiscent of the last time the Taliban took over the country from 1996-2001. Our experience all those years ago may also hold the key to tide us over this crisis for the sector, traders said. “From past experience, we have seen that the dry fruits trade is very lucrative, and India is a big market for the Taliban to let go. We hope trade will soon restart soon,” Mr. Sait said. However, trade between the two countries may also be linked to whether India recognises the Taliban government. “During their previous tenure, India did not recognise the Taliban initially and that hit trade badly. But then too traders found ingenious ways which we hope will sustain us again,” Mr. Choudhary said. “During the Taliban’s previous reign, we used to get traders from Afghanistan to sell their produce to their counterparts in Pakistan or Tajikistan. They in turn would import spices and dry fruits to India. When relations between India and Pakistan were tense, traders from Afghanistan and Tajikistan would step in. However, though this ensures that supply is not disrupted, it adds to costs, he explained. For now, traders have no choice but to adopt a wait-and-watch approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/taliban-takeover-disrupts-trade-prices-of-dry-fruits-spices-soar/article36052181.ece
23 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Now, very heavy vehicles allowed on Shiradi Ghat||The Hassan Deputy Commissioner on Saturday allowed movement of very heavy vehicles via Shiradi Ghat on National Highway 75 through the restored road stretch near Donigal in Hassan district. However, all the traffic had to move in a single file on the affected stretch. All types of vehicles will be allowed during daytime, between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m, Hassan Deputy Commissioner R. Girish in his order said. Vehicular traffic was prohibited through Shiradi Ghat since July 22 after a landslip at Donigal. Later, vehicles up to 20 tonne gross weight were allowed to operate since August 16. The NHAI, which undertook restoration work, recommended to the Hassan district administration on August 19 to allow movement of very heavy vehicles through the stretch during daytime in a single file. Owing to heavy rain, the embankment of the highway near Donigal had witnessed large-scale landslip on the night of July 21. The Hassan district administration passed an order on July 22 prohibiting vehicular movement through the stretch. The highway stretch, earlier with the National Highways Division of the Karnataka Public Works Department, was handed over to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for four-lane work between Hassan and Maranahalli in Hassan district. Work on the four-lane road is progressing at a slow pace. Barring movement of heavy and very heavy vehicles for nearly a month has considerably affected trade and commerce activities in the coastal region as the national highway has been the lifeline of the region connecting it to other regions in the State. While light motor vehicles and heavy vehicles up to six-wheels were allowed to operate on alternative routes, including Charmadi and Sampaje ghat roads, operators of heavy goods vehicles bore the brunt as they had to take circuitous routes. The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry had urged the Union Road Transport Ministry to immediately restore the affected stretch so that trade and commerce activities in the region were not affected. After heavy vehicles were allowed through the stretch from August 16, drivers of hundreds of very heavy vehicles, both from Mangaluru and Hassan directions, made attempts to enter the Shiradi Ghat but were prevented by the police. Consequently, they lined up at Gundya in Dakshina Kannada and Maranahalli in Hassan districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/now-very-heavy-vehicles-allowed-on-shiradi-ghat/article36052554.ece
23 August 2021||Vijayawada,||AgriGold scam: Rs. 511 cr. to be paid to depositors tomorrow||MLC Lella Appi Reddy has said that the government is committed to its promise of compensating the loss incurred by the depositors in the AgriGold scam. Accordingly, it will credit Rs. 511 crore into the bank accounts of the depositors who invested up to Rs. 20,000, on August 24. The government has already given relief to the tune of Rs. 240 crore to those who deposited up to Rs. 10,000 in the schemes floated by the defunct company. Another important thing which the government planned to do is to take over the lands owned by AgriGold for the purpose of weaker section housing. Addressing media persons here on Sunday, Mr. Appi Reddy, the convener of the YSRCP AgriGold Victims’ Relief Committee, said Agrigold was established during the TDP regime in 1995 and the scam also came to light during Chandrababu Naidu’s rule. Though the firm was carrying out its operations without the RBI’s permission, the then government paid no attention to the irregularities, which eventually became a huge scam that involved 32 lakh investors, including 19.52 lakh in Andhra Pradesh, he said. Investments below Rs. 20,000 amounted to about Rs. 1,150 crore. Mr. Appi Reddy said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had released the welfare calendar in February 2021 and then itself made it clear that there would be another instalment of compensation paid to the Agrigold victims in August. However, the opposition leaders were trying to create panic among the victims, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/agrigold-scam-rs-511-cr-to-be-paid-to-depositors-tomorrow/article36052133.ece
23 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder faults comments of Sidhu’s advisers||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday took exception to the recent remarks of two advisers to Congress State president Navjot Sidhu Sidhu on sensitive national issues such as Kashmir and Pakistan. He said such atrocious and ill-conceived comments were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the State and the country. Capt. Amarinder urged Mr. Sidhu’s advisers to stick to giving advice to the PPCC president and not speak on matters of which they clearly had little or no knowledge, and had no understanding of the implications of their comments. The Chief Minister was reacting to reported remarks of Pyare Lal Garg questioning his (Captain Amarinder’s) criticism of Pakistan, as well as the earlier statement of Malwinder Singh Mali on Kashmir. Both of them were recently appointed by Mr. Sidhu as his advisers. Capt. Amarinder expressed shock at the statements of Mr. Mali and Mr. Garg, which he said were totally misplaced and antagonistic to the stated position of India and the Congress on Pakistan and Kashmir. “Kashmir was and is an inalienable part of India,” the Chief Minister said, adding that with his proclamation to the contrary, Mr. Mali had effectively and inexplicably toed Islamabad’s line. “This is totally anti-national,” he said, also slamming Mr. Mali for failing to withdraw his statement despite the widespread condemnation it had evoked. ‘Punjabis’ sacrifice’ Ridiculing Mr. Garg’s statement that criticism of Pakistan by him (Capt. Amarinder) was not in the interest of Punjab, the CM said Mr. Sidhu’s adviser was clearly disconnected from the ground reality. “The fact, which every Punjabi and in fact every Indian knows, is that Pakistan’s threat to us is real. Every day they are pushing weapons and drugs into Punjab via drones to destabilise our State, and our nation. Soldiers from Punjab are dying at the borders at the hands of Pakistan-backed forces,” he said. “Mr. Garg may have forgotten the thousands of Punjabi lives lost in the fire of Pakistan-backed terrorism of the 1980s and 1990s, but I have not. Nor have the people of Punjab. And we will continue to do everything in our power to fight off Pakistan’s dangerous games,” he said, urging Mr. Garg not to undermine the sacrifices of Punjabis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amarinder-faults-comments-of-sidhus-advisers/article36052595.ece
23 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Government to review COVID-19 situation||The State government will soon weigh whether to reintroduce certain restrictions lifted for Onam, including the weekend lockdown, given the continuous increase in COVID-19 cases in the State. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is currently in Kannur. An official said Mr. Vijayan was likely to take a call on the matter soon. Senior health, police and revenue officials are monitoring the pandemic situation actively. Meanwhile, the State continued to report one of the highest infection rates in the country, with the test positivity rate (TPR) touching 16.41% on Sunday. Active cases touched 1,63,212 on Sunday. A police official said there was a fear that the TPR may rise again and push the State back to another severe phase of the pandemic. The relatively low death rate, a high recovery percentage, and enhanced vaccination coverage were mitigating factors. Cause of concern Nevertheless, reports of increasing COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalisation in Ernakulam, Kozhikode and Palakkad remained a cause of concern. The government will examine whether to reimpose the weekend lockdown and night curfew eased because of the Independence Day and Onam holidays. Some officials felt the reintroduction of the restrictions were necessary to pre-empt another protracted lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/government-to-review-covid-19-situation/article36052477.ece

23 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder faults comments of Sidhu’s advisers on Kashmir||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday took exception to the recent remarks of two advisers to Congress State president Navjot Sidhu Sidhu on sensitive national issues such as Kashmir and Pakistan. He said such atrocious and ill-conceived comments were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the State and the country. Capt. Amarinder urged Mr. Sidhu’s advisors to stick to giving advice to the PPCC president and not speak on matters of which they clearly had little or no knowledge, and had no understanding of the implications of their comments. The Chief Minister was reacting to reported remarks of Pyare Lal Garg questioning his (Captain Amarinder’s) criticism of Pakistan, as well as the earlier controversial statement of Malwinder Singh Mali on Kashmir. Both of them were recently appointed by Mr. Sidhu as his advisers. Capt. Amarinder expressed shock at the extraordinary statements of Mr. Mali and Mr. Garg, which he said were totally misplaced and antagonistic to the stated position of India and the Congress on Pakistan and Kashmir. “Kashmir was and is an inalienable part of India,” the Chief Minister said, adding that with his proclamation to the contrary, Mr. Mali had effectively and inexplicably toed Islamabad’s line. “This is totally anti-national,” he said, also slamming Mr. Mali for failing to withdraw his statement despite the widespread condemnation it had evoked not only from other parties but also from the Congress. Ridiculing Mr. Garg’s statement that criticism of Pakistan by him (Captain Amarinder) was not in the interest of Punjab, the Chief Minister said Mr. Sidhu’s advisor was clearly disconnected from the ground reality. “The fact, which every Punjabi and in fact every Indian knows, is that Pakistan’s threat to us is real. Every day they are pushing weapons and drugs into Punjab via drones in a brazen attempt to destabilise our State, and our nation. Soldiers from Punjab are dying at the borders at the hands of Pakistan-backed forces,” he said. “Mr. Garg may have forgotten the thousands of Punjabi lives lost in the fire of Pakistan-backed terrorism of the 1980s and 1990s, but I have not. Nor have the people of Punjab. And we will continue to do everything in our power to fight off Pakistan’s dangerous games,” asserted Captain Amarinder, urging Mr. Garg not to undermine the sacrifices of Punjabis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amarinder-faults-comments-of-sidhus-advisers-on-kashmir/article36051925.ece
23 August 2021||New Delhi,||Afghan returnees to get polio vaccines||The Health Ministry has decided to vaccinate returnees from Afghanistan with free polio vaccines as a preventive measure, tweeted Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Sunday. . Providing details on why India is keen to vaccinate people returning from Afghanistan, a senior Health Ministry official explained that India received its “polio-free certification” along with the entire southeast Asia region on March 27, 2014. However, wild polio virus cases continue to be reported in neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan — the last two polio-endemic countries in the world. “Failure to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in as many as 2,00,000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world,” the World Health Organization (WHO) has noted. “Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only countries where wild polio virus is circulating and vaccination of those coming in [from Afghanistan] will ensure that people harbouring the virus will not be able to infect those around them. Afghanistan has suffered because of its compromised [disease] surveillance and healthcare system. The move by the government is vital in ensuring India’s status as a polio-free country,” said Lalit Kant, former head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research. COVID disruptions The WHO has said that if enough people in a community are immunised, the virus would be deprived of susceptible hosts and would die out. High levels of vaccination coverage have to be maintained to stop transmission and prevent outbreaks from occurring. Child vaccination drives, including polio campaigns, were halted in both Afghanistan and Pakistan in March 2020 to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission to children, caregivers, and the vaccinators themselves. According to UNICEF, polio immunisation campaigns were resumed in Afghanistan and Pakistan several months after COVID-19 left 50 million children without their polio vaccine. As a result, 34 polio cases were reported in Afghanistan, and 63 in Pakistan, in 2020, including in some previously polio-free parts of the country, UNICEF said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afghan-returnees-get-free-polio-jabs/article36051943.ece
23 August 2021||MOSCOW,||India signs deal for 70,000 assault rifles||With repeated delays in deals for the procurement of AK-203 assault rifles and Kamov-226 utility helicopters from Russia, India has signed a deal for 70,000 AK-203 assault rifles to be procured off the shelf, while the Army is also looking at procuring a limited number of helicopters the same way to meet an immediate shortage of light utility helicopters. Meanwhile, Russia has carried out upgrades of the Ka-226T helicopter on offer, according to officials. “The deal for the 70,000 rifles has been signed, but the first payment is yet to be made. The deliveries would begin within three months once the first payment is made and be completed in six months,” officials from India and Russia confirmed. On the Ka-226T “Climber”, as the upgraded version is referred to, an official from Russian Helicopters said the redesigned helicopter had improved flight and technical characteristics. The Army is looking at procuring over 7.5 lakh AK-203 rifles and the two countries had signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) in February 2019, following which a joint venture (JV) — Indo-Russian Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL) — was set up at Korwa in Uttar Pradesh for manufacturing the rifles. The JV is between the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) from the Indian side and Rosoboron Exports and Kalashnikov on the Russian side. The Army had also appointed a Major General as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of IRRPL to ensure timely execution and deliveries. The Defence Ministry had already floated a Request For Proposal (RFP) to the JV for the supply of 6.71 lakh rifles, but the final deal had been held up over the high cost quoted. There are two major changes in the Ka-226T helicopter, which include a change in the hull from composites to aluminium and a change in avionics, apart from several minor upgrades, said Vasily Grydin, deputy head of the commercial department, Ulan-Ude Aviation plant of Russian Helicopters, at the Army 2021 expo that began on Sunday. In 2015, India and Russia had concluded an IGA for at least 200 Ka-226T twin-engine utility helicopters estimated to cost over $1 billion. Sixty helicopters were to be directly imported and the remaining 140 manufactured locally by a JV, India Russia Helicopters Limited, set up between Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Russian Helicopters. However, the deal had been held up over the percentage of indigenous content, which as per the RFP, should reach 70% in phases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-signs-deal-for-70000-assault-rifles/article36051958.ece
23 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Fulfil Kalyan Singh’s dreams: PM||“To compensate” for former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, who died on Saturday evening at the age of 89, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, “We must make maximum efforts towards his values and resolution, and leave no stones unturned in fulfilling his dreams.” Mr. Modi was speaking at the residence of the former Chief Minister in Lucknow where he paid tributes to the senior BJP leader. BSP chief Mayawati was among other politicians who visited the former Chief Minister’s residence. Kalyan Singh, who served as the Chief Minister of U.P. twice, was the head of the government in 1992 when the Babri Masjid was demolished by a mob of karsevaks on December 6 following which his government was dismissed. Mr. Modi said Singh had provided meaning to the name given to him by his parents, Kalyan, which means welfare in Hindi. “He lived his life for jan kalyan (public welfare),” Mr. Modi told presspersons here. With Kalyan Singh’s death, the country lost a “valuable personality and a capable leader”, Mr. Modi said, adding that Singh would be admired across India. Singh’s mortals remains were later taken to the U.P. Assembly and the BJP State headquarters for people to pay homage before being taken to his home district of Aligarh. He will be cremated on Monday on the Narora ghat on the Ganga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fulfil-kalyan-singhs-dreams-pm/article36051931.ece
23 August 2021||Srinagar,||Hurriyat may face wrath of UAPA||A ban under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) may be imposed on both factions of the secessionist conglomerate, the Hurriyat Conference, which has been spearheading the separatist movement in Jammu and Kashmir for over two decades, officials said. A recent probe into the granting of MBBS seats to Kashmiri students by institutions in Pakistan indicated that the money collected from aspirants by some organisations that were part of the Hurriyat Conference conglomerate was being used for funding terror organisations in the Union Territory, officials said. Both factions of the Hurriyat were likely to be banned under Section 3(1) of the UAPA, under which “if the Central Government is of opinion that any association is, or has become, an unlawful association, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare such association to be unlawful”, the officials said. They said the proposal was mooted in accordance with the Union government’s policy of zero tolerance against terrorism. The Hurriyat Conference came into existence in 1993 with 26 groups, including some pro-Pakistan and banned outfits such as the Jamaat-e-Islami, the JKLF and the Dukhtaran-e-Millat. It also included the People’s Conference and the Awami Action Committee headed by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq. The separatist conglomerate broke into two factions in 2005, with the moderate group being led by the Mirwaiz and the hardline headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani. So far, the Union government has banned the Jamaat-e-Islami and the JKLF under the UAPA. The ban was imposed in 2019. The officials said a probe into the funding of terror groups indicated the alleged involvement of secessionist and separatist leaders, including members and cadres of the Hurriyat Conference, who had been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terrorist organisations such as the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), the Dukhtaran-e-Millat (DeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The cadres raised funds in the country and from abroad through various illegal channels, including hawala channels, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, they said. The funds collected were used for causing disruption in the Kashmir Valley by way of pelting stones on security forces, systematically burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India as part of a criminal conspiracy, they claimed. Supporting the case for banning the two factions of the Hurriyat Conference under the UAPA, the officials cited several cases related to terror funding, including the one being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in which several of the conglomerate's cadres were arrested and jailed. Many of the second-rung cadres of both the factions are in jail since 2017, they said. Among those in jail are Altaf Ahmed Shah, the son-in-law of Geelani; businessman Zahoor Ahmed Watali and Geelani's close aide Ayaz Akbar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hurriyat-may-face-wrath-of-uapa/article36051947.ece
23 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fourth evacuation from Kabul since 1992, but in different international climate||The evacuation of Indian Embassy personnel, including Ambassador Rudrendra Tandon, from Kabul is the fourth time India had to pull out all its diplomats from Afghanistan, but what has changed considerably now is how world players have dealt with the Taliban, say diplomats who recall the strong stand taken by the United Nations and various governments in the 1990s. In 1993, India decided to close the mission in Kabul after a rocket attack on the Chancery building killed an Indian security guard. Significantly, the Indian security official was killed when rockets were fired on Kabul by Hizb-e-Islami forces commanded by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is now one of the coordinating council members negotiating with the new Taliban regime. The mission staff, led by Ambassador Arif Qamarain, who had only been appointed two months before that, were driven in three buses to the Uzbek border town of Termez and flown out from Tashkent, after a joint decision by the heads of the Indian, Chinese, Turkish, Pakistani and Indonesian missions in Kabul that the situation was too volatile to stay. Hamid Ansari’s tenure His predecessor Ambassador Vijay Nambiar had been flown out of Mazar-e-Sharif with the help of Gen. Rashid Dostum in 1992, with the IAF operating two AN-32 aircraft that also flew out the Ambassadors of ASEAN countries and others. At the time, the Kabul Air Traffic Control had been destroyed by the Taliban, wielding U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft stinger missiles, and the IAF planes had loaded anti-missile flares just in case, but fortunately did not need to deploy them. The cooperation with Gen. Dostum had been secured during a special diplomatic mission by former Vice-President Hamid Ansari, who was then India’s Ambassador to Iran, and had previously served as Ambassador to Afghanistan, who carried humanitarian and medical relief to Mazar-e-Sharif. “While it is necessary to judge each situation anew, and decide India’s reactions to it, we may also remember the principle that a neighbour’s neighbour can often be a friend. Many Afghans feel the same way,” Mr. Ansari told The Hindu , when asked about the mission. In 1996, after opening the Embassy for about a year, India decided to close it again, when the Taliban entered Kabul and brutally murdered former President Najibullah and his brother, and then, more significantly, Northern Alliance forces led by Ahmed Shah Massoud retreated to the Panjshir valley. “We achieved the evacuation of the mission, which was quite small, along with the few other Indians present there quite painlessly, on an Ariana [commercial] flight,” recalls Vivek Katju, who was the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs at the time. “The difference between then and now, 25 years later, was that this time, the U.S., Russia, China and other countries have not shunned the Taliban, and in fact appeared to legitimise them by signing a deal with them, inviting Taliban delegations to their capitals, and holding talks with them in Doha,” he added. New Delhi too has not yet directly named the Taliban in its statements, or criticised its actions, possibly due to the ongoing evacuation of Indian nationals, and discussions with the U.S., Russia and China on the possible de-designation of various Taliban representatives at the U.N. Security Council, where India heads the Taliban sanctions committee. MEA’s stand Speaking at an event on Friday, Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla said that there was a “silver lining” in the Taliban’s statements seeking international legitimacy, in contrast to its previous regime in Afghanistan. The MEA had also sent a two-man delegation to Doha on August 12, for a meeting that included other countries, and the Taliban's representatives. Speaking in Parliament in 1996, however, then External Affairs Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, who became Prime Minister the next year, had said India would have no truck with the group. Subsequently the Indian government maintained the Afghanistan Embassy at its own cost, until the Taliban was defeated in 2001, and Hamid Karzai took over as President. During the 1996-2001 period, India had actively supported the Northern Alliance. India’s Ambassador in Dushanbe Bharathraj Muthukumar coordinated funds, supplies for them, contacting Massoud through Amarullah Saleh (President Ashraf Ghani’s Vice-President until a week ago), and is now a leader of the anti-Taliban resistance force regrouping in the Panjshir valley. It is clear that many of the leading figures that have dominated the Afghan landscape still remain in significant positions today. What has changed, however, is the immediate reaction of global players to the Taliban’s Kabul takeover nearly three decades on, even as India’s position remains to be spelt out in the weeks and months ahead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fourth-evacuation-from-kabul-since-1992-but-in-different-international-climate/article36051950.ece

23 August 2021||New Delhi,||Drug abuse on rise, will have huge consequences: HC||The Delhi High Court has observed that the menace of drug abuse was on the rise in the country and its consequences “can be experienced across the board from causing economic issues to societal disintegration”. Justice Subramonium Prasad made the remarks while declining the bail plea of a Nepal national who was caught with 475 g of charas here. “The harmful effects of drugs on an individual and on the society have been researched extensively and are well known... The purpose of enacting the NDPS [Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances] Act was to curb this menace,” Justice Prasad said. The High Court also noted that the accused, Madan Lama, being a citizen of Nepal, has no roots in society and can be considered a potential flight-risk. “Thus, he satisfies the factor that there exists the danger of him absconding or fleeing from justice, if released on bail,” the court said, adding, “Furthermore, if the petitioner [Mr Lama] is released on bail, it cannot be ruled out that he will not indulge in such activities again.”. On December 18, 2020, secretly provided information was received by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) that one Nepali national of small built wearing yellow-coloured clothes would be near Gate no.1 of the city’s Kailash Colony metro station, between 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., and that he might be carrying narcotic drugs for delivery to his client. An NCB team was formed to intercept the person. When the team was waiting near the said location, they observed that one person wearing a yellow sweatshirt matching the description in the tip-off was carrying a black shoulder bag. He met with another person wearing a black jacket. The person who was wearing the yellow sweatshirt handed over a small packet to the person who wearing the black jacket, who gave an amount of cash to the person in the yellow sweatshirt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drug-abuse-on-rise-will-have-huge-consequences-says-hc/article36051928.ece
23 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC expresses worry over false rape cases||The Delhi High Court has expressed worry that there is an “alarming increase” of false cases of rape being registered “only to arm-twist the accused and make them succumb to the demands of the complainant”. Justice Subromonium Prasad made the observation while rejecting a plea seeking to quash a first information report for the offence of rape, in which the parties pleaded that they had amicably resolved the issue and entered into a compromise. The court pointed out that the parties had registered cross-cases against each other for offences under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Aman Vihar police station here. “In the present case it appears that both sides have resorted to filing complaints of rape without having any sensitivity to the offence of rape,” Justice Prasad said. “Allegations regarding offences such as one under Section 376 IPC cannot be made at the drop of a hat — in order to settle personal scores. “...False allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused. The accused in a false case of rape loses his honour, cannot face his family and is stigmatised for life,” the High Court said. “False claims and allegations pertaining to cases of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Such litigations are instituted by the unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will capitulate to their demands out of fear or shame,” Justice Prasad said. “Unless wrongdoers are not made to face the consequences of their actions, it would be difficult to prevent such frivolous litigations,” the judge remarked adding that this problem could be solved, or at least minimised, to a certain extent, if exemplary cost was imposed on the litigants for instituting frivolous litigations. Justice Prasad said the time spent by the police in investigating false cases hindered them from spending time in investigation of serious offences. “It leads to faulty investigations and the accused end up going scot-free. Valuable judicial time is also spent in hearing cases,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-expresses-worry-over-false-rape-cases/article36051939.ece
23 August 2021||New Delhi,||3 parliamentary committees visit J&K in 10 days||Amid growing demands for the restoration of Statehood for Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh have been visited by members of three parliamentary committees in the past 10 days. These visits by parliamentary panels not only come two years after the bifurcation of J&K and the removal of its special status under Article 370, but barely two months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met 14 leaders from J&K, including former Chief Ministers Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Azad, and others, in June. And all three panels that visited J&K between August 14 and 22 are headed by leaders of the Congress that had opposed the manner in which the J&K’s special status was abrogated. Next month, the Standing Committee on Information Technology, headed by Shashi Tharoor of the Congress, is likely to visit J&K. On Sunday, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, headed by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma, wrapped up its six-day visit to the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. Before the panel on Home Affairs, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) headed by the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, too, visited Srinagar and Kargil in J&K, and Leh in Ladakh, to examine the issue of protective clothing for troops stationed at high altitudes. Members of the PAC discussed various aspects of security by visiting the Srinagar-based 15 Corps and the Leh-based 14 Corps of the Indian Army. In fact, Mr. Chowdhury unfurled the Tricolour on August 15 at Kargil with Indian troops. Another panel that visited Srinagar, Pahalgam and Gulmarg around the same time is the Committee on Subordinate Legislation, headed by the Congress’s Partap Singh Bajwa, to study waste management, rejuvenation of water bodies like the Dal Lake, and lending by banks to priority sectors, among other issues. However, the Parliamentary panel on Home had the largest number of interactions across three regions. “We met a cross-section of people, including elected representatives, and Block Development and District Development Councils,” Mr. Sharma told The Hindu . Asked about the demand for early restoration of Statehood, Mr. Sharma said, “Our committee’s report will reflect the views of the stakeholders.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-parliamentary-committees-visit-jk-in-10-days/article36051944.ece

23 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Meghalaya police play down letter on rifles||The Meghalaya police have played down an anonymous letter claiming that three INSAS rifles snatched from the police by masked teenagers on August 15 were thrown into a river flowing through Shillong, the State capital. Shillong had descended into chaos as officials observed the country’s 75th Independence Day. The trigger that day was the funeral of former extremist leader Cheristerfield Thangkhiew, who was allegedly killed in a fake encounter at his residence in the city’s Mawlai area on August 13. ‘Taken from teenagers’ The unsigned letter sent to the headman of Mawlai area, with a copy sent to the Superintendent of Police (SP), East Khasi Hills district, on August 20 claimed that the three rifles were taken from the teenagers and tossed into the Wahumkhrah river from a bridge that goes across it. “My friends and I came across a few youth carrying the weapons in the Lawmali area. We took the rifles from them after learning they were snatched from the police and threw the weapons into Wahumkhrah from the Umpohliew Bridge. This was done for the safety of the teenagers,” the unsigned letter read. ‘Search is on’ East Khasi Hills SP Sylvester Nongtnger made light of the letter. “Anyone can write an unsigned letter like that,” Mr. Nongtnger said, adding that his team was searching for the missing weapons. Three police officers from the Mawlai Mawkynroh outpost, who fled into a nearby forest after being attacked by a mob, were suspended for losing their rifles. The State government is initiating an inquiry against them. The miscreants who snatched the weapons also hijacked and vandalised an SUV in which some police officers were travelling. They drove the vehicle across the city before torching it. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma appealed to the unidentified rifle-snatchers to return the weapons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/meghalaya-police-play-down-letter-on-rifles/article36051966.ece
23 August 2021||Kolkata,||TMC takes out rally in Visva Bharati campus on Raksha Bandhan||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Sunday took out a procession inside the Visva Bharati University campus in Birbhum district on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. Carrying banners with photos of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee and its district chief Anubrata Mondal, several members of the party entered the varsity premises and marched to the heritage ‘Upasana Griho’. The development comes days after Mr. Mondal announced that the TMC would now organise functions inside the campus in response to district BJP leaders accompanying Union Minister of State for Education Subhas Sarkar during an official visit. TMC members and student supporters tied rakhis and sang songs composed by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who had founded the central university. Small flags of the ruling party were put up around the place, but no political slogans were raised. TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh said that since Visva Bharati doesn’t belong to any political party, there is “no harm” if members of any organisation visit the campus with the message of brotherhood and amity on the day of Raksha Bandhan. “The TMC has never meddled in the functioning of Visva Bharati,” he added. ‘Disregard for values’ BJP State spokesman Samik Bhattacharya, however, said: “If someone wants to flaunt power and show that he is superior in the land of Tagore, it reflects disregard for the visionary and the values espoused by the bard.” An official response from the university is awaited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tmc-takes-out-rally-in-visva-bharati-campus-on-raksha-bandhan/article36052507.ece
23 August 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||COVID-19 cases in minors near 1,000 in Odisha||With the total COVID-19 infections among those in the 0-18 age group approaching the 1,000-mark in Odisha since August 15, experts have advised the government to take a cautious approach towards reopening schools for regular classes for all students. Since August 15, 7,430 persons have tested positive for COVID-19, while 948 persons in the 0-18 years age group have been found to be infected. Infections among children accounts for 12.75% of the total number of infections. Till August 16, while Odisha’s total caseload was 9.96 lakh, only 41,946 children in the age group of 0-14 years were infected. The rate of infection was 4.21%. “The rate of infections in the below-18 years population in Odisha corresponds to the national average. The State does not have higher infections among children,” said Bijay Panigrahi, the State’s Director of Health and Family Welfare and head of Odisha’s vaccination drive. Though the Odisha State Commission for Protection of Child Rights recommended reopening of Classes 6 to 8 in a phased manner, the government is adopting a wait and watch policy. Now, schools are open for Classes 9 and 10 across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-cases-in-minors-nears-1000-in-odisha/article36051927.ece
23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Afghan Sikhs, Hindus among 392 airlifted||Stating that he had not seen Afghan Taliban among those present in Kabul, Mr. Khalsa said, “In my 36 years, I have never seen such Taliban fighters.” Mr. Khalsa is the son of Avtar Singh Khalsa, a dynamic Sikh politician of Afghanistan who was assassinated in Jalalabad in a suicide bomb attack in 2018. Apart from Mr. Khalsa, Dr. Anarkali Kaur Honaryar, the only female Sikh MP of Afghanistan was also among those who were airlifted to the Hindon air base. Dr. Honaryar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government of India for evacuating her family. Hundreds of others, however, were left behind even as the security situation of Afghanistan is expected to deteriorate due to the growing tension between Taliban leaders and the Tajiks of Panjshir Valley who are led by the faction of Ahmad Massoud and former Afghan vice-president Amrullah Saleh. A spokesperson for the Resistance told The Hindu that they require support of “allies” to take on the Taliban. “Taliban are trying to send delegations and as well use Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai to mediate between Resistance Leaders in Panjshir. The stance of the Resistance is clear. We have legitimate Caretaker President Amrullah Saleh who enjoys people’s support from Republic’s side,” said Homayon Ahmadi, the spokesperson. “If they opt for any military offensive, people are ready to defend their rights at any cost. We will be needing support from our allies, of course,” said Mr. Ahmadi who argued that the Resistance believed in ballots unlike Taliban that believed in bullets. ‘Man-made suffering’ Afghanistan’s Ambassador to India, who was appointed by the government of President Ashraf Ghani, also called for international support. In a message posted on social media on Sunday, Ambassador Farid Mamundzay said, “The avoidable suffering of Afghanistan is man-made and at a scale beyond all civilised contemplation. Afghanistan is going through a difficult time, and only good leadership, compassionate attitude and international support to the Afghan people would somewhat bring an end to these miseries.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afghan-sikhs-hindus-among-392-airlifted/article36051933.ece
23 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Trinamool eyes MP to expand clout in Assam||After reaching out to activist-turned-politician Akhil Gogoi, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has been angling for an MP to make inroads in Assam. Naba Kumar Sarania, a former area commander of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom, is a two-time MP, representing the Kokrajhar constituency since 2014. Though listed as an independent parliamentarian, he is the chief of the regional Gana Suraksha Party (GSP) that is said to have an influence among more than 15 non-Bodo communities in parts of western and north-central Assam. “The Trinamool has sent feelers and we will have a meeting in September. But people are jumping the gun by saying I have joined the party that rules West Bengal,” Mr. Sarania told The Hindu . The GSP is part of the alliance that ruled the Bodoland Territorial Council straddling 12 of Assam’s 126 Assembly constituencies. The BJP is the second largest party of the alliance headed by the United People’s Party Liberal. A few days ago, Mr. Gogoi said he had met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee twice in Kolkata after his release from jail on July 1. “I have been offered the leadership of the Trinamool in Assam but we have not decided whether our party will have a tie-up or a merger with the Trinamool,” he said. Mr. Gogoi is the president of the Raijor Dal and is an MLA from the Sibsagar constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-eyes-mp-to-expand-clout-in-assam/article36051938.ece

We regret the inconvenience,” the global IT major’s India business unit said on Twitter. Infosys didn’t respond to calls from The Hindu . However, the firm’s CEO is expected to comply with the Ministry’s ‘summon’ on Monday. The non-functioning of the portal is particularly embarrassing for the government as just last week, the Finance Minister had said all its glitches were expected to be fixed entirely in the ‘next two-three days’. Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj had been “neutrally monitoring the progress” on fixing the glitches and 10-15 taxation experts were working to engage with Infosys on a day-to-day basis, she had said. Ms. Sitharaman expressed regret about the new portal’s dysfunctional systems on July 28 and said the portal had been tried out before its launch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-t-portal-glitch-finmin-summons-infosys-ceo/article36051940.ece

23 August 2021||Pune,||Pune NGO Sarhad to help provide for 1,000 Afghan students in India||With Afghanistan in turmoil following the Taliban takeover, the Pune-based NGO Sarhad, which works for students living in conflict zones, has said it would “adopt” 1,000 Afghan students till the situation stabilised in their country. Sarhad founder Sanjay Nahar said he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the matter. Centre’s cooperation “While we have announced that we would be providing for the education, upkeep and livelihoods of 1,000 Afghan students, the task of selecting these students lies with the Central government. Accordingly, we have written to the Prime Minister seeking permission and cooperation to expedite aid,” Mr. Nahar said. Since the Afghan issue is a politically sensitive one, the NGO could not select students without the Central government’s permission, he said. “Without the selection of students, the humanitarian work we want to undertake cannot materialise. We are not asking for any financial assistance from the Centre, but a change in policy,” Mr. Nahar said while observing that the Afghan consulate in Mumbai had done little thus far to help its students. Sarhad said that it would also be helping Afghan students facing visa problems. Money deposited Sarhad has begun depositing small sums of Rs. 5,000 and above into the accounts of students who are not being sponsored by the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR). The Sikh community will be providing the students with scholarships named after Guru Tegh Bahadur, Mr. Nahar said. Of the estimated 5,000 Afghan students and nationals in the State, more than 1,300 are in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Less than 40% of them are sponsored by the ICCR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pune-ngo-sarhad-to-help-provide-for-1000-afghan-students-in-india/article36051945.ece
23 August 2021||New Delhi,||Malabar war games to begin on Thursday||The Quad countries — India, the U.S., Australia and Japan — will carry out the next edition of the Malabar naval exercise from August 26 to 29 off the coast of Guam amid mounting global concerns over China’s growing military muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific region. Indian stealth frigate INS Shivalik and anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kadmatt arrived in Guam, an island territory of the U.S. in the Western Pacific, on Saturday to take part in the exercise that would feature complex drills, Indian Navy officials said on Sunday. “The Malabar-21 will witness high-tempo exercises among destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters and long-range maritime patrol aircraft of the participating navies,” Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said. Expanding ties The exercise is taking place in the midst of growing convergence of interests in the maritime domain as well as military cooperation among the Quad nations in the face of China’s increasing assertiveness. Though the exercise is not part of the framework of cooperation under Quad, it is seen as a reflection of the increasing partnership among the four countries. Senior officials from the Quad nations held talks on August 12 on advancing practical cooperation to achieve the goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific. China has been suspicious about the purpose of the exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malabar-war-games-to-begin-on-thursday/article36051959.ece
23 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Women’s panel defends draft Inheritance Bill||The Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Women (APSCW) has defended a “contentious” Bill it has drafted for providing equal inheritance rights to women in the State. The panel has also advised critics to go through the draft Arunachal Pradesh Marriage and Inheritance of Property Bill, 2021, carefully before commenting, and give suggestions. Various community-based and students’ organisations as well as political parties in the State have slammed the draft Bill as “anti-tribal”, “anti-Arunachal”, violative of customary laws and an invitation to outsiders to take over tribal land through marriage. Members of the APSCW and the Arunachal State Commission for Protection of Child Rights had been working on the draft Bill. “It has taken years to draft it and was finalised after several awareness camps, discussions with community-based organisations and students unions,” APSCW Chairperson Radhilu Chai Techi told presspersons in Itanagar on Saturday. She said the opposition to the draft Bill was based on a clause that was redrafted long ago. A couple of new clauses deal with the rights of an Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APST) woman married to a non-APST man, she added. According to one of the clauses, such APST women shall enjoy the rights to any immovable property inherited from the head of the family in her lifetime. “The commission is not against any customary practices,” Ms. Techi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/womens-panel-defends-draft-inheritance-bill/article36051965.ece

The incident occurred on Friday evening, and the police registered a case on Saturday. Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi attended the wedding. When contacted, he acknowledged that the boy died while erecting a DMK flagpole. “The organiser has paid his family Rs. 1.5 lakh in compensation.” Police sources said the body of E. Dinesh, a Class VIII student of the Government High School in Villupuram, was sent to the Government Villupuram Medical College and Hospital for post-mortem examination and then handed over to his family. Municipal sources said the road was under the Highways Department. An application for the no-objection certificate for erecting flagpoles had to be sent to the Collector, who would forward it to the municipality for payment of charges. But no application was made, they said. Stalin’s appeal Following accidents caused by flex banners and flagpoles in the past, DMK president M.K. Stalin had appealed to party workers to avoid grandeur at political events. In 2019, a young woman died in Chennai when she fell from her scooter after an AIADMK flex banner crashed on her. The same year, another woman riding a scooter was severely injured in Coimbatore while trying to avoid an AIADMK flagpole.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/boy-electrocuted-while-erecting-dmk-flagpole/article36052314.ece
23 August 2021||Hassan,||Big win for women in battle against bottle||The women of migrating communities residing at Anche Chomanahalli in Kadur taluk of Karnataka have won their fight against the liquor shop at Bapuji Colony in the village. The Excise Department has ordered the shifting of the liquor shop, considering the objections raised by women belonging to Sudagadu Sidda and Hakki Pikki communities in the village. A.G. Girish opened the retail shop on July 6 this year. The women, all daily wage workers, resolved to fight against it the same day. Sixty-five of them staged a dharna for six days, foregoing their earnings. They did not give up the protest even when it rained heavily. After listening to the arguments from both sides, Chikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner of Excise K.K. Sumitha, on August 17, ordered the shifting of the shop within 60 days under the Karnataka Excise Act, 1967, which prohibits liquor shops within 100 m of a religious place, school, hospital, and SC-ST residential locality. The shop owner had argued that his shop was more than 100 m from the residential locality. HC judgment The High Court of Karnataka, in a judgment in 1997, had stated that when local residents are opposed to a shop, officials need not stick to the 100-m rule. “The owner offered free liquor to the men of the village to gain their support. However, the women continued their struggle. A meeting was held in the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Excise, where 80 women objected to the shop,” said C.K. Manjunath, a farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/big-win-for-women-in-battle-against-bottle/article36052506.ece

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Vyasa’s contribution||The Vedas are indeed infinite. The saying “Anantho Vai Vedaha” only indicates their limitless nature in terms of content and form. Just as the natural laws in creation have always been in place and no one can take credit for inventing them, the Vedas have always been in existence since time immemorial. They are held to be apaurusheya, meaning not made by any person. They are believed to be the very breath of the Supreme Brahman. Their greatness lies in their teachings that benefit humanity. In them man can find the ways and means to attain whatever worldly goals he desires and above all, the way to seek the ultimate goal, salvation. In a discourse, Sri B. Sundarkumar drew attention to the fact that Vyasa, whose original name is Krishna Dvaipayana, came to be known as Veda Vyasa owing to his role in arranging and classifying the Vedas into a comprehensive format. Vyasa was born in the beginning of Dwapara Yuga due to divine Sankalpa. Foreseeing that in Kali Yuga people will be short lived and their grasping power much reduced, he was concerned that they should not miss out on the benefits of the Vedas. But the Vedas were unwieldy as a huge mountain. So he divided them into four sections, the Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharvana Vedas. Each of them is self contained. Vyasa taught the Rg Veda to Pyler, the Yajur to Vaisampayana, the Sama to Jaimini, and the Atharvana to Sumantu. There is a difference between invention and discovery. Vyasa did not invent or create the Vedas. But he discovered their import and usefulness for mankind. So he organised and presented the same in simpler form. This is similar to the way in which for instance, man has tried to discover and understand the natural law of gravity and through effort and research has brought out the useful air plane||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vyasas-contribution/article36051951.ece

23 August 2021||New Delhi,||Petrol, diesel prices cut by 20 paise||Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 20 paise a litre on Sunday. It was the first reduction in petrol rate in over a month, and the fourth in case of diesel in less than a week. The petrol price in Delhi was cut to Rs. 101.64 a litre and diesel to Rs. 89.07, according to a price notification of State-run oil companies. The reduction came as international oil prices tumbled to their lowest level since May, after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled it was set to start tapering asset purchases within months, hurting commodities and lifting the dollar. The price cut in diesel is the fourth since August 18, when the reduction cycle began. All four reductions have been of 20 paise per litre each. On the previous three occasions when diesel rates were cut, petrol prices remained unchanged. Sunday’s cut in petrol price came after 36 days of status quo in rates. Petrol and diesel prices were last hiked on July 17. The freeze in rate revision coincided with the Parliament session, where the Opposition parties tried to corner the government on various issues, including the hike in fuel prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/petrol-diesel-prices-cut-by-20-paise/article36051936.ece

23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Projects to clean river mouths on hold||Crucial projects of the Water Resources Department (WRD) to prevent sand bar formation in river mouths and to reduce inundation have remained on paper for three years now. The major reasons are either a long wait for funding or an absence of committees at the district and State level to provide project approval. The department had proposed building a training wall at the mouth of the Ennore Creek to reduce sedimentation and minimise the risk of inundation in upstream areas. One of the early project proposals was made in 2017. Some of the key aspects of the holistic rejuvenation of the creek were dredging of the estuary for a length of 500 m, building straight training walls on the north and south sides of the mouth and demolition of old piers near Nettukuppam. Sources in the WRD said besides the pandemic, the project was still waiting to take off after approval from the district-level committee. The committee in the State Coastal Zone Management Authority, which would provide Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance, was yet to be formed. It is this body that recommends projects to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for approval. Researchers’ suggestion It may be recalled that researchers from IIT-Madras proposed a straight training wall as a solution to prevent flooding around the banks of Kosasthalaiyar river, which joins the creek. Sources in the WRD noted that a combination of boulders and tetrapods were proposed be used to build the wall to withstand strong wave action and provide better access to fishing boats. The Rs. 121.8 crore project is meant to be implemented in two phases. Similarly, a Rs. 70 crore project to construct a training wall to minimise sand bar formation on the mouth of Cooum river was also pending for two years now. The department planned to build a training wall to open the river mouth under the aegis of the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust. However, this project too is pending since the committee for the District Coastal Zone Management Authority is not functioning, sources said. For more than four years now, a project to restore the beach near the Shore Temple in Mamallapuram and reclaim the eroding shoreline also remains shelved owing to a lack of funds. It was submitted to the Central Water Commission for funding, based on a study by the National Institute of Ocean Technology. Similar projects proposed by the Greater Chennai Corporation had also been put on hold, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/projects-to-clean-and-keep-river-mouths-open-remain-on-hold/article36052260.ece

The State has recorded 26,00,885 cases so far. It took 48 days for the State to add another one lakh cases to its tally. The case count crossed 25 lakh on July 5. Fresh infections continued to fall gradually in the State. A total of 198 people tested positive for the infection in Coimbatore, when compared to 205 on the previous day. There were 177 fresh cases in Chennai and 146 in Erode. Thanjavur recorded 108 cases, while Chengalpattu and Salem recorded 96 and 82 cases respectively.

23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Jewellers in Chennai to go on token strike today||Jewellers in Chennai plan to down shutters for a few hours on Monday as a token strike against the process to provide hallmarking unique ID (HUID) for every piece of jewellery. The Chennai Jewellers’ Association plans to organise the protest, coinciding with the nationwide strike announced on Monday by the National Task Force on Hallmarking. About 7,000 shops will be closed between 9 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. on Monday. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) had made gold hallmarking mandatory from mid-June. One of the major challenges faced by jewellers, they say, is that they have to upload a six-digit HUID number, affixed to each hallmarked jewellery piece on the BIS portal. At a press conference held on Sunday, Udhay Vummidi, the association’s president, said HUID was provided based on tracking mechanism, and it did not have a link to ascertaining the purity of gold. It is a time-consuming process, and assaying centres do not have the capacity to hallmark jewellery. Earlier, hallmarking was done in batches. While jewellery stock waiting to be hallmarked was already piling up, the HUID process would only lead to further delay, affecting the sector. The new process, which also seeks customers’ details, could pose a threat to their rights, he said. Jayanthilal Challani, president, The Jewellers and Diamond Traders’ Association Madras, said nearly 25% of the 47,000 jewellers registered with the BIS belonged to Tamil Nadu. On average, each of the registered jewellers would have about 10 kg of gold jewellery waiting to be hallmarked. There was no clarity on the insurance factor of the jewellery given to assaying centres. The retail sale of gold ornaments improved by 10% recently after a steady dip in prices. The new hallmarking process would be detrimental to the industry, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jewellers-in-city-to-go-on-token-strike-today/article36052264.ece

In the standard operating procedure released by the Directorate of Public Health, only 50% of the students have been asked to be present on campus at a time depending upon the strength, and based on further instructions from the Department of School Education, schools can either implement a shift system or have alternate working days. “We are planning to have students on campus in a shift system — students of X and XII will have classes in the morning and students of 9 and 11 will have classes in the afternoon. We feel it would be better to have them come in regularly this way and ensure all safety norms are followed,” said G.J. Manohar, correspondent, MCC Higher Secondary School. While schools which have sprawling campuses can accommodate more than 20 students at a time either on their grounds or in other open spaces, smaller campuses and classrooms will throw up challenges since students have to maintain physical distancing. Staggered start “Given all these challenges, we feel that it is best for students to start off in a staggered way — fisrt Classes X and XII on campus and then the other two classes once a system is in place. Schools with smaller classrooms should have enough faculty members to teach two sets of students,” said S. Arumainathan, president, Tamil Nadu Students Parents Welfare Association. Calling for detailed instructions to be issued for rural and urban schools, he said the School Education Department had to separately address the needs of these students, ranging from transport to infrastructure, to ensure compliance with the safety norms. Lack of focus Schools reopened briefly for students of Classes X and XII this January, and then for Classes IX and XI. “Since students then were coming back to school after nearly 10 months, we initially had to pay attention to their concentration and motivation. Many students found it hard to focus and were not serious about their exams,” a government school teacher said. “This time too, we will have to start with motivating and encouraging the students instead of immediately proceeding with lessons. The School Education Department has given a syllabus for a bridge course, which will be very helpful for the students since they have missed out on classes for months,” said A. Ramu, State president, Directly Recruited Post Graduate Teachers Association. Several private schools are also planning to speak to the parents next week about the safety norms that will be enforced on campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-gear-up-for-reopening-likely-to-put-in-place-a-schedule/article36052238.ece
23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||24-hour vaccination centres in govt. hospitals from today||All government medical college hospitals in the State will have round-the-clock COVID-19 vaccination centres from Monday. The first such centre was opened at the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine on the premises of Directorate of Medical Services in Chennai on Saturday. Inaugurating the centre, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said similar centres would start functioning in all government medical college hospitals, and district government hospitals in districts that did not have government medical colleges such as Mayiladuthurai and Perambalur from Monday. In Chennai, round-the-clock vaccination centres will come up at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Government Medical College Hospital at Omandurar Estate, Government Royapettah Hospital, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital and Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. “Through this, the pace of vaccination will be faster and people can get vaccinated easily in Chennai,” he told reporters. The Minister said that persons who were employed and those travelling could utilise the facility. Individuals can approach these centres directly with proof of residence. Arrangements for observing persons after vaccination were made at these centres. 100% coverage In Pudukottai, 100% vaccination (administration of first dose) of the people with disabilities had been achieved, while Ariyalur had achieved 100% coverage of pregnant women, he added. “We have advised 100% vaccination in tourism destinations, particularly in all spiritual centres. Following this, vaccination has been expedited in many places. For instance, Kodaikanal is an important tourism destination where 100% vaccination has been reached. In Palani, we have achieved 98% coverage, and will reach 100% in one or two days. We are expediting the vaccination in Tiruvannamalai, Rameswaram, Nagore and Velankanni,” he said. The Minister said that so far, 100% vaccination had been achieved in over 60 villages throughout the State. On the occasion, Tamilnadu Foundation USA handed over medical equipment for hospitals to the Health Minister. He said the organisation had sponsored medical equipment worth Rs. 2.36 crore that would be provided to 15 hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/24-hour-vaccination-centres-in-govt-hospitals-from-today/article36052671.ece
23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A deadly bloom in Muttukadu Estuary||An excessive algal and plant growth in the Muttukadu Estuary, a process brought on by an increased load of nutrients, is posing a serious problem to the environment and fish species. Scientists at the Muttukadu experimental station of the Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture said fish had started dying due to oxygen depletion caused by a process called eutrophication. The mouth of the Muttukadu Estuary has been blocked by sand deposited by the high tides of the sea. Normally, the blockage would be removed by the Public Works Department in October, November and December. Local fishermen and government institutions operating near the lagoon complained that the stagnant water emitted a foul smell. A study published in the International Journal of Science Inventions Today on eutrophication explains how Microcystis aeruginosa, a species of cyanobacteria that can form harmful algal blooms, has affected the water quality of the Muttukadu backwaters. Threat to marine life “The bloom forms like a film on the water surface and reduces the water clarity and oxygen content. These algae produce hepatotoxin, called ‘microcystin’, which in high concentrations could be fatal to fishes, humans, birds and other aquatic organisms. “Pollution, like domestic and industrial wastes, affects the normal phytoplankton composition of the study area,” said one of the authors of the study, S. Vasudevan of the Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology, Faculty of Marine Sciences, Annamalai University, Parangipettai. The investigation also underscored the need for regular monitoring of algal bloom and physico-chemical parameters in the Muttukadu backwaters to conserve fishery resources and protect human health.

Citizens who helped people in distress during crises were honoured, and a Chennai Day anthem was released. ‘Ma Foi’ K. Pandiarajan, former Minister, said the city was home to rich history and culture, and the anthem captured its essence. “Each of the award winners is special. They truly represent the city as they bring to the fore the best aspects of humanity,” he said. Nivedita Louis, feminist and historian, said from arranging hospital beds to blood, the city’s youth had been out on the streets, be it the 2015 flood or the current pandemic. “They stand for the resilient, indomitable spirit of the city, and this is what we need to celebrate now,” she said. The award winners are Meena Sathyamoorthy (Women of Wonder Award), Karthik (Reading Ambassador Award), Sandhyan (Awareness Creator Award), Srivatsa Vema (Life Saving Leader Award), Sakira Banu (Super Social Woman Award), Gokula Rao (Rural Warrior), Arun Kumar (Annapoorna Award), Trans Community Kitchen members (Changemakers Award), Asha Bhagyaraj and Anita Raj (Group Magic Award) and Karthikeyan Imayavaramban (Eco Warrior Award).

23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Engg. colleges see drastic drop in campus placements||Campus placements at engineering colleges dropped drastically in the academic year 2020-2021, with only 59,494 students bagging jobs. This was the lowest since 2012-13 when 63,486 candidates were placed, according to data available with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). The data contradict what many engineering colleges have been maintaining — that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, companies came in droves to campuses for hiring. According to them, placements were particularly good in circuit branches and the IT sector. Enrolment drops Student enrolment also dropped when compared to the previous academic year, when colleges saw an additional 3,000 students take admission. However, some colleges said the placement scene was not too bad. T. Saravanan, principal of New Prince Shri Bhavani College of Engineering And Technology, said core sector companies did not come for recruitment. With construction activity getting hit due to the pandemic, there was no recruitment in the mechanical and civil engineering branches. However, even those students got placed in the IT sector, he said. Rajalakshmi Engineering College saw a record 1,375 offers from approximately 220 companies, said Philip Praveen, director of training and placement. “The distinct feature was that the average salary went up,” he added. Arun Ramaswami A., head of training and placement at Velammal group of institutions, said 1,200 students, or 90%, were placed with an average annual pay package of Rs. 4.54 lakh. Recruitment still on Most colleges said recruitment was still on. Anna University faculty said the pandemic did not impact recruitment in tier-1 colleges. The university coordinates with affiliated colleges to conduct State-level placements. Among the theories that are being floated is that students may have lost out since IT companies like TCS and Cognizant opted for a national-level recruitment process. Another suggestion is that the colleges may not have furnished all data required by AICTE. The council will permit a college to download the Extension of Approval certificate only if it provides the placement data. AICTE officials said the data uploaded on the website were based on what the colleges sent them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/engg-colleges-see-drastic-drop-in-campus-placements/article36052246.ece

The victim was identified as Monesh, son of Rajesh and a student of Class II at a private school. The school had been closed due to the lockdown. Fifty days ago, when Monesh and four of his friends were playing in the streets of the village, a stray dog bit them. The villagers reportedly beat the animal to death. A villager said while four of the boys were administered anti-rabies vaccines, Monesh’s parents instead took him to a man who practised herbal medicine. However, the boy started behaving abnormally a few days ago, and taken to the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children, Egmore. The victim’s health began deteriorating on Saturday, and he died without responding to treatment. His body has been handed over to the health staff of the Chennai Corporation for safe disposal at a burial ground in Mylapore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/7-year-old-from-village-near-poonamallee-dies-of-rabies/article36052253.ece
23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Successive nomination can help in insurance claim settlement||The COVID-19 pandemic poses a high life risk. In such a situation, it is possible to enrol three nominees in life insurance policies under the concept called successive or alternative nomination. Normally, the insured person gives the name of the nominee while enrolling for life insurance. When the insured person dies, his/her nominee receives the claim amount. However, they cannot use the claim amount unless they are a legal heir of the policyholder. In life insurance policies, the two common types of nomination are single nomination or joint/multiple nomination (in which the policyholder mentions how much of the claim money should go to each nominee). However, there is the third type of nomination called successive nomination or alternative nomination, which many are not aware of. There might be instances in which husband and wife would have put up each other as nominees. If both lose their lives to COVID-19, immediate claim settlement becomes difficult. In such a situation, proper evidence of title is required, and it is a cumbersome process. That is when the successive nomination can come in handy, said Mohan Prasad, an insurance adviser. “The successive nomination makes it possible to have three nominees registered. Under it, after the expiry of the policyholder, the first nomination will become operative. If the first nominee is not alive, the second nomination will become operative. If the first and second nominees are not alive, the third nomination will become operative,” he explained. Mr. Prasad pointed out that existing policyholders can switch their nominees to successive nomination. “It is the best solution to have a successive or alternative nominee to ensure an easy claim process for the rest of the family,” said Naval Goel, founder & CEO, PolicyX.Com, an online insurance marketplace. He argued that it is important to inform the insurance company of the expiry of the first nominee if it happens before the demise of the policyholder to avoid any hassle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/successive-nomination-can-help-in-insurance-claim-settlement/article36052256.ece

The Mettur Power Stations I and II, which have a capacity of 1,440 MW, have coal requirement of 7.18 million tonnes in 2021-22, according to data shared by Union Minister for Power R.K. Singh in the recently-concluded monsoon session of Parliament. The Thoothukudi power plant, which has a capacity of 1,050 MW, has coal requirement of 4.64 million tonnes for 2021-22, as per the data shared by Mr. Singh in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. Tangedco has a generating capacity of 1,830 MW in north Chennai and coal requirement of 16.34 million tonnes. Total power availability Tangedco-owned power plants have a capacity of 4,320 MW. Including the capacity of the Central generating stations and long-term and medium-term power purchase agreements, among other sources, the total power availability is over 18,500 MW. The current average power demand in Tamil Nadu is estimated to be 14,500 MW to 15,500 MW. The impact of the missing coal on generation has to be closely watched. However, Tangedco officials have ruled out any problems as of now, since the peak power demand is yet to cross 15,000 MW. The maximum demand met in Tamil Nadu was 16,151 MW on April 3, 2019. Last week, Electricity Minister V. Senthilbalaji said 2.38 lakh tonnes of coal were missing from Tangedco’s North Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTPS) at Athipattu in Tiruvallur district. He also flagged similar issues at the Thoothukudi and Mettur power plants, adding that an investigation was on.

23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Include kuruvai paddy, cow peas in insurance scheme’||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Sunday said that the Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme, which is being implemented in partnership with State governments to support farmers from natural calamities, must include kuruvai paddy and cow pea crops. The date of paying the crop insurance premium should be extended to August 31. In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that it was disappointing that the seasonal kuruvai crops have not been included in the scheme. “We are unable to predict when nature will fail us because of how we have been polluting it. The farmers, who depend on nature, are the worst affected. The farmers are worried that the scheme has not been announced for the year 2021-22.,” he said. While the State government has announced Rs. 2,327 crore, he said that farmers who grow corn, ragi, groundnuts, horse gram, banana, onions, potatoes and other crops grown in this season are included in the scheme, but the grains and crops such as cow peas being cultivated in the current season have not been included. The PMK leader said that kuruvai cultivators have enjoyed profits only for three years in the last nine years. “In the other six years, the farmers in the delta region have faced heavy losses. This is the reason for the increase in farmer suicides. When farming has become a sort of gambling, the government should not stop providing crop insurance,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/include-kuruvai-paddy-cow-peas-in-insurance-scheme-ramadoss-tells-state-government/article36052366.ece

23 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP does a balancing act in T.N. by making Ganesan Manipur Governor||By appointing party veteran L. Ganesan as the Governor of Manipur, the BJP high-command appears to have done a balancing act in Tamil Nadu, where there were murmurs about the old guard not getting its due in recent years. His appointment, insiders feel, could put to rest complaints that while relatively new entrants to the party were able to achieve a “meteoric” rise, the old hands, who built the organisation in a land dominated by the Dravidian parties, were not duly rewarded. Third from T.N. He is the third leader of the BJP from Tamil Nadu who has been honoured with the Governor’s post. Earlier, V. Shanmuganathan served as the Governor of Meghalaya before his resignation. Tamilisai Soundararajan who, as the party’s first woman chief in Tamil Nadu, tried to keep the BJP in the limelight but with nil electoral success, was appointed the Governor of Telangana months after she lost the 2019 Lok Sabha poll to DMK leader Kanimozhi. She is now holding additional charge as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. Her successor in the party, L. Murugan, who sought to create a buzz with his ‘Vetrivel Yatra’, was recently inducted into the Union Cabinet as the Minister of State for Fisheries and Information and Broadcasting, despite losing the Assembly election in Dharapuram. Incidentally, he was the party’s State unit chief for just over a year. The appointment of former IPS officer K. Annamalai as the BJP State president last month, less than a year after he joined the party, rattled seniors. Some of them felt that the party high-command was pandering to new entrants and political turncoats by giving them organisational posts, ignoring loyal workers. With Mr. Ganesan’s appointment, that criticism would now no longer be valid. RSS roots Mr. Ganesan, a native of Thanjavur district, has his roots in the RSS, and was sent to develop the BJP in the State in 1991. He also functioned as the general secretary and president of the State unit of the party. He was the vice-president of the BJP at the national level. In 2017, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh, following a vacancy caused by the appointment of Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson Najma Heptulla as the Governor of Manipur. “It is a strange coincidence that Mr. Ganesan also has become the Governor of Manipur [replacing Ms. Heptulla],” said V. Maitreyan, former AIADMK MP and a long-time associate of Mr. Ganesan while in the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-does-a-balancing-act-in-tn-by-making-ganesan-manipur-governor/article36052242.ece

The group, led by R. Surendran, commenced work on the walls in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board tenements near Vyasarpadi, with paintings inspired by sports. Mr. Surendran, a graduate of the Government College of Fine Arts in Chennai, who is now working in the cinema industry, said Corporation officials engaged them after seeing their artwork created in public places in Korukkupet. “I grew up in Korukkupet and love the place. In recent years, nearly seven Tasmac [liquor] shops are functioning in one particular stretch in the area, which is resulting in public nuisance, lack of hygiene and defacement of walls,” he said. As a measure to reclaim the walls, he and his juniors from college began painting them a month ago, decorating them with images of gods, hoping it would deter people from defacing them or urinating nearby. “This was noticed by some Corporation officials, who asked us if we could create artwork in other places with their funding. We readily agreed,” Mr. Surendran said. Meaningful art To signify north Chennai’s relationship with sports, particularly football and boxing, Mr. Surendran said they had chosen that as the theme for the walls in Vyasarpadi. “One of the highlights will be a portrait of Olympic medalist and boxing champion Mary Kom, which will be ready in a few days,” he said.

The revision is done annually on the basis of the wholesale price index. The rates for another group of plazas governed by a different set of rules are revised in April. “The revision at some plazas is between 7% and 10% of the current rates, and at some others, it is very minimal,” said Pavan Kumar, regional officer, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Asked about the rough behaviour of attendants at some plazas, he said they were being advised to remain composed and take the help of supervisors to resolve issues. Recently, an operator at a plaza in Puzhal hit a truck driver after the latter allegedly used expletives. “We are awaiting the CCTV footage of this particular incident,” Mr. Pavan Kumar said. Jude Mathew of the Tamil Nadu Independent Taxi Owners Association said this was not a lone incident. “Issues with FASTag continue to dog some people, especially now since the owners are getting their vehicles back on roads with the lifting of restrictions.

23 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore sees marginal dip in positivity rate||COVID-19 positivity rate in the district showed a marginal decline in the last fortnight since the administration imposed additional lockdown restrictions. District Collector G.S. Sameeran had imposed restrictions starting August 2 to contain the infection spread in the district. While restricting the business hours of commercial establishments till 5 p.m., he had also said that shops other than those selling milk, vegetables and medicines on Cross Cut Road, Gandhipuram 5th,6th and 7th streets, Oppanakara Street, Ramamoorthy Street, Saramedu Road, Rice Mill Road and N.P. Itteri Road, and at Thudiyalur Junction and Ellai Thottam Junction would remain shut on Sundays. This was to be in addition to what the State Government had said. In the fortnight, the positivity rate had comedown marginally from 1.99 to 1.93. The period also saw the number of cases come down from 226 to 205. Commenting the dip in positivity rate and positive case count, Mr. Sameeran said though both the indicators had declined during the additional restriction period, it would not be right to directly relate those to the additional restriction alone. “It is because of multifarious factors that there is a drop in both the indicators. The administration imposing additional restriction is one of them,” he said and added that the fortnight period was too small a period to comment on the dip, at least from the epidemiological point of view. During the period, the administration had increased the number of vaccinations a day, from 19,000 to 23,000. With the State Government announcing further relaxations to the lockdown, the Coimbatore district administration was talking to stakeholders – representatives from the traders’ associations, cinema owners’ association, hoteliers among others – to see if it should continue with the additional restriction or offer some relaxation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/district-sees-a-marginal-dip-in-positivity-rate/article36052290.ece

23 August 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||NABARD aid for integrated mangrove fishery farming system in Cuddalore district||The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has extended a grant of Rs. 24.9 lakh for a project on Integrated Mangrove Fishery Farming System (IMFFS) in Cuddalore district. According to a release, the project is being implemented by the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) and is aimed at enhancing the adaptive capacity of the fishing community. The project is being implemented on 2.1 hectares of land in Mudasalodai village by involving traditional and Irula fishers from Mudasalodai and Kalaignar coastal hamlets in Pichavaram. Under the integrated mangrove fishery farming system, mangroves are integrated with fish culture. “This is a new kind of farming system wherein conventional earthen aquaculture ponds are modified to provide about 30% of the area for raising mangroves and the remaining for fish cultivation,” said S. Velvizhi, principal scientist, Fish for All Research and Training Centre, MSSRF. The farms have been designed to be tidally fed, which makes them more environment friendly and profitable. The presence of mangroves would mitigate the impact of rising sea levels whereas the sustained harvest of fish would take care of the adaptive capacity of the coastal community, she said. The farm pond is designed in a mitochondrial pattern and is a tide-fed pond. NABARD Chief General Manager T. Venkatakrishna recently visited the project site and interacted with the stakeholders. Mr. Venkatakrishna also suggested that the MSSRF help the community members form farmers produce organisations. MSSRF could also train villagers in fish processing and seed production, he said. NABARD District Development Manager Vijay Neehar was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nabard-aid-for-integrated-mangrove-fishery-farming-system-in-cuddalore-district/article36052628.ece
23 August 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Dwarf calf turns a crowd-puller||A dwarf calf in Nallamputhur, a nondescript village near Kattumannarkovil in Cuddalore district, has been attracting people from various places. Many of them are taking selfies with the tiny bovine. The newborn calf is 32 cm tall (12.5 inches) and pictures of the calf on social media platforms have set off a frenzy among the locals. The calf belongs to Vijayan, a dairy farmer of Nallamputhur. The family has been unable to come to terms with the abnormal calf. Mr. Vijayan’s son Arivu Sudar said the family has three cows, and the female calf was born on August 18. “The bovine had already delivered two healthy calves. We were shocked on seeing her size and called up the Department of Animal Husbandry for help. The calf’s abnormal size has been hampering its movement and it has to be lifted to help it reach the udders to drink milk. We are now bottle- feeding her,” Arivu Sudar says. According to a veterinarian, “It is a case of genetic mutation and could be a problem of either the bull or the bovine.” In most such situations, the calf dies in a couple of days if it has other deformities. The calf has stunted growth and was unlikely to become any bigger, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dwarf-calf-turns-a-crowd-puller-in-cuddalore-village/article36052278.ece
23 August 2021||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Health issue behind death of four persons of family||The investigations into the death of four persons from a family in Vatha Goundan Valasu village near Palani in Dindigul district appears to be due to certain health issues. On Saturday, four persons - Chinnaraj (52), his wife Valarmathi (45), daughter Sivaranjini (20) and son Karthikeyan (18) were found charred to death in a haystack just near their dwelling. When firefighters were dousing the fire, they spotted the four people dead and burnt. Initial inquiries gave no clue as the police investigations revealed that the valuables inside the house were intact or at least not disturbed. Police officers said on Sunday that the family had not borrowed money from any person or finance company as suspected. Both the children were studying online due to the covid-19 pandemic, some relatives told the investigators. However, one officer said that Chinnaraj was not keeping good health for about six months after his son was diagnosed with kidney-related ailment. The family was in a depression and they were worried about the deteriorating health of Karthikeyan. According to post-mortem reports, the deceased had consumed poison an hour prior to the death. The bodies of two of them were completely charred in the fire. It is likely that Chinnaraj may have set the fire to the haystack after ensuring that the other three had taken the poison and died. Quoting a relative of Chinnaraj in the village, the police said that there was absolutely no sign or indicator from the family members about such a decision, who had attended a wedding function on Friday night at Velayathum Pudur. Ayakudi police have registered a case of suspicious death. After the post-mortem was performed, the mortal remains were handed over to the relatives at the Dindigul Government Hospital. Further investigation is on. Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State's helpline 104 and Sneha's suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-issue-behind-death-of-four-persons-of-family/article36052287.ece

All the cinemas in the city remain shut from the start of the second wave of COVID-19 in April.

M. Aadhavan, Manager with Priya complex, says, “Some new Tamil movies are ready for release and it will be confirmed by Wednesday. So we’ve planned to resume screening from Friday.” This four-day window will also allow cinemas to to do a thorough cleaning of their premises. “Seats must be sanitised and carpets need shampoo cleaning. A thorough overhaul of the premises will be done to make sure that the visitors feel safe. Almost all the employees have been vaccinated. Those who have not will not be allowed to work,” Mr. Aadhavan said. Three shows a day The cinemas have planned three shows a day as night shows are not permitted. K. V. R. Gajendran, treasurer, Tamil Nadu Film Exhibitors Association and owner of Midlaand Cinemas, says that cinemas had to be periodically cleaned even during lockdown. “We clean the halls almost every day and screen some trailers in the presence of just the staff to keep projectors, amplifiers and sound system in working condition. There is no clarity on whether to follow the old SOP issued when cinemas started functioning in last November. We will stick to functioning without air-conditioners and with 50% occupancy,” he says. Though it is unsure of drawing cine-goers right away, the movie industry pins its hopes on the festive season and the upcoming movies of big stars. V. Pandi, Manager with Thanga Regal, says, “Cinemas have not been doing well ever since COVID-19 entered the scene.

P R Vishwanath, who led the volunteers, said, “There are two ways to reach the Kasi Viswanathar temple. One can either climb through hilly terrain or take the steps cut on the granite. As the view from the top is breathtaking, a good number of visitors climb the hillock on any given day.”  This is the second phase of cleaning on the pathways. They had done a similar exercise two weeks back. Mr. Vishwanath said that the authorities should prevent visitors from taking disposable food products such as plastic water bottles and snacks packed in plastic bags at the entry point itself. Though there are dustbins on the hillock, people seldom use them, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garbage-removed-from-hillock/article36052370.ece
23 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Students behind burglary in liquor shop||Madurai district police have seized 1,270 liquor bottles out of 1,400 bottles that were taken away from a TASMAC-run IMFL retail outlet in Othakadai, with the arrest of two youths. The police said that a gang of eight persons, including four college students, were involved in the crime. The bottles were stocked in a house in Thoppur near Austinpatti. “We got the images of the accused through the closed circuit television camera network,” said Superintendent of Police V. Baskaran. The youths, who were also friends of the college students, had broken open the shop and took away cartons of liquor bottles. They had been selling the bottles in black market in the last few days. A phone conversation they had made from the scene of crime helped the police to trace them. “The two arrested – C. Sankar of Oomachikulam and Vijay, 24, – were first-time offenders. We are on the lookout for others, including the prime accused, P. Arun Kumar,” Othakadai Inspector A. Ananda Thandavam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/college-students-behind-burglary-in-liquor-shop/article36052546.ece
23 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry’s Ambitious tree planting drive enthuses the green brigade||While welcoming the recent initiative of the government to plant 75,000 saplings in Puducherry, environmentalists want the administration to put in place a proper mechanism to improve green cover. The government, at the instance of Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, launched a programme to plant 75,000 saplings, a majority of them on Forest Department land at Manapet. Inaugurating the programme early this month, Dr. Tamilisai had given a clarion call to the government to scale up the number of saplings to be planted to 7 lakh in the coming months. “Planting 75,000 saplings is an excellent initiative. Growing trees help keep the natural ecosystem rolling and displays commitment to ensure a healthy planet for future generations. However, with the planting of a seed or a sapling comes the responsibility of nurturing them. Therefore, it is vital to involve local communities so that they become the guardians of the saplings for two or three years till the sapling grows into a tree,” said Probir Banerjee of PondyCan. Studies reveal that had all saplings that were planted so far survived, they would have covered four times the country’s area. “Someone should conduct a study here to find the status of saplings planted in the last 10 years,” Mr. Banerjee said. According to environmental activist K. Ramamurthy, the exercise should not become a mere tokenism. Experience showed that saplings in residential areas and on the roadsides had either withered away or got damaged in a few months. “It is better to create a separate body, involving government officials, environmental activists, students, and representatives of corporate organisations, to monitor the growth of plants,” he said. Instead of planting trees on the roadside, the focus should be to increase green cover by growing saplings in government offices, educational institutions, on temple land and in poromboke areas, he said. The former Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests P. Devaraj said any success of tree plantation depended on community participation. Reward and punishment should go hand in hand. People should be rewarded for protecting the trees and punished for cutting them down or damaging the saplings. Selection of species He stressed on the need to select the species properly. On narrow streets and lanes, tall branching trees should be avoided. Branching of trees at a low height would hinder movement of vehicles. Trees with heavy foliage should not be planted in windy areas as they get uprooted by strong wind.  Deputy Conservator of Forests Vanjulavalli Karthik told The Hindu that planting of 75,000 saplings had been done in a planned manner. “This exercise was more voluntary as several departments and agencies came forward on their own. A majority were planted on our land. So there is no question of them being neglected. We have our staff to take care of the plants,” she said. Ms. Karthik said the species had been selected carefully. Saplings of fruit trees were given to self-help group members, and those given to the Public Works Department were shade and timber trees. “Even on our land, we chose forest trees, which are more rain fed. Some of the species do not need watering after six months,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ambitious-tree-planting-drive-enthuses-the-green-brigade/article36052625.ece

23 August 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen allege attack by Lankan Navy team||Six fishermen from Rameswaram, who were fishing near Katchatheevu, were allegedly attacked by Sri Lankan Navy personnel on Saturday. Speaking to reporters in Rameswaram on Sunday, Kingson, one of the fishermen, said over 500 mechanised boats with around 2,000 fishermen had set off to the sea on Saturday. When he and five others on a boat were fishing near Katchatheevu around 3 p.m. on Saturday, Sri Lankan Navy personnel who came there on a surveillance boat pelted them with stones and chased them away, he said. Apprehending arrest by the Sri Lankan Navy personnel or attack with deadly weapons, the fishermen hurriedly left the spot. Mr. Kingson said the six fishermen managed to reach ashore safely in his boat. Only less than a month ago, two fishermen from Mandapam were attacked by Sri Lankan Navy for allegedly having entered their territorial waters. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic threat, the Lankan Navy personnel, instead of arresting the ‘tresspassing’ fishermen and seizing their boats and fishnets, had been pelting them with stones and empty bottles. This was really shocking, Sesu Raja, a fishermen leader, said and urged the Union government to convey their disapproval to the Sri Lankan government. At a time when the fishermen had been fighting to get better prices for their catch, demanding subsidy for diesel and financial assistance from the government in view of the pandemic, such threats to their lives had only worsened their prospects, Mr. Sesu Raja added. When contacted, a Fisheries Department official in Ramanathapuram district said they would hold an inquiry with Mr. Kingson about the incident and submit a report to the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-allege-attack-by-lankan-navy/article36052274.ece
23 August 2021||RAMESWARAM,TAMIL NADU||A sea of opportunity waiting for the taking||It has not been a very rough sailing for S. Muneeswari’s family during the past one year, though her husband’s income as a fisherman has been sporadic. For 12 years she and her group of friends in Vedalai, a coastal village in Mandapam, have been cultivating Kappaphycus alvarezii (red algae). But it was when the COVID-19 lockdown was announced that these women realised the potential of this seaweed. It kept their families afloat, and the medicinal value that the seaweed is packed with, including its immune-boosting property, necessary to fight coronavirus, was brought into limelight. In 2021, the Centre allocated Rs. 637 crore as subsidy support for cultivation of seaweeds as part of the Rs. 20,050-crore Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). This helped in boosting cultivation of seaweeds, started on an experimental basis by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Mandapam, in 2003-2004. During this period, Pepsico, under its corporate social responsibility initiatives, joined hands with the CMFRI to promote seaweed cultivation in Rameswaram. Jayakumar, Principal Scientist of ICAR-CMFRI, Mandapam, says as the cultivation was less labour-intensive and less technology-driven, it has helped empower almost 600 women. As the sea is shallow in these parts, the CMFRI trained the women in bamboo raft method of cultivation. The raft has bamboo poles measuring 12 feet X 12 feet as main frame and 4 feet X 4 feet for diagonal frame. At the bottom of the raft is a fish net of 4 feet X 4 feet size to keep fish from grazing. Twenty polypropylene ropes are tied to the main frames and as many weed fragments are tied on a single rope. Under the subsidy scheme, SC/ST and women farmers get Rs. 900 for each bamboo raft which costs about Rs. 1,500. Once ready, this floating field is anchored at a depth of 1 to 1.5 metres in the sea with a 15 kg anchor which can hold a cluster of 10 rafts. No feed is necessary as the weeds thrive on the nutrients available in the sea. Harvest takes place after 45 days and till then the women separate other algae that may have got attached and remove strands grazed by fish. Once harvested, the scorching sun dries up the weed in two days. It is sent to private units like Aquagri in Manamadurai where carrageenan is extracted. This extract is a gelling and thickening agent that is mainly used in food, pharmaceutical and even cosmetics industries.  Not a foreign species  Today, this red algae, which was once seen as a foreign species invading Indian waters, is also an ingredient for various ‘nutraceutical’ products being manufactured by the ICAR-CMFRI, Ernakulam. A prime candidate for export, but as B. Johnson, Scientist, ICAR-CMFRI, points out, “we need to promote this more, for what we produce now is not even enough for the domestic market.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-sea-of-opportunity-waiting-for-the-taking/article36052362.ece

23 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine hesitancy: fear of stigma, side-effects grip transgenders||Transgenders in Tiruchi remain hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine due to apparent lack of awareness and fear of stigma and side-effects. Several transgenders live in constant fear of the virus as well as the vaccine as they do not know how their bodies will react to it. Many of them, who take various kinds of treatment, believe the vaccine will react and cause side-effects. “The fact that we were not included in the trials held for the vaccination makes our fears valid,” a transwoman from Srirangam said. Some have silicone implants, which, they believe, may affect their health when the vaccine is injected. Only 300 transgenders have taken the jab, while at least 2,000 are yet to take it, officials said. Health officials have not made any effort to help dispel their fears, the transgenders allege. “Not many transgenders in Tiruchi have been affected by COVID-19, and those who have contracted it have not suffered severe health effects. This might also be a reason for the hesitancy,” the transwoman said. P. Kajol, former member, Tamil Nadu Tansgender Welfare Board, says some members of the transgender community are afraid that if they fall ill, nobody will take care of them. “Many of them live alone and do not have any relatives. They are afraid of falling sick,” she points out. Another section of the community, who live with their families without revealing that they are transgender, are afraid that getting the vaccination may cause them to be ostracised. “Many have told me that they live with their families and that they would be sent away from home if their parents or relatives find out. In case of side-effects or reactions to the vaccine, we will have to reveal that we are transgender due to which they may get in trouble,” Ms. Kajol said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-hesitancy-fear-of-stigma-side-effects-grip-transgenders/article36052351.ece

23 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||AUT deplores delay in settlement of salary dues of guest lecturers||Espousing the cause of guest lecturers and non-teaching staff in the new government arts and science colleges that were erstwhile constituent units of Bharathidasan University, Association of University Teachers (AUT) has urged the Government's intervention for payment of salaries for May, June and July. In a press release, S. Balamurugan, State general secretary of AUT, deplored the delay on the part of the university in settling the salary dues of 363 guest lecturers, 205 part-time lecturers and 51 lecturers appointed by parent-teacher associations despite a directive issued by the Higher Education Department on July 30. The Higher Education Ministry had advised State Universities to settle the pending salaries of guest lecturers with an assurance that the expenditure on that account would be re-imbursed. Bharathidasan University was not complying with the government directive, he said. To bring the issue to the attention of the government, the affected teaching and non-teaching staff and the members of AUT would send SMS alerts on Monday (Aug.23) to the Chief Minsiter, Higher Education Minister, Secretary of Higher Education, Director of Collegiate Education and BDU Vice-Chancellor. In the event of non-response, AUT would conduct a protest in front of the office of the Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education in Tiruchi on August 26, demanding immediate settlement of the dues. As in the case of lecturers in other government colleges, those in these 10 colleges must be paid Rs. 20,000 as monthly salary in accordance with a goverment order, with effect from January, 2021. The salary dues and the arrears must be paid at the earliest, Mr. Balamurugan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aut-deplores-delay-in-settlement-of-salary-dues-of-guest-lecturers/article36052359.ece

23 August 2021||TIRUVANNAMALAI,TAMIL NADU||Six tribal children rescued in Tiruvannamalai||Six tribal children of the Jawadhu Hills were rescued by a Childline team in Tiruvannamalai on Sunday, barely a week after the rescue of four tribal children in the district. Interestingly, all these children are from the same village, Nammiyampattu, in the Polur taluk. Childline officials said they got an alert in the afternoon about six boys waiting with an agent at the Polur bus terminus. After informing officials of the District Child Protection Unit and the National Child Labour Project, a team, led by district coordinator A.R. Ashok, rushed to the bus terminus and spotted the children with Perumal, the agent. With the help of the Polur police, the team rescued all the six boys. However, Perumal escaped on seeing the team. “All the rescued boys are school students. They have been rehabilitated at the district reception house by the child welfare committee,” said S. Murugan, Project Director, Childline. All the rescued children were being taken to work on cotton fields in Kallakuruchi district after their parents were paid Rs. 1,000 each. Officials said poverty and labour migration were the major reasons for child trafficking in the Jawadhu Hills. The abled men go to Kerala and Karnataka to work as wood-cutters, leaving their families to fend for themselves, making it easy for traffickers to trap children. Along with other students, those who were rescued on Sunday had received government school kits a week ago. Child traffickers are booked under Section 79 (whoever engages a child in bondage for employment) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. Childline officials said that even parents could be found liable because trafficking could not happen without their knowledge. ( Childline operates a toll-free helpline 1098 for children in distress across the country. )  All the rescued boys have been rehabilitated at the district reception house by the child welfare committeeS.

23 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Political activities gain pace in all major parties in Belagavi||With the announcement of elections to the Belagavi City Corporation Council, political activities have gained momentum in all major parties in the city. Polling, scheduled for September 3, promises to be different as this is the first time in decades that the urban local body polls will be contested on party affiliations. The BJP was the first to declare that it will fight the polls based on party ticket. State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel and other party leaders held a meeting with city unit leaders a week ago. Member of Legislative Assembly Abhay Patil, who inaugurated the campaign office at Goaves here on Sunday, expressed the confidence that the city’s Mayor and Deputy Mayor will be from the BJP. The Janata Dal(S) then said that it will field candidates in all the 58 wards. Aam Aadmi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party also made similar announcements. There are reports that the AIMIM will field its candidates, though there is no official announcement yet. The Congress was the last to make the announcement. The party leaders held several meetings with local leaders. Senior leaders B.K. Hariprasad, Syed Nasir Hussein, L. Hanumantiah and M.B. Patil held four meetings with Satish Jarkiholi, Lakshmi Hebbalkar, Firoze Sait and others. KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi announced on Saturday that the party’s first list of probable candidates will be out by Monday, giving them enough time to campaign. To a query, he said that the Congress will not entertain leaders who are likely to defect from the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti. “We will not give ticket to any candidate who wants to fight polls on linguistic lines, whether they are followers of the MES or not,” Mr. Jarkiholi said. Observers say that the central point of the polls will be the influence that the MES will have on the minds of the voters. The MES has been playing a key role in the elections to the city corporation and the erstwhile Belagavi Town and City Municipal councils since the 1950s. In the last council, the MES won over 60% of the seats. Its influence on the voters had forced the other parties to abandon their symbols and encourage their candidates to contest as independents. The MES is a single-agenda party that has been demanding the merger of Marathi-speaking towns and villages, in all border districts from Belagavi to Bidar, into Maharashtra. MES leaders Prakash Margale and Shubham Shelke, who addressed a media conference in Belagavi on Sunday, argued that the MES will continue its winning streak. “We have not suffered any disadvantage with the increase in the number of wards,” Mr. Margale said. “We will win over 45 of the 58 seats,” he said. Mr. Margale dismissed reports that the rise of the BJP and increased awareness among young people had led to a reduction in the influence of the MES over voters in the city. “Far from it, we are seeing an unprecedented support among young people to the Marathi cause,” he said. Mr. Shelke said that the influence of the MES is already visible. “Everyone knows we are winning. We are already seeing strong candidates from national parties seeking our ticket. There is no way our activists will go to the Congress or the BJP seeking ticket,’’ he said. Mr. Shelke, a young Marathi activist, had managed to get over one lakh votes in his fight against Mangala Angadi of the BJP in the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypolls.  Observers say that the central point of the polls will be the influence that the MES will have on the minds of the voters, as it has been playing a key role in the local elections since the 1950s||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/political-activities-gain-pace-in-all-major-parties-in-belagavi/article36052400.ece

23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Idol makers stare at financial distress for a second year||With the government ordering a ban on large-scale gatherings ahead of Gowri-Ganesha festivals, idol makers are facing financial distress for a second consecutive year. Prior to the pandemic, shopkeepers in the busy lanes of Malleswaram and other parts of the city would have already stocked up on idols in various hues, and taken orders and advances from customers. But with fears of a third wave, and the government’s ban on cultural gatherings, shopkeepers have not procured any Ganesha or Gowri idols so far, though Ganesh Chaturthi is less than 20 days away. V.B. Babu, whose family has been selling idols for the past 40 years, said that a month before the festival, at least 500 idols would be pre-booked. “This year, I am yet to place an indent for the idols. I will be getting idols that are less than 3-ft tall only next week,” he said. Another seller, K. Shankar, said the festival celebrations were likely to be low key, given the restrictions put in place by the State government. “Several families have lost loved ones to COVID-19 this year, and may choose to not celebrate the festival,” he said, adding that he still had unsold stock from last year. While these idol sellers see business at least twice a year during Ganesha and Navaratri festivals, for many idol manufacturers, Ganesha and Gowri festival is the only time they make some profit. However, major idol manufacturers on R.V. Road claimed that nearly 40 lakh worth idols remained unsold from last year. D.L. Suresh, an idol manufacturer who also has a shop in Gandhi Bazaar, claimed that there had been nearly 75% drop in business over the past two years. “Following the outbreak of the pandemic last year, we were pushed to the brink of financial distress. Our financial condition has only worsened this year,” he claimed. M. Thirthagiri, proprietor of Sri Vinayaka Enterprises, told The Hindu that pre-booking of idols was nearly nil this year. “We are making changes to the unsold idols from last year in the hope that at least this year, we will be able to clear the stock,” he said. Mahesh R., an artisan who used to make only idols earlier, has now diversified. In his rented workshop on MVIT–Thimmasandra Road, near Devanahalli, he makes kitchen utensils, water jugs, and other fancy items. “After the first lockdown, the government announced some relief on repayment of loans. During the second lockdown, no such measures were announced. With no sales, we had to make loan repayments. It was difficult to pay rent even,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/idol-makers-stare-at-financial-distress-for-a-second-year/article36052189.ece
23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State increases testing to keep test positivity rate under 2%||With Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai making it clear last week that restrictions will have to be re-imposed and school reopening will have to be put off in districts where the test positivity rate (TPR) is above 2%, district authorities are now under pressure to increase daily testing. This has been increased, especially in the border districts, and daily tests are now ranging between 1.5 lakh to 1.79 lakh in Karnataka. While 1.79 lakh tests were conducted on August 18, 1.76 lakh, 1.73 and 1.57 lakh tests were conducted on August 19, 20 and 21, respectively. What is TPR? TPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people who are found to be infected from those who are being tested. According to epidemiologists, a high positivity rate indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. Over 81% of the total 4,18,39,866 tests conducted till date have been done using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. Sources in the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) told The Hindu that officials were compelled to conduct more tests to keep the TPR under 2%. “The CM’s direction is now working as an in-built pressure wall in the district health system to increase tests. If a particular district is forced to re-impose these restrictions in case TPR goes up, it will not augur well with the public. Also, it will indicate that the district is not monitoring the situation effectively,” sources said. Eight districts Karnataka’s average TPR in the last seven days (prior to August 20) is 0.9%. While eight districts have a TPR higher than the State average, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kodagu have the highest TPR - 3.24%, 2.84% and 2.23% respectively. The test positivity rate is inching towards 2% in Chikkamagaluru and Hassan that now have a TPR of 1.72% and 1.61%, respectively. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said the only way to keep TPR under check is to increase tests. “The State has been consistently doing over 1.5 lakh tests daily for the last 15-20 days. The daily tests had reduced considerably during the lockdown period as people were not coming out to get tested,” he said. Pointing out that at least 10% of the daily tests should be focussed on children in the 0-18 years group, Dr. Manjunath said that special attention should be given to children as this age group is likely to be hit the most during the third wave. He added that it is now vital to continue the same pace of testing for another 4 to 5 months. What is R number? TAC member V. Ravi, who is also the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said, “If the TPR goes beyond 5% and the Reproductive Number (R No.) crosses 1, the doubling time will reduce drastically. R No. describes how many people each infected person will infect on an average and if this goes beyond one, it will be very difficult to control the situation. It will indicate the beginning of another wave,” he said. “It is for this reason that we had suggested during the Chief Minister’s meeting last week that at least 20 contacts should be tested for every positive case (1:20). As of now, 10 contacts are being tested,” he pointed out.  The State has been consistently doing over 1.5 lakh tests daily for the last 15-20 days. Daily tests had reduced considerably during the lockdown period as people were not coming out to get tested. C.N.

23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Crop insurance: Farmers may get right to object||As several disputes have arisen over crop insurance, specifically with regard to the extent of yield, a proposal has been made to give the right to file objections to farmers, empowering them to protect their interests. At present, in the insurance scheme under the Karnataka Raitha Suraksha Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, only insurance companies have the right to file objections to the “crop-cutting exercise” that is very crucial in determining the yield and, thereby, the insurance amount. Similarly, at the district level, the District Planning Officer can file objections to the outcome of the exercise on behalf of the State government. Mistakes galore “Many instances have been reported in the State where wrong entries have been made during the crop-cutting exercise, bringing down or increasing the average yield, which is important for crop insurance. It is only fair that the farmers who opt for the scheme and pay premium amount get a chance to file objections if such circumstance arise,” a senior government official told The Hindu . “These mistakes in entry could be deliberate, or in a number of cases they might have occurred during manual entry into the app. To maintain the sanctity of the process, nobody can make changes. In serious cases, the crop-cutting exercise results could be cancelled or the process repeated,” the official said. Apart from instances of wrong entry on yield, mistakes on whether land is irrigated or rain-fed, mix-up in plot numbers, or even improper procedures followed during the crop-cutting exercise have been reported. “In several instances, it has been reported that the primary worker in charge of the crop-cutting exercise had made entries without even visiting the farmer’s field due to absence of GPS. Large-scale manipulation was found in Kalaburagi recently. In Vijayapura, Rs. 6.5 crore was released after an official inquiry. All this could hurt a farmer when he claims insurance,” the officer said. When wrong entries were made, farmers could complain to the authorities about the discrepancy on receiving the insurance amount, compared to what a neighbouring farmer had got. “It was a cumbersome process and there was no guarantee that farmer’s claim would be honoured,” said the officer. Notifying results In light of these problems, it is now proposed that the respective gram panchayats notify the results of the crop-cutting exercise, based on which the farmer can file objections. “By following proper procedures, a decision on the matter can be taken by the district administration,” said the officer. However, the government is also worried about opening the floodgates for complaints, which can prove a nightmare for the district administration that is already burdened with other work and shortage of personnel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/crop-insurance-farmers-may-get-right-to-object/article36052212.ece
23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Missing woman reunited with family after 16 days||Raksha Bandhan on Sunday was extra-special for one family after the Amruthahalli police traced a relative whom they had reported missing 16 days ago. The police organised a reunion, where the woman tied a rakhi around her brother’s wrist, after which a cake was cut at the station. Deputy Commissioner of Police (north-east) C.K. Baba, who supervised the search operation, said, “A coordinated effort with multiple people for 16 days and across 100 km finally helped us to find the missing woman. We thank everyone involved, including a couple of Good Samaritans.” On August 6, the Amruthahalli police received a complaint from Vivek Addi that his mother, Rimi, who had gone to Aster CMI Hospital to visit a relative, was missing. She hails from Ranchi and had come to the city to visit her brother, who works with an online retail platform in Bengaluru. According to the police, she was wearing 100 grams of gold jewellery at the time she went missing. The police gathered CCTV camera footage and saw that she was riding pillion on a motorcycle heading towards Esteem Mall. The police further checked the CCTV camera footage from in and around Veerannapalya, Govindapura, and K.G. Halli where they spotted her taking lifts from different motorists. The police printed pamphlets and distributed them across the city and also at railway stations and bus stops. “We checked around 50 old age homes and tapped the local intelligence network,” said the police. On Sunday, their efforts paid off. A few citizens reported that a woman matching Rimi’s description was seen living outside a temple on Magadi Road. A police team that went to the spot were relieved to find that it was Rimi. “Despite the fact that she was alone, and wearing gold jewellery, she was safe. Many people tried to help her,” the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/missing-woman-reunited-with-family-after-16-days/article36052202.ece
23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fuel costs, poor ridership deter RTCs from running AC buses||The high price of fuel, coupled with poor patronage, is proving to be hurdle for road transport corporations (RTCs) which have scaled operations of high-end and luxury buses. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which has a fleet size of 860 air-conditioned buses, is currently running only 40 odd buses, while the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is running only half of the 400 AC buses in its fleet. Shivayogi Kalasad, MD of KSRTC, pointed out that corporations have been operating at a loss since the pandemic last year. Though the second wave appears to be easing, ridership remains low. “As a result, we are forced to take every possible measure to bring down losses. Corporations are paying Rs. 89 per litre of diesel, and the operational cost is very high. We have no option but to rationalise our service. KSRTC is operating wherever there is demand,” he said. Despite taking such drastic measures, while operating an AC bus, the corporation is still incurring a loss of Rs. 10-15 per km. According to Mr. Kalasad, all the four corporations are spending Rs. 3,000-3,500 crore per year for fuel. They are bracing themselves for further expenditure due to the constant rise in fuel cost. Within the city limits, BMTC, too, has taken to rationalising resources. Of it’s fleet of 860 AC buses, it is operating only 42 to Kempegowda International Airport, Bannerghatta Zoo and Wonderla Amusement Park. It has completely stopped operations of AC buses within city limits. “AC buses give a mileage of hardly two km per litre. Considering poor occupancy and fuel prices, we have completely stopped services in the city limits,” said a BMTC official. A majority of the buses have been parked at the department for nearly a year and a half. BMTC spends Rs. 50 lakh a month on their maintenance. Prior to the pandemic, BMTC would sell around 2,000-3,000 monthly passes for commuters using AC buses within the city limits. “Now we have stopped issuing monthly passes, barring those to the airport,” said the official. Salary likely this week The cash-strapped RTCs are waiting for the State government to release salaries for July. RTCs required nearly Rs. 360 crore per month to pay staff their salaries, and had sought 75% funding from the State government. While employees have expressed unhappiness over not getting salaries in time, especially during the festive season, Mr. Kalasad said the State government is likely to release funds this week. Buses to Tamil Nadu from Monday After a long gap, KSRTC has received a green signal to run buses to Tamil Nadu. From Monday, the corporation will run 250 buses to various destinations such as Hosur, Vellore, Madurai and Chennai. Bus services to Tamil Nadu were stopped on April 27. The resumption of services will come as a huge relief to hundreds of people who commute regularly between the new States. In its absence, they had no option but to get down at Attibele checkpost, cross the border, and board another bus.  AC buses give a mileage of less than two km per litre. Considering poor occupancy and fuel prices, we have completely stopped services in the city limits.

23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Man held in Bengaluru for printing fake visas||A man from Kerala was arrested for allegedly printing fake visas at his house at Talaghattapura on Saturday. The accused, Nipun Venugopala C., 28, from Malappuram, used to work as tout and procured seats for students hoping to enrol in professional courses under the management quota. “But due to the pandemic, for the last year and a half, his business dried up. He decided to make a quick buck by offering to print fake visas to people for anywhere between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 lakh,” said the police. He found customers, some even from neighbouring States, who were willing to courier their passports to him so that he could print fake visas. But his neighbours started getting suspicious after they noticed a rise in the number of couriers he began receiving over the last three months. “Police sub-inspector Prabhugowda Patil received a tip-off from his source that a particular house was getting too many parcels in a day. After following up on the lead, a police team raided the house and found a large number of fake visa seals, passports, visa documentation, a laptop, printer, and other material,” said a police officer. The accused would download copies of different visas, print them and paste them on the passports. “He knew that customers would spot the difference, and was planning on escaping with their money,” the officer added.

23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘JD(S) planning padayatra after legislature session’||Saying that the Janata Dal (S) would start padayatras after the legislature session to fight for various State issues, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Sunday said the party would be fighting on the Krishna, Mekedatu, and Mahadayi river issues. “The Chief Minister has said he would speak to his party leaders in Maharashtra on Krishna and resolve the problem. If the problem is sorted out, then it is good. Otherwise, we will start a padayatra from the Krishna basin,” Mr. Gowda told presspersons here. “The JD(S) will be fighting for the issues on the Upper Krishna Project, Mekedatu, and Mahadayi rivers. After the padayatra, we will take a delegation to the Prime Minister. In case the State government takes a delegation, our party is willing to join it.” He added that he would symbolically participate in the padayatra for a day. “I will be part of the struggle, but given my old age I cannot participate in the padayatra completely. The fight will be led by [former Chief Minister] H.D. Kumaraswamy,” he said. The padayatra will commence after the legislature session ends and will continue till the next legislature session, scheduled in November, the JD(S) patriarch said, adding that he would travel to every district to strengthen the party. “People think we are restricted to the Old Mysuru region. When I was Chief Minister, our legislators had won from Hyderabad Karnataka region too. I will decide the districts that I will be travelling to,” Mr. Gowda said. He claimed that the Congress and BJP do not fight on these issues though they have formed governments. “What has the BJP government done over the last two years? The Centre has delayed the Mekedatu project under pressure from Tamil Nadu,” he said. Referring to Opposition parties coming together against the Narendra Modi-led NDA, Mr. Gowda said that regional parties were strong in their respective States. “I am not sure about the nature of leadership against Mr. Modi. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is also fighting Mr. Modi, should moveforward,” he said. The former Prime Minister also expressed disappointment over the manner in which the recent Parliament session was conducted. “Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to speak in the fight between ruling and Opposition parties. I am deeply disappointed about it. According to me, the Parliament session was a waste. None of the issues concerning the common man were discussed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-planning-padayatra-after-legislature-session/article36052215.ece

23 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police to crack down on vendors using microphones||Police Commissioner Kamal Pant has directed police personnel to keep a check on noise pollution and crack down on push-cart vendors using microphones to sell their wares. This decision was taken after residents, during an online grievance meeting on Saturday, said the noise was proving to be a nuisance not just to senior citizens but also to the children who have to attend online classes at home. “I have directed jurisdictional police stations and the patrolling police staff to ensure that vendors do not use microphones and disturb the peace,” said Mr. Pant. He also promised to take action against towing vehicle staff after residents claimed they slap hefty fines without following protocol. Before seizing a vehicle, they have to make an announcement, but this is rarely done, resulting in clashes between residents and towing teams. Just recently, a towing vehicle team was attacked by people at Indiranagar. Residents suggested the police opt for a contactless fine system and slap notices on illegally parked vehicles instead of towing them away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-to-crack-down-on-vendors-using-microphones/article36052200.ece

23 August 2021||Bengaluru/ Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Many Afghan students in Karnataka want Indian visas for their parents||In the midst of the evacuation of Indians stranded in strife-torn Afghanistan after the Taliban took control, Afghan students in Karnataka have made special requests to Indian authorities. About 40 Afghan students in the State have approached the State government seeking its help in securing Indian visas for their family members so that they can migrate here. “Everyone is worried. About 40 Afghan students studying across Karnataka have approached the State government seeking help to secure visas for their families. Since all these come under the purview of the Ministry of External Affairs and the visa process has been made online, we have asked them to seek online visas,” Additional Director-General of Police (CID) Umesh Kumar, the State’s nodal officer on the Afghan issue, told The Hindu . He also said that they had received requests from Afghan students, who have been enrolled in educational institutions in Karnataka, but are currently stranded in their country, seeking help to come here. According to the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO), 339 Afghan students are currently in Karnataka. The bulk of them are in Bengaluru (202), followed by Mysuru and Mangaluru with 64 and 35 students, respectively. Ramanagaram has 25 students, Hubballi-Dharwad 10, and Raichur and Davangere have two and one, respectively. “Apart from students, there are some Afghan nationals who are working in Karnataka,” Mr. Kumar said. He also said that an estimated 300 persons from Karnataka have so far returned from Afghanistan. “There are many more who have settled there but are willing to stay back. We do not have their numbers.” Safe return Meanwhile, Abdul Sattar, father of Tanveen Abdul, a 24-year-old woman from Ballari who was settled in Afghanistan with her Afghani husband Jalal Hashmi for the last three years, confirmed that his daughter had safely returned to India. As per information provided by the Ballari police, Ms. Tanveen, a native of Sandur in Ballari district, married Mr. Jalal met in 2016 when they were studying at an engineering college in Bengaluru. They got married in 2018 and left for Afghanistan. Considering the Taliban’s advances in Afghanistan, Ms. Tanveen contacted her father before the Taliban’s takeover of the country and expressed her desire to come back to her native place. Mr. Sattar immediately contacted the Indian Embassy in Kabul with the help of authorities in New Delhi. “We don’t know when she will reach Ballari. Considering the COVID-19 guidelines in force, she may be asked to get quarantined for 14 days,” said Chidanand Rao, Inspector of Police, Special Branch. Among the others from Karnataka returning to India are those employed with the ground handling agency at the Kabul airport, Mr. Kumar said. “The company is making arrangements for their return home. Others will make their own arrangements,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-afghan-students-in-karnataka-want-indian-visas-for-their-parents/article36052214.ece
23 August 2021||Benglauru,KARNATAKA||E-commerce boom sees demand for warehouse spaces rise in city||The pandemic brought about many sweeping changes in people’s lifestyles, including a heavy dependence on e-commerce platforms, more so during the lockdown. And Bengaluru, playing host to many e-commerce giants, has seen a corresponding demand for warehousing space. The real estate sector, which took a severe beating like most others, is expressing increasing interest. A warehousing facility is an infrastructure/domestic area for storage, sales, and distribution of goods, which reduces end-to-end transit time and supply chain costs. Suresh Hari, chairman, CREDAI Bengaluru, told The Hindu that ever since online activity and web-based merchandising started, warehousing demand had increased. Divergent requirements “Since the pandemic, it has grown more rapidly, but with divergent requirements — storage of company stocks to enable easy delivery to the nearest consumption areas; distribution of stock and commodities from another city/State/country for further distribution; smaller entrepreneurs who do not have storage space, and protection of stocks from damage and pilferage,” he explained. These facilities enable small manufacturers to keep stock in a centralised location for easy distribution and at the same time keep manufacturing activity continuing, he added. Monica Matthias, director, Hoysala Projects, said warehousing was slowly growing due to e-commerce giants setting up offices in Bengaluru. Since the pandemic began, the warehousing segment had seen an increasing demand in Bengaluru. “I have seen emerging trends in warehousing demands post COVID-19 lockdowns. Real estate players are continuing to add more supply in 2021 to meet the needs of increasing e-commerce demand in India,” she said. Asked what is contributing to this demand, she explained: “The demand is predominantly due to the booming e-commerce industry in Bengaluru. Existing players are looking to expand and new e-commerce players are entering the market due to the increase in online shopping induced by COVID-19 lockdowns. Also warehousing has become a promising investment opportunity for institutional investors.” She said expecting high spurt, developers were acquiring land on the outskirts of Bengaluru to develop warehouse spaces. Bommanahalli, Bommasandra, Yelahanka, Nelamangala, and the Hoskote–Doddaballapur belt are seeing a lot of warehousing spaces primarily due to availability of large land parcels. ‘Has remained resilient’ Farook Mahmood,founder and chairman emeritus, FIABCI India, said Bengaluru’s warehousing market had remained resilient in the face of challenges thrown at it by the pandemic due to “strong occupier interest on the back of consumption-led demand from this vast metropolis”. Key warehousing clusters — Nelamangala–Dobbspet cluster in the city’s north-west and the Hoskote–Narasapura cluster in the east — have become a cynosure in the eyes of occupiers, he said, adding that a strong consumer base coupled with government measures in the form of GST had already facilitated a steady infusion of industrial and warehousing parks in the Bengaluru Metropolitan Region (BMR) in the past few years. “Key manufacturing hubs next to the National Highway 4 provide port connectivity via Mumbai and Chennai and are much sought after warehousing belts in the region today. Additionally, the southern belt of Attibele–Bommasandra is also an emerging warehousing location to cater to the nearby tier-II and -III towns,” he said. According to Mr. Mahmood, while demand in other commercial real estate segments had been impacted in the last few quarters, the warehousing market had emerged as a standout led by e-commerce and third-party logistic growth. “This is largely attributed to a sudden surge in the need for extra storage/warehousing space by many occupiers during the first wave. E-commerce accounted for 22% share; however, it is evident that the real pent-up demand from e-commerce giants is yet to translate into new warehousing space take-up once decision-making is fast tracked. Retail and FMCG accounted for 5% and 4% of the space consumed respectively,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/e-commerce-boom-sees-demand-for-warehouse-spaces-rise-in-city/article36052191.ece

23 August 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||HKCCI seeks Centre’s assistance for Kalyana Karnataka region||Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HKCCI), a body of industrialists and traders from Kalyana Karnataka region, has demanded that the Union government extend its financial assistance to Kalyana Karnataka along the lines of other regions that had been given Special Status under various clauses of Article 371 of the Constitution. HKCCI president Prashant Mankar and secretary Sharanabasappa Pappa recently submitted a memorandum to the Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, New and Renewable Energy Bhagawanth Khuba demanding financial assistance to the region. “The Union government has accorded Special Status to Kalyana Karnataka region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution. The Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB) has been carved out, out of this Special Status. Similarly placed regions of Vidarbha in Maharashtra and Telangana State, which have been accorded Special Status have been sanctioned central Assistance by the Union government. But the same central Assistance is not extended to KKRDB. To ensure effective development of the Kalyana Karnataka Region, we feel that the Union government should extend Central assistance to KKRDB,” Mr. Mankar and Mr. Pappa urged in the memorandum. They also demanded that the Union government sanction Special Economic Zones (SEZ), particularly pharma-specific SEZs, to the region. “The development of Kalyana Karnataka and eradication of poverty in the region can be effectively addressed if the government establishes a set of SEZs, more particularly relating to the pharma sector. The neighbouring State of Telangana has 63 SEZs in the periphery of Hyderabad city. We very specifically request [you] to sanction pharma SEZs in all the districts of Kalyana Karnataka to address the problem of industrial development in the region,” they said. The office-bearers of the trade and industry body reminded the Union government of the Railway Division that it had sanctioned seven years ago and demanded that it implement the project. “The Justice Sareen Committee recommended the establishment of Railway Division in Kalaburagi in 1984, along with 38 railway divisions across the country. Almost all railway divisions recommended by the committee have been established. But Kalaburagi Railway Division had to wait till 2013 when the then Railway Minister announced sanction for the establishment of a Railway Division in Kalaburagi on the floor of Parliament,” they said. “That apart, the foundation stone was laid at Wadi Junction Railway Station in the same year by the then Railway Minister in the presence of the then Chief Minister and also Chairman of Railway Board. This was followed up by the acquisition of 42 acres of land in Kalaburagi for the purpose. A Special Officer was also appointed to oversee the establishment of the Railway Division. The Special Officer prepared and submitted a detailed Railway Division projects, including estimates, to the Railway Board. The board approved the project and estimates and also identified the jurisdiction of the Kalaburagi Railway Division in its meeting held on April 30, 2014,” they said. “Except for fencing the land acquired, no visible action has been taken to establish the Railway Division at Kalaburagi so far. In the absence of a Railway Division at Kalaburagi, the region of Kalyana Karnataka, from the point of view of railway amenities, is fragmented and distributed among five railway divisions. And, a railway commuter has to move around these five divisions for resolution of one railway problem, if any,” they said. “That apart, Kalaburagi and Wadi railway stations contribute a lion’s share of revenue to the existing Sholapur railway division. In view of these ground realities, we seek your intervention to take up the establishment of Railway Division in Kalaburagi,” they said. Their demands included upgradation and development of the existing ESIC Medical Complex in Kalaburagi into a medical facility of the level of AIIMS, night landing facility for the airport, a mega textile park, the commencement of cargo services from Kalaburagi Airport, the establishment of an industrial corridor in Kalaburagi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hkcci-seeks-centres-assistance-for-kalyana-karnataka-region/article36052398.ece

23 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mangalore University to create awareness on NEP next week||With Mangalore University gearing up to introduce the National Education Policy (NEP) in the academic year 2021-22, which will commence in October, it will organise an awareness programme on the new policy for all stakeholders next week. Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan will address the stakeholders. Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya told The Hindu that the programme will be organised at Town Hall here either on August 30 or August 31, while ensuring adherence to COVID-19 protocol. The permission of the Deputy Commissioner will be obtained before organising the programme. He said that representatives of student bodies, college principals, chairpersons of all boards of studies, chairpersons of all post-graduate departments, teachers and civil society members will be invited to the programme. The Vice-Chancellor said that if the policy is to be implemented effectively, it needed cooperation from all. The stakeholders will have to shed the complacent attitude and negative mindset. “Implementation of the policy is the key. And, hence, there is a need for a change in mindset,” he said. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the new education policies introduced in 1968 and in 1986 could not fulfil their objectives effectively due to the tardy implementation process and a mindset that refused to change. A key feature of the new policy is that it gives students the options for entry and exit at various stages. Students can get a certificate after a one-year programme, an advanced diploma after two years of study, a Bachelor’s degree after three years and a Bachelor’s with research after four years of study. There will be a one year’s masters programme and also, an option to opt for two years masters programme. One can register for research (Ph.D) after four years of study, the Vice-Chancellor said. There is a provision for studying online courses during the course of regular study and earn academic credits. The multiple entry and exit options in the undergraduate level will make a lot of difference for students during their course of study. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the task force and the sub-committees formed in the university have prepared the skeletal framework of syllabi immediately required for one-year (for two semesters) and have also prepared the model regulations needed to introduce the courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangalore-university-to-create-awareness-on-nep-next-week/article36052565.ece
23 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||This picturesque village is in dire need of infrastructure||This landmass of over 300 acres surrounded on three sides by the Souparnika could have been an attractive tourist destination with vast extents of paddy fields, coconut groves and river channels; but for all-weather roads and a minor bridge. Welcome to Hadavu hamlet in Nada-Padukone village under Byndoor Assembly constituency where about 250 families with a population of around 1,500 live primarily on agriculture. Located a stone’s throw away from National Highway 66 along the famous Trasi-Maravanthe beachfront, the locality is separated from the mainland by the Souparnika. The bridge Though a bridge across the Souparnika near Maharajaswamy Varahaswamy Temple of Maravanthe constructed by then MLA K. Gopal Poojary in 2017 provided connectivity to Nada-Padukone, interior roads, including that of Hadavu, have remained in a pathetic condition. A minor bridge across a channel between the Souparnika on the eastern and western sides collapsed during last year floods; the makeshift bridge has been nightmare particularly during heavy rains, rues Girija Shedthi, a resident. The roads inside the hamlet were not good either as the residents were forced to wade through rainwater and slush, she lamented. Ramu Poojary, who was returning from the Hadavu Milk Society after filling milk cans on Friday morning, said residents of the hamlet raise paddy crop despite all the odds and also depend upon dairy farming. The least they asked for was pucca roads, he said. Ms. Shedthi said patients were ferried through boats to the mainland for want of good roads in the hamlet. Healthcare facilities Mary D’Souza, an Accredited Social Heath Activist (ASHA) in the locality, said infrastructure woes have affected healthcare facilities too. Former MLA Gopal Poojary had also promised to get a ring-road constructed connecting the Maravanthe-Padukone main road. Three years on with the new MLA, nothing has happened, she regretted. Lack of funds Harish, Panchayat Development Officer of Nada Gram Panchayat, said the panchayat has written to jurisdictional MLA and the MP seeking funds for the reconstruction of the collapsed minor bridge that was estimated to cost around Rs. 10 lakh. Though a ring road was planned earlier, the same could not be constructed for want of funds. If grants were made by the MLA or the MP, the road too would be constructed, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/this-picturesque-village-is-in-dire-need-of-infrastructure/article36052571.ece
23 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Foundation stone laid for Jalasiri overhead tank||Mangaluru South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath on Saturday laid the foundation stone for an overhead tank at Shaktinagar for supply of round-the-clock water to residents under the Jalasiri project. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Kamath said that the Jalasiri project was being implemented at an estimated cost of Rs. 792 crore for uninterrupted water supply to the residents of Mangaluru City Corporation. In a couple of years, all residents will get the facility. The overhead tank being built at Shaktinagar stores 10 lakh litres of water, he added. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai recently launched the project being executed by Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation. The tank at Shaktinagar will supply water to 1,167 dwellings in Shaktinagar, Alape, Pachchanadi, Kunjathbail and surrounding areas, Mr. Kamath said. He said that the project had suffered set-back following non-availability of funds. He got Rs. 100 crore sanctioned through Mangaluru Smart City Ltd.. Mayor Premananda Shetty, MUDA Chairman Ravishankar Mijar, Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation Chairman Nitin Kumar and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/foundation-stone-laid-for-jalasiri-overhead-tank/article36052560.ece

As rain has subsided since about a week, restoration work has gained momentum. On Sunday, workers filled potholes and craters on the Old Kulur Bridge across the Phalguni with bitumen mix. The pothole-filled bridge had been hindering movement of vehicles. However, the stretch of the carriageway between KIOCL Junction and Old Kulur Bridge from the Udupi side is still riddled with craters and has been slowing down vehicular movement. Trenches have developed on both the sides of the speed-breaker erected just before the bridge, thereby causing damage to vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nhai-begins-filling-potholes-on-old-kulur-bridge/article36052562.ece
23 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Four PHCs in coastal belt solar powered||Four primary health centres (PHCs) in Dakshina Kannada are now among the 160 in the State connected with solar power to meet the energy needs of the government health facilities, according to Guruprakash Shetty, Deputy General Manager, SELCO Solar Light Pvt. Ltd. Addressing presspersons here on Friday, he said the PHCs at Tingalady and Neriya in DK and at Hallihole in Udupi district had been provided with solar energy connectivity. The installation of each of the 5-kW capacity solar units cost Rs. 4.5 lakh. The PHCs at Kollamogaru, Eshwaramangala, and at Padmunja in Dakshina Kannada would be linked with solar power by this month-end. Mr. Shetty said energy need of a PHC is vital for its operation. Hence, SELCO has powered more than 1,520 government healthcare facilities across the country. Their capacity varied from 2 kW to 5 kW. Medical equipment cannot be operated unless their energy need is met. “Healthcare services cannot be delivered unless health facilities are provided with uninterrupted energy supply. The task is not over just by ensuring required medical equipment. There should be power to operate them,” he said. SELCO, with the Association of People with Disability and Seva Bharati, an NGO, recently arranged solar-powered beds to two persons with spinal cord injury in Belthangady.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-phcs-in-coastal-belt-solar-powered/article36052572.ece
23 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||One more arrested in work visa fraud case||In continuation of the investigation of an overseas recruiting agency accused of defrauding people of work visa abroad, the police have arrested one more person said to be involved in the case. After a complaint from a nurse, the Mangaluru North Police arrested Jeri Ithiel Sikha on August 14. Sikha was accused of collecting Rs. 2 lakh from the nurse who was promised of a job in Lithuania. Realising that Sikha is not an authorised agent, the nurse sought return of money. As Sikha refused to return the money, the nurse filed the complaint and Sikha was arrested. During investigation, as many as 20 people approached the police complaining that they have been cheated by the accused. The police arrested another person associated with Sikha. A team has been sent to Tamil Nadu to trace the third accused associated with Sikha. The action against illegal overseas recruitment agencies came after a letter from the Protector of Emigrants of Ministry of External Affairs to Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar. Along with the letter, the Protector of Emigrants sent a list of authorised recruitment agencies operating in the State. An officer involved in the investigation said that this letter coincided with complaints against agencies sending people to Saudi Arabia and other West Asian countries despite no recruitment being done there. The illegal agencies have been using middlemen to contact the aspirants. The middlemen collect about Rs. 3 lakh from each aspirant as processing fee. After retaining their cut, the middlemen send the balance amount to the agent. The ban on flight operations and the pandemic are cited as reasons against delay in issuing offer letters and visas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-more-arrested-in-work-visa-fraud-case/article36052566.ece
23 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Residential areas in industrial layouts fraught with difficulties||The proposed residential townships in industrial areas has a forerunner in Mysuru and does not augur well for either industries or the local residents. Minister for Industries Murugesh Nirani announced last week that the State government will promote a walk-to-work culture and hence mooted development of residential areas in industrial layouts. He went on to state that about 10% to 15% of the land will be earmarked for residential areas including for schools, parks, and other amenities. But stakeholders in the industrial sector in Mysuru — based on their experience with such a development in the city — aver the scheme is flawed and will pose a problem for both the industries as well as residents who will have to grapple with air, noise and sound pollution which will be significantly higher than what it is in residential localities in the city. A case in point is the frequent complaints by the residents of the Chamundeshwari Housing Society and a few other housing cooperative societies who want a major industrial units shifted on the grounds that they were causing pollution. Mypol or Mysore Polymers, manufacturers of tubes, have been in the business since decades and the unit is situated adjacent the KRS Road in Metagalli in what was an industrial area until mixed development was promoted. As a result vast swathes of industrial land has been converted over the years for non-industrial purpose and residential areas, schools and colleges have come up not only in Metagalli but also in Belawadi, Hootagalli, and other industrial layouts of Mysuru. “In the first place, residential areas should not have been permitted in industrial areas. But having entered the industrial area, the residents now want the industries to be shifted and this amounts to harassment of the factory owners who have other issues to be worried about,” said Suresh Kumar Jain, general secretary of Mysore Industries Association. T. Ramakrishna, senior manager, HR, of MyPol, said the unit complies with all the stringent industrial and pollution control norms and has state-of-the-art equipment. “Yet the local residents, who are here since only the last few years, complain about our presence and want us to relocate though we are functioning from an industrial site legally and meeting all the norms since more than 40 years,” he said. It is not an one-off incident and there are many manufacturing units which are bearing the brunt of such complaints by the residents of housing colonies. As a fallout of such complaints, bulk of the time and energy gets dissipated by replying to the routine notices issues by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board based on the complaint by the local residents, according to Mr. Jain who argued against housing apartments and residential townships in industrial areas. Not only does it encourage industrial zoning violations but could lead to deindustrialisation in the long run, according to stakeholders. Real estate players with deep pockets will lure factory owners — struggling to keep their units operational — to part with their land and this will result in closure of manufacturing facilities and affect the economy, said Mr. Jain. Stakeholders argue that pollution norms like ambient air quality levels, noise decibel levels etc. tend to be different in industrial zones compared to residential areas and hence keeping them separate was ideal in the interest of public health and industrial growth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residential-areas-in-industrial-layouts-fraught-with-difficulties/article36052586.ece
23 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||A zipline ride for Rs. 50 at Kollegal||The Forest Department is bidding on a 216-metre zip ride for Rs. 50 to let the public experience an adrenaline rush. Inaugurated and in operation since the last few days at Kollegal in Chamarajanagar district, the low fare has made this affordable and is gaining in popularity. It is located between two hillocks at Sri Mahadeshwara Maradigudda Tree Park. Deputy Conservator of Forests V. Yedukondalu said the installation cost was Rs. 20 lakh, but it is state-of-the-art in terms of safety and quality. “There are other ziplines too but they are not truly professional in terms of length of the ride and quality adherence to safety,” said Mr. Yedukondalu. Consequent to its operation, there has been a steady stream of visitors for the service. The Forest Department also provides Go-Pro camera facility for visitors to take selfies and record their ride. “We have used the natural terrain and the gradient to create the zipline and three of our staff have been trained to operate and maintain it,” said Mr. Yedukondalu. The park is spread over 25 acres and has nearly 300 species of trees and is akin to a forest. Many visitors from the surrounding areas come to the tree park but the zipline is turning out to be the new draw. Once hoisted and tethered to the overhead cable, the rider gets an aerial view of the woods below, said Mr. Yedukondalu. “The tree park is replete with trees and the signages sheds line on different species. The zipline will ensure repeat visits and help people imbibe the values of conservatiion,” Mr. Yedukondalu added. The zipline is becoming popular due to word-of-mouth publicity and people heading towards MM Hills temple and BRT Sanctuary are trying out the zipride. In view of its affordability, the department is calling it the people’s zipline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-zipline-ride-for-rs-50-at-kollegal/article36052588.ece
23 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||COVID-19: Vishwanath calls for banning political gatherings||Former Minister and BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath on Sunday called upon the government to ban political gatherings and processions and withdraw the weekend curfew imposed in Mysuru district. Briefing reporters here, Mr. Vishwanath said COVID-19 surged in the country on account of political rallies, elections, and processions. “COVID-19 will not increase if you reopen schools. Imposing weekend curfew will not help. Stop these political meetings and processions”, he said, while criticising the BJP’s Janashirvada Yatras in different parts of the State as well as the gathering outside the Hindalga jail in Belagavi when Congress leader Vinay Kulkarni was released on bail. “Politicians are behaving as though they have no sense of responsibility,” he said. Mr. Vishwanath also urged the government to withdraw the weekend curfew imposed in Mysuru as its imposition was not only unnecessary when the test positivity rate (TPR) but also seriously affecting small businesses, who have already suffered during the long lockdown. He called upon the government to strengthen the security at the State’s borders with Kerala instead of imposing weekend curfew in Mysuru, which is about 90 km from the border. He alleged that officials of a few government departments like Transport and Forest were allowing vehicles from Kerala into the State by accepting illegal gratification. He urged the government to tighten the security at the State’s border with Kerala in Kodagu as well as Chamarajanagar. Mr. Vishwanath also called upon the government to constitute the Mysuru Dasara Authority well in time. Pointing out that the constitution of Mysuru Dasara Authority was a long pending demand, Mr Vishwanath wondered why the government was not setting up the authority when it was setting up boards and corporations for different castes and providing them financial assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-vishwanath-calls-for-banning-political-gatherings/article36052583.ece
23 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Railways lifts ban on photography shoots at Mysuru rail museum||The railways will permit still photography with Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras and photo shoot of special events in the Mysuru Rail Museum premises with effect from August 23rd. Professional photo shoot and videography of special events employing tripods, reflectors and lights will be permitted on Tuesdays when the museum is closed holiday for general visitors. But such events require prior approval of the competent authority and is subject to conditions, details of which will be available at the reception counter. Though photography was permitted for a nominal fee in the rail museum, permission was withdrawn after the renovation and restoration was completed in March 2020. Sources said this was because it transpired that high resolution photographs taken in the museum were being uploaded for sale at an exorbitant price without the knowledge of the railway authorities. Hence, the use of DSLR cameras was banned though there was no restriction on the use of mobile phone cameras. But there was persistent demand for permission for still photography in the museum premises by using digital cameras. Rail enthusiasts, amateur and hobbyist photographers, and the general public were of the opinion that they were being deprived of an opportunity to capture the memorable moments spent by them with family and children. The Mysuru Rail Museum, apart from being one of the oldest rail museums in India, has in its collection a few heritage artefacts like vintage steam locomotives, wooden inspection coaches and the prized royal saloons. Consequent to the feedback and after weighing the pros and cons of the issue, railway authorities decided to allow still photography by visitors using DSLR and other professional cameras inside the museum premises with prior permission and on payment of the notified charges at the reception. Rahul Agarwal, Divisional Railway Manager, South Western Railway, Mysuru has urged visitors to make use of the opportunity responsibly. The photography fee and the cost of photo shoot using professional equipment is being finalised, and will be known by August 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/railways-lifts-ban-on-photography-shoots-at-mysuru-rail-museum/article36052582.ece

Vishwanath said MP Pratap Simha cannot claim credit for bringing the project. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mr. Vishwanath said a decision to widen the highway was taken when Oscar Fernandes, Congress leader from Karnataka, was the Union Surface Transport Minister in 2012. Mr. Vishwanath also endorsed former Minister H.C.

We hope trade will restart soon,” Mr. Sait said. However, trade between the two countries may also be linked to whether India recognises the Taliban government. “During their previous tenure, India did not recognise the Taliban initially and that hit trade badly. But then too traders found ingenious ways which we hope will sustain us again,” Mr. Choudhary said. “During the Taliban’s previous reign, we used to get traders from Afghanistan to sell their produce to their counterparts in Pakistan or Tajikistan. They in turn would import spices and dry fruits to India. When relations between India and Pakistan were tense, traders from Afghanistan and Tajikistan would step in. However, though this ensures that supply is not disrupted, it adds to costs, he explained. For now, traders have no choice but to adopt a wait-and-watch approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/taliban-takeover-disrupts-trade-prices-of-dry-fruits-spices-soar/article36052207.ece

The reason cited by it is that they have altered the tax zone classification chart in 2016–17 and also issued a gazette notification to that effect. Does it expect every citizen to buy and read the gazette periodically? Why did it not given wide publicity in the media then itself? As per natural justice, any notice on revision of revenue slab can only be prospective and not retrospective. Hence, I appeal to the Chief Minister to intervene in the matter and render justice to the aggrieved public. B. Balasubramanian, Bengaluru   Sir, — This refers to the report, ‘Police for pre-paid auto kiosks at metro stations’ in The Hindu (Aug. 20, 2021). While the police plan to get pre-paid autorickshaw stands at all metro stations is welcome, unfortunately, the traffic police have abandoned manning existing pre-paid auto stands at Yeshwantpur Railway Station for the last few years. This has resulted in railway passengers being harassed, exploited, and put to hardship by auto drivers. Added to that, Yeshwantpur station area also witnesses traffic chaos on the market side as it has BMTC bus stand just opposite pre-paid auto stand in a narrow area. To provide relief to commuters, the traffic police should immediately start manning the pre-paid auto stands on both sides of Yeshwantpur railway station. Sharad M.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Corridors of Power||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, ever since he took over, has been speaking to the media on a daily basis about various developments in the State. He even scrapped an order issued to ban reporters going on rounds in the State Secretariat. He has a special knack in handling mediapersons, given his hands-on experience of briefing Cabinet decisions in the B.S. Yediyurappa government. Over time, he has developed a unique of style posing questions back to reporters when he is asked embarrassing or tricky ones. The Chief Minister recently asked a reporter, “Are you Anand Singh?” when he was questioned about the sulking Minister when the latter was allocated a “low” profile. Mr. Bommai’s went on to say, “You will come to know the outcome after my meeting with Anand Singh. How will you know now?”   To the surprise of many officials of the Legislative Council, its Chairman Basavaraj Horatti has transferred and changed the postings of 30 officials, apparently for their “poor performance”. Breaking the tradition of posting officials in the same sections for a long time, Mr. Horatti undertook a major reshuffle after a gap of more than 15 years. Many officials had been given a long innings in different sections of the Secretariat and complaints were piling up against them for their lax attitude. Many of the employees had over time occupied higher positions, but were unable to handle new tasks. Now, many officials holding the ranks of deputy secretary to first division assistant havebeen given new postings. Mr. Horatti, the longest- serving legislator, has warned of more stringent action if the officials still fail to deliver. Time for a shake-up in other departments too?   Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s house may have been flooded with garlands and bouquets that his fans, friends, admirers, party colleagues and political friends showered on him on his birthday, celebrated on August 12. But is August 12 indeed Mr. Siddaramaiah’s birthday? The former Chief Minister has himself categorically declared that he does not know his birthday accurately, and nor did his mother and father. Even the approximate date of birth entered in his academic records by a teacher of his primary school is August 3, 1947. Now, the leader himself should throw light on how the tradition of celebrating his birthday on August 12 came into being. Nagesh Prabhu Laiqh A.

V., a 50-year-old woodcarver, from Kalavamkodam near Cherthala too came up with 17 types of vegetables and a basket. His vegetables were not grown in soil but have been carved out of wood, a gesture of solidarity with farmers and all those part of the campaign. “When the government launched the ‘Onathine Oru Muram Pachakari’ project in June for this year’s Onam, I was excited but at the same time a bit disappointed. My enthusiasm was about joining the mass movement for the production of safe-to-eat vegetables. On the other hand, there was a scarcity of land. But it did not stop my family from cultivating vegetables for Onam on the available space at house premises, albeit on a very small scale. The government initiated the campaign with good intentions and it should be promoted. I carved vegetables out of wood as a small gesture of solidarity,” Mr. Sanu says. Mr. Sanu hand-carved the vegetables and basket out of Acacia mangium with stunning reality in 40 days. The vegetables include pumpkin, beans, brinjal, cucumber, bitter gourd, drumstick, carrot, ginger, chilli, and so on. As a professional woodcarver, he has chiseled scenes from the life of Jesus Christ, Lord Krishna, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Sree Narayana Guru among others in a career spanning more than 30 years, but it is for the first time he did intricate designs of vegetables on wood. Free time “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have had a lot of free time in recent months. I used it to the best use by carving vegetables out of wood. I was keen to complete the work before Onam. All the vegetable designs and basket are fully made of wood,” he says, adding that he plans to start a YouTube channel to showcase his works. More than 60 lakh families in the State joined the ‘Onathinu Oru Muram Pachakkari’ campaign and cultivated different types of vegetables. The Agriculture Department had distributed vegetable seedlings and vegetable seed kits for the successful implementation of the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/carving-vegetables-out-of-wood/article36052467.ece

In addition the prices of jaggery remained low despite poor production. Farmers said that many of them had delayed harvesting due to the shortage of workers. If it is not harvested on time, the availability of juice will considerably fall resulting in a lower jaggery production. They said that the maximum period for its growth is 12 months. The average price the farmers gets is Rs. 60 and only a price of over Rs. 80 will make it remunerative to the farmer. In households Marayur jaggery is produced in household units. After, it received the geographical indication (GI) tag three agencies were entrusted with the right to sell it is as it received the brand name ‘Marayur Jaggery.’ The three agenicis are Marayur Karimpulpadaka Vipanana Sanghom, Mapco (Marayur Agriculture Producer Company) and Mhads (Marayur Hills Agricultural Development Society). Selvin Mariappan, chief of Mapco on Sunday said that the government had not included Marayur jaggery in the Onam kit. It was their long-standing demand to make Marayur jaggery available at Sabarimala for making aravana and for supplying anganwadis. From T.N. There is also complaint that low quality jaggery from Tamil Nadu is being packed as Marayur jaggery. P.T. Somasekaran Nair, a sugercane farmer said that the agencies should ensure that only Marayur jaggery should be packed in its name. It was during last Onam season that Marayur jaggery fetched the highest price of Rs. 4,100 for a 50 kg sack.  If sugarcane is not harvested on time, the juice received will considerably fall resulting in lower jaggery production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sugarcane-yet-to-be-harvested-in-marayur/article36052513.ece

Gopinath, who was removed from service while he was serving as Joint Registrar at the Central University of Kerala (CUK). On Saturday, he celebrated Onam with his family in Kasaragod, as the long-drawn legal battle ended, with the Kerala High Court quashing charges levelled against him by the university and ordered it to clear all benefits and salary arrears due to him within three months. Mr. Gopinath was removed from service following allegations that he was instrumental in taking on rent a building to house the boys’ hostel of the CUK, agreeing to pay a monthly rent of Rs. 75,000 as well as an advance amount for three months to the building owner without the approval of the Vice Chancellor or the Registrar. This reportedly cost the university a loss of Rs. 3.5 lakh during 2013-14. He was also accused of renting out a building without obtaining a rent reasonableness certificate (RRC) from the Central Public works Department (CPWD) and failure to enter into an agreement prior to payment of the amount and remitting a sum in excess of what was shown in the RRC, which was obtained two years later. With the enquiry officer giving a report against him and the single judge court approving the proceedings, he challenged the order. However, the High Court questioned the findings of the enquiry officer appointed by the university. It was of the view that the officer had failed to establish the specific charges against the petitioner. The court also found that the decision was taken at the level of the Vice chancellor and the Registrar of the university. With the judgment coming in his favour, the CUK will have to pay approximately Rs. 1.3 crore to him, Mr. Gopinath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-quashes-charges-against-former-cuk-joint-registrar/article36052461.ece
23 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cage fish farming launched in reservoirs||The Aquaculture Development Agency Kerala (ADAK) has begun fish seed stocking in three of the four reservoirs, where it has been permitted to launch cage fish culture. The launch of cage culture in reservoirs is a big step towards improving fish production against the backdrop of dwindling wild catch and marks a new beginning in the exploitation of the vast area available for aquaculture in the State, said ADAK managing director Dinesan Cheruvat on Sunday. The aquaculture agency was granted permission by the Water Resources Department, Kerala State Electricity Board, and the Forest Department to launch cage culture in Banasura Sagar and Karapuzha reservoirs in Wayanad district, Peruvannamuzhi in Kozhikode district, and Kakki in Pathanamthitta district. Seed stocking has begun in the first three reservoirs, and cages are being installed at Kakki. While Banasura Sagar, Karapuzha and Peruvannamuzhi reservoirs will see cage culture of improved variety of tilapia, Kakki reservoir will see culture of indigenous varieties of pearl spot ( Karimeen ) and anabas ( Kaithakkora ). The ADAK official said there was huge demand for fresh fish, and marketing arrangements were being made to ensure that farmers under SC-ST Reservoir Fisheries Societies got a good price for the produce. There will be over 100 cages per reservoir, with each expected to produce a tonne of fish. The cages measure 6x4x4, totalling 96 cubic metres, and can stock between 3,000 and 4,000 fingerlings each. Tilapia can be harvested for sale within six months. It will take around 10 months for pearl spot and anabas to be harvested. The equation works out well considering the current prices of fish. While tilapia sells at around Rs. 200 a kg, pearl spots and anabas sell at between Rs. 300 and Rs. 400. The launch of aquaculture in reservoirs will augment income for hundreds of families, and the venture is backed by the Prime Minister’s Matsya Sampada Yojana with an investment of Rs. 16 crore, Mr. Cheruvat said. Growing segment  He added that aquaculture was the fastest growing segment in the primary sector and holds out great promise for the future, especially against the backdrop of waterbodies remaining underutilised. “Reservoir aquaculture is considered a sleeping giant”, and reservoir fisheries have immense potential. There are a total of 47 reservoirs in the State which can be utilised for aquaculture. They can be fields where 50,000 tonnes of fish can be produced a year and backwaters, where the potential for fish production is huge,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cage-fish-farming-launched-in-major-reservoirs-in-state/article36052469.ece

That the bicycles are unisex models and come with height-adjustable seats help, since men, women, and even children can use them. That they can be locked manually and opened using smartphones (no key needed), considerably helps. “Their demand is picking up after a lull, to operate last-mile trips from metro stations and also on extended hire for months. People living in the city and even those from the suburbs are opting for them for exercise and also for short-distance trips,” said sources in MyByk, the start-up firm that was roped in earlier this year by Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) and Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) to introduce 1,000 shared bicycles in the Greater Kochi area. The cycles, 800 of which have so far arrived in Kochi, are parked in 57 kiosks near Kochi metro stations and in other public spaces. A total of 150 kiosks have been envisaged, of which 33 more will be in the city soon. The approval of the Kochi Corporation is awaited for the list of spots identified for the kiosks. Of the rest, 60 bicycles will be based at 10 docks at Infopark, KMRL sources said. CSML funds The bicycles of robust build quality were procured using CSML funds, while the Kochi metro was the coordinating agency, including to establish kiosks beyond the metro corridor. “That each cycle is GPS-enabled helps collate data and analyse aspects like location-specific and peak-demand timings. A goods autorickshaw is on duty all through day and night, to redeploy them to areas where demand rises,” the sources added. The hourly rent for cycles picked from public kiosks is as low as Rs. 2. The service can be utilised through an app-based platform, which will show the nearest terminal and also other terminals. There will be a refundable security deposit of Rs. 500 for all services, including door delivery under the daily / weekly / monthly rental scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shared-bicycle-system-picks-up-steam-in-kochi/article36052489.ece

The Thrissur Railway Passengers Association and other passenger bodies have been seeking restoration of all MEMU and short-distance services. “The Thiruvananthapuram railway division informed us that running of unreserved passenger and MEMU services is under consideration. Officials say unreserved ticketing for MEMU and passenger trains will be restored only with the permission of the Railway Board,” says P. Krishnakumar, general secretary. Sources said only the Central Railway had fully restored services in high-demand corridors. The Railway Board ought to take a call on the demand from commuters in other areas, especially for unreserved travel. The Jansatabdhi Express trains via Kottayam and Alappuzha are operating, with reserved seats as per the norm. In addition, reservation is mandatory for Vanchinad Express and Venad Express which office-goers and regular commuters depend on. The advantage is that everyone gets seats, in keeping with physical distancing norms. A few MEMU services too have resumed service, they said. On criticism that Railways are levying much more than the regular fare for special trains in busy corridors, sources said 50% of the regular fare was added to the cost of tatkal tickets. For the rest, Rs. 10 was being charged as reservation fee. More general coaches were being allotted on express trains, depending on demand. Occupancy on most trains was improving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-resume-all-rail-services/article36052479.ece

But for nearly 300 families of the low-lying Thuruthipuram-Vellottupuram area of Puthenvelikkara panchayat in Ernakulam, one of the worst affected in the 2018-deluge, tidal flooding has become a monthly phenomenon for four days following every full moon day. Now, a community-driven tidal flooding mitigation programme is under way in the area under the joint aegis of Equinoct—a community-sourced modelling solution provider initiated by IIT Bombay and NIT-Calicut alumnus—and Community Resource Centre (CRC), Puthenvelikkara, with the support of the civil engineering department of SNM College, Maliankara. “The project has been running for around six months now and during the period we have noticed an average tidal flooding of 10 cm to 30 cm, and it could well go beyond that during December. We are still in the first stage of the programme, where the emphasis is on data-gathering based on which we will do a contour mapping, identify the most vulnerable areas, and do a detailed study of streams contributing to flooding in the successive stages,” said C.G. Madhusoodhanan, CEO, Equinoct. CRC has installed 17 tidal gauges in the area and has trained community members in gauging tidal flooding. “We have a WhatsApp group, where they will either post each gauge reading in real time or a consolidated report,” said P.N. Maya, coordinator, CRC. Steps are under way to record them on a web-based platform. The installation of gauges, measurement, and data upload into the platform have become a community education exercise, especially for children and women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panchayat-takes-up-tidal-flood-mitigation-programme/article36052485.ece

Opposition Leader in the council M.K. Chandrababu of the CPI(M) and Independent councillor M.C. Manoop were among the 18 councillors who had demanded a Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation into the issue, even as Municipal Chairperson Ajitha Thankappan categorically denied the allegations. Congress sources said the Ernakulam District Congress Committee (DCC) would inquire into the matter. The first step is to find out if the allegations are based on facts. The preliminary understanding is that the municipal council had not paid the councillors, and that the allegations against the Chairperson and the ruling council are not true, party sources said. It was reported that a group of 18 councillors, including some from the ruling front, returned the money allegedly paid by the council. The Municipal Chairperson alleged a “conspiracy” to frame her, and that several attempts had been made in the past too to bring down the UDF council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-to-investigate-alleged-payment-to-councillors/article36052492.ece

With work from home (WFH) likely to be in vogue at least for the foreseeable future, techies who previously let go otherwise attractive offers, bogged down by proximity factor, now have an opportunity to tap into a wider set of offers. For tech companies, recruitment drive through online platforms has become far more simpler, facilitating them to explore a bigger talent pool beyond geographic limitations. “A lot of hopping around has been happening in the IT industry with WFH leaving location immaterial. Job applications that previously attracted responses from south India alone are now drawing responses from across the country. The only dampening factor is the three-month notice period,” said Aneesh Panthalani, State president of Progressive Techies, a combine of IT employees. The notice period is proving a hurdle both for the applicant and the recruiting company. While the former may miss out on offers that demand immediate signing up, companies prepared to wait out the notice period runs the risk of losing their candidates who may be exploring other offers in between. Recruitment drives have become a lot easier both for the candidates and companies. Thanks to advanced cameras, the identification is all about taking a screen print as the candidate joins the interview panel. “Earlier, companies had to make a lot of logistical arrangements for conducting a recruitment drive whereas now they just need to send the link of an online meeting. Candidates are also a lot more relaxed and confident facing interviews from the familiar environs of their homes. The recruiter is able to reach a better informed decision,” said Santhosh Melekalathil, a senior professional who is part of a recruitment team of an IT major in Kochi. However, there is the remote possibility of candidates ‘Googling’ for the right answers as shown in a widely circulated recent video. However, companies are increasingly adopting more precautions to avert such cheating.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wfh-benefits-job-hopping-techies-recruiters/article36052478.ece

Public can directly report all related incidents to the control room and a taluk-level facility too will be functional. Officials in charge of the control room will be available 24x7 and immediate action will be taken against violations. Special district and taluk level squads have been deployed for inspections and Kollam Sub Collector Chethan Kumar Meena and deputy collectors are in charge of the squads. “Ignoring such incidents will be considered as a serious lapse of duty and action will be initiated against those taking a favourable stand,” said the Collector. Legal proceedings He has instructed officials concerned to go ahead with legal proceedings after taking the pictures of wetland filling cases.

According to Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas, the UGC’s Distance Education Bureau has given permission for three programmes, the application for which were submitted last year. 10 more It was in October 2020 that the Syndicate had established a centre for online education to launch online undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. The university has applied for permission to launch 10 more programmes online this year. “As part of the first phase, we have decided to apply for permission to launch BCom and BBA degree programmes and MCom postgraduate degree courses online. Jurisdiction The territorial jurisdiction of the university is not applicable for conducting online programmes and students from anywhere in the world can join these programmes,” he said. The admission, teaching, learning management, fee payment, examinations, valuation, and mark list will be carried out using the MGU-ALEMS (Automated Learning and Evaluation Management System). As part of it, steps are in place to upgrade the software by adding more features. The MGUIF (Mahatma Gandhi University Innovation Foundation), a subsidiary of the university, will prepare the e-learning materials and offer technical assistance for online learning. Works on a state-of-the-art studio and recording labs, which are being established for the purpose, are nearing completion. As online undergraduate and postgraduate programmes are considered equivalent to the regular programme, the UGC stipulates the online programmes to follow the same syllabus and curriculum as the regular programmes conducted by the university. 75% attendance The UGC regulation also stipulates that only those with 75% of attendance in the online classes will be allowed to appear for the examination. In view of the COVID-19 situation, the university has extended the date of admissions till November, sources said.

23 August 2021||Kottayam,KERALA||Football serves as a game changer for these youngsters||It’s a wet morning and the field is soggy. These conditions, however, have not stopped this group of 50-odd children from gleefully running their soccer drills. From ball security to blocking and tackling and field sprints, they keep practising for hours. Standing amid these youngsters, 49-year-old Ramesh Kumar C. asks them to do a little extra, making the children sprint and chase each other over and over. The man, who runs the Drona Football Academy (DFA) at Changanassery, now serves as a lifeline to over a hundred children from underprivileged families. Besides making football accessible to every child irrespective of their social status, he is using the game to ensure that these children are given a fair shot at life. “Since I am a product of the grassroots system, I would like every child to have the opportunities the players of our generation were lucky enough to enjoy,” says Mr. Kumar, who had played for various football clubs in his over two-decades-long career. Mr. Kumar, who possesses a D certificate from the All India Football Federation, began associating with a few schools in the region. The experience helped him realise how the increasing cost of playing the game, coupled with economic inequality, was increasingly keeping players from poor families away from the game. It was at this point that he decided to launch a free training camp at the Changanassery municipal stadium. The camp is open all days of the year. The camp, which began with just one youngster, grew over the years and presently trains 140 children. The free-football movement has the backing of the coach’s former colleagues like P.S. Ashim, a former Indian international. “The best coach for football in this world is the game itself. Our effort is to ensure an atmosphere that is conducive to practising and using it as a life skill module for social change,” observed Mr. Ashim. Studies, employment Over the years, the academy has helped a handful of youngsters who dropped out of their studies to join colleges under the sports quota while a few of them are now in the cusp of gaining employment through the game.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/football-serves-as-a-game-changer-for-these-youngsters/article36052539.ece

23 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Process begins to acquire land for SilverLine in Kozhikode||Amid mounting protests, the State government has begun the process to acquire 42.03 hectares of land in Kozhikode district for the first phase of the proposed SilverLine corridor project connecting Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram. As per the detailed project report, the alignment of the ambitious semi high-speed rail project, an initiative of Kerala Rail Development Corporation (K-Rail), passes through 73 km in Kozhikode district. K-Rail is a joint venture company of the Kerala government and the Ministry of Railways for the infrastructure development of railways in Kerala. The proposal is to acquire land in seven villages spread across Kozhikode and Koyilandy taluks. Though the alignment passes through Vadakara taluk, no villages have so far been listed for acquisition in the first phase. Government sources said permission had been granted to acquire land in Beypore, Cheruvannur, Elathur, Karuvanturathi and Puthiyangadi villages in Kozhikode taluk and Chemmanchery and Chengottukavu villages in Koyilandy taluk. However, land will be acquired only after securing permission from the Rail Board, based on the social impact assessment report and also a report from the District Collector. Meanwhile, protest is brewing against the multi-crore project at the local level. At least a dozen action committees have been constituted against the proposed acquisition of land. A district-level coordination committee has also been formed against the demolishing of houses. More than 3,000 houses will have to be razed in the district for the project. Land will be acquired mostly in Elathur and Vengalam segments. The proposed alignment also passes from Panniyankara to West Hill. At present, only an aerial survey has been completed in the district as elsewhere in the State. Steps for land survey and acquisition will be carried out after working out the modalities at departmental levels. An environmental impact assessment study was conducted by the Centre for Environment and Development, Thiruvananthapuram, in July last for the Rs. 63,940.67-crore project. The construction period for the project is five years. The 529.45-km SilverLine corridor connecting Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, with an operating speed of 200 kmph, is expected to ease commute between the north and south ends of the State and reduce the total travel time to less than four hours, compared to the present 10-12 hours. The intermediate stations include Kollam, Chengannur, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Kochi Airport, Thrissur, Tirur, Kozhikode, and Kannur. In Kozhikode, the station will be underground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/process-begins-to-acquire-land-for-silverline-in-kozhikode/article36052471.ece
23 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Swimming test for Plus One aspirants cancelled||A swimming test being organised by the District Sports Council as part of Plus One admissions has been cancelled in view of the increasing COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) in Kozhikode district. The Sports Council had suspended the test earlier this week until Sunday as a large number of students had turned up for the test at a swimming pool at East Nadakkavu in the city. District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy said he had received complaints of more than 500 students reporting for the test at a swimming pool in the city in clear violation of the COVID-19 protocol. The State government’s directive to the District Sports Council to conduct swimming tests and issue certificates to students who seek admission to Plus One courses had drawn flak from teachers’ organisations earlier. Students producing swimming skills certificates are given two bonus points during the admission. The practice of submitting the certificate began after the Thattekad boat tragedy in which 15 students and three teachers died. Spread of infection  The Kerala Aided Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association had warned that conducting the event at a single venue in the district could lead to overcrowding, thus violating the pandemic protocol. It was not safe to ask students to swim together in a pool as it would increase the risk of infection, they said. The association had suggested decentralising the swimming test and holding it in various towns other than the district capital. However, the District Sports Council had claimed that all guidelines were being followed while conducting the test. The District Collector has asked the Sports Council to issue certificates based on documents available with the students or based on available information instead of holding the test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/swimming-test-for-plus-one-aspirants-cancelled/article36052473.ece

The arrested have been identified as Kutti Vijayan, 42, of Ambalavayal in Wayanad and Pattamveettil Bhaveesh of Nadakkavu in Kozhikode. They were arrested on the charge of stealing 44.5 sovereigns of gold, a diamond necklace, and cash from the house of Swapna Nambiar, an assistant professor at the Government Medical College, Kozhikode, on July 26. Vijayan, the first accused in the case, is also an accused in a 2007 murder case. He, along with a few other arrested persons, had escaped from the Medical College police station in 2018 after drilling a hole in the lock-up wall. Though they were caught later, the group had been engaged in several robberies across Kerala and other States since then. Vijayan is an accused in over 500 cases in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. Medical College ACP K.

She had begun her career in tinseltown as a child artiste in Tamil films. But it was through Malayalam films that she became more popular. After debuting as an adult in a minor role in Hariharan’s Valarthumrugangal in 1981, she gained recognition with Aattakalasham . Five years later, she lip-synched to an even more popular song in a film that would prove a turning point in her career. The beautiful melody Aa raathri maanju poyi …, in the film in Panchagni , was rendered by her namesake K.S. Chithra. She did justice to what was a good role in the film directed by Hariharan.

Their friends Atulya and Haripriya too were among the three dozen children of the Palakkayam tribal colony who celebrated the arrival of high-speed Internet. Thanks to JSS, many students from Palakkayam, Ambumala and Vettilakkolli tribal hamlets were introduced to online classes for the first time since COVID-19 brought about the lockdown in March 2020. Lack of Internet had kept a large number of tribal students away from studies during the lockdown. Some of them could hardly remember the name of their school, as the long vacation had nearly erased their campus memories. As usual, their records with the government may be perfect. But their education has not progressed an inch since March 2020. “Wow, we are getting 4G. This is amazing,” said Sandeep and Sunil, browsing the net on their phone. The children’s excitement on getting the Internet and tabs spilled over to their mothers, as they demanded that everyone be given a tab each. As many as 60 Lenovo tabs were arranged by P.V. Abdul Wahab, MP. Mr. Wahab had adopted Chaliyar panchayat under the Centre’s Sansad Adarsh Grama Yojna scheme. The condition of children in Ambumala and Vettilakkolli colonies is even worse. With no proper road access to the colonies, dozens of families in the hamlets have been living virtually a marooned life. While the dual hamlets of Palakkayam have 36 families belonging to Muthuvan tribes and 16 belonging to Kattunaikar tribes, Ambumala and Vettilakkolli hamlets have 25 families of Paniya tribes. Vettilakkolli, with little access and hardly a safe house to shelter them, is one of the worst in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-speed-net-cheers-up-tribal-kids/article36052463.ece

The KSEB has now invited bids from firms experienced in installing the electromechanical and hydromechanical equipment which were originally supplied by Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC), Chengdu, China. If things pan out, the much-delayed scheme should be ready for commissioning in one to one-and-a-half year’s time, a KSEB official said. Centre non-committal Following the India-China clash in the Galwan Valley, the Centre had remained non-committal on the KSEB's request to use the Chinese firm's services for installing the machinery. “We had taken up the matter repeatedly with the Department of Promotion of Industries and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of India, but they have neither given the approval nor said a 'no.' So we are now looking at firms other than the original equipment manufacturer for erecting the machinery,” an official in the power generation wing of the KSEB said. As per the tender floated by the KSEB, bidders “from a country which shares a land border with India” will be eligible to participate in the bid only if they are registered with the DPIIT. According to KSEB officials, once the work is awarded, the installation of the machinery and tests are expected to be completed and the scheme ready for commissioning in a year. Original schedule Designed to have two 30 MW generating units, the 60 MW Pallivasal Extension Scheme (153.9 million units) was originally scheduled for commissioning in March, 2011. The machinery, in fact, had reached Kerala more than six years ago, but problems related to land acquisition, geology and technical issues had caused delays at the time. Subsequently, the KSEB had set December 2021 as the new deadline for commissioning the scheme. However, following the Galwan Valley incident in June 2020, the Centre had imposed stringent regulations on the procurement of equipment and services from China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chinese-hurdle-kseb-looks-at-other-options/article36052535.ece

The works have been progressing on a stretch of road in the Fort area, where site surveys have been completed and the construction of multi-utility ducts and storm water drains is ongoing. In this phase of the project, consisting mainly of Corporation roads, an amount of Rs. 104 crore will be spent on a total of 9.87 kilometres of road. All cables, including electrical utility cables, telecom cables, digital TV cables and optical fibre cables will be shifted to the utility ducts in the entire stretch. In three phases The major component of the smart road project will be the 36.94 kilometres of road under the Public Works Department and the Kerala Road Fund Board in the core city area. The project is expected to be completed in February 2023. The first two tender calls were unsuccessful and no construction company was chosen for the project. It was later divided into three parts — phase 1 and 2, phase 3, phase 4 — and tenders called separately. The phase 1 and 2 of the project were awarded to NA Construction Private Limited for Rs. 136.96 crore. The same company has taken up the contract for the phase 3 of the project at a cost of Rs. 141.84 crore. The phase 4 of the project has been taken up by R.K. Madani and company at a cost of Rs. 147.5 crore. The survey work on these projects are progressing. Execution delayed All projects envisaged under the Smart City project have already been tendered, but execution has been a problem with multiple roadblocks since last year, beginning with the first COVID-19 lockdown, the two extended periods in which model code of conduct were in force for the local body and Assembly elections, the most recent lockdown due to COVID-19, and the heavy summer showers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-may-get-its-first-smart-road-by-feb/article36052654.ece
23 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Reports of leaked DCC presidents’ list haunt Cong.||The Congress on Sunday appeared dogged by reports that anonymous insiders had leaked the presumed list of candidates for the post of District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents in the State to the media. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran vehemently denied the speculation that threatened to upend the integrity of the selection process already fraught with factional feuding. The KPCC had edged closer to finalising the contentious list reportedly in the face of stiff opposition from Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, the leaders of the traditionally powerful ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups, respectively. By one account, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar was in touch with the leaders after they “informed” the high command that the KPCC had sidelined them from the decision-making process. Notably, a party insider said, the traditional factions in the KPCC felt threatened by the perceived emergence of a new group supposedly owing allegiance to AICC general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups supposedly believe Mr. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan had aligned themselves with the “emergent faction” for now. Row in the open The “disagreement” in the Congress about the selection of DCC presidents had spilt over into the open in Kollam last week. Anonymous persons had lampooned KPCC working president Kodikunnil Suresh, MP, in unsigned posters for allegedly choosing a close ally for DCC president, Kollam. The Congress feared that copycat protests could gather momentum in other districts if the ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups felt that the KPCC had discounted their opinion in the nomination process. KPCC stance The KPCC has indicated that it had strived to keep factionalism at bay in DCC president selection. The emphasis was on merit, acceptability, and industriousness. Age and caste demographics also influenced selection to some measure. The AICC wanted to achieve a generational shift in organisational leadership without creating much rancour. It appeared disinclined to waste energy appeasing the traditional groups. The KPCC had reportedly given weightage to the choice of MPs, MLAs, and local self-government heads. However, many senior leaders felt kept out of the loop. Two of them, former KPCC presidents Mullappally Ramachandran and V.M. Sudheeran, have reportedly communicated their displeasure to the high command.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/reports-of-leaked-dcc-presidents-list-haunt-cong/article36052532.ece

The coins are being documented and inventoried for the past few years for their scientific conservation. Three documentation experts, Ramamoorthy, G. Sarojini Amma, and P. Gopakumar, supported by staff from the department’s numismatics wing, have been at work at Sree Padam Palace to document the coins under the supervision of a monitoring committee. The monitoring committee decides which coin hoard from which period has to be documented, and the experts work accordingly to record on data sheets a brief history of each coin, and details such as size, obverse and reverse characteristics, symbols, and specialities. As documentation and inventory of a number of hoards such as the massive Angamaly hoard has been completed, the department plans to bring it out as a publication, both in print and online format for the benefit of the public, researchers, students, and those interested in numismatics, Archaeology Director E. Dineshan said. Photos of each coin too will be displayed. A final picture of the print publication has been arrived at, but not of the online mode. Mr. Dineshan said the classification and documentation of coins had come along well in the past few years, and would continue this year. The work was important so that information on the coins could be made available in the public domain. Coins were also present in government treasuries, and while some had been retrieved, others would be once the documentation of the coins with the department was completed, he said. On special expo While it had been proposed sometime ago that a special exhibition for coins would be set up, a proposal has not been prepared. Coins, Mr. Dineshan pointed out, had been displayed in all museums, be it the Koyikkal Palace at Nedumangad, Hill Palace at Tripunithura, or the Sakthan Thampuran Palace in Thrissur. Even upcoming museums would have coin displays. Hence, a proposal for an exclusive collection of coins had not been put up for approval.  Three experts, supported by staff of the department’s numismatics wing, have been at work at Sree Padam Palace to document the coins.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/archaeology-dept-to-publish-coin-inventory-online-too/article36052644.ece

Mr. Upadhyay, who was been undertaking a month-long awareness programme against cybercrime and financial frauds, said such pyramid structure schemes deceive those who fall for the promise of easy and quick money upon enrolment by paying a certain sum and then adding more members. The schemes assure high returns and also pay the first few instalments to the investor as promised so that word of mouth publicity would attract prospective investors. Commission is paid to the investor for including more persons in the scheme rather than for the sale of products. The scheme becomes unsustainable after some time when the number of those enrolling starts to come down. This prompts the fraudsters to wind up the scheme and flee with the money. No sale, just returns Mr. Upadhyay advised the public to be wary of schemes that offer abnormally high returns, especially without the actual sale of goods or service. Accepting money under such schemes is a cognizable offence under the Prize Chit and Money Circulation (Banning) Act, 1978. The officer urged people to alert the police if they notice such schemes. He also urged caution against OTP-based frauds and schemes that offer instant and short-term loans. In the latter, fraudsters dupe borrowers and may charge significantly higher interest rates. Those interested in taking loans must ascertain whether the lender is registered with the government or other authorised agencies.

Jellyfish population has increased along the Kerala coast as well as in other parts of the world in recent years. Dying in large numbers, they wash ashore on beaches, as observed in Shanghumughom. This particular jellyfish is an Indo-West pacific species commonly known as the ‘crowned jellyfish’ (Netrostoma coerulescens, belonging to the family Cepheidae), A. Biju Kumar, professor and head, Department of Aquatics Biology, University of Kerala, said. “They appear in blooms during June-September along the Kerala coast, and local fishers call them ‘ona chori’ since they appear during the Onam season. Elsewhere they are known as ‘neela chori’ because of the blue colour. Some call them ‘krishna chori’ because of the blue colour,” according to Dr. Biju Kumar. Not-so-pleasant results Large jellyfish populations can have adverse impacts on fishing. They get entangled on the fishing nets and some species can cause body pain and skin irritation when fishermen try to remove them from the nets. Coming into contact with the carcass of the free-swimming marine animal will not cause death, but can cause severe itching.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jellyfish-wash-ashore-in-hordes/article36052649.ece

In the past decade, the landscape on these routes has transformed from being a dryland to green courtyard now with several species of trees. The transformation was brought about by 2,200 persons from 11 villages in Ramagiri, Roddam, and Chennekothapalli mandals. Thanks to the Kalpavalli Mutually Aided Cooperative Society, an initiative of Timbaktu Collective, the villagers achieved regeneration of more than 9,000 acres of fallow revenue land in the three mandals. At the 13th anniversary celebrations of formation of the society, villagers danced, dined and shared their experiences in converting land around their village into the green patch. The Kalpavalli Community Conservation Area now has a ‘bush camp’, where environmentalists, naturalists and bird watching enthusiasts stay for days together to study nature from close quarters. The regeneration of barren land has brought enough rain in the past three decades and many of the tanks are full of water. Aside from this, the green corridors have become shelter to many species of birds and animals like deer, sloth bear. On Sunday, Accion Freterna Ecology Centre Director Y. Malla Reddy addressed the members of the Kalpavalli society and encourage them to become members of State government-sponsored Bio-diversity Development Committees of village panchayats and get help from the State to further improve their area. Promoters of the Kalpavalli, C.K. Ganguly and Mary Vattamattam, said while the work on the regeneration of fallow land was taken up from 1992, this Kalpavalli society had given the villagers a recognition and growing paddy, vegetables or any other millets organically has been their forte, while regenerating forest on the barren hills. “Our villagers fought with the corporates and rejected the setting up of large windmills, which harmed the regeneration process,” said Mr. Ganguly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/folk-from-11-villages-turn-9000-acres-of-barren-land-into-green-corridor/article36052146.ece

23 August 2021||Hassan,ANDHRA PRADESH||Women score big win in battle against bottle||The women of migrating communities living at Anche Chomanahalli in Kadur taluk have won their fight against the liquor shop at Bapuji Colony in the village. The Excise Department has ordered the shifting of the liquor shop, considering the objections raised by women belonging to Sudagadu Sidda and Hakki Pikki communities in the village. A.G. Girish opened the retail shop (CL2) on July 6 this year. The women, who are all daily wage workers, resolved to fight against it the same day. As many as 65 women staged a dharna for six days, losing their daily earnings. They did not give up the protest even when it rained heavily. After listening to the arguments from both sides, Chikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner of Excise K.K. Sumitha, on August 17, ordered the shifting of the shop within 60 days. The order was issued under Rule 5 of the Karnataka Excise Act, 1967, which prohibits the establishment of liquor shops within 100 metres of a religious place, school, hospital, and SC-ST residential locality. The High Court of Karnataka, in a judgment in 1997, had stated that when local residents are opposed to a shop, officials need not stick to the 100-metre rule. In this case, the shop owner had argued that his shop was more than 100 metres from the residential locality. Background In the village of 150 families, migrant communities are more in number. The women were determined to close the shop as they were facing many problems at home because of the men’s addiction to alcohol. “Until now, men travelled to nearby places to get liquor. Now the shop has come close to our place. My husband takes away my earnings to get drunk every evening. We have not been able to provide education to out children nor cleared the loans borrowed. This is the story of every family. If the shop is opened near the area, we will be ruined,” said Rathnamma, one of the protesters. As their protest began, the licence-holder tried to silence the women through various tricks. “The owner offered free liquor to the men of the village initially to gain their support. However, the women continued their struggle. Finally, a meeting was held in the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Excise in Chikkamagaluru, where 80 women registered their objections to the shop,” said C.K.

23 August 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana man killed by business partner||A businessman from Karmanghat was allegedly murdered by his business ‘partner’, who later buried his body in the roadside agricultural fields on the night of August 19. The motive behind the alleged murder was a financial dispute. The gruesome murder happened between Charminar and Zaheerabad in Sangareddy district, where the accused Sanju Kumar, a resident of Charminar and two of his associates — Girish and Jagannath — buried the victim Madhusudhan Reddy’s body in the agricultural fields. However, the offence came to light only the next day when an unknown person called Reddy’s wife and told her that some people kidnapped her husband and Sanju due to business rivalry. Soon, she approached Charminar police and based on her complaint, a man missing case was registered and police launched a probe. According to Charminar police, the accused Sanju, a native of Karnataka, took a loan of Rs. 40 lakh from the victim by mortgaging his house documents. Despite repeated reminders, Sanju was not willing to return the amount and recently his sister and brother, who were caught by the Tenali police in Andhra Pradesh for transporting two tonnes of ganja in a lorry, named Reddy as one of their associates. “Though he (Reddy) was not associated with their ganja business, Sanju’s family members confessed his name, which further provoked him against the former,” police said. On August 19, Sanju asked Reddy to come to his house to collect the pending loan amount. “When Madhusudhan Reddy reached home, the accused along with his associates killed the former and stuffed his body in their SUV, which they drove towards Zaheerabad and disposed of the body,” police said. Based on the technical evidence, the police reached the spot, exhumed the body and brought it to the city. They detained car driver Jagannath and a manhunt is on to nab the prime accused Sanju and Girish. Apparently, Reddy met Sanju in Chanchalguda prison, when he was arrested in connection with a murder case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-man-killed-by-business-partner/article36051970.ece

23 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||387 ‘Moplah martyrs’ to be removed from dictionary||Malabar Rebellion leaders Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji, Ali Musaliar and 387 other ‘Moplah martyrs’ will be removed from the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle. A three-member panel, which reviewed the entries in the fifth volume of the dictionary brought out by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), is understood to have recommended the deletion as it felt that the 1921 rebellion was never part of the Independence struggle, and was a fundamentalist movement focused on religious conversion. None of the slogans raised by the rioters were in favour of nationalism and anti-British, it noted. RSS leader Ram Madhav, at a meeting to commemorate the victims of the rebellion, had stated that the movement was one of the first manifestations of the Taliban mindset in India. However, Speaker M.B. Rajesh described Haji as a warrior who refused to apologise to the British and chose martyrdom over deportation to Mecca. A film project announced with actor Prithviraj in the role of Haji last year created an uproar with Sangh Parivar outfits opposing it. The review panel is said to have viewed the rebellion as an attempt to establish a Caliphate. Had it succeeded, a Caliphate would have been established in the region and India would have lost part of its territory, sources said. It concluded that Haji was a rioter who established a Sharia court and beheaded many Hindus. The rioters did not spare secular Muslims. Those who died at their hands were non-believers. Many ‘Moplah martyrs’ facing trial died from disease or natural causes, and could not be treated as martyrs. Only a handful were executed by the government. Om Jee Upadhyay, Director (Research and Administration), ICHR, said the list would be modified as recommended and the dictionary published by October-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/387-moplah-martyrs-to-be-removed-from-dictionary/article36051972.ece

At an awareness programme organised by Jana Vignana Vedika on the Birla Compound premises here on Sunday, Mr. Krishnaswamy said people should show an interest in understanding the dynamics of heavenly bodies and their size and movement with relation to Earth so that we are in a better position to understand our surroundings. Practising Vaastu on Earth at a time when all the celestial bodies are in motion and keep their positions changing, determining a good direction was lack of common sense, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaastu-shastra-has-no-basis-astrophysicist/article36052635.ece
23 August 2021||MACHILIPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police recover stolen handbag||The handbag that was snatched by two thieves from a couple a few days ago was recovered with its contents intact by the police, and handed over to the victims on Sunday. According to the complaint lodged by Chinna Seshachary with the Hanuman Junction police, the accused had snatched away the bag while he and his wife Venkata Kumari were riding a motorcycle at around 4.30 a.m. on August 12.

23 August 2021||MALAPPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||High-speed Net comes to a deep jungle in Kerala||The Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS), a Union government initiative for skill development in rural areas, has brought high-speed internet to some of the remotest tribal hamlets deep inside the Nilambur jungle. For the first time, the Palakkayam, Vettilakkolli and Ambumala tribal hamlets got high-speed internet, thanks to long-distance Wi-Fi technology. Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) executive director Anwar Sadath, who visited the hamlets on Saturday, was jubilant about the 100-mbps internet. The JSS’s technical partner C4S provided support for the long-distance Wi-Fi on 5GHz frequency. With the help of five towers, 100-mbps internet is made available at Palakkayam, Ambumala, and Vettilakkolli hamlets in Chaliyar grama panchayat. No transmission loss “In this technology, there is no loss of transmission. We have set up the servers in such a way as to help a minimum of 250 users use the Net concurrently. And this can be easily boosted,” said C4S director V.J. Thomas. He said that using long-distance Wi-Fi technology, high-speed internet could be provided even up to 100 km without any transmission loss. While the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) provided Rs. 5 lakh, the JSS chipped in Rs. 2.02 lakh. “The biggest advantage of this technology is its low cost,” said V. Ummer Koya, JSS director.  The JSS will monitor the use of the internet through its own technology. “We have to have strict monitoring, especially since the area has Maoist threat. The use of internet will be restricted strictly to the hamlets’ residents,” said Mr. Ummer Koya. The base station has been set up at Indira Gandhi Memorial Residential Government School, Nilambur. From there, the internet provided by BSNL and Railnet will be transmitted to the tribal hamlets inside the jungle using long-distance Wi-Fi. Battery backup has also been arranged by utilising solar energy. With authorities P.V. Abdul Wahab, MP and chairman of JSS, visited the hamlets along with District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan last week. Mr. Wahab said the technology could be utilised effectively for online interaction with the authorities, including the Collector. The three hamlets were covered in the first phase, and the facility would be extended to more tribal colonies in other parts of the forest, Mr. Wahab added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/high-speed-net-comes-to-a-deep-jungle/article36051975.ece
23 August 2021||SIDDIPET,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana govt. tests three Mallannasagar reservoir pumps||Finally, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s dream came true. Godavari water was lifted from Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS) to Mallannasagar, one of the biggest reservoirs in Telangana. In the wee hours of Sunday, as pumps were being tested by engineer-in-chief Hari Ram and others, water gushed out of the vents. Out of the eight motors, three pumps were tested and would run for about 24 hours to ascertain that there were no technical snags. Each motor will pump 0.1 tmc ft water if it is run for a day and it was stated that by Monday morning, 0.3 tmc ft will flow into the reservoir. “The CM’s programme will be finalised in the next one week or 10 days. Meanwhile, we will test all the pumps,” said an irrigation official on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, as officials were in a jubilant mood having succeeded in getting all the villages under Mallannasagar vacated with not many problems, oustees were found sulking, and their outburst was open on social media. Many said that injustice was meted out to them and no one even bothered. “Our MLA (M. Raghunandan Rao) promised during his election campaign that oustees will be paid compensation on a par with those who lost land for irrigation projects at Siddipet and Gajwel. Where has he vanished?” asked an oustee from Toguta. “Officials worked on a war footing to see that all oustees vacate the villages. These are the same people who promised that villagers will be asked to leave only after handing over keys to the new houses. But, this promise was not fulfilled in case of several oustees. Where should they go now and what will be their fate?,” questioned another oustee. Some oustees suggested that the officials who worked for Mallannasagar be accommodated in the houses constructed at Mutrajpally to understand the problems being faced by the residents there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-govt-tests-three-mallannasagar-reservoir-pumps/article36051979.ece
23 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala to review COVID-19 situation||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is likely to chair an online meeting on Monday to weigh whether to reintroduce certain restrictions lifted for Onam, including the weekend lockdown, given the continuous increase in COVID-19 infections in the State. The Chief Minister is currently in Kannur. An official said Mr. Vijayan was likely to preside over the proposed meeting remotely with senior health, police and revenue officials joining him via a secure video conferencing link. Meanwhile, the State continued to report one of the highest infection rates in the country, with the test positivity rate (TPR) touching 16.41% on Sunday. A police official said there was fear that the TPR may rise again and push the State back to another severe phase of the pandemic. The relatively low death rate, a high recovery percentage, and enhanced vaccination coverage were mitigating factors. Nevertheless, reports of increasing COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalisation in Ernakulam, Kozhikode and Palakkad remained a cause of concern. An official said the meeting would dissect whether the dialling down of some restrictions for Onam holidays had accelerated the spread of the disease. Another official said the ban on indoor events and gatherings was unlikely to be scrapped anytime soon, given the spectre of a Delta variant driven third-wave. The mask and physical mandate and ban on indoor dining were likely to continue. Shopping malls and cinema halls will remain closed. Educational institutions Ideally, the government wanted to open educational institutions from the higher secondary level and upwards by September middle without risking another COVID-19 surge. The meeting will examine whether to reimpose the weekend lockdown and night curfew eased because of the Independence Day and Onam holidays. Some officials felt the reintroduction of the restrictions were necessary to pre-empt another protracted lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-to-review-covid-19-situation/article36051977.ece
23 August 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Seema backwardness due to lack of political will’||Speakers at an inaugural session of the third annual conference of Rayalaseema Economic Association (REA) held here on Sunday blamed the lack of political will and skewed vision of the politicians for the backwardness of the region. Former UGC emeritus fellow K. Munirathnam Naidu, who inaugurated the meet, attributed the region’s development to the presence of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), which had sustained in spite of the factionalism present among power mongering groups. “Rayalaseema lost Ballari (Karnataka) and Tiruthani (Tamil Nadu) due to the formation of States on linguistic basis. This indirectly led to loss of economic activity,” Prof. Naidu pointed out. He also called for development of each of the six districts(Chittoor, Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur, Nellore and Prakasam) into units nurturing Information Technology so as to capture the lost ground. In his keynote address, a professor of political science and public administration at Sri Venkateswara University(SVU) M.A. Hussain observed the British and Nehruvian policies of having addressed development issues in the country, which had witnessed ups and downs during Chandrasekhar and P.V. Narasimha Rao regimes. With the BJP government at the Centre encouraging smaller States, he saw the possibility of Rayalaseema once again raising its voice seeking Statehood. A. Ranga Reddy, REA president and a retired professor of Economics, found factionalism on the wane due to the entry of educated offsprings and the movement of influential families to urban areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/seema-backwardness-due-to-lack-of-political-will/article36052151.ece

23 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Urban civil societies up the ante against new tax regime||Upping the ante against the new property tax regime based on the capital value, about 250 civil society organisations have came together to form ‘Pattana Pourasanghala Aikya Vedika’, or Urban Civil Societies’ United Front, to mount pressure on the government. The decision emerged in a meeting held virtually with the representatives of the civil society organisations from all the 13 districts on Sunday. The meeting was facilitated by the Tax Payers’ Association (TPA), Vijayawada; Visakhapatnam Apartments’ Welfare Association (VARWA), Greater Visakha Colonies Welfare Associations’ Federation (NIVAS), and the AP Urban Citizens’ Federation (APUCF). ‘Against Constitution’ While former Union Secretary and social activist E.A.S. Sarma was named honorary president of the united front, MLC K.S. Lakshman Rao was named its president. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sarma said levying of property tax based on the capital value was against the constitution. He said it was not right on the part of the governments to exempt corporate organisations from several taxes and burden the common public. He called upon the people to join hands and fight against the policies being made by the governments unilaterally without involving the citizens. Mr. Lakshman Rao said the implementation of the new tax regime, without the involvement of the State Finance Commission and discussion in the Legislative Council, was against the constitution. ‘Additional burden’ AP State Bar Council member Sunkara Rajendra Prasad said property tax based on capital value was another form of Income Tax, and it caused a lot of burden on the taxpayers. He said there was no proper channel for people to raise issues against an order, and the objections raised so far were not considered. The new outfit decided to explore legal options to counter the new tax regime, apart from mounting pressure on the government through the people’s movement. District and city level JAC would be formed, and representations would be submitted to all the elected representatives and officials concerned across the State. The demands of the front included withdrawal of the new tax regime and user charge on garbage collection, and reconsideration of tax on vacant lands. APUCF convener Ch. Babu Rao, TPA secretary M.V. Anjaneyulu, NIVAS general secretary P. Narayana Murthy, and VARWA general secretary B.B. Ganesh were among others who took part in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/urban-civil-societies-up-the-ante-against-new-tax-regime/article36052603.ece
23 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI bats for TIDCO housing beneficiaries||CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna on Sunday said the party had called for a round-table meeting on August 24 (Tuesday) to press for its demand that the government hand over the TIDCO housing units to the beneficiaries. In a statement, the CPI leader said the TDP government had laid out a plan for construction of 7,58,788 housing units under the AP Township and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDCO) in 110 cities and towns in the State. Construction of a large number of units was completed by February 2019 and many other units were nearing completion. At the time of elections, the then Opposition leader Jagan Mohan Reddy promised that if voted to power, his party would allot houses to the beneficiaries free of cost. The government would return the money of the beneficiaries who had already paid by then and the State would bear the entire cost and make the payments to the banks. The CPI leader said even after 26 months of assuming power, the Chief Minister had not fulfilled his promise made to the beneficiaries who had paid anything from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 1 lakh and were eagerly waiting for allotment of houses. Responding to a protest by the beneficiaries in the past, the government ordered preparing the final list of the beneficiaries and asked officials to make ready the eligibility letters. “But the housing units continue to be elusive,” said Mr. Ramakrishna. He said the party would build pressure on the government to expedite the works and hand over the units to the beneficiaries without any further delay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-bats-for-tidco-housing-beneficiaries/article36052684.ece

23 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Attempts to privatise LIC will fail: Shreekant Mishra||The attempts being made for the last 30 years to privatise the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India will fail once again, All India Insurance Employees’ Association (AIIEA) general secretary Shreekant Mishra has said. “It is not being opposed from an ideological standpoint, but due to the fear of the likely impact of the strategic disinvestment of the Central government’s stake on the policyholders and the overall economy,” Mr. Mishra says. “The Centre considers privatisation of LIC as a safe bet only to wriggle out of the economic crisis by tapping the insurance giant’s massive pile of cash that runs into Rs. 38 lakh crore,” he argues. Mr. Mishra was speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the South Central Zone Insurance Employees’ Federation’s 12th zonal conference here on Sunday. AIIEA president V. Ramesh was present. “In a bid to privatise the LIC, the Centre has incorporated the amendments required to be made to the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, in the Finance Bill. The valuation of LIC by an American firm is under way. The IPO is most likely to hit the capital markets in the last quarter of FY 2021-22. Against this backdrop, we have mobilised the support of political formations, which are normally friendly to the government, the policyholders and the general public. With this, the Centre will eventually drop the idea of selling LIC,” Mr. Mishra observed. He said that some early proponents of privatisation of LIC were now convinced that retaining it in the public sector was in the interest of all. “Particularly, the policyholders still rate it (the LIC) as the best in class with an impeccable record in claim settlement,” Mr. Mishra said. “The inbuilt strength of LIC is going to make it very tough for the Centre to offload its stake. Then the markets should have the kind of appetite to absorb even as little as 10% of the shares that may be put up for sale initially, given the country’s economic woes,” he pointed out. “An insurance product is basically a promise, and the ‘sale of a promise’ is better backed by governments rather than private companies, as it involves a huge amount of public money that ought to be in the public domain,” Mr. Mishra reasoned. Merger demand Coming to the sale of its stake in the general insurance companies, the government appeared to be not sure of the repercussions of privatisation, while the employees’ demand was that they (the United India Insurance, the Oriental Insurance Company and National Insurance) should be merged like some PSU banks were consolidated. “But, there is apparently a doublespeak on this count,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/attempts-to-privatise-lic-will-fail-shreekant-mishra/article36052605.ece

The party has released a 15-point charter of demands, which includes universal vaccination and release of persons arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Addressing the media here on Sunday, CPI(M) State secretary P. Madhu said the two-day State Committee meeting held in the city from August 20 had urged people to fight against the “anti people” policies of the State and Central governments. “Andhra Pradesh is being subjected to discrimination by the Centre on several counts. Under the garb of river management boards, the Centre has plans to take control over rivers, canals, reservoirs and projects in the State. The Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), which is a symbol of Telugus’ fighting spirit, is being privatised. The Centre has no intention to launch the Kadapa steel plant, or the Visakhapatnam Railway Zone as envisaged in the Reorganisation Act,” Mr. Madhu said. Funds were not being released for paying compensation to the Polavaram evacuees, he added. “The ruling YSRCP and the Opposition TDP are silent on the Centre’s discriminatory attitude.

23 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||DBT under YSR free power scheme evokes good response||The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under the ‘YSR free power’ scheme has evoked a good response from the farmers in all the 13 districts with around 92% of them giving their consent to it. The power utilities have created awareness among the farmers about the DBT and explained its benefits. The stage is thus set for the installation of meters, which facilitates availing of the scheme. Though the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has fixed a tariff of Rs. 5.73 per unit on an average for agriculture power supply, there will not be any burden on the farmers as the government will bear the entire expenditure in the form of subsidy, according to an official release. It said the DBT scheme was implemented as a pilot project in Srikakulam district, and it was successful with 98.6% of the farmers agreeing to the installation of meters. The ultimate aim of the government is to ensure that all the farmers in the State get free power for the next 30 years. Under the DBT scheme, the government will deposit the entire amount towards electricity bills in the accounts of the farmers. The farmers will then pay the power utilities. The farmers will clearly know the quantum of power consumed by them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dbt-under-ysr-free-power-scheme-evokes-good-response/article36052606.ece

Naidu has accused the State government of failing to ensure timely supply of quality seed and fertilisers to the farmers this season. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Naidu said the situation was so bad that many farmers were on the verge of quitting agriculture. “The government has to be solely blamed for the plight of the farmers. There is no proper supply of seed and fertilisers. On top of it, the government is determined to install meters for agricultural pump-sets. The government’s policies are forcing the farmers to press the panic button,” he said. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy owed an explanation on why there was scarcity of urea for over 50 lakh acres this season, the TDP leader said. “The government needs to take measures to ensure that there is sufficient supply of urea. The farmers are also facing problems because of spurious seed, fertilisers and pesticide entering the market in a big way,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-failed-to-supply-quality-seed-to-farmers-tdp/article36052607.ece

23 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cancellation of Palasa special draws flak from commuters||The cancellation of 08531/32 Palasa-Visakhapatnam-Palasa Special Express, which meets the needs of scores of commuters from Palasa, Srikakulam Road, as also from other intermediate stations to Visakhapatnam city, even after the sharp decline in COVID-19 cases, after the second wave, is drawing flak from commuters. The original passenger train, which was running to full capacity before the outbreak of the pandemic, saw a dip in commuters after it was converted into a special express. The non-issuance of unreserved tickets, withdrawal of the MST (Monthly Season Ticket) facility and non-issuance of tickets through the booking counters, apart from the pandemic threat, are some of the reasons for the drop in patronage after the first wave, say commuters. The maximum ticket sales for this train are through the booking counters. Train no. 08531 Palasa – Visakhapatnam Special Express is very convenient for daily commuters, particularly office-goers, working in the city as it leaves Palasa at 5.25 a.m., reaches Srikakulam Road Station at 6.20 a.m. and Visakhapatnam Junction at 9.25 a.m. The commuters demanded its restoration as there are no daily special trains between Palasa and Visakhapatnam between 00.22 hours (midnight) and 9.20 a.m towards Visakhapatnam from Palasa. They seek quick restoration of this train as almost all offices, schools and colleges have reopened after the second wave and this train also serves the travel needs of students. In the absence of convenient trains, commuters are travelling in the 02873 Howrah – Yesvantapur Special, squatting on the floor of the 2 S (general sitting compartment) in the absence of seats. “The Palasa special also provides a convenient link to passengers from Naupada, Ponduru, Tilaru, Chipurupalli, Vizianagaram and Kottavalasa to the city,” says Ravi, a commuter from Srikakulam, who travels to Visakhapatnam regularly. During the first wave of COVID-19, all trains were cancelled and subsequently many were restored after permission was obtained from the Railway Board by the authorities concerned. Train no.08531/32 Palasa-Visakhapatnam-Palasa was run as a special express with effect from November 16, 2020, after the first wave. When there was a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases during the second wave, it was cancelled again with effect from April 30, 2021, from Visakhapatnam and from Palasa with effect from May 1. “Since this is being run as a special train, permission of the Railway Board is required for its restoration, each time after its cancellation. A proposal has been submitted by the railway authorities seeking its restoration and the approval is expected soon,” say railway sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cancellation-of-palasa-special-draws-flak-from-commuters/article36052692.ece
23 August 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Visakhapatnam Public Library turns a new page||The Visakhapatnam Public Library is all set to throw its doors open to its newly-developed second floor spread over 8,000 sq.ft. area. The completion of the project marks a new beginning for the library that was inaugurated in December 2003. Located at Dwarkanagar, the library is today the exact opposite of the perceived image of dusty book shelves, creaking fans and dim lights. In its new look, the library extends a warm welcome with its bright colourful walls with motivational slogans, well-lit corridors, activity corners, conference hall and a hum of airconditioners. The new addition of the second floor has general sections, children’s activity room, a Gandhian section and a conference hall. “We plan to make the children’s section with a forest theme by putting up pictures of forests and animals on the walls. The idea is to mark this dedicated place for children where they can come and pick up books to read or participate in various activities like story-telling or drawing,” said D.S. Varma, secretary of the library, who was instrumental in taking forward the renovation concept of the 18-year-old library. Among the new features, the library has entry through door access systems, e-learning facilities for online mock examinations, and providing a plethora of competitive examination books as well as access to The Hindu newspaper for career aspirants. The idea of the library was conceived in 1996 by a group of like-minded citizens that included former mayor D.V. Subba Rao, D.Ch. Tirupathi Raju, M. Varahala Chetty, A. Prasanna Kumar, K.C. Reddy, B.S. Sastry and N.V.S. Murthy. While the foundation stone was laid on October 23, 1999, it began operating from July 15, 2004. The library today has more than 42,000 members from all age groups. It has an inventory of 50,000 books with a plan to add more. The first floor, which was renovated in 2019, has designated rooms for studying, general reading and a computer lab. Inside the reading rooms, all one can hear is occasional sound of turning pages or scraping chairs. Speaking about the transformation of the public library, Prof. Prasanna Kumar, former Rector of Andhra University and founding director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said, “The goal of the library is to bring children back to books and to raise a library with difference, enabling people of all ages to read in soothing ambience. Right now we are passing through a civilisational crisis. During this challenging time, the Visakhapatnam Public Library instils hope in the youth by providing them with a window of opportunities and solace for the senior citizens.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/visakhapatnam-public-library-turns-a-new-page/article36052688.ece

BSNL, LIC of India, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and other public sector undertakings had over Rs. 50 lakh crore worth of properties across the country and they needed to be protected in the interest of the public and the employees of the respective companies, he added. Mr. Ravindranath, who offered floral tributes to CPI and AITUC leader Bugata Suribabu on his first death anniversary, spoke to The Hindu on the sidelines of the condolence meeting. “Loss-making is only an excuse to sell off the public properties. The national wealth created in the last 75 years of Independent India cannot be looted with so called privatisation policies. Moreover, the government is not in a position to take the opinion of the public and stakeholders. There is no discussion in Parliament over such serious subjects which would have a long-term impact on the country,” he said. The AITUC Central Executive Committee would meet in New Delhi on September 5 to chalk out an action plan for the protection of the interests of the workforce. He indicated that AITUC and other unions would join hands for a united fight against the Union government over the disinvestment policies. He said that the trade unions would also fight against the three farm Acts and four Labour Codes which were detrimental to the interests of over 60 crore people of the country. Earlier, CPI district secretary Bugata Ashok urged Mr. Ravindranath to look into the issues of the workers in various industries, including jute mills, of the district. He said that many companies failed to pay the statutory PF and gratuity to the workers after announcing lockouts in violation of the Labour Department rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/disinvestment-leading-to-loot-of-national-wealth-aituc/article36052637.ece

Along with JSP leaders Vanka Narasinga Rao and Dantuluri Ramesh Raju, he visited Kotagadredu village of Gurla mandal to study the socio-economic condition of the artisans. The weavers, Mr. Mohana Rao said, told them that they were dependent on textile companies and traders for work as they were unable to invest and market the products. Mr. Mohana Rao said that many artisans living in Sircilla of Telangana, Chirala, Mangalagiri, Uppada and other places in the State were able to get a decent income by directly selling their products to customers. “Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has recently visited Ponduru of Srikakulam to observe the khadi units there.

23 August 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||Two ITDA employees suspended||Two employees of the sub-divisional mobile magistrate office at the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) headquarters in Bhadrachalam were placed under suspension on charges of gross negligence in discharge of their designated duties. Collector D. Anudeep on Saturday suspended Senior Assistant Rasheed and Record Assistant Sk. Waheed for alleged dereliction of duties during a surprise inspection of the office at the ITDA headquarters in the temple town, official sources said. The surprise inspection was conducted following a slew of complaints from aggrieved persons against the staff members, including the head of the office. The Collector inspected the attendance records, office files and court records. He reportedly found several lapses including absenteeism and gross dereliction of duties on the part of some of the staff members concerned. The Collector inquired about the attendance details of the sub-divisional magistrate concerned and recorded the statement of the record assistant for appropriate action, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/2-itda-employees-suspended/article36052450.ece
23 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Doctors flag ‘Quarantine Myopia’ among children||It has been almost a year and a half that children have been at home, and the idea of education or entertainment is centered around digital screens. This means they are spending more time staring into mobile phones. Citing this unprecedented situation, ophthalmologists say they are seeing an increase in cases of Myopia (near sightedness) among children under 15 years since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. Squint-eye cases too The specialist doctors from Dr Agarwals Eye Hospital say more cases of ‘squint-eye’ is also being observed in children. “Our figures show that there is a 100% increase in annual myopia progression and a five-fold increase in annual squint-eye cases among children of 5-15 years during the pandemic year,” says Palak Macwana, consultant ophthalmologist at the private hospital. Dr. Macwana adds that during the lockdown period, getting work done involved computers, laptops, and mobile phones or tablets, which was taken up without frequent breaks. Screen time for academic or other purposes increased substantially. This visual stress could be a cause for squinting and has an accelerating effect on myopia progression. Consultant opthalmologist T. Srinivas opines the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in accelerating the problem. Since keeping oneself and family members was the ultimate priority, people held themselves back from going for general consultation with doctors, including opthalmologists. Consultations skipped “Since children had to skip consultations with opthalmologists, some of them continued to use spectacles with inadequate power which put strain on eyes. This further increased refractive error (eye sight power). Increased usage of digital screens without taking breaks compounded the problem. Dimensions of eye ball changes until one reaches the age of 21 except in a few cases. Usually, eyesight power changes in the growing age. Usage of spectacles with inadequate power and spending excess time staring into digital screens could lead to further changes in eyesight power,” explains Dr Srinivas. Attending online classes cannot be avoided currently. So Dr Macwana suggests that children use laptops or desktops instead of mobile phones as the distance between the eyes and a bigger screen is more. Exposure to sunlight for one to two hours a day including outdoor games, along with a healthy and well-balanced diet, is recommended.  Usage of spectacles with inadequate power and spending excess time staring into digital screens could lead to further changes in eyesight power. T.

23 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||OU to ban protests and celebrations at Arts College||Osmania University Arts College — once the epicentre of the Telangana movement will no more be available for students protests, meetings or birthday celebrations of student or political leaders. The OU administration has taken the decision not to allow any meetings at the college to restore the image of the university that has eroded over the last few years given the political meetings and student protests. “Arts College is now known for protests than its academic credentials and we want to wipe out that image,” a senior professor said. Walls defaced “Arts College walls are defaced with posters or flexis of political leaders and student leaders on their birthdays at regular intervals by various student organisations. The architectural glory is also affected. This was never the culture in the university and we want to restore the image by avoiding such practices,” he said. The Vice-Chancellor Prof. D. Ravinder said the Executive Council was unanimous in its decision on this issue. However, he said the varsity prefers to engage the student organisations in implementing it. “We want to convince them first that it is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that that perception in the society changes and glory of Arts College is restored,” he said. Prof. Ravinder said the varsity was aware of the democratic rights of students and faculty and they would not be stifled. The varsity has identified two spaces where students can carry out their protests and also engage the media organisations to express their dissent on all issues. The Vice-Chancellor had appealed to the student community during his Independence Day speech as well to work with the administration to change people’s perception about the university. Non-academic activities will damage the university’s reputation and deter good students from joining the university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ou-to-ban-protests-and-celebrations-at-arts-college/article36052438.ece
23 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Revanth: CM mum on Eatala’s corruption after he joined BJP||Telangana Congress president Revanth Reddy is surprised at the silence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the ‘corruption’ of former Minister Eatala Rajender after he joined the BJP when initially he made a huge hue and cry. Nexus “Why has the Chief Minister suddenly turned silent on the corruption of Mr. Rajender and what happened to the allegations that were splashed across the media,” he asked here on Sunday. “Isn’t that an indication of KCR’s understanding with the BJP,” he said. In an informal interaction with the media in Hyderabad, he alleged that the aircraft used by Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy to discuss the entry of Mr. Rajender into BJP was arranged by KCR himself. “Can they reveal who arranged that aircraft if not the CM, he asked?” Mr. Reddy ridiculed the allegations that Congress was not serious on Huzurabad bypoll to help ‘someone else’ win. On Dalit Bandhu, Mr. Reddy challenged the TRS MLAs to campaign in their respective constituencies if they had so much confidence in the scheme. “The Chief Minister owes at least Rs. 1 crore to each Dalit family for all the promises made and broken and not just Rs. 10 lakh. ‘KCR and Deceit’ are like Siamese twins,” he charged. IAS appointment Appointment of Dalit IAS officer Rahul Bojja in the CMO was nothing but insulting him, he said, adding that Mr. Bojja, who otherwise is a good officer, will have to work with the tag of KCR doing a favour to him to avoid criticism from the society. Mr. Praveen Kumar too, had to leave the service suffocated by KCR, he claimed. On whether Congress was willing to work with Mr. Praveen Kumar, he said such decisions have to be taken by the Political Affairs Committee and so far no such discussion had emerged. Meanwhile, he termed Mr. Kishan Reddy’s Ashirwad Yatra and the proposed walkathon of BJP president Bandi Sanjay as an internal tussle for one upmanship. Deeksha Mr. Reddy said that the Dalit Girijana Deeksha at Moodu Chintalapally in Yadadri district would be held on August 24 and 25 to expose the failed promises of KCR. He said, “Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had adopted this village and promised the moon for them. We will expose all his false assurances.” He reiterated the party’s stand on Huzurabad elections saying the committee headed by former Deputy Chief Minister Damodar Rajanarasimha will finalise the candidate and poll strategy soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cm-mum-on-eatala-after-he-joined-bjp/article36052447.ece
23 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A voice of confidence at Tokyo Olympics||It has been over two weeks that the Tokyo Olympics came to a close, and while the achievements of Indian sportspersons is still being talked about, there is someone else who made her mark during the world’s biggest sporting event — behind the mike! At 43, Radhika Reddy, former National Games gold medallist in kabaddi, feels on cloud nine over what was a successful stint as the only woman commentator for Sony TV for the Olympics. “I feel proud being the only woman commentator cutting across four languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and English) in which the Olympics was telecast live,” she says. For someone who has been a regular TV commentator for the past six years, starting with Pro Kabaddi League before branching out into Premier Badminton League and Khelo India Games, Ms Radhika has found her comfort zone and is ready for any challenge as a broadcaster. “Honestly, when I came to know 20 days before the Tokyo Games that I would be broadcasting for Sony TV, I was a little hesitant. But, hours of preparation given the fact that the Olympics means 11,000 athletes competing in 33 disciplines and 300 events for two weeks helped me learn many things about so many sports,” she avers. A big advantage for her was the liberty of mixing English words with Telugu. “That really helped me a lot too, for many television viewers are pretty knowledgeable about English terminology in commentary,” the Hyderabadi says. “The biggest challenge was that you have to be ready to chip in as a commentator midway through a match in any discipline. So, keeping track of all that was happening in Tokyo was a huge task but I enjoyed it thoroughly,” she recalls. She turned to many senior commentators for advice, says the MBA graduate. With her husband Srinivas Reddy as coach of Indian team in the World Cup and the Asian Games kabaddi championships and also for different franchises in PKL, Ms Radhika could always bank on him for proper guidance. So, after the Olympics high, what is next for her? “Now, I can unhesitatingly take up any challenge as a commentator in any language given the knowledge I have gained from Olympics,” she signs off.  Hours of preparation given the fact that the Olympics means 11,000 athletes competing in 33 disciplines and 300 events for two weeks helped me learn about so many sports.

23 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Police authorised to detain vehicles with pending challans’||Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar on Sunday clarified on the ‘false news’ being interpreted on social media about the Telangana High Court orders claiming “traffic police have no powers to seize the vehicles for non-payment of challans”. He said that High Court has issued no such order and some persons with reasons best known to them have been issuing misleading statements in the media and social media creating confusion among the public. Further, it is clarified that in its order dated August 11, 2021, disposing of the writ petition number 18611 of 2021, the High Court had directed the writ petitioner to submit a fresh application to the police seeking the release of his vehicle as per law within two weeks from the date of the order and the police have to consider the same and pass an appropriate order in another eight weeks’ time thereafter. Accordingly, the said person has appeared before Rajendranagar Traffic Police on August 19, and paid the pending challan against the said vehicle as per Rule 167 of the CMVRs, 1989 and got the vehicle released as per law. “But for the reasons best known to him, the writ petitioner, hiding these facts, has been issuing misleading statements by misquoting the High Court’s orders. This is the intentional spreading of false news,” the Commissioner said. He said that all the persons who have been indulging in spreading this false news must read the High Court’s order and stop indulging in spreading of misinformation. It is reiterated that as per Rule 167 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, the police are authorised to detain a vehicle that has any pending traffic violation challan which is more than 90 days old and regarding which the vehicle owner has been intimated by the police at least once either electronically or over a call. It is the duty of the vehicle owners to regularly check whether their vehicle has been driven in contravention of any traffic rules and if there are any traffic violation challans issued against their vehicle, they shall verify the evidence and pay the penalty, Mr. Sajjanar said. “If they notice any discrepancy in the challans, they can report the same to the authorities online which will be verified and rectified, if any,” the officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-authorised-to-detain-vehicles-with-pending-challans/article36052433.ece

Funding support This will be the second such facility to be accorded the status with the Pune-based NIAB being the first one. Funding support for both institutions will come under the PM-CARES funds. More facilities to regulate the testing of COVID-19 vaccines will help in quick release of vaccine batches for prevention and treatment of viral infection. These two are autonomous institutes of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and are expected to test approximately 60 batches of vaccines per month. Easing supply Considering that the facilities are located in proximity to the vaccine manufacturing hubs of the nation, logistics for vaccine manufacturing and supply are expected to be eased up. The financial support through PM-CARES and the relentless efforts of the two institutes have enabled the rapid upgrade and setting up of the state-of-the-art, modern ‘GLP compliant’ vaccine testing facilities. This would further strengthen the vaccine supply chain and boost the massive vaccination drive in India, said an official release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/niab-upgraded-as-central-drugs-lab-for-vaccine-testing/article36052421.ece

Kishan Reddy has not spent a single rupee from the MPLAD funds for developmental activities in his Secunderabad constituency. At a press conference on Sunday, he questioned the Jan Ashirwada Yatra of Mr. Kishan Reddy in his constituency, when he could not spend any money on its development. “The data is available with the statistical department of the Union government. Mr. Kishan Reddy’s criticism of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is just a joke as behind the screens, both are working together,” he said. He said it was an open secret that both BJP and TRS were working together while criticising each other in public just to mislead people, adding that people were not naive not to realise this ‘secret understanding’. He also said that the Central government has utterly failed in COVID relief measures while Mr. Kishan Reddy spent time visiting hospitals just to pose for the media. The lapses in vaccine distribution and oxygen shortage has exposed the Modi government. The Congress leader added that the cadre was energised with the appointment of Revanth Reddy as PCC president and it was sure to romp home in the 2023 Assembly elections winning at least 72 seats. “The Congress cadre should expose KCR’s failures,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kishan-spent-nothing-from-his-mplad-funds/article36052448.ece

At a press conference here on Sunday, he said that Mr. Arvind doesn’t have the stature to talk about KCR leave aside criticising him or his policies. He demanded Mr. Arvind to ensure establishment of the Turmeric Board as promised in the election campaign first or else people would teach him a lesson. “He has no stature to criticise ministers like K.T. Rama Rao, Harish Rao and MLC Kalvakuntla Kavitha, who participated in the Telangana agitation and won people’s confidence,” he said. He also asked Mr. Arvind not to speak on dynasty politics and said there was a huge list in the BJP of children of national leaders in politics and enjoying power. Ridiculing that the BJP was blind when economic offenders left the country, he said it was laughable that Mr. Arvind speaks of corruption in the TRS government. The TRS MLA also claimed that the Central government was copying all the schemes introduced by the Chief Minister for the State and even Union ministers praised schemes like Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya but did not extend any financial support. He said that the BJP will never be accepted by the people of Telangana who have been constantly reposing faith in Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-mla-warns-arvind-for-remarks-against-cm/article36052449.ece

The cash-starved corporation is presently earning a revenue of over Rs. 9 crore a day through sale of tickets. “The State government is ready to extend a guarantee for a loan of another Rs. 500 crore for payment of pending Credit Cooperative Society’s dues,” he said on Sunday during a review meeting with senior officials on RTC’s financial situation.

The amount pertaining to budgetary allocation was being released on a monthly basis while the government allowed the corporation to raise Rs. 1,000 crore, as part of off budget allocations. The loan of Rs. 500 crore was released and the balance Rs. 500 crore would be released soon.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Eatala ‘burning’ issue loses steam||The Panchayat Raj department has issued a strong worded circular a couple of days ago barring the relatives of elected representatives of rural local bodies from attending official meetings. Panchayat Raj commissioner said that attendance of husbands/relatives of elected representatives in official meetings was illegal. He warned the department officials and district collectors to keep an eye on such happenings lest they too, would be held responsible for the developments. The orders follow a letter addressed by the Forum for Good Governance to the Governor expressing concern over relatives having a say in official discussions. The development, though a bit delayed, should hopefully bring in some discipline in the functioning of rural local bodies.   The political scene in the State witnessed some hot moments in the past few months since the expulsion of former Minister Eatala Rajender from the State Cabinet and his subsequent resignation from his MLA post. Inquiries were ordered into his alleged land deals and the ruling party went to town over the alleged irregularities committed by him. But leaders have become silent on these issues ever since Mr. Rajender announced his entry into the BJP. A section of political parties started questioning the intent of the government on the hype that was created against Mr. Rajender and the subsequent stoic silence that followed. Is it yet another instance of “much ado about nothing” or is there any significant political development in the offing? Only time will reveal.   Eatala Rajender suffered a major setback as his confidante and vice-chairman of Karimnagar District Cooperative Central Bank Pingali Ramesh resigned from the BJP and joined TRS. Mr. Ramesh said he had resigned from BJP as he could not adjust himself to the party’s ideology. He rejoined the TRS as he was attracted by the development agenda of the party. No wonder that everyone joins a ruling party expressing their liking to its programmes.   From the day Telangana Cabinet approved the implementation of Dalit Bandhu scheme during the first week this month, the opposition parties in the State are left with no option but to talk about the scheme. The subject is such that the opposition parties have no option of opposing the scheme and criticise the government except for demanding its implementation on a larger scale than the pilot project basis launched in Vasalamarri village of Yadadri-Bhongir district and Huzurabad Assembly Constituency in Karimnagar district. According to a ruling party leader, the opposition parties’ reaction to the announcement and launch of the scheme was exactly on the lines wished by the government – giving it free publicity not by willing but inevitable political situation.

But, these services continue to be suspended even now. As a result, autorickshaw drivers are charging arbitrarily.

I urge the GHMC to look into these issues. K.

I request the authorities concerned to arrange necessary canopy structures along with a few chairs for the benefit of senior citizens. K. Ramayanam, Balanagar   JJ Nagar post office is an offshoot of ECIL post office with the former getting a new pincode 500103 and the latter retaining 500062. However, this is not getting reflected in the system and therefore, we are not able to change the pincode in our passports, Aadhaar cards and other important documents. All letters reach the ECIL post office and are then redirected to JJ Nagar P.O. leading to delay. I request the authorities concerned to incorporate the new pincode in all systems. D.

23 August 2021||Jalna,||‘Railways suffered Rs. 36,000 cr. loss during pandemic’||Union Minister Raosaheb Danve on Sunday said the Railways had suffered losses to the tune of Rs. 36,000 crore during the novel coronavirus pandemic, and termed goods trains as the real revenue generators for the national transporter. He also said that a bullet train project would be executed along the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, which is under construction. The Minister of State for Railways was speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony of an underbridge at Jalna railway station. “The passenger train segment always runs into losses. Since increasing the ticket fares affects the passengers, we cannot do so. During the pandemic, the Railways suffered losses of Rs. 36,000 crore,” he said. “Only goods trains generate revenue. During the pandemic, these trains played an important role in carrying goods and providing relief to people,” the Minister added. Speaking about the bullet train, he said this project would be rolled out along the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway as it was necessary for people. The Railways had undertaken the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor project, which would connect Navi Mumbai to Delhi, Mr. Danve said. He assured doubling of tracks between Nanded and Manmad stations, and said he would check if the Jalna-Khamgaon railway line was viable or not. Hitting out at his detractors, Mr. Danve said he was being attacked from all quarters. “But I become stronger after facing criticism,” he said. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope, who was also present at the event, said the State government had sanctioned a hospital in Jalna for treatment of those suffering from mental illnesses. He said the facility would benefit the Marathwada region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/railways-suffered-rs-36000-cr-loss-during-pandemic/article36052341.ece

23 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||In drive to save energy, DMRC to instal LED lights at 155 spots||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has taken up a drive to save energy by replacing its existing conventional lights with LED lights at 155 locations: covering metro stations, depots, parking and other areas, which were constructed or opened for the public under DMRC’s Phase-I (2005) and Phase-II (2010). The DMRC said it has completed 75% of the drive by installing around one lakh LED lights in recent months. The remaining 25% of the drive will be completed by the end of October 2021. Around 35,000 LED lights will be installed in the remaining portion of these locations, the DMRC added. A DMRC spokesperson said the average LED lasts 50,000 operating hours or more, which is 40 times more than the lifespan of an incandescent bulb. In addition, LED lights have an energy efficiency component, which makes them consume a very low amount of power. “The LED-based light system will help DMRC save around half of the energy expenditure vis a vis the existing lighting system. As a result, the whole cost of installing these lights will be recovered by DMRC in around two years,” the spokesperson said. Undertaking this drive at already operational stations was a challenging task for the DMRC maintenance teams. As there is regular movement of people, the work had to be executed in the night due to safety reasons, which increased the installation time, officials said. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has already implemented LED-based lighting solutions at its Phase-III stations and a similar system will be adopted for upcoming Phase-IV stations also.  The LED-based light system will help DMRC save around half of the energy expenditure vis a vis the existing lighting system DMRC spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/in-drive-to-save-energy-dmrc-to-instal-led-lights-at-155-spots/article36052338.ece

23 August 2021||Pune,||Minister Eknath Shinde dismisses Rane’s ‘rubber stamp’ allegations||A day after Union Minister and senior BJP leader Narayan Rane claimed that Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Minister Eknath Shinde was allegedly ‘fed up’ with his party and on the lookout for ‘alternatives’, Mr. Shinde on Sunday dismissed the allegations as ‘baseless’ and accused Mr. Rane of trying to sow confusion within the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Mr. Rane, a former Shiv Sainik who is now the Sena’s bete noire and a bitter critic of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, had earlier dubbed Mr. Shinde, who heads the Urban Development Department, a “rubber stamp” who could not function independently unless his decisions were approved by Mr. Thackeray. Mr. Shinde, speaking in Gadchiroli, said that the Chief Minister never interfered in his department’s decisions. “I have complete freedom to make decisions for my department. I have taken many such decisions on my own, such as approval for the historical and ambitious unified development control and promotion regulations to boost the real estate sector or the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg (expressway). So, there is no truth in his [Mr. Rane’s] allegations,” the Sena minister said. Mr. Shinde is seen as a bulwark of his party in the Thane region. It has long been speculated that his exit could leave the Sena gasping for survival, and that the BJP would use every guile to woo him into its fold. “Unless ‘Matoshree’ [the Thackeray family’s residence] approves, Mr. Shinde cannot sign on a file. So, he is tired and frustrated and is searching for a way out,” Mr. Rane had claimed during his recent Jan Ashirwad Yatra. In response, Mr. Shinde accused the BJP of attempting to drive a wedge within the tripartite MVA alliance, while hitting back at Mr. Rane. “He [Mr. Rane] was the State’s Chief Minister during the Sena-BJP alliance government (1995-99), so he should know that any important decision or policy must be taken with the CM’s consent. As a Union Minister, he should know that if he wants to take any policy decision, he will have to get it cleared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Mr. Shinde said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/minister-eknath-shinde-dismisses-ranes-rubber-stamp-allegations/article36052346.ece

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||‘China will not get drawn into a serious security role in Afghanistan’||How is China likely to deal with the Taliban? Despite Beijing’s early positive signaling that it “stands ready” to work with the yet-to-be-formed new government in Kabul and its open celebration of the manner of the U.S. exit, there remain deep apprehensions in China about the Taliban and its links to jihadist groups. With an “obsessive focus” in Beijing on Afghanistan being “a graveyard of empires”, China will not get drawn into a serious security role and its economic engagement will likely remain calibrated, ultimately depending on whether the new regime can gain international legitimacy, says Andrew Small , senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund and author of “The China Pakistan Axis”. Edited excerpts:  China said shortly after the Taliban takeover, that it “stands ready” to work with Afghanistan. What have you made of China’s response so far to the events in Kabul? You already had these signals being given, particularly with the meeting that took place in July between Mullah Baradar and Wang Yi which was this unusually well-publicised interaction between the two sides. China has been preparing for a changeover here in a way that is more serious than had been the case in the preceding period. They’ve had this long-standing relationship with the Taliban and were one of the few actors to deal with them, even in exile in Pakistan. They want to have a benign relationship with the Taliban. This is something that at this stage they can offer – just this kind of diplomatic signalling for the moment. I don’t think it changes a lot of the apprehensions that are there, but it’s indicative, particularly keeping the Chinese Embassy in Kabul open in the manner that they did, that they have a certain level of confidence in the way that some of these early dynamics with them will be handled. Some of those apprehensions have in the past dominated how China looks at dealing with the Taliban, specifically its links to jihadist groups active in China’s Xinjiang region. Do those concerns still very much remain? They do. Certainly you have seen this well-prepared propaganda operation on the Chinese side to make the most of the U.S. withdrawal and try to use this to indicate this should be treated as a signal to other U.S. allies. They’ve been preparing for the U.S. withdrawal for some time. I don’t think they had anticipated it would be conducted in such a disastrous manner. So there’s a certain amount of additional hay that they can make with this, but they didn’t want to see this happen. That’s very clear. They did not want to see the U.S. withdraw in advance of some kind of a political settlement in Afghanistan. They wanted to see the Taliban somewhat constrained by the need to reach political agreement with other parties in Afghanistan and to some extent being a little bit more beholden to other international actors as well. The concern now is they’re taking power in a maximally-emboldened fashion. Those concerns that were there all the way back to the late 1990s have not gone away – about Uighur fighters operating in territory that the Taliban control, that there’s a permissive environment for them. If you look at the groups that directly threatened China – not so much the Chinese mainland or Xinjiang itself but particularly soft Chinese targets in the rest of the region – you have the TTP, the Pakistani Taliban, that have conducted operations against Chinese targets. If you have seen the recent developments with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Chinese investments in Pakistan, there’s been far more anxiety about the security situation there in the last few months than in the last few years. They are concerned that effectively, Afghanistan could be used as strategic depth for the Pakistani Taliban, and that would have implications for their investments and security interests in the country. The attack that we saw a few weeks ago in Dasu [on July 14 in which 9 Chinese were killed] was probably the largest loss of life you’ve seen in a terrorist attack on Chinese personnel in Pakistan, full stop. Do you think China’s approach to Afghanistan will broadly be more of the same, where they are likely to be mainly only involved in economic projects? Chinese experts in the press have been saying China isn’t going to in a big way fill in any security vacuum. Do you expect continuity or any dramatic change? On the security front, there is an obsessive focus on the Chinese side on “the graveyard of empires”, that this is a strategic trap. They do not want to be drawn, sucked into a serious security role in the country. So I would see very little change on that front, aside from going into the details on some of the counterterrorism activities, such as what the Chinese were conducting in Badakhshan [which borders Xinjiang] and things like that. I think anything broader would be extremely limited. They will be extremely wary of that. The question on the economic side is, what kind of economic involvement would China want? I think China sees this as stability first, investment later. With the Belt and Road, how comfortable is China really going to be with putting in place an expanded set of infrastructure connections, when they’re very worried about this becoming a militant hub in the region?

23 August 2021||Washington,||American airlines to aid Afghan evacuation||The U.S. on Sunday enlisted several major airlines in its frantic evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans, Americans and other foreigners from Kabul following its fall to Taliban extremists. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin activated the rarely-used Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) to aid the onward movement of people arriving at U.S. bases in the West Asia, the Pentagon said. “We’re going to try our very best to get everybody, every American citizen who wants to get out, out,” Mr. Austin said in an ABC interview on the evacuation mission, adding that the same applied to Afghan allies. Eighteen civilian craft, from American Airlines, Atlas, Delta, Omni, Hawaiian and United, will aid dozens of military cargo transports involved in the evacuation, the statement said. Rather than going in and out of Kabul, the planes will transport people from U.S. bases in Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to European countries and, for many, onward to the U.S. With thousands of troops trying to secure the Afghan capital’s airport, Washington has set a deadline to complete one of the largest evacuation missions the Pentagon has ever conducted by August 31. But Mr. Austin didn’t rule out asking the President to extend the deadline. “We’re going to continue to assess the situation. And again, work as hard as we can to get as many people out as possible. And as we approach that deadline, we’ll make a recommendation to the President,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/american-airlines-to-aid-afghan-evacuation/article36051922.ece
23 August 2021||Jerusalem,||Israel strikes Gaza after clashes along border||Israel’s military bombed Palestinian militant weapons sites in the Gaza Strip on Sunday in response to a violent demonstration on the perimeter fence that left an Israeli police officer critically injured, the Army said. Saturday’s violence erupted after hundreds of Palestinians took part in a demonstration organised by Gaza’s Hamas rulers to draw attention to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the territory. The demonstration grew violent after dozens of people approached the fortified border fence and threw rocks and explosives toward Israeli soldiers from behind a black smoke screen billowing from burning tires. At least 24 Palestinians, including a 13-year-old, were injured by Israeli gunfire, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. An Israeli Border Police officer was shot and critically injured. The Army said in a statement that in response to the violent demonstrations, fighter planes hit “four weapons and storage manufacturing sites” belonging to Gaza’s Hamas rulers, and that the military deployed additional troops to the region near the border with the Palestinian enclave. There were no immediate reports of injuries in the airstrikes. Addressing the Cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Israel “will settle the score with those who harm our soldiers and Israeli civilians,” adding that the military is “ready for any scenario.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-strikes-gaza-after-clashes-along-border/article36051916.ece

The hardline Islamists’ swift return to power a week ago, and desperate scenes of thousands trying to flee, have cast another shadow over the U.S.’ status as a global superpower. But on her visit, Ms. Harris will seek to allay concerns about U.S. dependability. “The Vice-President will make clear throughout the trip that we do have an enduring commitment to the region,” said a senior U.S. official. Ms. Harris landed in Singapore on Sunday. The crisis has prompted comparisons with the trauma of 1975 Saigon, when U.S. helicopters ferried final evacuees from the Embassy roof, as Viet Cong troops advanced. U.S. officials say the trip was planned long before the Afghan debacle, however — and insist Ms. Harris is focused on Washington’s broader strategic goals in Asia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/harris-begins-asia-trip-amid-afghan-debacle/article36051921.ece

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking the logjam, handing over the baton||For the first time ever, the Supreme Court Collegium led by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) recommended/selected as many as nine persons at one go to be appointed to the apex court. With the appointment later of the nine judges by the President of India, barring one vacancy which arose after the Collegium met, all the nine vacancies in the Supreme Court will be filled up. The highest court in the country having its near full strength will ease the pressure on it considerably. Much-awaited move Every CJI during his tenure has taken up the filling up of vacancies as a matter of highest priority, but many could not succeed. CJI T.S. Thakur, in fact, broke down, in 2016, at a function attended by the Prime Minister in a rare expression of extreme anguish because of his inability or helplessness in filling the vacancies which was seriously affecting the functioning of the supreme judicial forum of the country. It is indeed a happy augury that the present CJI, Justice N.V. Ramana, could, along with his colleagues in the Collegium, select the judges within a short period of his assumption of office. It is almost a truism that the selection of judges for appointment to the higher courts, particularly the top court is a complex exercise. After the Collegium came into existence, much to the consternation of political class, the selection of suitable judges has become most arduous in as much as the members of the Collegium have to take extra care to ensure that the process of selection remains transparent and the suitability of the persons selected attracts the highest level of approbation. Difficult task This is by no means an easy task. The members of the Collegium are all the senior most judges who have in their own way helped shape the ethos of the highest judiciary. With their keen intellect, long years of experience at the Bench and an admirable ability to discern merit in individuals, it is a tough task to build a consensus around one person or a few persons. The CJI being the head of the Collegium, has an unenviable task in building that consensus. Therefore, it can be said without any fear of contradiction that the job of selecting as many as nine judges for appointment to the Supreme Court was done admirably well. Going by news reports, it appears that the selection process was concluded in the first ever formal meeting of the Collegium. It is a remarkable feat in itself. As the Secretary General of Lok Sabha, I had the privilege of assisting the Presiding Officers and I witnessed close quarters the struggles the Speaker had to endure in evolving consensus even on absolutely non-partisan proposals. Justice Ramana deserves full credit for taking along his colleagues in the true spirit of being the first among equals. The latest resolution of the Collegium gave effect to the multiple judicial pronouncements of the top court on the subject, particularly in recommending three women, a feat which may not be possible to be repeated in the foreseeable future. Article 142 (1) contains the concept of ‘complete justice’ in any cause or matter which the Supreme Court is enjoined to deliver upon. The citizens of the country look up to the Supreme Court for complete justice. So, while selecting a judge to adorn the Bench, the fundamental consideration should be his/her ability to do complete justice. The Supreme Court has gone into this fundamental normative matrix in which the whole exercise of selection of judges is performed. In the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association and Another vs Union of India (1993), the Court spelt out the parameters within which to accomplish the task of selecting candidates for appointment to the higher judiciary. The most crucial consideration is the merit of the candidates. But consideration of merit should be done “… without giving room for any criticism that the selection was whimsical, fanciful or arbitrary or tainted with any prejudice or bias” (paragraph 330). The merit is the ability of the judge to deliver complete justice. India’s compelling realities India is a country of bewildering diversity. In this cacophonous democracy, language, region, religion, community, caste, are all realities which the state cannot ignore while identifying people to man its various organs. The nine judges who decided the above case were quite aware of these compelling realities. So, they said, “In the context of the plurastic [pluralistic] society of India where there are several distinct and differing interests of the people with multiplicity of religions, race, caste and community and with the plurality of culture … it is inevitable that all people should be given equal opportunity in all walks of life and brought into the mainstream so that there may be participation of all sections of people in every sphere including judiciary”. The overriding concern of the Supreme judiciary is to ensure equal opportunities to all classes of people … be they backward classes or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes or minorities or women, … so that the judicial administration is also participated in by the outstanding and meritorious candidates belonging to all sections of the society [and] not by any selective or insular group” (paragraph 315). Need for transparency India is perhaps the only country where the judges select judges to the higher judiciary. It is, therefore, necessary to make the norms of selection transparent. The Supreme Court has emphasised the need for maintaining transparency and an openness with regard to the norms of selection. In 2019, a five judge Bench of the Supreme Court, of which the present CJI was also a member, laid emphasis on this point. The Bench observed: “There can be no denial that there is a vital element of public interest in knowing about the norms which are taken into consideration in selecting candidates for higher judicial office and making judicial appointments”. Thus, the essence of the norms to be followed in judicial appointments is a judicious blend of merit, seniority, interests of the marginalised and deprived sections of society, women, religions, regions and communities. A closer look would reveal that these norms are followed in their essentiality in selecting the nine for the Bench. The selection of three women judges, with one of them having a chance to head the top court, a judge belonging to the Scheduled Caste and one from a backward community and the nine selected persons belonging to nine different States (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat; https://bit.ly/385WJbP), all point towards an enlightened and unbiased approach of the members of the Collegium. It is also a matter of public knowledge that many of those selected have zealously upheld citizens’ freedoms and public interest. The contributions of a few of them in waking up governments from their slumber in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is well documented. A high level of social consciousness possessed by a Judge enhances the quality of justice. The present CJI can be credited with recognising this crucial factor in the selection of judges. Unwarranted A needless controversy is sought to be raised by a section of the media about this round of selection citing the non-existing ‘Rule of Seniority’. It is this insistence, on one single criterion, which led to the piling up of vacancies in the Supreme Court for nearly two years. The logjam of 22 months has been finally broken by the Collegium led by the CJI through a pragmatic approach. It is also significant to note that those who are complaining of omission have not alleged that the selected nine cannot do complete justice as the Constitution mandates. There is no doubt that there are meritorious people outside this group too. But in a population of 1.3 billion, to select just nine suitable persons to man the highest judiciary is not without difficulty. Considering the merit of the selected persons, one can undoubtedly say that the Collegium has done a good job. With seven names (district judges) cleared by the Collegium for the Telangana High Court in one go, we can safely trust Team Ramana to speedily fill up all judicial vacancies. The Collegium has started doing its job. Now, it is time for the Government to match the pace and take the process of appointments to its logical conclusion at the earliest. P.D.T.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Focusing on diseases sidelined by COVID-19||Nearly 71% of all deaths worldwide occur due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, heart attacks and coronary artery disease are the top cause of global deaths. One out of every four deaths occurs due to cardiovascular diseases, especially among younger patients. In the Indian subcontinent, there is early onset and rapid progression of such diseases, and a high mortality rate. Premature loss of life due to NCDs in the age group of 30-69 years is also very high among Indians. Half the deaths due to cardiovascular diseases occur in the age group of 40-69 years. To address this growing burden of NCDs, the National Health Mission launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke, in 2010, focusing on strengthening infrastructure, promoting good health, human resource development, early diagnosis, management and referral. Disruption of NCD services The rapid spread of COVID-19 has severely tested primary healthcare systems, which perform myriad functions, across the world. Maternal healthcare services, immunisation, health surveillance, and the screening and management of NCDs have all been severely disrupted. A World Health Organization (WHO) survey conducted in May 2020 among 155 countries found that low-income countries were the most affected by this disruption. More than half (53%) of the countries surveyed had partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment, 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications, 42% for cancer treatment and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies. The outcomes in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease risk factors or with established cardiovascular disease can be worse than others, perhaps due to low cardiorespiratory reserve, worsening of the underlying cardiovascular disease due to systemic effects of the illness, or precipitating novel cardiac complications. Data from the National Health Mission’s Health Management Information System in India show that emergency services for cerebrovascular diseases dropped by about 14%. Among NCDs, persons with diabetes are at an exceptionally higher risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. A recent study reported that nearly one in every two Indians living with diabetes is unaware of their condition. They are at higher risk of dying if they contract COVID-19 because of uncontrolled glucose levels in their blood. Findings from an observational study in Delhi show that 47.1% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had diabetes. In most countries, staff working in the area of NCDs were reassigned to support patients with COVID-19, and public screening programmes were postponed. Shortage of medicines, diagnostics and technologies were the main reasons for discontinuing services in one-fifth of the surveyed countries. Cancellations of planned treatments, decreased availability of public transport, and lack of staff were the most common reasons for the disruption of NCD services. NCD services also got more disrupted as countries moved to the stage of community transmission from the stage of sporadic COVID-19 cases. Lockdowns and reduced physical interactions led to loneliness, especially in the geriatric population. This resulted in mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Lockdowns increase exposure to NCD risk factors as people became more likely to increase their consumption of alcohol and tobacco and adopt an unhealthy diet. Solutions Although most countries reported that they had included NCD services in their national COVID-19 preparedness and response plans, only 42% of low-income countries did so. Worryingly, tobacco cessation activities and rehabilitation have not been included in response plans. India’s response plan to address the growing burden of NCDs must include tobacco cessation activities as tobacco consumption has been indisputably linked to hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Alternative strategies have been established in most countries to support those at the highest risk so that they continue receiving treatment for NCDs. Among the countries reporting service disruptions, half are using telemedicine. A positive impact of the pandemic has been that two-thirds of the countries are now collecting data on the number of COVID-19 patients who also have a NCD. There is an urgent need for national and State health policymakers to draw up a road map which gives equal weight to patients living with NCDs. Utilising the existing network of NGOs while respecting local factors will go a long way in tackling the growing burden of NCDs. Campaigns on maintaining a healthy lifestyle need innovation; the monotony of broadcasting the same message over and over again must be broken. Uncontrolled epidemics have the potential to snowball into a major pandemic. A paradigm shift in governance, which means effective and participatory leadership with strong vision and communication, is the need of the hour to tackle the silent epidemic transition to NCDs. Screening for NCDs at the grassroots level and the delivery of locally relevant and contextual messages for health promotion and primordial prevention of NCDs can be significantly improved by incentivising the already overburdened ASHA workers. Access to essential NCD medicines and basic health technologies in all primary healthcare facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative. Strategies must include mitigation efforts to address administration challenges, a strong health workforce, infrastructure, supplies, maintaining the standard of care, and continued access and care for the vulnerable populations. Also, the importance of physical activity and mental health due to restrictions on movement should be brought to the forefront. The use of alternative modalities such as online platforms for disseminating information on exercise and mental health management must be made available to the marginalised. Telemedicine can reduce travel expenses, thus lowering patients’ expenditure burden. Multiple risk factors which are interrelated, such as raised blood pressure, glucose, lipids, and obesity, are preventable. Primary healthcare systems must ensure that persons at risk of NCDs receive appropriate screening, counselling and treatment. In India, those with NCDs find that productive years of life are lost and there is high-out-of-pocket expenditure on treatment. Urgent action is needed using the ‘all of society approach’ to achieve the WHO goal of a 25% relative reduction in overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases by 2025. This can be achieved by strengthening the primary health system to prevent, diagnose and provide care for NCDs in the future, especially during health emergencies such as a pandemic.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||In Afghan collapse, the fall of international relations||The heartbreaking images of Afghans clinging on to a United States Air Force plane in Kabul, on August 16, in a desperate bid to flee Afghanistan is a reminder of the fall of Saigon, Vietnam, and the horrifying scenes of American diplomats evacuated by helicopter, leaving behind supporters to languish in re-education camps. We have the urge to ask this question: Who is responsible for the return of the Taliban and a new rise of barbarism in the name of Allah in Afghanistan? One-sided accord In his defiant speech justifying his Afghanistan policy, U.S. President Joe Biden conveniently omitted acknowledgement of his responsibility for the disastrous endgame. He squarely laid the blame on the Afghan government and army for all the problems. One cannot shift the blame away from the Biden administration for the current chaos in Afghanistan. But one has to recognise the fact that once the predecessor administration of President Donald Trump and U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad signed the disastrous one-sided agreement with the Taliban, the fate of Afghanistan was sealed. It was just a matter of time. Whether keeping 2,500 personnel or 5,000 personnel or just one American soldier would have made a difference is subject to conjecture. Lessons missed This does not mean that the decision to withdraw American soldiers was wrong per se ; rather, there was obviously inadequate planning in preparing the operation. As usual, many innocent people were left behind. There was certainly a moral failure in getting out as many of those Afghans who supported the U.S. intervention and military presence in Afghanistan as possible. One historical lesson that was not learned was the predictable collapse of the Afghan government. The surrender to the Taliban slowly gained pace in the months following the Doha deal in 2020, but it began to snowball as soon as Mr. Biden announced in April that U.S. forces would withdraw from Afghanistan. But there is a second part to the debacle in Afghanistan. Surprisingly, when we think of the Taliban, we have in mind a shabby army of 70,000 fervently Islamist foot soldiers confronting and defeating a modern Afghan army of 3,00,000 men. However, the world was surprised by the speed of the Taliban army in reconquering Afghanistan, from Kunduz on August 7-8 through Mazar-i-Sharif and every other provincial capital last week to Kabul on Sunday. Certainly, one of the reasons for the defeat of the Afghan army has been the poor training and corruption of the Afghan officers. We can also add that the strategy of pushing the Taliban into the mountains and hinterlands, while securing towns and cities by the Afghan army did not work as expected. It took the Taliban only a few weeks to sweep away the Afghan army, which had been financed and trained by the United States for 20 years. It is impossible to predict how the current situation will evolve. But we can have a better understanding of the Taliban’s violence if we go back to their history. The Taliban was a Pashtun movement which appeared in the early 1990s following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989. Posing a danger Once in power in Afghanistan, the Taliban imposed their own violent and authoritarian version of Sharia Law, exemplified by ‘punishments such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, amputations for those found guilty of theft and imposing the all-covering burka for women. Television, music and cinema were also banned by the Taliban and girls aged 10 and over were forbidden to go to school’. All these previous actions show that the Taliban will rule Afghanistan once again with extreme violence and barbarity. However, some analysts continue to believe that because of the negotiations in Doha, there is room for compromise with the Taliban and that international mediation has played a positive role in asking for a more pragmatic attitude from the Taliban. This is just wishful thinking that ignores the fact that the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan will be a great danger for all Afghans and the neighbouring countries. Let us not forget that once again, terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State will take advantage of the new rise of the Taliban to create their own power bases in Afghanistan. Challenge for diplomacy Last but not least, on a human level, the fate of the Afghan people under the new Taliban government is most important. One thing is certain. The sufferings of the Afghans will not end under Taliban rule. From the point of view of international affairs, it will certainly take a Herculean effort to maintain decent working relations with the Taliban. However, India, Iran, Russia, and China are hoping for stability and an end to bloodshed in Afghanistan. But the return of the Taliban will not necessarily be welcomed by all these countries despite the fact that they would rejoice at America’s setback. There will also be a fear of Islamic jihadism all over West Asia, including in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia. So, all and for all, the Afghan debacle is not the story of a defeat of democracy in one country but a sign of a fiasco in international politics in general.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Getting uncomfortable||I have shared extensively what I have learnt from literature in navigating the choppy waters of journalism. Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, Rabindranath Tagore, Gabriel Garcia Márquez, Isabel Allende, Toni Morrison and a host of other influential voices have not only shaped my world view but also defined my writing. Though literature is the discipline from which I derive multiple life tools, I also draw from the social sciences to address many tricky issues. Dealing with polarising views One of the toughest issues confronting a news ombudsman is how to express profound differences in a polarised world. Democracy Features is an academic initiative to stimulate fresh thinking about the many challenges facing democracies in the 21st century. It tries to explore the new idea of choice, where one is forced to choose between two opposing positions. In this world view, as Sabine Selchow, a Research Fellow at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Sydney, points out, “reflection and compromise are seen as admitting weakness, defeat, and even a betrayal of one’s position.” Her prescription for dealing with the challenges of polarisation is to “get uncomfortable to open up new horizons for imagining and acting in the world.” I often tend to use the tools developed by anthropologist Anand Pandian to get uncomfortable and to bring in a more nuanced approach to the elements that make up a credible information ecology. Prof. Pandian won the Infosys Prize 2019 in Social Sciences for his brilliantly imaginative work on ethics, selfhood and the creative process. As a Tamil, I was always interested in the complex, yet organic, relationship between Tamil Nadu and its vast diaspora. Jothi , a magazine edited by V. Swaminatha Sharma and published from Rangoon, provided the template for modern Tamil journalism. It was Prof. Pandian’s collaborative book with his grandfather, M.P. Mariappan, Ayya’s Accounts: A Ledger of Hope in Modern India , that gave insights into the dynamics that bind the locals with the diaspora. Prof. Pandian wrote a brilliant anthology of essays, ‘A Possible Anthropology: Methods for Uneasy Times’, which helped me as a journalist to look at newer approaches that are more inclusive and less judgmental. The key question he sought to answer in these essays was: “In a time of intense uncertainty, social strife, and ecological upheaval, what does it take to envision the world as it yet may be?” His vision of a possible anthropology was “the one that may be adequate to the challenge of seeing and thinking beyond the profound fissures and limits of the present.” Charting a new path Prof. Pandian wrote: “These are times that call for anthropological faith and existential generosity, ways of cultivating sympathy, openness, and care as liveable realities. For the humanity yet to come — now, as always, we will need such anthropology.” I am convinced this applies to journalism also. Prof. Pandian, in his recent essay in The Guardian , ‘What I learned from an unlikely friendship with an anti-masker’, explains the need for a sustained dialogue with those on the other side of the ideological fence. He documents his interactions with Frank, whose views were disturbing, a brazen assertion of white privilege. Frank is a pseudonym as he wanted to remain anonymous. Frank used the idea of freedom to denounce masks worn to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (he called them “face diapers”). For him, the idea of vaccination symbolised “compliance, control and capitulation.” He opposed any restriction of movement and joined ‘Operation Gridlock’ against the preventive measures taken by the Governor of Michigan. Frank justified the storming of the Capitol. For him, it was the outburst of a populace long under siege, struggling against a power constantly wielded in the name of care. It is obvious that Prof. Pandian’s views on each one of these topics were diametrically opposite to that of Frank’s. As a news ombudsman, I get mails almost daily from readers like Frank. They find masterstrokes in every decision of the Union government. They feel that any critical voice against the ruling regime is undermining their rights. They discover virtues in obvious flaws. They are generally hyper-nationalistic; they are sceptical of any affirmative action. Prof. Pandian sees masks and vaccines as “the truth of our vulnerability, our capacity to wound and be wounded by others.” When we are tied to each other’s whims and disdains, it is not only anthropology but also journalism that needs to chart a new path. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/getting-uncomfortable/article36051908.ece
23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Going from conflict to conflict||On August 16, while explaining why he was so firm on withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, President Joe Biden acknowledged the U.S.’s myriad missteps of the last 20 years. The history of American missteps is, however, longer, and goes further back than the provocation caused by the 9/11 attacks. Steve Coll’s book, Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001, is a detailed documentation of the endless list of misadventures of the U.S. and other western countries. By all accounts, Afghanistan is the worst victim of the fiercest superpower rivalry of the post-World War II era. A more humane foreign policy Afghanistan’s current predicament is only a small part of a much bigger story pertaining to American foreign policy. Seen in conjunction with what has happened to Iraq, Libya and Syria, the moral flaw in American foreign policy and the U.S.’s contribution to destroying nations becomes apparent. If national interest is the only game in town, it is high time American policymakers begin to re-imagine it in a way that is less destructive and more humane. It was believed that President Biden would undo the agenda of his predecessor, Donald Trump. But he seems more determined to pursue Mr. Trump’s agenda, and with greater ineptitude. Some argue that the decision to withdraw forces from Afghanistan was President Biden’s original agenda, which he aired unsuccessfully as Vice President in 2009. The 2020 Doha Agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban merely eased the process and brought forth a rare consensus between a Republican President, Mr. Trump, and his Democratic successor, Mr. Biden. The current mess in Afghanistan, and in Syria, Libya and Iraq, once more reaffirms that in the domain of foreign policy, there is very little ideological difference between the Republicans and Democrats who alternately govern the U.S. Though several western nations were involved in this U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan, no country was interested in stepping in after the U.S.’s exit. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed this in the British Parliament when he said that the NATO’s “core mission” had succeeded. What is becoming clear is that the western nations lacked a vision for and commitment to Afghanistan.  Monopoly of state power While militant religious groups exist or operate in several countries, the Taliban enjoy the unique advantage of having acquired monopoly of state power. On the issues of rights, whether human rights or gender rights, each nation state has its skeletons in the closet. Consider, for instance, the U.S. itself and its track record on human rights with regard to African Americans or indigenous people. But the basic difference between nations like the U.S. and Afghanistan is that there is a political environment in the U.S. which allows these issues to be raised. For instance, the Black Lives Matter movement could not have been possible if a militant group was enjoying the monopoly of state power in the U.S. Clearly, not enough was done in the last 20 years to create institutions for such a conducive environment in Afghanistan. The Taliban were allowed to expand and now they are ready to govern. Aside from the extremist nature of the Taliban, what poses an equally dangerous threat to Afghanistan is that it remains the site of a power struggle among big and regional powers. At this juncture, a new equation seems to be emerging in the security game in the region. There is a China-Pakistan axis vis-à-vis an India-U.S. one. Russia, Iran and a few others have their own spin to the game. A new but more pernicious Cold War variety rivalry that doomed Afghanistan has reappeared. No one knows how these players will cast their die. But one thing is certain: there are more threats to Afghanistan than just the Taliban.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Curbing Delta||The overall number of coronavirus cases in India is on a downward trajectory though around 35,000 cases continue to be added almost daily. Nearly three in four of these infections are from Kerala and Maharashtra with the former — once heralded as the model State in tackling the pandemic — contributing close to 60% of the national total. There may be several reasons why this is the case and one of the conjectures is that newer variants may be playing a significant role. A weekly update from the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a repository of labs tasked with monitoring variants of the coronavirus, says that the Delta variant remains most responsible for the continuing spread of infections in India. The INSACOG collects a percentage of coronavirus-positive samples for analysis from all States and of the nearly 50,000 samples analysed for their genetic composition, about two thirds — 30,230 — were among the internationally classified Variant of Concern or Variant of Interest (VoC/VoI). Of these, nearly 20,000 were the Delta variant (AY.2) and about 5,000, its associated lineages (AY.1 and AY.3). Because they contain mutations that help the virus avoid detection by the immune system, the lineages of the Delta variant are driving spikes in infections worldwide. Globally, there are believed to be 13 sublineages of Delta with characteristic genetic mutations. AY.1, AY.2 and AY.3 are the predominant ones. Concerning as this variant is, it should not be forgotten that the purpose of the existing vaccines is to prevent hospitalisation and mortality, and the limited evidence so far is that vaccine coverage has played a role in keeping hospitalisation in most States to manageable levels as well as allowing normalisation of economic activity. Unless there is a dramatic fall in susceptible hosts globally, it is unlikely that transmission will obliterate itself. India’s Drugs Controller General has now approved a three-shot vaccine, ZyCoV-D, for use in those 12 and above. The interim efficacy data of this vaccine shows that it has only 66% efficacy which is lower than what most of the other vaccines delivered in their trials. Zydus Cadila also has not published phase-3 results from the trials and so it is quite uncertain if the vaccine will meaningfully curb transmission but may well be effective in boosting India’s vaccine arsenal, cutting disease and saving lives. The INSACOG still monitors too few a proportion of coronavirus samples given that India has the second highest numbers globally. Improving coverage and increased vaccination continue to remain the best bets against the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/curbing-delta/article36051897.ece
23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Pursuing post-poll truth||Political violence has long been a feature of West Bengal politics. Whether it is due to a sense of mass empowerment, or an outcome of political awareness, or the partisan nature of electoral politics, the phenomenon has been a subject of debate as well as a cause for concern. Post-election violence, however, stems from the victor’s sense of entitlement and triumphalism, making it more condemnable and far less spontaneous than the frequent confrontations that mark the State’s political scene. The latest round of violence broke out soon after the declaration of results of the State Assembly elections on May 2. The Calcutta High Court has ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into incidents of rape and murder that took place during this post-poll violence, while other incidents will be probed by a special team of State police officers. Both the probes will be under the court’s supervision. The verdict by a five-judge Bench is a welcome denouement to days of fierce recriminations by the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Opposition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party over the incidents. It is a reflection of the state of affairs in the State that there is a dispute over how bad the violence was and how long it lasted. To make matters worse, the Mamata Banerjee government claimed that the violence was brought under control as soon as the party assumed office on May 5, giving the impression that three days of mayhem brooked no response from the police. The court’s decision to get the National Human Rights Commission to form a panel, including representatives of the State Human Rights Commission and the State Legal Services Authority, to make a field assessment was contested by the State government, but the report the exercise yielded confirmed large-scale and widespread violence, much of it by ruling party supporters against their political adversaries. The main judgment by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal has explained the reasons for handing over the probe to the central agency: the lack of concrete action, the absence of first information reports, or diluted ones registered after a committee had pointed out such cases, and the tendency to downplay many cases. Further, when faced with allegations of police apathy and inaction, only an investigation by an independent agency will inspire confidence. In a separate opinion, Justice I.P. Mukerji said that there was nothing to show that the ruling party intended to promote political violence, but agreed that the CBI probe was needed to ensure a fair investigation into heinous crimes. The State government may appeal against the verdict, but the doubt cast on the ruling party’s commitment to the rule of law is genuine. An impartial investigation may not only result in credible prosecutions but also be a much-deserved blow against the culture of violence and post-election triumphalism in West Bengal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pursuing-post-poll-truth/article36051896.ece

In order to assist these parties in selecting quality animals and also to safeguard against diseases to which these exotic animals are prone to, the import will be canalised through the Indian Dairy Corporation. The Corporation has been asked us to work out a detailed scheme which will be finalised by Government later. There is considerable demand in India for foreign cattle breeds. The Tamil Nadu Government has intimidated a requirement of 85 males of Jersey, Friesian, Brown Swiss and Red Dane breeds for 1971-72. This request is now being considered by the Government of India. The Punjab Government wanted to set up an exotic cattle farm with an outlay of Rs. 12 lakhs. While it was considered earlier that the breed should be Jersey the State Government has since decided to set up a Brown Swiss cattle farm under an Indo-Swiss project. In consultation with technical experts, the State Government has chosen Patiala and Sangrur districts for cross breeding with Brown Swiss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dairy-corpn-may-import-exotic-cattle/article36051906.ece
23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||How to spot a potential bubble||“It’s not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid” — Charlie Munger Having set the context for this article, let’s start with a simple definition of a ‘bubble.’ Bubbles occur when assets become artificially expensive, driven by a false belief known as a misconception. There are identifiers that might help us spot potential, irrational exuberance in the market. Here are seven of them: Entry of new investors About 1.42 crore new demat accounts were added in FY21, which is about threefold more than that seen in FY20. The average age of new investors is trending lower, and the mix is getting skewed towards tier 2 and 3 locations. This indicates that new investors with limited experience are entering the market. Most of them have experienced only a one-way upward rally in the last 15 months. In the short term, the market is like a pendulum — we need to watch the behaviour of the new investors during a downturn to understand the sustainability of retail participation. Leverage play Clients are willing to take on more leverage to benefit from the rally. (Leverage refers to the act of borrowing money to speculate in the market; this is generally funded by the broker or by an NBFC). Most of the broking houses’ margin-funding book has doubled in the last year. Leverage is a double-edged sword. In good times, leverage magnifies the return and during a downturn, which is generally inevitable, it takes away a lot of capital earned when the market was rising. Unless used wisely, leverage does more harm than good to investors, especially if they approach investments as speculators and not long-term investors. High risk appetite Raising money without difficulty is one of the biggest signs of market sentiment as investor risk appetite at this juncture is very high. Investors are willing to allocate more capital than they would otherwise, towards asset classes which have done exceedingly well in recent times. Record collection by new funds, grey market premium (GMP) and large IPO subscription (bids exceeding 100 times the quantum up for offer) are testimony to this sentiment. Big-ticket IPOs One more sign of a potential bubble is large IPOs starting to hit the market and getting oversubscribed. When IPOs of new, loss-making companies are subscribed with a lot of enthusiasm, most of the investors tend to sell their long-term wealth creator stocks to participate in new stock ideas which get all the attention at that point of time. As investors, we need to remember the base rate of success while making investment decisions in new age start-ups. In high probability, few of these companies might become wealth creators in the future. That all the new-age companies are going to perform like Amazon or Netflix is a big assumption to make and only long-term evidence can support such a strong narrative. Predictive power Another sign of market exuberance is to check the degree of confidence among market participants on future prediction. Past projections on market-earning estimates can be very optimistic but reality turns out to be bleak for many reasons. For example, for the year 2020, NIFTY EPS estimate was Rs. 650 plus when it was initially projected during 2019. The actual EPS turned out to be Rs. 453. We should allow companies we invest in to exceed our conservative expectations. Small-cap trades In the last few months, the rise in traded volume of small-cap stocks is much higher than for stocks with large capitalisation, more liquidity and a wider investor base. Trading or investing in thinly-traded stocks or those with lesser institutional coverage should be kept to a minimum. As and when the tide turns, companies with poor fundamentals might see permanent declines from the current price levels. In April 2021, NIFTY Smallcap volume was 30-40% of NIFTY 100 volume and by the first week of July 2021, it had risen to 55%. Sudden rise in valuations In every market cycle, a few sectors or a few types of stocks get all the attention. Here is an example of a company that had a big tailwind due to COVID-19, which led to a sharp jump in its business. Profit almost doubled from FY20 to FY21 — a period when our economy suffered one of the worst contractions in our lifetimes. On top of this elevated earnings base, the stock is currently trading at 75 times reported earnings; it used to trade in the range of 20-25 trailing 12 months’ price-to-earnings ratio, as observed in the past. As investors, our job is to not get too excited about the current earnings growth alone. We need to focus on sustainable growth in the medium term and avoid overpaying in order to improve our margin of safety. As investors, we do not have the ability to predict the future but what we can do is to look for all the evidence around us dispassionately before taking decisions. Protecting the downside risk is one of our primary jobs in addition to generating sustainable long-term returns.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Insurance at the speed of light||The process of buying an insurance policy is unrecognisable today compared to two decades ago. Competition and a flood of products and options have combined with the galloping awareness and needs of the insuring public. Insurtech, or technology in insurance, has stepped in to reduce much of the friction in buying insurance or getting claims. Contrast this to the early days of life insurance when underwriters met every six months to consider the handful of life insurance proposals received and to determine whether to write the risk or not! Timely premium collections and claims payments were always a challenge in the offline world. But, no more. In India, by the early nineties, credit cards had become commonplace and Internet banking entered the scene by the late nineties. In 200,1 The Insurance Act, 1938 was amended to allow various methods of payment of premium, including credit card and Internet banking. Mobile app payments What technology offered was a godsend in times of crises. If demonetisation saw us paying our household staff through Internet banking, the pandemic pushed almost all purchase and payment to mobile apps. In the last 20 years, almost the entire process of buying insurance has gone digital. The way I bought my policy last week is a case in point. Filled a proposal form online, fulfilled know-your-customer (KYC) formalities digitally and paid using an app on my phone. Almost instantaneously I could download the policy complete with electronic signature. What is more, all my policies can be stored in an e-insurance account for easy retrieval and transaction. The e-insurance account also eases renewals with KYC and other compliances. Yet, some physical processes will always be involved because we live in a physical world. So, a medical evaluation or a vehicle inspection before issuing a policy may be needed, as will similar formalities for paying claims, even if cashless. Buying insurance begins best online with the research based on your unique awareness of your needs and constraints. Product information and premium calculators on insurance-company websites should be your stop in this journey. On the websites of insurance brokers and web-aggregators, you can go one step ahead and do comparison shopping, deciding between insurance policy options on coverage and other terms, including premium and zeroing in on the company to buy from. You can buy most policies on company or intermediary websites by filling in the proposal form and uploading supporting documents such as KYC or vehicle papers. There are advantages in sticking to an insurance company you have earlier policies with. On the other hand, going to an aggregator opens up your options on policies and also future purchases as you build up a new relationship. Payment for a policy is the easiest bit, and straightforward renewals are only easier. If you need enhancement of coverage or changes in the policy, budget the time and effort for these to get processed in time to meet your renewal deadline. The offline processes, if any, will be facilitated by the company representative. The e-insurance account earlier makes renewals way more easy. Not only do they add to the swell of your SMS or email inbox with reminders to renew and sometimes offers, they provide their own payment mechanism as well. A word about renewal links. This is where you go to make payments. Exercise caution to ensure that you are visiting an authentic link. Look for safety certification on the website where you intend to pay, like the ‘https’ protocol on the payment site / page. For absolute safety, instead of clicking on renewal payment links, type out the URL of the site yourself. Many good products don’t catch up that fast. One such is the e-insurance account mentioned earlier. A digital account carrying all your insurance policies is such a convenience in a world of characteristic hypermobility of the working-age population earlier or the contrasting work-from-home ‘hyper-immobility’ in recent times! This is one account worth signing up for and my surmise is that it isn’t popular because it is free! It is not just buying insurance and paying for it that has gone digital. Cashless claims, introduced in the early 2000s, have stepped up convenience of health insurance immensely. Cashless claims are available for motor insurance too with insurance company-affiliated network garages, usually vehicle-dealer workshops. This has eased the many headaches of the process of estimating the damage and repair costs and ensures you get authentic spares and service, plus a much faster return of your vehicle with damages fixed. ‘Invisible process’ The cashless process is mostly invisible to the insured. In the case of a health insurance claim, the hospital deals with the service provider of the insurance company (the third-party administrator or the TPA) for the documentation and the payment. We can all remember times when these were more painful than the health condition itself! Remember, the hospital has to give you information about what you are being charged under various heads for your cashless claim. This is so that you can verify that you are not being double-billed for the same expenses. Pre-approval of claims has added to the ease of the insured and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has even mandated that COVID-related claims should be pre-approved in 60 minutes! That, if anything, qualifies as insurance at the speed of light!

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Ask Us||Q.I am 85 and a retired engineer. I do not draw any pension. Based on the advice given in your article titled ’Where there is a will,’ I have prepared a hand-written, plain-paper will. The following are my doubts: 1) Do I need to get it signed by one or more witnesses? 2) If so, can my wife be a witness? K.R. Vasudevan  Gaurav Mashruwala replies: Two witnesses are required for any kind of will. There is no restriction on who can be the witness but as a good practice, refrain from having any beneficiary as a witness. Registering a will is optional. But a registered will always have more weightage.  (Gaurav Mashruwala is a financial planner and author of Yogic Wealth)  Q.I am a pensioner. I couldn’t attach my insurance document during 2020-2021 for claiming deduction under 80D. 1) Can I attach the same during 2021-2022 so as to claim deduction under section 80D? 2) I have a fixed deposit for Rs. 15 lakh under the senior citizens savings scheme for 5 years. Can I deduct Rs. 1.5 lakh from income under 80C for the whole tenure of 5 years? Sebastian Thomas  N. Sree Kanth replies: Deduction under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 can be claimed only in the assessment year during which the premium towards the health insurance is paid. You cannot claim in FY22 for the health insurance paid in FY21. Deduction towards senior citizens savings scheme is restricted to the limits provided under Section 80CCE. The limit is Rs. 1.5 lakh. You cannot claim the deduction towards any investment made in a particular previous year in excess of the limits prescribed during the tenure of the investment in the forthcoming assessment years. Q.I opted for the old tax regime for the purpose of TDS in salary. Is there any possibility to switch to the new tax regime at the time of filing returns? I have also received arrears of salary for three years from 2017 to 2020 but I failed to file ITR for two years; I have filed only for 2019 to 2020. I am seeking relaxation under Section 89(1) Form 10E. Are I-T returns for all the 3 years mandatory to claim sec 89(1)? I have Form16s for the above two years. Is relief under sec 89(1) possible under the new tax regime? A. Mathivanan A.1) CBDT has clarified that intimation to employer with respect to opting of new / old regime is for the purpose of deduction of TDS only. At the end of the year, you may choose to opt for tax rates under the new or old regime whichever is advantageous to you. You may file your ITR accordingly and claim refund of the excess deduction. 2) You are to file Form 10E in order to claim relief under Section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 prior to filing the ITR of the AY in which the relief is being claimed. There is no provision that the ITRs of the assessment years pertaining to the arrears salary ought to have been filed in order to claim relief in this AY. 3) Relief under Section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is allowed under the new tax regime as well. Q.My mother is 87. She has two sons and a daughter. My brother is a U.S. citizen. My mother has property in Hyderabad and Bengaluru in her name. Can she transfer the property in my brother’s name and if so, what will the tax implication be? S. Murthy A.Your mother may settle the properties in the name of her children by entering into a settlement deed and by paying the requisite stamp duty. The method of transfer will be the same for both resident and non-resident children. There is no income tax implication at this stage. Income tax is attracted only when the children further transfer the property to persons who are not relatives as defined in the Income Tax Act, 1961. Q.I am a PSU employee with two houses in my name and I do delivery trades in shares with STCG and LTCG. Kindly suggest a suitable ITR form for me. Ajay A.ITR 2 is to be filed by you as you have salary income, two house properties and capital gains. Q.I am a senior citizen. I purchased a money-back insurance policy favouring my daughter. As per terms of the policy, I am the policyholder and my daughter is the insured person. The insurance premium is paid by me from my source. I request you to clarify: 1) Can my daughter claim relief under Sec.80c even though the premium is paid by me and I am not claiming the relief? 2) Being a money-back policy, the interim amount due, as per terms of policy, was credited to my account. Is the payout taxable in my hands? If yes, can I shift the tax liability to my daughter by transferring the payout to her though the premium is being paid by me?  V. Ayyappan A.1) Section 80C deduction benefits can be claimed only by the assessee who invests / pays / incurs the eligible investments / expenses and such investments / expenses are to be in accordance with the conditions laid out in the provision in order to claim the deduction. The benefit cannot be transferred to any other assessee from one assessee.  (N.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Shaili leaps into the big league||Robert Bobby George and Anju George, who coach and guide Shaili Singh in Bengaluru, expect her to win medals at the Olympics and Worlds in the next few years. And the 17-year-old from Jhansi, who was raised by a single mother who works as a tailor, offered a glimpse of what she is capable of as she claimed the women’s long jump silver with 6.59m which came with a small wind advantage (+2.2), missing the gold by just one centimetre to Sweden’s Maja Askag, at the World Athletics under-20 championships in Nairobi on Sunday. After two mediocre 6.34 jumps, Shaili (under-18 world No. 2) produced the big one that carried her to the top of the pack briefly before European champion Askag came up with 6.60 that would bring her the second gold of the championships after her triple jump triumph earlier. Shaili’s silver is the first long jump medal at the under-20 Worlds while Anju’s 2003 Worlds long jump bronze is India’s lone medal at the ‘senior’ Worlds. “Shaili was brilliant. Of course, gold would have been prettier,” her coach Bobby George told The Hindu from Nairobi. “She was capable of even 6.65 or 6.70 this evening.” Personal best Donald Magimairaj missed the bronze by three centimetres as he came up with a personal best 15.82 for the fourth place in men’s triple jump, which was won by Sweden’s Gabriel Wallmark with 16.43. The Indian women’s 4x400m relay team, comprising Payal Vohra, Summy, Rajitha Kunja and Priya H. Mohan, also finished fourth, clocking a season-best 3:40.45. In the women’s 5000m, Ankita was eighth in 17:17.68 with Ethiopia’s Mizan Alem pocketing the gold in 16:05.61. India finished with three medals (two silver and a bronze) in the five-day meet for its best-ever finish at any World championship. Host Kenya topped the table with 16 medals, including eight golds.  Records South Africa men (38.51) and Jamaica women (42.94) broke the under-20 world records while winning the men’s and women’s 4x100m relay while Botswana men (3:05.22) and Nigeria women (3:31.46) won the 4x400m relay titles with world-leading performances. Kenya’s Emmanuel Wanyonyi (men’s 800m, 1:432.76), Purity Chepkirui (women’s 1500m, 4:16.07), Amos Serem (men’s 3000m steeplechase, 8:30.72), Finland’s Heidi Salminen (women’s 400m hurdles, 56.94), Turkey’s Berke Akcam (men’s 400m hurdles, 49.38), neutral athlete Natalya Spiridonova (women’s high jump, 1.91) and Lithuania’s Mykolas Alekna (men’s discus, 69.81) were some of the other gold medallists on the final day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shaili-claims-silver-in-long-jump/article36051983.ece

23 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||Bhagat targets gold at Tokyo||World No. 1 Pramod Bhagat, who will be one of the main contenders from India in Tokyo Paralympics badminton (SL4 category — standing/lower limb impairment/severe) starting from Aug. 25, said he was determined to make all those who believed in his abilities proud by winning a gold. “The target will be gold as the preparations have been really good,” said the 33-year-old Bhagat in a chat with The Hindu before leaving for Tokyo. Improving standards “Over the years the standard of para badminton has been improving consistently but I have always enjoyed and given my best when pushed to the limits,” he said. “To take part in Paralympics was my dream since I started playing badminton. I am conscious of the pressure factor,” said Bhagat, who will be competing in men’s singles and mixed doubles (partnering Palak Kohli). “The Paralympics, just like the Olympics, is the biggest stage for any sportsperson to deliver. Honestly, I never thought I would reach this far. It is a huge honour for me to represent the country in these Games,” he added. “Winning gold in the 2018 Asian championship and 2019 Worlds are some of the highs of my career,” he said. “In my category, all Indians are in the top 10 and all of us are constantly playing well. We train together and our dedication levels are also high. We are one team, we strategise and help each other,” Bhagat explained. “Being World No. 1 is very important, for it makes me feel that I have been competing and winning at the top level for some time now. Still it all boils down to how well you perform in every game as it is a knockout format,” Bhagat said. Morale-booster He said that winning the Dubai para championship gold before Tokyo was a huge morale-booster as it was the first major event after the pandemic. “I am thankful to the Odisha Government and the Government of India for constantly supporting me through this journey and winning a Paralympics gold will be a fitting gift to all those who supported me,” Bhagat said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhagat-targets-gold-at-tokyo/article36051986.ece

Only last week, he was among the many former internationals who were felicitated in Hyderabad. “I was not in the starting eleven. The team was packed with heavyweights; only in case of an injury to some of the big names, players like me had a chance in the Rome Olympics,” said Hakim in a recent interview to The Sportstar, while recapping his experiences, before the Tokyo Games. Former India captains Victor Amalraj, Shabbir Ali, Telangana Football Association secretary G.P.

23 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Sreeja sets her targets high after the thrilling WTT-Contender run||What Sreeja Akula did as a qualifier in the WTT-Contender table tennis tournament in Budapest recently was quite a revelation. Ranked 150 in the world, the 23-year-old played three draining rounds in the qualifying, went on to outplay Linda Bergstrom (WR 78) from Sweden in the first round, and then overcame Barbora Balazova (WR 53) of Slovakia, before losing to Manika Batra (WR 60) in the women's singles quarterfinals. In fact, in the last-eight clash against Manika, the 23-year-old was up by two games to one and leading 9-3. With just two points from sealing a place in the semifinals, Sreeja allowed the reigning National champion to make a comeback. “Against Manika di, I should have won. She used her experience well. But on the whole, I am happy with the way I played in Budapest. This is my best show at a global event with such higher-ranked players. Beating Linda, a defensive paddler, against whom we don’t get to play regularly and overcoming Balazova was a huge morale-booster,” Sreeja told The Hindu on Saturday. Sreeja's personal coach, Somnath Ghosh, said Sreeja aggravated her right shoulder injury after the Senior National Championships in February 2021, and to play the way she did at Budapest was fantastic. "Now she is alright. Her performance is certainly a big boost. But losing to Manika from that position was heartbreaking,” he said. Good results Ghosh said Sreeja, now sponsored by LakshyaSports, has been getting good results in the last couple of years. “In 2019, she won two National ranking tournaments in Sonepat and Thane, and reached the semifinals of the 2021 Senior Nationals, losing to Manika,” he said.

Toyota’s second car, with Kazuki Nakajima, Sebastien Buemi and Brendon Hartley sharing the driving, took second. After 1,440 minutes, 370 laps, over 5,000 kilometres and 33 pit stops, Toyota’s number seven car’s trio of drivers finally came good after years of ill luck behind their sister car. In a neat touch Nakajima pitted behind Kobayashi in the leading car shortly before the finish to ensure they passed the line virtually in tandem, albeit with two laps separating them in the classification. In third, four laps adrift, came the elite Hypercar category rival Alpine of Andre Negrao, Nicolas Lapierre and Matthieu Vaxiviere.

23 August 2021||Mysuru,||Yachting in India has improved a lot: Motivala||Homi Motivala, 63, a recipient of the Arjuna Award (1993), Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna Award jointly with P.K. Garg (1994-95), Dronacharya Award (2002) and Shaurya Chakra gallantry award (1993), said that “Yachting in India has improved a lot” in a chat with The Hindu while on a visit to the Royal Mysore Sailing Club, Mysuru, for the National sailing championship at the KRS backwaters.  Excerpts:  How is the yachting scene in the country? It has improved a lot. Definitely more emphasis is being given by the Yachting Association of India and the Government of India for the development of the sport in different centres. India has fared well in the Olympics, Asian Games and many youngsters are taking up the sport. Your views on India’s recent performance in Tokyo? The performance of the four sailors was very good. Vishnu Saravanan was the best performer and did well above our expectations. Ganapathy Chengappa, Varun Thakkar and Nethra Kumaran also performed well and it was a good learning experience for them in a world class field. Tell us about your exploits in yachting I was a Commander in the Indian Navy, which gave me full support. I represented the country in the Asian Games in 1990 (Beijing) and 1994 (Hiroshima) partnering P. Garg and won bronze medals, in the Enterprise class. Garg and I were also world champions in the Enterprise class in 1993. I was also an International race officer. I served as the chief national coach from 1999 to 2006. How do you see the future of yachting in India? The future bright. Youngsters are competing at the highest level. For the first time we had four sailors in the Olympics. Your advice to upcoming youngsters I give them 10 points to follow: 1. Know the rules properly; 2. Seek knowledge from wherever you get it, 3. Should be extremely methodical and scientific in your approach, 4. Willing to do hard work and effort, 5. Realistic goal setting is a must, 6. Should have a routine, 7. Be critical of yourself, 8. Never dwell in the past, 9. Have fun, 10. Winning and losing is all in the head.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/yachting-in-india-has-improved-a-lot-motivala/article36052170.ece
23 August 2021||London,||Lukaku bosses Arsenal into submission||Harry Kane made his first appearance for Tottenham this season as Nuno Espirito Santo earned a 1-0 win against his former club Wolves, while Mason Greenwood salvaged a 1-1 draw for Manchester United at Southampton on Sunday. Striker Kane came off the bench in the second half at Molineux after the Manchester City transfer target missed the first two games following his late return from his close-season holiday. Tottenham was already leading through Dele Alli’s 10th minute penalty by the time Kane arrived on the scene. Alli was fouled by Wolves keeper Jose Sa and the midfielder picked himself up to convert the spot-kick. At St. Mary’s, Manchester United failed to build on last weekend’s 5-1 demolition of Leeds. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side needed a Mason Greenwood equaliser to rescue a point after Fred’s own goal. While United left the south-coast frustrated, it did equal Arsenal’s English top-flight record of 27 successive away league games without defeat. Barcelona was given a torrid time by Athletic Bilbao but escaped from its trip to San Mames with a point as Memphis Depay’s superb late strike secured a 1-1 draw for the Catalans in the LaLiga on Saturday. Depay found the net with a fine left-foot half-volley 15 minutes from time in the Basque Country for his first goal since moving to Barcelona. Debutant striker Edin Dzeko was on target as Inter Milan got its Serie A title defence off to a flying start, thrashing Genoa 4-0 on Saturday. Elsewhere, Giacomo Raspadori, Filip Djuricic and Hamed Traore were on target as Sassuolo edged a thriller 3-2 at Hellas Verona.  The results: Premier League: Southampton 1 (Fred 30-og) drew with Manchester United 1 (Greenwood 55); Wolves 0 lost to Tottenham 1 (Alli 9-pen).   On Saturday: LaLiga: Espanyol 0 drew with Villarreal 0; Granada 1 (Luis Suarez 16) drew with Valencia 1 (Carlos Soler 88-pen); Athletic Bilbao 1 (Martinez 50) drew with Barcelona 1 (Depay 75).   Serie A: Inter Milan 4 (Skriniar 6, Calhanoglu 16, Vidal 74, Dzeko 87) bt Genoa 0; Verona 2 (Zaccagni 71-pen, 90) lost to Sassuolo 3 (Raspadori 32, Djuricic 51, Traore 77); Empoli 1 (Bandinelli 4) lost to Lazio 3 (Milinkovic-Savic 6, Lazzari 31, Immobile 41-pen); Torino 1 (Belotti 79) lost to Atalanta 2 (Muriel 6, Piccoli 93).   Bundesliga: Bayer Leverkusen 4 (Sommer 3-og, Schick 8, Diaby 55, Amiri 87) bt Borussia Monchengladbach 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/united-ekes-out-a-draw-at-southampton/article36051993.ece

23 August 2021||Kingston,||Fawad returns to the crease, Pakistan 231/5||Pakistan was 231 for five when play started for the second time on Sunday afternoon on the third day of the second Test against the West Indies at the Sabina Park. Fawad Alam was unbaten on 83. After the entire second day’s play was lost on Saturday to rain and a sodden outfield, there was a further 90-minute delay on Sunday as concerns remained about a damp area in line with the bowlers’ run-ups at the southern end of the pitch. When play eventually started, only eight balls were bowled. Jason Holder, operating from that troublesome southern end, struggled through the first two deliveries of his over before getting the support of his captain, Kraigg Brathwaite, over his concern about the conditions. The action was suspended following lengthy deliberations involving the on-field umpires, both captains, coaches and the match referee.  The scores: Pakistan 231/5 in 91 overs (Fawad Alam 83 batting, Babar Azam 75, Kemar Roach 3/56) vs West Indies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rain-washes-out-second-days-play/article36051987.ece

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Creators, not consumers||Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer the talk of the future — it is a thing of the present. While there is plenty of talk about its potential problems, it also has the power to solve some of the biggest problems we are facing, be it climate change, education, or even global health. But this, of course, depends on a few things such as: Who will decide which problems to solve? How will we ensure AI systems are ethical and fair? Who will decide if AI will work for us or we work for it? The ability to answer these questions will decide the quality of our future lives. To design an AI-powered and socially progressive world, students must be encouraged to move beyond simply knowing how to use AI as a technical competency. The focus should be on making them creators, not consumers, of AI. They need to be able to imagine new and creative ways through which to infuse the power of AI to solve larger, structural problems that plague society. The real rub lies in the question: How can we gear our education systems to respond to this opportunity? Take charge What we need to figure out is how our curriculum can focus on developing problem-solvers who could use AI rather than producing students technically proficient in it. Students should be able to look at a problem and creatively think of ways they could harness the powers of AI to solve it. We need to go beyond the simple idea of treating AI as a “computer science” module. How can we do this? Students should be pushed to identify larger, structural challenges in society that they could work on that are aligned to international frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This can be brought alive for students by exposing them to case studies on how AI has been used to solve similar issues of healthcare, climate and agriculture in different countries and simultaneously connect them with technical mentors who could help in prototyping their solutions. Only after this holistic perspective should the technical competencies be taught. Interdisciplinary participation The AI wave has to be unlike previous technological turns that were pushed into school curriculum — Python, for example, was simply taught to students interested in Computer Science and lent itself simply to the creation of a Python-ready workforce. The most important thing to ensure is the participation of students across fields like Biology, Psychology and even arts. What this influx from diverse fields can facilitate is an open exchange between students to think of creative ways to use AI. AI cannot become yet another specialised field for “computer nerds”. It must become a language — one that is spoken by all students. What we need are leaders of AI, not simple-minded consumers or back-office techies. We want a generation of leaders who can use AI to create solutions to solve the biggest problems plaguing our country and define its future growth. While starting early in school is one way of doing it, it will also happen only if we simultaneously focus on creating responsible AI leaders at the hyper-local level and equip them with mentors and coaches who can help lead the way.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Ocean of choices||I am in the third year of B.Sc. Statistics. I want to work with pharmaceutical companies. Should I do an M.Sc. in Biostatistics or Data Science? — A. Sabesan. Dear Sabesan, What do you want to do at a pharma company? Each pharma company has a core and a non-core department divide. The core is directly responsible for product quality; it comprises production, quality, R&D, engineering, regulatory affairs and a store team. The non-core is indirectly responsible for product quality and comprises of the HR, the entire workforce, marketing and sales, IT, EHS, and warehouse staff.. An M.Sc. in Biostats will help with you find opportunities such as a faculty statistician, a research assistant or an officer and you could work in the core department of production, quality and R&D. With Data Sciences, you would be a data analyst, a statistician, or a data engineer. Depending on your interest, shortlist your choice. I completed my B.Com. from Delhi University last year but didn’t get a job because of the pandemic. I got a job at a call centre but my parents wouldn’t allow me to take it up because of the night shift. I am wondering whether to prepare for the banking exams but, given the uncertainty, should I look for a job? — Mehak Dear Mehak, It all depends on what you want to do. Have you considered studying further? Is that something that might excite you? A call centre job, though financially attractive right now, may not allow you to take on anything else. Be it the prep for the banking exams (if that is something that excites you) or another course to further enhance your employability prospects. Work on a cost-benefit analysis and take the plunge! I am a B.Com graduate but am more interested in films. I’ve worked on some short films and want to study further. I don’t know where to start. Please help. — Jay Joshi Dear Jay, There are many opportunities for filmmaking aspirants. Course choices vary from production and direction, film and TV production, MFA in TV, films and theatre, screenplay, script writing, film making, directing and creative production and so on. Identify what it is that you want to explore and where you want to do this from? We have some brilliant institutes in India that offer some exceptional courses. Alternatively, the U.S. is good if you have the finances. While shortlisting the course, ensure that you check the subject list in each semester so that there are no surprises once you begin. I have completed a B.Tech. but have recently become interested in Global Politics and International Relations (IR). What should be my approach if I want to pursue a career in this? — Juber Mujawar Dear Juber, You will need to do a PG in IR, and take a qualifying entrance exam to secure admission into the college/university of your choice. In India, JNU, Delhi University, South Asian University, Symbiosis, and Christ University are some of the reputed institutions. Cambridge, Harvard, New York University, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, University of Michigan are highly regarded international institutions. I would suggest you start a dialogue with the university of your choice and do your research before plunging in.

23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Judge Sabyasachi on his core strength: business||Barely a week into designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s global collaboration with fashion retail giant H&M, everything that could go wrong has done so. The ‘crashed apps and stubborn carts’ as he called them on an Instagram post, problems with fits and not enough size inclusivity, the alleged return period of a single day that left many disgruntled, and that very bad word: viscose. Not to mention a collective open letter from the country’s craft communities that has gone viral. Plus, a total of nine Indian magazines that allowed Sabyasachi to literally give them their digital covers, which quickly became the butt of jokes about how print media has sold the remainder of its soul. This could be a two-pronged masterclass in how not to do a fashion collaboration and yet, having done it, how to market it to the high heavens. In the midst of all this, I feel we have forgotten something crucial about Sabyasachi the designer. That he is, foremost, a businessman. He has made no secret of it ever since he started doing interviews, which was pretty much from his debut on the ramp at the then Lakmé India Fashion Week at the turn of the millennium. And I, for one, do not see a problem with that. For over 20 years, Sabyasachi has evolved into a brand that has pushed a craft-oriented narrative in his bridal wear, creating a tribe of moneyed loyalists across the world. He has become a household name for even those who can only dream of owning a handkerchief with the Bengal Tiger logo. Why, then, is a collaboration that makes his designs — he never promised his craft — available to a global audience, being judged through the lens of socialist morals when it is clearly a capitalist business exercise?  Highlighting our hypocrisy  The questions being put forward to him now make me laugh because, while the board is the same, he’s playing checkers and we’re stuck in the arcana of chess. Example: ‘He’s known as a champion of the crafts of India. Why did he not ensure that even a percentage of this collection features Indian crafts?’ Why should he? It’s a collaboration with H&M! About the customers: the same people who were happy to queue outside H&M stores when their Balmain line launched in 2015 — with the worst blended wool military coats and ill-cut trousers — are questioning why something Sabyasachi already sells for lakhs of rupees isn’t suddenly available for thousands while also being mass produced for a global launch? No designer or creative person on this planet owes us affordability. That they choose to do so through such collaborations is, well, their business. The choice to buy into it, literally or figuratively, remains firmly with us. Which leads me to this: behind the criticism that Sabyasachi today faces lies a denial of our own hypocrisy. We love the idea of such fashion collaborations as great levellers as long as they’re done with international designer names. Yet we are also the ones who are quick to suggest a lighterodhanior a border or two fewer when that couture weddinglehengais just out of budget. Let’s admit it, it was never about Sabyasachi or the craftspeople. It’s about us not getting what we want for cheaper; about the fact that here, at home, we are coddled by designers who are happy to oblige because they produce fewer SKUs of higher value as part of their business strategy. And that’s OK, because it is our unique ecosystem. Sabyasachi, I’m told, is one of the few Indian designers who does not entertain such requests. So how is a global fashion collaboration, the very premise of which is to sell in numbers, being held responsible for ringing the ‘death knell’ on the future of artisans and craft communities of India? When did one designer become so powerful? When did a choice to collaborate with a fast-fashion retailer become a zero sum game? The artisans of India do not rely solely on Sabyasachi giving them work, do they? Many designers before him have made exquisite saris and lehengas , and continue to do so. One of his greatest innovations is creating a system of line production when it was almost unheard of in India, giving him an edge over his competition. Just like Salvatore Ferragamo did for handmade shoes in Italy and changed the game.  Putting business first  So why are we so disappointed in this one-of-a-kind global design collaboration that, according to Sabyasachi Mukherjee, has shown the world that India can also be a hub of design, and not just cheap, skilled labour? And what real possibility ever existed for India’s artisans to actually be a part of this collaboration without prices shooting up even beyond the (gasp!) Rs. 9,999, digitally-printed sari featuring (allegedly) culturally-appropriated Sanganeri block print motifs? Few designers across the world have a head for business. Sabyasachi is one of them. If he is to be judged as a designer, then this conversation is pointless. Let us judge him on the basis of his core strength, which is business. The questions we should be asking are: has he created a global furore like H&M’s previous collections with Karl Lagerfeld and Balmain did? Yes. Does this range make his design signature available to people who otherwise cannot afford his couture? Yes. Does it crack the door open for other talented Indian designers to explore planet-wide design collaborations? Yes. And perhaps the most relevant question of all: did it ever have anything to do with our artisanal legacy beyond informing the visual aesthetics of the collection? The answer, as has been proved with every resounding ka-ching of the till, is no.

23 August 2021||new delhi,||AAP champions patriotism, eyes more States||The Deshbhakti or patriotism drive launched by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the national capital is setting the backdrop of the party’s political ambitions in other States, even as it reinforces the party’s grip over the city. In the last budget, Finance Minister Manish Sisodia announced “grand celebrations” for 75 weeks till August 15, 2022, that would fill Delhi with “patriotism and national pride", allotting Rs. 45 crore for erecting 500 national flags across the city and Rs. 10 crore each to conduct programmes to honour Bhagat Singh and B.R. Ambedkar. In July, the Public Works Department (PWD) issued a tender for setting up of “35 metres high mast flag” at 495 locations for Rs. 84.6 crore; on August 15, the Delhi government inaugurated five national flags, all of them on 35 metres high masts. “When we see the Tiranga, we get goosebumps and our hearts are filled with love and pride towards the nation. 500 similar Tirangas will be installed all around Delhi, so that when you leave for office, one or two Tirangas can be seen by the time you reach the office. If you see Tiranga even once, then patriotism and love towards the country would be reignited,” said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in his Independence Day speech. The hour-long Deshbhakti class every day in Delhi government-run schools, he hoped, would motivate the younger generation to take pride in the country and realise their duty towards building the future of the country. According to a statement from the government, the Deshbhakti Curriculum that will start on Bhagat Singh’s birth anniversary on September 27, aims to develop among students, self-confidence, awareness, respect for constitutional values, and a problem-solving mindset, and bring about changes to take the country forward. Religious appeal AAP’s victory in the 2020 Delhi assembly elections was largely founded on the improvements its government made in the health and educational sectors in Delhi, but its winning campaign also required a strong dose of religious appeal — for instance, Mr. Kejriwal chanted Hanuman Chalisa during the campaign and challenged BJP leaders to follow suit. That was on top of the well advertised schemes that give free water to about six lakh consumers, free electricity to 36.6 lakh consumers and the 496 Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinics or neighbourhood dispensaries where people can go for minor ailments. AAP is now trying to expand beyond Delhi and have announced that they will be fighting Assembly elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Goa among other states and Mr. Kejriwal has been presenting Delhi as a model of development and is promising similar schemes if elected to power. The crisis in Delhi healthcare system during the second wave of coronavirus in 2021 may have made AAP’s governance claims less appealing, and the party may also be looking for a pan-India image through its focus on patriotism, according to some observers. P.K. Datta, former professor at the Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that earlier when the AAP tried to expand outside Delhi, they had been working on local issues that had brought them to power in Delhi. “My feeling is that they think that patriotism will give them that ideological bridge which they can capitalise on,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal also used India’s relatively good Olympic performance to enhance the patriotism theme. Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury said that the Deshbhakti budget and the push for nationalism will certainly help the AAP in elections in States outside Delhi, when it is tied with basic issues of the State. AAP has a tough task in keeping its patriotism campaign robust even while keeping its distinction with the BJP and the Congress. Anti-Muslim rhetoric is not part of AAP vocabulary, but many times, AAP remained silent on violence against Muslims. “Sometimes, you don’t want to hype up the issue and give BJP an advantage, but there is a limit to it,” said Ms. Chowdhury, referring to polarising communal incidents on which the AAP choses silence. She feels AAP silence may have crossed that limit. All told, the opposition parties, the Congress and the BJP are struggling hard to form a counternarrative to AAP’s patriotism campaign. While they do admit in private that they are yet to evolve a viable strategy to take on the AAP, the deshbhakti push of the latter has only increased their difficulties. “Deshbhakti (patriotism) is an emotion and has no connection to a budget. This is just another example of the fact that the AAP Delhi government believes in doing less and making it seem more thorough advertisements and public announcements which later turn out to be false,” North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari said. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that the AAP has come up with the Deshbhakti budget and several other campaigns to create a screen behind which they can hide. "The AAP is going the BJP way of using patriotism and huge spending on publicity to hide its failures. Why spend so much money on installing flags when the basic amenities are not being provided to the citizens of Delhi," he said.  For civic sense and pluralism AAP presents the Deshbhakti curriculum as an emphasis on civic sense and pluralism, including lessons in religious tolerance and a pushback against religious intolerance. “We seek to combine the values of ‘Desh Prem’ with concrete actions; this in essence, is our notion of Deshbhakti Curriculum,” Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had said. “The story of the hard-fought struggle for independence that India went through certainly needed to be conveyed to new generations and citizens. But, at the same time, citizens must ask themselves and their governments whether the promises of liberty and equality enshrined in the Constitution had been delivered upon,” said Professor Manisha Priyam of the Delhi University’s National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration.  When we see the Tiranga, we get goosebumps and our hearts are filled with love and pride towards the nation. 500 similar Tirangas will be installed all around Delhi, so that when you leave for office, one or two Tirangas can be seen by the time you reach the office. If you see Tiranga even once, then patriotism and love towards the country would be reignited Arvind Kejriwal Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-champions-patriotism-eyes-more-states/article36052332.ece
23 August 2021||August 23 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Wake-up call to the design fraternity’||Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s response to the joint letter by a collective of Indian craft organisations, voicing concerns about his digitally-printed Sanganeri and Kalamkari lookalike collection for global brand H&M, had lots of words — basically saying that by putting Indian textile traditions in a mass production medium he hoped it would then generate a demand for the authentic artisanal product. Well, here’s hoping! The trouble with global clothing chains is that their existence depends on creating new trends on a seasonal basis in order to maintain a constant demand for their products. What’s ‘in’ today is not ‘in’ next season. Old stock is junked. That’s why it is known as fast fashion. Seeing a new range promoted by H&M in malls and high streets across the world creates avid demand at first, but then comes the saturation. Will customers really clamour for genuine handblocked Indian prints once they’ve bought the H&M versions, or will they simply move on to the next latest thing?  Nurturing artisinal luxury  I too have an H&M story. About 18 years ago, Action India, an NGO that works with deprived women in Delhi and its environs, approached Dastkar for help. H&M, under fire for sourcing cut-price merchandise from Asian sweatshops, had funded a project with women in Hapur, Uttar Pradesh, to train them to make beaded wristbands, then greatly in demand at their stores. The brand committed to placing orders once the women had mastered the skill. The accessories department at New Delhi’s National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) was commissioned to do the training and develop designs. However, when the project ended, the Swedish company decided that there was no longer a demand for the bands. The Hapur women were left with a skill but no orders. So they came to Dastkar and, along with the NIFT students, developed lovely beaded jewellery and decoratives aimed at the Indian market. A Dastkar Bazaar was imminent, and the women worked tirelessly to produce stock. Their products were a runaway success and, elated by their first foray into the market, the women went home each night to make more pieces. The group, Agaaz, still continues, travelling to bazaars all over India. A happy ending, but there’s a moral to the story too. Global markets and international chains have their own imperatives. Quick turnovers, cheap production, constantly changing looks and product ranges. These factors do not necessarily match those of traditional craft communities because what craftspeople excel at is making one-of-a-kind products, in small quantities, with unique techniques and identities. This (and I agree with Sabyasachi here) is a luxury we need to nurture and market. Trying to turn it into mass assembly-line production doesn’t work for them, nor does replicating it industrially. The two streams should be kept separate, and each must have its own identity. Blurring the lines doesn’t help anyone.  No shortcuts, please  Sabyasachi, whose play with Indian textiles in his early collections I remember with pleasure, has the talent and creativity to fashion a distinctive Indian look without appropriating and digitising existing textile traditions. Our Indian colours, flora and fauna, patterns and motifs in architecture and sculptures, carvings, etc, are more than sufficient design inspiration. Simply chastising Sabyasachi on social media is not the answer. It’s a wake-up call to all in the design fraternity, especially in a country where millions of craftspeople themselves have no voice and GIs (geographical indication) are only on paper. India is fortunate to have a huge pool of living craft traditions. How we promote it, give craftspeople due respect, make craft a profitable profession, and sensitively preserve cultural identity while bringing it into the 21st century and the contemporary marketplace, is the real challenge. When working with communities that have centuries-old creative traditions and practices, there should be no crude shortcuts, however tempting. The fact that more and more people are turning away from the short-term agendas of global brands is heartening. Only the hands of Indian craftspeople can make each of us look both different and stunning.  Laila Tyabji is chairperson of Dastkar, an NGO that works to support traditional Indian craftspeople.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/wake-up-call-to-the-design-fraternity/article36052495.ece
23 August 2021||Chandigarh,||Haryana extends lockdown till Sept. 6, relaxations to continue||The Haryana government on Sunday extended the COVID induced lockdown by a fortnight while allowing various relaxations permitted earlier to continue. The relaxations include the opening of restaurants, bars, malls, clubhouses and shops. “The Mahamari Alert-Surakshit Haryana is extended for another fortnight, that is from August 23 (5 a.m. onwards) to September 6 (till 5 a.m.) in the State of Haryana along with guidelines to be implemented during this period issued vide earlier orders,” an order issued by Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan said on Sunday. The order was issued in the exercise of powers under various provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. As per other relaxations allowed earlier, conduct of entrance and recruitment examination by different universities, institutes or government departments and recruitment agencies will continue to be permissible. All COVID-related guidelines including those related to social distancing, sanitisation and seating capacity, however, will have to be followed, the order said. Universities and colleges will be allowed to reopen for students for doubt classes, practical classes in laboratories, practical examinations and offline exams with strict adherence to the COVID-related norms, earlier orders provided.  Plan for varsities Vice-chancellors of universities in the State are advised to plan the reopening of universities from the next academic session and share the programme of the same with the concerned department of the State government. Immediate action may be initiated by the university administration to fully vaccinate all hostel students, day scholars, faculty and other staff including the outsourced ones, the government order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-extends-lockdown-till-sept-6-relaxations-to-continue/article36052321.ece
23 August 2021||new delhi,||HC rejects bail plea of basketball coach accused of sexual assault||The Delhi High Court has rejected the bail plea of a basketball coach accused of sexually assaulting his 13-year-old student noting that “betrayal of trust at an early stage of life may inhibit the child from developing healthy interpersonal relationships in the future”. Justice Subramonium Prasad noted that the 57-year-old man, being the basketball coach of the girl and also known to her parents, “can be stated to be in a position of trust or authority of a child, as per Section 9(p) of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act”. “The relationship between the Prosecutrix (victim) and the Petitioner is, therefore fiduciary in nature,” the judge said adding, “This compounds the severity of the matter.” The girl, in her complaint, has stated that the man provides her basketball coaching at a sports complex here. On April 10, 2021, when she reached the complex at 6.15 a.m. for her basketball coaching, the coach asked her to do an exercise. The girl stated that when she was exercising, the coach groped her. The girl narrated the incident to her parents. On her complaint, FIR was registered for offences punishable under Section 354-B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) of IPC and Section 10 (aggravated sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. The coach had contended that the allegations recorded in the FIR and the charge-sheet are false, frivolous and a figment of the girl’s imagination. He claimed that the FIR was a means to play out a personal vendetta which exists between his wife and the mother of girl, both of whom work in the same school. ‘Did not misread act’ The HC, however, did not agree with the submission that the victim may have “misread an innocuous act” of the coach. “The Prosecutrix (girl) herein is a 13-year-old girl studying in 9th standard of a public school in New Delhi. She is well equipped to differentiate between conduct that may be inadvertent and conduct that may be deliberate,” the High Court said. “Furthermore, the allegations in the FIR as well as subsequent statements of the Prosecutrix are coherent in nature,” the High Court remarked. Additionally, the High Court stated that, “paramount consideration is to be given to the well-being of the child whose mental psyche is vulnerable, impressionable and in a developing stage. The long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse are, at many times, insurmountable”. “An act of sexual assault or sexual harassment, therefore, has the potential to cause mental trauma to the child and may dictate their thought process for the years to come. It may hinder the normal social growth of the child and lead to various psychosocial problems which could require psychological intervention,” Justice Prasad remarked. While rejecting the bail plea, the High Court directed the trial court to proceed with the framing of charges within one month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-basketball-coach-accused-of-sexual-assault/article36052326.ece
23 August 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Infection among 0-18 age group close to 1,000 mark in Odisha||With total infections among people in the age group of 0-18 approaching the 1,000-mark in Odisha since August 15, experts advised the government to take cautious approach for reopening schools for regular classes for all students. Since August 15, a total of 7,430 persons have tested positive for COVID-19 while 948 persons in 0-18 years have been found to be infected. Infection among children accounts for 12.75%. Till August 16, Odisha’s total caseload was 9.96 lakh. “The rate of infection among below 18 year population in Odisha corresponds to national average. The State does not have higher infection among children,” said Bijay Panigrahi, State’s Director of Health and Family Welfare and head of vaccination drive. Though the Odisha State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (OSCPCR) recommended reopening of Classes from VI to VIII in a phased manner, the government is adopting wait and watch policy. The child protection body wanted reopening of schools for students’ cognitive and academic development. Now, schools are open for IX and X Classes across the State. There were reports of infections among students attending physical classes. Three private schools and one government school in Bhubaneswar reported new cases among students. Wait and watch policy In fluid situation like this, the government has adopted a wait and watch policy. A senior official in School and Mass Education Department said, “the government would finalise its strategy for opening rest of the classes by first week of September depending on the trend of infection of population in the age-group of 0-18.” Dr. Panigrahi said a decision to vaccinate children above 12-year-old in the State would be taken soon after the approval of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

The development comes a day after some right-wing organisations and religious leaders clad in saffron staged demonstrations, torched effigies of Pakistan, and demanded tough action by the police against those people who had raised pro-Pakistan slogans in the Geeta Colony area on the night of August 19. Ujjain Superintendent of Police Satyendra Shukla confirmed to PTI that the NSA has been invoked on four persons who among others had allegedly shouted the slogans.  Names not given He refused to give names of the accused. The District Collector invoked the NSA on four accused on the recommendation of the police, police sources said. Mr. Shukla said police have arrested ten people for sloganeering so far. Reacting to the incident on Friday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said his government would not tolerate a “Taliban-like” mindset. When asked if the sloganeering was a reaction to the district administration’s decision to ban all public processions because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ujjain police had denied any such link.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/pro-pak-slogans-nsa-invoked-against-4/article36052323.ece
23 August 2021||Chandigarh,||Farmers’ stir over cane prices continues||Farmers seeking a hike in sugarcane prices continued to block rail tracks and a national highway in Punjab’s Jalandhar as a meeting between their representatives and State Ministers here remained inconclusive with another round scheduled with agriculture experts on Monday. Scores of farmers had on Friday launched an agitation for an indefinite period to press the Punjab government to accept their demands related to pending dues of sugarcane and hike in cane prices. After the meeting here on Sunday, senior farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal told reporters, “Not much was achieved from today’s meeting. It remained inconclusive.” He, however, said the government has assured that outstanding arrears of private mills will be cleared within next 15 days and those of cooperative be settled by September first week. Another senior farmer leader, Balbir Rajewal, told reporters that the blockade will continue till their demand of hike in cane prices is met. The blockade by farmers has been affecting movement of trains and vehicular traffic. Emergency vehicles are, however, being allowed to ply. Giving more details of the meeting, Mr. Dallewal said, “On cost of production issue, the government admitted that the officials had not given them correct feedback and now in the meeting in Jalandhar these things will be discussed threadbare.” Meeting with experts Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said agriculture experts, officers of cooperation and agriculture departments will hold a meeting in Jalandhar with farmers’ representatives and all calculations regarding cost of production will be worked out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-stir-over-cane-prices-continues/article36052325.ece
