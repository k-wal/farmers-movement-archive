01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre suggests curbs in 46 districts with high positivity||With the daily tally of new coronavirus cases touching a 24-day high at 41,649 cases on Saturday, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written to several States that all districts reporting a positivity rate of more than 10% in the last few weeks ought to consider strict restrictions. According to a statement from the Health Ministry the curbs must aim to “prevent/curtail movement of people, formation of crowds and intermingling of people to prevent spread of infection”. Earlier, Mr. Bhushan held a meeting with health authorities from Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur. Over 80% of the active cases in these States were under home isolation. Pockets of concern The Director-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Balram Bhargava, who was present at the meeting, said that over the past few weeks, 40,000 fresh cases were being reported every day and 46 districts were showing more than 10% positivity; another 53 districts were showing positivity between 5%-10%.  The States were advised to conduct their own State-level sero-surveys for district-wise disease prevalence data as the fourth national level sero-prevalence survey — whose headline results were announced last week revealed that nearly 40 crore Indians lacked antibodies to the virus and were particularly vulnerable — was heterogeneous in nature. Dr. Bhargava advised the States to ramp up vaccination in the 60+ and 45-60 age categories as nearly 80% of the mortality was from these vulnerable age-groups. Regarding enforcement measures, he advised the State authorities to warn against all non-essential travel and to discourage all large gatherings. India’s active case load stood at 4,08,920, which constituted about 1.29% of the country’s total positive cases. On Saturday evening, India reported that it had administered 46.1 crore doses since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January.  Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan held a meeting with health authorities from Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-suggests-curbs-in-46-districts-with-high-positivity/article35660670.ece
01 August 2021||CHINTOOR (EAST GODAVARI),||Is abduction the new recruitment strategy of Maoists in Chintoor?||On June 17, a 12-year-old Gutti Koya tribal girl was allegedly abducted by the Charla-Sabari Area Committee of the CPI(Maoist) from her house in a settlement. The settlement in the Chintoor Agency comprises families that fled from the Moaist-hit Chhattisgarh prior to 2011. The girl was abducted to be groomed as a Maoist to be deployed on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. Spending over a month with the Maoists, the girl managed to meet the Chintoor police on July 27. Her meet was not an attempt to surrender before the police as a Maoist, but to plead with them for medical treatment and send her back to her parents. She pleaded with the police not to brand her as a Maoist. In December 2020, a 14-year-old Gutti Koya tribal boy was allegedly abducted by the Maoists from his house. In the police records, his official status remains ‘missing’. A native of Chhattisgarh, his family settled in Goluguppa, a habitation of the Internally Displaced Families (IDP) in Chintoor Agency. The incidences of abduction of Gutti Koya minors from the IDP settlements appear that the Maoists embraced the new recruitment strategy of “abduction:”. The tribe is known for its command over the terrain on the Andhra-Chhattisgarh borders. In the two cases of the abduction of minors, the pleas by their parents yielded no result to free their children from the clutches of Maoists, who are desperately inching forward to strengthen their force with the Gutti Koyas. Chintoor ASP G. Krishnakanth told The Hindu that the 12-year-old tribal girl stated that she was subjected to physical labour during her brief stint with the Maoists. “Investigation is on to ascertain the facts beginning from her abduction,” Mr. Krishnakanth said. When the apex court declared ‘Salwa Judum’ as unconstitutional in 2011, about 6,660 victims of the Salwa Judum–Maoists conflict fled Chhattisgarh to East and West Godavari districts. Above 90% of them are Gutti Koyas who settled in the reserve forests in the twin Godavari districts. On Saturday, a flex banner displaying the photographs of Maoists trekking the hilly terrain with loads of baggage surfaced near Edugurallapalli that shares a border with Sukma district, the heart of Red Corridor. The banner in Telugu condemned the kidnap of the 12-year-old girl. However, the authenticity of the banner was yet to be ascertained. Surrenders Since July last, four Gutti Koya tribal youth, including a 19-year-old girl, surrendered before the East Godavari police, reportedly after serving some months in the respective committees of the Maoist groups. They all settled in the Chintoor Agency. The age of the three youth is 19 and one was 20 when they surrendered. Former East Godavari SP Adnan Nayeem Asmi said the four youth had been recruited by the Maoists, including Charla-Sabari Area Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/is-abduction-the-new-recruitment-strategy-of-maoists/article35660678.ece
01 August 2021||Mysuru,||‘Removal of BSY an admission of corruption’||The removal of B.S. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister amounted to admission of corruption by the BJP government in Karnataka, claimed All-India Congress Committee general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala. “By summarily sacking Mr. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister of Karnataka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has admitted that the Karnataka government is mired in corruption,” Mr. Surjewala said here on Saturday. Addressing a press conference on the sidelines of the Mysuru division-level meeting of the Congress, Mr. Surjewala claimed that Mr. Modi had told the incumbent Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai about the alleged corruption in the State government and hence Mr. Yediyurappa’s replacement was necessary for an image makeover for the party. “The Prime Minister has proved the point that we have always raised,” he claimed. Even while he claimed that Mr. Yediyurappa was running a “corrupt” government with “maladministration”, the Congress leader found fault with Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for “habitually” insulting their own leaders. Similar treatment had been meted out to veteran leaders such as L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, and Keshubhai Patel. “The culture of the BJP is they do not like elders or wisdom,” he said. On defectors Meanwhile, Mr. Surjewala also claimed that the RSS-BJP leaders were demanding the removal of all the former Karnataka Ministers who had gone to court seeking a stay on the telecast or publication of their “misdeeds”. Also, there was opposition in the party to the induction of defectors into the Cabinet, he said, adding that they want all the defectors from the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) to be kept out. Mr. Surjewala also brought up the failure of the Prime Minister to visit the State during floods, which have ravaged Karnataka since 2019. He also alleged that Mr. Modi, who had time to visit other parts of the country such as Bihar and Gujarat, had not announced relief to the people of the State either for floods or for farmers, Dalits, or development in cities. “Karnataka does not exist on the map of India for Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. When asked if the Congress would try to woo the Lingayats, who formed the main support base of Mr. Yediyurappa, Mr. Surjewala said the Congress considered the support, love and affection of all communities, including Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Dalits, backward classes and even the miniscule of minorities like the Parsis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/removal-of-bsy-an-admission-of-corruption/article35661335.ece
01 August 2021||Guwahati,||Assam CM wants neutral probe into border clash||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday questioned the rationale behind the Mizoram government registering an FIR against him and six State officials over the recent border clash when the incident occurred within his State’s “constitutional territory”. Mr. Sarma said he would be “very happy” to join the probe but wondered why it was not being handed over to a “neutral agency”. The Mizoram police had lodged an FIR against Mr. Sarma and six officials under various charges, including those related to attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, at the Vairengte police station late on Monday after a gunfight between the Mizoram and the Assam police. The FIR, however, became public only on Friday. The clashes, which also involved civilians from the two northeastern States, left six Assam police personnel and a civilian dead. Responding to the development, Mr. Sarma, in a series of tweets, said: “Will be very happy to join in any investigation... But why is the case not being handed over to a neutral agency, especially when the place of occurrence is well within the constitutional territory of Assam.” Mr. Sarma said he has conveyed as much to his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga. The four police officials named in the FIR are IGP Anurag Agarwal, Cachar DIG Debojyoti Mukherjee, Cachar SP Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar and Officer in Charge of the Dholai police station Sahabuddin. Cachar Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli and DFO Sunnydeo Choudhury have also been booked under the same charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assam-cm-wants-neutral-probe-into-border-clash/article35660672.ece
01 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||INS Airawat rescues fishing boat crew members off Car Nicobar island||Eastern Naval Command’s (ENC) INS Airawat, a Shardul-class amphibious warfare vessel, rescued seven crew members from a fishing boat in distress off the Car Nicobar island in the Andaman area of the Bay of Bengal late on Friday. Based on a distress call received from the fishing boat, Saleth Matha II, the ENC vessel that was on deployment under Operation Samudra Setu-II, immediately proceeded towards the fishing boat at maximum speed to render assistance. The naval ship, after rescuing the crew members, towed the fishing boat to the nearest harbour for shelter. Challenging task The Port Blair-based fishing boat with seven crew members had been drifting from July 29 due to a major defect in its gearbox. Gusting winds beyond 25 knots, heavy swell and intermittent rain due to the active south-west monsoon in the region made the search and rescue operation a challenging task for naval personnel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/naval-ship-rescues-fishing-boat-crew/article35660659.ece
01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||T.N. objects to Vedanta’s plea, SC to list case on August 6||The Tamil Nadu government has objected to a plea by Vedanta in the Supreme Court for permission to continue producing medical oxygen at its Sterlite Copper premises at Thoothukudi for another six months to meet the demands of the COVID-19 crisis. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, the Tamil Nadu government, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Joseph Aristotle, on Friday said the State was self-sufficient in oxygen production and refused the offer from Vedanta. The Thoothukudi factory was permanently closed in 2018 for reasons of environmental pollution. Exceptional case However, the Supreme Court, on a stand-alone basis on April 27, allowed the factory to operate its oxygen plants till July 31 to help the State meet the high demand for medical oxygen caused by a devastating second wave. The court said a decision would be taken post July 31, after taking into consideration the pandemic situation, on whether or not to continue with the stand-alone arrangement. Senior advocate Harish Salve, for Vedanta, on Friday urged the court to extend the operation of its April 27 order for another six months. Medical requirement He said the oxygen plants at the Vedanta factory were capable of producing 1,050 tonnes of oxygen daily. The oxygen would be supplied free of cost across Tamil Nadu to fulfil its medical requirements during the pandemic. “Due to the timely intervention of the Supreme Court, the petitioner (Vedanta) was able to supply medical oxygen to the tune of 1,403 MT as on June 30, 2021, free of cost and is continuing it. “It has thereby augmented the efforts of the State and Central governments during the lethal second wave of the pandemic. Considering the average medical oxygen consumption for treating COVID-19 patients, the medical oxygen supplied is estimated to have saved 13,720 human lives,” Vedanta said in its application. Vedanta said the COVID situation is “dynamic”. The need for oxygen continues even as a third wave is widely expected. It assured the court to maintain a continuous and free of cost supply of oxygen for the next six months in order to aid in the battle against the pandemic. Vital part of supply “A vital part of the health infrastructure, while dealing with COVID-19, is the oxygen production and supply in the country. “Thus, it is important that a sufficient supply of medical oxygen be maintained throughout the country in order to prevent any casualties on account of lack of oxygen supply,” the application said. After hearing the arguments, the court agreed to list the case for further hearing on August 6.  Considering the average consumption, the medical oxygen supplied is estimated to have saved 13,720 lives||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-objects-to-vedantas-plea-sc-to-list-case-on-august-6/article35660995.ece

Lamboo was highly trained, especially in the making of IEDs. He was also instrumental in planning and executing the February 2019 Pulwama suicide attack,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar told The Hindu . Forty CRPF jawans died in the attack. Both militants were encircled and engaged in a gunfight after a specific input was generated by the police and a joint search operation was launched in the forest area of Namibian and Marsar, part of the Dachigam National Park, a forest range straddling Srinagar and Pulwama.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pulwama-mastermind-killed-in-encounter/article35660680.ece

District Collector J. Nivas alerted all the officials of 15 mandals alongside the Krishna from Jaggaiahpeta to Avanigadda. In a meeting here on Saturday, he said about 5.5 lakh cusecs flood water was being discharged at Srisailam and in Nagarjuna Sagar downstream there was 256 tmcft of water. Nagarjuna Sagar would be full by Sunday morning and surplus water would be discharged downstream. The same would reach Prakasam Barrage by Sunday evening, he said.

01 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Surge in border districts: Experts raise the red flag||Raising the red flag over the surge in the neighbouring States of Kerala and Maharashtra, COVID-19 experts in Karnataka have suggested reversal of certain unlock measures including weekend and night curfews in districts where the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is more than 2%. Sources said the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is likely to recommend this to the government after observing the spread in the border districts in the next few days. Although Karnataka’s seven-day average TPR stood at 1.18% prior to July 30, at least 10 districts have a TPR higher than the State average and are in the red zone. While Dakshina Kannada has the highest TPR at 4.58%, Chikkamagaluru, Udupi, and Kodagu have a TPR of 3.98%, 3.56%, and 3.51% respectively. Besides, Hassan, Shivamogga, Chamarajanagar, Mysuru, Uttar Kannada, and Tumakuru have TPR higher than the State average. Experts said stricter surveillance and containment measures should be imposed in districts where the TPR is more than 2% or has doubled in the last seven days. “It is important that the State starts imposing stringent restrictions such as weekend and night curfews apart from closure of bars, cinema theatres, and malls at this juncture when the neighbouring States are witnessing a surge,” said V. Ravi, TAC member. “We have always seen an increase in the number of cases and TPR in our border districts whenever there is a surge in Maharashtra and Kerala. The second wave also began after some clusters were reported in Mangaluru,” said Dr. Ravi, who is also the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in the State. Stating that it was too early to say if the third wave was beginning in the State, he said: “It is a matter of concern if there is increase in numbers consistently for over a week. We have to learn from our past experience and initiate quick measures this time to postpone the third wave,” he said. Inching towards 5% TAC chairman M.K. Sudarshan said crossing a TPR of 5% is a red alert. “Currently four districts are inching towards 5% TPR. When the TPR starts moving up, hospitalisations and occupancy of oxygen beds increase. Poor COVID Appropriate Behaviour by people is the reason for this. Stringent measures should be initiated to restrict congregation of people and crowding, especially in markets and public places. People should be fined for not wearing masks,” he said. The State government had eased COVID-19 curbs by restricting curfew hours to 10 p.m.-5 a.m., besides allowing cinemas to operate at 50% capacity from July 18. The ‘unlock 3.0’ guidelines permitting opening of all shops, restaurants, malls, private offices, and religious places till 9 p.m. in all districts, barring Kodagu, were implemented from July 5. Subsequently, restrictions were eased in Kodagu after its TPR fell below 5%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/surge-in-border-districts-experts-in-karnataka-raise-the-red-flag/article35660932.ece
01 August 2021||Mangaluru,||Buses between DK and Kerala to be suspended for a week from today||All bus services between Dakshina Kannada and Kerala will be suspended for a week from August 1. It is to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from Kerala where the positivity rate is high. Stating this at a District Disaster Management Authority meeting here on Saturday, Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel, who presided over the meeting, said that there is a need for all to follow the COVID-19 appropriate behavior to contain the spread of infection. He instructed the officials to ensure that students coming from Kerala were compulsorily quarantined in their respective accommodation facilities for a week. Their health should be monitored daily and all of them should have COVID-19 negative certificate. Deputy Commissioner K. V. Rajendra said that no political, religious, social meetings, and functions will be allowed in the district till August 10. But marriages will be allowed with a maximum of 50 persons. If more persons are found in marriages cases should be filed against the authorities of such marriage halls. Home Guards will be deputed to monitor the gathering of people. If a family had more than two positive cases such houses should be considered as micro-containment zones. If the infected persons are found roaming around cases should be booked against them, he said. He instructed the officials concerned to impose fine on such people who are found in public places without wearing masks. They should be made to wear masks and follow COVID-19 appropriate behavior. Tahsildars and taluk health officers should take appropriate decisions based on local conditions. In vaccination sites, the Deputy Commissioner said 60% of those aged above 45 years should be jabbed if they had registered and taken appointment online and the remaining can be administered the vaccine directly. In the 18 years to 45 age category, 80% should be given the vaccine through online registration and appointments and the remaining can be jabbed directly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/buses-between-dk-and-kerala-to-be-suspended-for-a-week-from-today/article35661316.ece
01 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Stalin opposes National Exit Test for postgraduate medical admissions||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Saturday expressed his strong objection to the Draft Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, recently released by the National Medical Commission. The draft regulations intended to undermine the role of the States in Post Graduate Medical Education, since their role in the admission of students under their own State quota is sought to be unilaterally removed, he said. In a letter to Union Health Minister Mansukh Laxmanbhai Mandaviya, a copy of which was released to the media, Mr.Stalin said it was unfortunate that such draft regulations had been formulated without a proper understanding of the current predominant role of State governments in this domain. “The Union Government and the National Medical Council need to appreciate the fact that it is only the States which have heavily invested their own resources to create most of the PG seats,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the State was against the proposed National Exit Test as well as the proposal to make it as the basis for admissions to PG seats. Pointing out that Tamil Nadu had consistently been opposing such measures aimed at centralisation of States’ powers, he said the proposed step was not only unacceptable but was also in contravention of the provisions in the Main Act, governing the common counselling for the seats at the State level. Mr. Stalin also drew the Union Minister’s attention to Section 11.2 of the draft PG Regulations, “which attempts to centralise and designate the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India as the designated authority for counselling for State quota seats.” He said the section was clearly contrary to the proviso in the Section 15 of the Main NMC Act, 2019, “which explicitly mentions that “the designated authority of the State Government shall conduct the common counselling for the seats at the State level.” Further, “Section 10.1 in the proposed draft Regulations and the sub-clauses under it are again a brazen attempt towards giving effect to the yet-to-be introduced licentiate examination for enrolment in medical registers and making it serve as a NEET for admission to PG Courses,” he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stalin-opposes-national-exit-test-for-pg-medical-admissions/article35661005.ece
01 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. finds itself at a crossroads||The State government appears to be at a crossroads on how best to balance COVID-19 curbs on social life and commerce against the crying need to reopen the moribund economy and restore shattered livelihoods ahead of Onam. The State is also under pressure from the Centre to shut down localities with an average test positivity rate (TPR) of above 10%. (As many as 355 local government jurisdictions are over the mandated threshold.) Travellers from Kerala also feel fenced off from neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Both administrations have announced that they will allow only persons with RT-PCR negative certificates from Kerala and Maharashtra to enter their respective jurisdictions via road, rail or air from August 1. Meanwhile, there is media speculation that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has expressed scepticism about the efficacy of the test positivity rate-driven COVID-19 regulations. The government also faces harsh criticism from the trading community that the curbs have not brought down the TPR. Instead, the ‘crippling and unscientific’ regulations have destroyed businesses. KVVES protest The Kerala Vyapara Vyavasaya Ekopana Samathi (KVVES) has threatened to rebel against the restrictions and open shops on all days from August 9. It has claimed that opening only on alternate weekdays for limited hours would cause crowding. Parallelly, the KVVES has moved the High Court to lift the curbs on the retail and service sectors. It has requested the court to allow businesses to open 24/7. The KVVES has told the High Court that 11 traders had committed suicide during the second lockdown. At least 20,000 shops have boarded up for good since May 6. Thousands of traders have approached the government for the cancellation of their GST registration. The retail and hospitality sectors have not recovered since the catastrophic floods in 2018. Idle stock remained piled up inside stores. Retailers are hard-pressed to repay loans and meet the rent. Many traders face the threat of eviction and forfeiture of property. Most of them cannot afford the wages of employees. An official says the government may update the pandemic mitigation roadmap in the run-up to Onam. The priority is to keep the death rate low and prevent the infection from overwhelming the State's finite health resources. The government could not risk discounting the possibility of a third wave driven by new and more virulent variants. The second COVID-19 wave is yet to abate. A trade-off between protecting lives and preserving livelihood is unavoidable at the current stage of the pestilence. Mr. Vijayan is due to chair a meeting of the pandemic expert committee on August 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-finds-itself-at-a-crossroads/article35661208.ece

Only people who have received two jabs and have RT-CPR test results not older than 72 hours would be allowed to enter the State. Until now, people with one jab were allowed in. This is applicable to travellers arriving by all modes of transport. For daily commuters from Kerala for education and employment, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has directed officials to issue passes once in a week instead of 14 days. He instructed them to make it mandatory for them to get tested every week. Mr. Bommai on Saturday held a videoconference with District Commissioners, CEOs and SPs of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, Mysuru and Bengaluru Urban as there is a surge in COVID-19 cases in the last few days. He instructed officials to intensify random testing at inter-State borders by establishing check posts. Deputy Commissioners and SPs have been told to inspect border areas once in two days and submit a report to the Chief Secretary. “The main intention is to keep the positivity rate below 5% in border districts,” he said. Quarantine for students Besides testing at railway stations and ports, RT-PCR test negative reports are mandatory for guests/ tourists at resorts. Mr. Bommai instructed officials to conduct testing at home stays/ resorts as the number of tourists have increased. Students arriving from other states are to be quarantined in hostels. Directing officers to ensure that there was no scarcity in medical facilities, oxygen and medicine supply, the Chief Minister said pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating units are to be distributed to the districts and installed immediately. The Chief Minister instructed DCs to provide required power supply for PSA units. Following the death of COVID-19 patients there, Mr. Bommai said action should be taken to commence the PSA unit in Chamarajanagar Medical College within a week. Vaccination drive During the interaction, all DCs were instructed to intensify the vaccination drive. With 72% of government school teachers receiving jabs, DCs have been told to increase vaccination to teachers in the next 15 days. The district administration has been told to intensify contact tracing and implement strict action to contain the pandemic by forming micro-containment zones. Wearing masks is made mandatory. The district officials were told to take steps to ensure crowd management at tourist spots and religious places. The Chief Minister instructed officials to submit their requirements regarding medical facilities to the government. Action will be taken to provide the same as early as possible to contain the pandemic. BOX  Guidelines extended  COVID-19 related restrictions would be extended for another 15 days. With this, cinemas will continue to operate with 50% occupancy, pubs will stay shut, and night curfew will remain in force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/negative-test-result-2-vaccine-doses-mandatory-to-enter-state/article35660918.ece

Under the leadership of Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao, the State had achieved progress not only on industrial front, but also with emphasis on balanced, inclusive development, it was working for all-round growth. Be it for growth of agriculture and industry or development of rural and urban areas, the State government operates several programmes and was also responsive. For industries, the government’s TS-iPASS scheme of time-bound approvals and self-certification for new projects was one of its kind in the country.

01 August 2021||Pune,||NFAI acquires over 450 glass slides of Telugu cinema||In a major acquisition, the Pune-based National Film Archive of India (NFAI), the country’s premier film repository, has added more than 450 glass slides of films from the golden heyday of Telugu cinema to its ever-burgeoning vaults. These glass slides constitute a veritable pictorial history of the ‘Golden Age’ of Telugu cinema from the late 1930s to the mid-1950s and feature a number of artistically important, trend-setting films and classic social dramas, which made Telugu cinema a force to reckon with in the regional cinematic sphere. Slides from 70 films The acquisition includes glass slides from 70 films like Y.V. Rao’s pathbreaking social drama about widow remarriage Malli Pelli (1939); B.N. Reddi’s classic Vande Mataram (1939); the popular swashbuckler hit Keelu Gurram (1949), featuring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Anjali Devi, and the famous N.T. Rama Rao starrer Daasi (1952) — a critically acclaimed adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s classic ‘Devdas’ among others. “We are indeed thrilled to have acquired these glass slides. All of them are in black and white and are of 70 Telugu films from 1939 to 1955. Together, they form an integral part of the early Indian cinema viewing experience while bringing to fore the vitality, innovation and originality of Telugu cinema,” said NFAI Director Prakash Magdum. Curtain raiser The slides, made by pressing a film positive between two thin glass squares, were used for announcing new attractions before the commencement of a film or during intervals in theatres, said Mr. Magdum. “The film positives used to prepare the glass slide were miniatures of the film poster or publicity material for newspapers and magazines. Presently, NFAI has over 2,000 such glass slides of Hindi, Gujarati and Telugu films in its collection,” he said. Commenting on the significance of the collection, Arti Karkhanis, in-charge of documentation at the NFAI, said, “These glass slides give a bird’s eye view of the publicity scenario in the Telugu industry in its formative years. It has a great reference value for film researchers, and we will soon digitise them.” “Glass slides are exquisite records of Indian cinematic heritage, and we are happy to preserve these in our archival collection. In the wake of fast-changing technologies, having these glass slides in such huge numbers is a rare and significant discovery.

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,||T.N.’s seroprevalence stands at 66.2%||Tamil Nadu has an overall seroprevalence of 66.2%, according to the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine’s phase-III cross-sectional survey conducted during July. Among the 38 districts, Virudhunagar had the highest seropositivity at 84%, while Erode had the lowest at 37%. The State’s seroprevalence — presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 — was 29% during the second survey conducted in April 2021 and 31% during October-November 2020. Of the 26,610 samples tested from 888 clusters for the third round of the serosurvey, 17,624 individuals had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The survey covered persons aged 18 years and above. In fact, the Indian Council of Medical Research’s survey that covered three districts and persons aged six years and above during June-July put the State’s seropositivity at 67.6%. Commenting on the State’s overall seroprevalence, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said, “We still believe that all districts should be careful and follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and encourage eligible persons to get vaccinated.” T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said the results of the serosurvey might look promising but challenges remained. “The risk is that there is still a susceptible population. If Chennai has a seroprevalence of 82% and cases still happen, it means that the virus can still spread if people do not follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The virus is known for variants, and this is a risk. People will be exposed to variants, and this is why we need to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour till we reach zero cases,” he said. He added that serosurveys would be conducted at regular intervals in the State.  According to the DPH report, the overall seropositivity of 66.2% could be attributed to the timing of the serosurvey and vaccination coverage. The phase III serosurvey was conducted during the declining phase of COVID-19 second wave in the State. Intense vaccination drives conducted from January 16 and inclusion of 18+ age individuals for vaccination would have generated protective antibodies in the population. As of June 10, 97.6 lakh persons got vaccinated — either single or double dose — in the State, it said. Western districts such as Erode, Coimbatore and Tiruppur have reported around 45% seropositivity which could be attributed to consistent reporting of new COVID-19 cases in these regions, the report added. Seroprevalence was more than 50% in 33 districts unlike in the previous two surveys in which seropositivity remained under 50%. After Virudhunagar, Chennai had the highest seropositivity at 82% as against 49% in the previous round. As many as 11 districts had seropositivity in the range of 70 to 79%. This included Madurai (79%), Tenkasi (78%), Theni (77%), Tirunelveli (76%) and Ramanathapuram (75%). In the last two serosurveys, Erode’s seropositivity stood at 17%. After Erode, Coimbatore had the least seroprevalence at 43%. In the second phase, Coimbatore had a seroprevalence of 20%. Tiruppur’s seropositivity stood at 46% as against 23% in the previous survey. Nagapattinam and Namakkal had 47% and 48% seropositivity respectively. While Nagapattinam recorded a seropositivity of nine per cent in the survey-II, Namakkal had 26% seropositivity. Meanwhile, another serosurvey conducted earlier this month jointly by Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) and National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) has shown similar results as that of DPH. Unlike DPH’s study, this study conducted in Chennai included not just the 18 plus population but people aged six years and above. The study, which involved 7,026 samples collected from 51 wards, showed an overall seroprevalence of 78.2 %. The seroprevalence was 72.2 % in the six to 11 age group, 76 % in the 12 to 17 age group, and 82.5 % in the 18 years and above age group. Among the 15 Chennai zones, Tondiarpet had the highest seroprevalence of 83.3 % and Alandur the lowest of 74.1 %. Of the 51 wards, 24 had positivity more than 80%, 21 had positivity between 70% and 80% and six had less than 70%. Otteri had the highest seroprevalence of 94.7 % and Kolathur the lowest of 67.2 %.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tns-seroprevalence-stands-at-662/article35661078.ece

His comments came in the wake of newly appointed Tamil Nadu BJP president K.

The surprising announcement was made by the singer-turned-politician in a detailed Facebook post in Bengali, titled “ Alvida ” (goodbye), in which he added, “resigning from my MP-ship too (obviously)”. The MP had initially posted he was a “team player” and was not joining any other political party — the Trinamool Congress, the CPI(M) or the Congress, he mentioned — but later, this portion was edited out from the post. The two-time Asansol MP was a part of the Union Council of Ministers under Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the past seven years. He was upset at being dropped in the recent Cabinet reshuffle. “Questions will definitely arise, [on] why I have decided to quit politics. Does it have anything to do with being dropped as a Minister? Yes, it does, some of it certainly does,” the MP posted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-mp-babul-supriyo-says-he-will-quit-politics/article35660674.ece

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ruins of an Indus Valley civilisation site||With its planned streets, intricate water management system and architectural features, the ancient Harappan city located at Dholavira in Gujarat’s Rann of Kutch has a lot to offer on the ancient civilisation. With its inscription on UNESCO’s World Heritage list on July 27, experts hope the lessons from Dholavira will reach a larger audience and that the site will get greater care. Discovered in 1968 by former Archaeological Survey of India Director General Jagat Pati Joshi, the site dates back to 3,000 BCE to 1,500 BCE, covering nearly 1,500 years of continued habitation. Excavations that were carried out from 1989 to 2005 unearthed a city that showed the “unique and masterpiece ingenuity of the Harappans during the third millennium BCE”, according to India’s nomination submitted to UNESCO. The city is believed to have had trade ties with Mesopotamia and Oman peninsula. Spread over 70 hectares, the remains are encompassed within an outer fortification and make for the fifth largest Harappan site after Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Rakhigarhi and Ganweriwala, or sixth if Lakhanjo-daro is taken into account, according to the nomination dossier. The site’s entry onto the World Heritage list has been welcomed by India with delight. “Absolutely delighted by this news,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on July 27. “Dholavira was an important urban centre and is one of our most important linkages with our past. It is a must visit, especially for those interested in history, culture and archaeology.” For retired Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Joint Director General Ravindra Singh Bisht, under whose watch the excavations were carried out, Dholavira getting the World Heritage tag means it will get the attention it deserves. “Certainly, the ASI will take better care of the site. The eyes of the world tourist will be on it.” Along with becoming the 40th Indian site on the list, Dholavira is also the first Indus Valley Civilisation site in India to receive the tag. Considered one of the best preserved urban settlements from the period, the site has a walled city, a castle, a ceremonial ground, two seasonal streams and houses of different categories, indicating a social hierarchy. The water management system shows the ingenuity of the inhabitants to survive in an otherwise arid region. Excavations have unearthed objects of shell, copper, stone, semi-precious stones, terracotta and gold. Excellent example Dholavira was the first such “excellent example of town planning with mathematical precision, both arithmetic and geometry”, Dr. Bisht said. Stone quarries that manufactured beautiful objects were found and objects like beads found in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa seem to have been transported from Dholavira, he said. The site also has several gates, including the North Gate that had a signboard above it, a first of its kind found at Harappan sites. While the board itself could have been made of wood and decomposed completely, the gypsum letters of the inscription were found, according to Dr. Bisht. Divided into a citadel, the middle town and lower town, Dholavira was designed for different categories of residents and purposes. There was a castle for an important person, while the middle town housed rich merchants and generals and the lower town was for the common people. An annexe used as a warehouse, two grounds, bead-making workshop and graves were also found. According to Dr. Bisht, the larger of the two grounds, with seating for spectators all around, much like stands at a stadium today, was used for cart-racing, animal races and races by humans too. But, that wasn’t all it was used for. A large number of beads that would have fallen down from the wearers’ bodies while dancing were also found at the ground, pointing towards festivities, he said. Evidence of the ground being used for trading purposes was also found. Temporary structures of grass and wood would have been put up for bazaars. The water management system included drains constructed through two monsoon channels and a cascading system of reservoirs, according to Dr. Bisht. In houses in the lower and middle town, septic tanks were found. The castle had a network of drains connected to an arterial drain that was underground. “All these drains are usually found containing fresh water deposits, and not sewage nor household waste, nor are these connected to house drains. It was only during Stage VI [1,950 BCE - 1,800 BCE] that a house drain seems to be discharging into one of the storm water drains, when those had already become defunct. The purpose of these drains was surely to let out the monsoon run-off, which is why these are found furnished with air ducts at short intervals,” the nomination dossier said. Memorials at the city One of the finds that stands out are Dholavira’s memorials. Dr. Bisht said they seem to be constructed a year after the death of the person as there were no skeletons found, though there was evidence of offerings being made. This, he said, was like the shradh ceremony to mark one year of a loved one’s passing. The memorials also had design that was found in Buddhist stupas. Now with the site getting the World Heritage tag, ASI officials said it would get greater care. However, the ASI’s own nomination dossier raised concerns over the increase in footfall at the site. “…approximate 20,000 visitors are reported to visit Dholavira annually. The site witnesses minor pressure and vandalism in terms of visitors walking over the excavated remains due to lack of a defined movement plan. This, in future due to increase in tourist footfall, may pose threat to the integrity of the excavated remains,” the nomination dossier that was submitted in 2020 read. While it remains to be seen what impact a potential increase in visitors will have in the future, the archaeological remains at the site show how important maintenance, or the lack thereof, was in the past. From 2,100 BCE-2,000 BCE, there was a general decline “particularly in the maintenance of the city”, seen more in the citadel, the dossier said. There was evidence of poor quality ceramic wares that became brittle as well as signs of desertion for a few decades. Finally, the area of the city began decreasing and the last phase of habitation had no resemblance with the urban features of Harappan settlements. “The site was never occupied thereafter,” the dossier noted.

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pegasus row: CJI Bench to hear plea on Aug. 5||A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana will on August 5 hear a petition filed by senior journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar for an independent probe headed by a former or sitting top court judge into the mass surveillance of over 142 potential “targets”, including journalists, lawyers, ministers, Opposition politicians, constitutional functionaries and civil society activists, using military-grade Israeli spyware Pegasus. The Chief Justice will have Justice Surya Kant accompanying him on the Bench. The Supreme Court causelist for August 5, released on Saturday, showed the petition filed by Mr. Ram and Mr. Kumar listed along with separate petitions on the same issue filed by Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas and Supreme Court advocate M.L. Sharma. The senior journalists’ petition was mentioned by senior advocate Kapil Sibal before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Friday. The CJI had agreed to list the case next week. Mr. Sibal had pleaded urgency in hearing as the petition concerned issues affecting the fundamental rights, civil liberties of citizens and even national security. He said the issue was making waves not only in India but globally. “Such mass surveillance using a military-grade spyware abridges several fundamental rights and appears to represent an attempt to infiltrate, attack and destabilise independent institutions that act as critical pillars of our democratic set-up,” the petition has said. It has sought a full disclosure from the government on whether it had authorised the snooping, which seems be an attempt to muzzle free speech and to chill dissent. The government, the petition said, had still not given a straight answer to whether the illegal hack was done with its blessings.

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI/COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka seeks to reset relations with India||After months of strain over a number of issues, including the cancelled port project in Colombo, Sri Lanka is preparing to send its High Commissioner-designate to New Delhi, along with a “road map” to restore ties that includes resolving fishermen’s issues, building connectivity, trade and investment, as well as promoting religious links, Buddhist exchanges and handing over a sacred “Sita temple stone” from Sri Lanka for the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya. According to a formal proposal presented to Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, which The Hindu has seen, the road map will help bridge the “growing trust deficit”. In February, the Narendra Modi government expressed its unhappiness over Sri Lanka’s decision to scrap the East Container Terminal project signed in 2019, amid other signs that China was gaining the upper hand in infrastructure deals in the country. The Rajapaksa government has been disappointed over the lack of movement on the requests it made to India for assistance, including a debt repayment waiver for three years and a separate currency swap for $1 billion to help with economic crisis which were made by President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to Mr. Modi. Transactional approach “In recent years, the Indo-Sri Lanka bilateral relationship has been increasingly dominated by a transactional approach. This is a consequence of the changes in the geo-political equilibrium in the region, that have resulted in a growing trust deficit,” says the document prepared by a team led by new High Commissioner- to-be Milinda Moragoda, Deputy High Commissioner Niluka Kadurugamuwa and top diplomats at missions in Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai. The reset in ties is expected to be marked by the arrival of Mr. Moragoda, a former Cabinet Minister, in mid-August. His predecessor, High Commissioner Austin Fernando, completed his term and returned to Colombo on January 11, 2020, which makes this the longest period the position has remained vacant, even though Mr. Moragoda’s appointment was announced in August 2020. While officials say the COVID-19 situation and the lack of connectivity between India and Sri Lanka during the second wave contributed to the delay, no official reason was given to the Indian side who had processed the diplomatic agreement speedily at the time. An official of the Ministry of External Affairs welcomed the news of the High Commissioner’s arrival, but said New Delhi had not yet received details of the “Integrated Country Strategy” for India. In its recommendations, the paper says it is “imperative” that Colombo speeds up the West Container Terminal project that Sri Lanka offered after cancelling the ECT project, as well as the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm and other pending projects. It also advocates an inter-Agency Committee on Trade, Investment and Tourism to reach Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) goals of $256 million from India in 2022. While it sets a goal for Sri Lankan exports to India of about $675 million in 2022, it points out that export prospects presently suffer due to “increasing protectionism [in India], limited market access, a challenging and unpredictable regulatory environment as well as the Make in India Initiative, which prioritises local business and sourcing of local raw materials and products over imports”. The strategy is silent on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), negotiations for which appear deadlocked. In his letter to President Gotabaya introducing the paper, Mr. Moragoda outlines plans for the next two years of his tenure in New Delhi, including high-level visits between both capitals. Putting a special emphasis on the role of Buddhism, which he calls “most precious gift that India has bestowed upon [Sri Lanka]” from the time of Emperor Ashoka, he says the two countries are bound by geography, economics, culture, history and democratic values. “Against this backdrop, any setbacks to our relationship however intractable they may appear to be at any given point in time, can only be temporary,” Mr. Moragoda adds. The strategy paper advises promoting exchanges of Buddhist and Hindu scholars as well as Sri Lankan Catholic pilgrims to the “Velankanni trail” in Tamil Nadu. In particular, it speaks of handing over a sacred stone from the Sita Amman temple in Sri Lanka for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Among the problems the paper seeks to address is the conflict in the Palk Bay, where Sri Lankan fishermen object to Indians using bottom trawlers and fishing illegally along their coast, which often leads to arrests of the Indians. Indian fishermen accuse the Sri Lankan Navy of attacking and killing them. The paper suggests that top Sri Lankan diplomats engage directly with the government and fisheries associations in Tamil Nadu. It also advises engaging with the MEA, the Tamil Nadu government and the UNHCR to encourage and facilitate the return of about 1 lakh Sri Lankan refugees from India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sri-lanka-seeks-to-reset-relations-with-india/article35660607.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||India all set for UNSC presidency term||As it begins its month-long presidency of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), India is set to hold high-level meetings and briefings to bring focus to its three priorities: maritime security, counterterrorism and peacekeeping, said India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations T.S. Tirumurti in a video message released on Twitter on Saturday. On August 9, India will organise a virtual Open Debate for heads of state and government titled, ‘Maintenance of international peace and security: Enhancing maritime security — A case for international cooperation” according to a government press statement. Countries will discuss coordinations to tackle maritime crime and security issues. Increasing coordination India will also organise a minister-level meeting titled, “Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts” at the end of August. It is seeking to enhance coordination between the U.N. and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the money-laundering and terror-financing watchdog as well as address the linkages between terror and transnational crime. Another ministerial open debate on “United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Technology and Peacekeeping” will be held on August 18. India is one of the top troop contributors to the U.N. missions and is looking for ways to use technology to better protect the forces. It is also looking at ways to address crimes against them. It expects to deploy a mobile app — UNITE AWARE — that will provide terrain information and “improve situational awareness” for peacekeepers, Deputy Permanent Representative K Nagaraj Naidu told the UNSC in May, as per a PTI report. India had taken a “principled and forward-looking position” on various issues since its tenure at the UNSC began in January, Mr. Tirumurti said in his message. “We have been proactive. We have focused on issues of our priority. We have made efforts to bridge the different voices within the Council to ensure that it comes together and speaks in one voice on a variety of important issues of the day,” he said. Navigating this path has meant that India has sometimes abstained from voting at the Council and the larger U.N. system, for which it has been criticised for. For instance, in June, India was one of 36 countries that abstained from a General Assembly vote on an arms embargo on Myanmar, despite condemning the violence and saying there can be “no turning back” on Myanmar’s democratic transition. India, which shares a border with Myanmar and exports arms to the country, said its concerns were not reflected in the draft resolution. Escalation in conflict Other meetings related to international peace and security could be convened as needs arise — for example if there is an escalation in conflict. Afghanistan, along with Israel-Palestine, Syria, Lybia and Iraq will come up for discussion: these conflicts are regularly discussed at the Council. India already chairs the Taliban Sanctions Committee and Libya Sanctions Committee for 2021. The future of Afghanistan and the fallout for the region is a priority for India, as the U.S. and allied troops complete their withdrawal process. The government is keen to showcase the fact that the presidency coincides with its 75th Independence Day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla are expected to chair Security Council meetings. Mr. Modi will do this virtually, while Mr. Jaishankar could possibly travel to New York City for some of the meetings, depending on the schedule, which will be known on August 1, following the adoption of the work programme, according to government sources that spoke with The Hindu .

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Class dismissed||The 2013 film American Dreams in China tells the extraordinary rags-to-riches story of Yu Minhong and the New Oriental Education and Technology Group. The film, released in China in May that year, two months into Xi Jinping’s tenure as China’s President, is closely based on Mr. Yu’s life, telling the story of three friends in Beijing and their attempt to secure an American visa in search of prosperity. Two are rejected, and instead turn their efforts into starting a language school to help millions of others secure their American dream. The film’s resounding commercial success underlined how Mr. Yu and his company are seen by many in China — as a poster-child of the reform era. For a whole generation of Chinese, New Oriental became synonymous with learning English, and for many, with moving abroad and seeking their fortunes. According to the company, it has trained 65 million students, including 10 million last year, a reflection of the recent boom in China’s private education industry. It currently has a network of 118 schools, 1,625 learning stores and 48,300 teachers on its rolls spread across 104 cities in China. It is by some distance the biggest provider of private education services in the country. A 2006 profile in the official China Daily hailed Mr. Yu as “the “godfather for overseas study”. Indeed, Mr. Yu’s was a success story emblematic of China in its age of opening up — an age of unabashed ambition, aspiration and achievement — a success story, it appeared, that the government was happy to celebrate as well. Crackdown No longer, it appears. On July 25, Mr. Xi’s government dealt what the Chinese media described as “a death blow” to New Oriental and the wider private education industry, introducing sweeping regulations that are likely to bring a booming industry to a screeching halt. The new regulations, industry experts say, may go as far as turning all private education companies into non-profits, as well as barring them from going to the stock market (Mr. Yu’s was the first Chinese educational company to list on the New York Stock Exchange in 2006.) Foreign capital will largely not be allowed to participate in the private education sector, said the document issued by China’s State Council, or Cabinet. The cited reasons were understandable, aimed at “easing the burden on Chinese students and their families” amid the hugely escalating costs of private tuition. With the new regulations, shares of New Oriental and TAL Education, the other major player, crashed last week. Both are now down by a whopping 70% in the past month, reeling from the new regulations as well as earlier anti-trust moves that rattled the entire tech sector in China. Completing its fall from glory, New Oriental last week suffered a ratings downgrade, down to the lowest investment-grade rating from Moody’s and a step away from junk. The moves didn’t come out of the blue. Mr. Xi has on several occasions highlighted high education costs as a bane. Chinese authorities are also aware that it is the reason most often cited in surveys of families explaining why China’s population growth rate is falling despite relaxing family planning measures. Following the anti-trust investigations into tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent last year, and the more recent moves against the ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing, the latest regulations have now dealt a hammer blow to a third thriving industry and left investors shell-shocked. On July 28, China’s securities regulators convened a meeting with major investment banks to address their concerns, attempting to convey a message that the measures were industry specific and not a broader tech crackdown. They will take convincing after the latest bloodbath. Regulators’ moves have wiped out a combined $800 billion in value for China’s tech companies since February, according to Bloomberg data. If it is true the education regulations were to some extent a long-time coming and had their own sector-specific logic, they will inevitably be seen outside China as part of a broader effort by the Communist Party to tame companies and industries that its regulators see as having grown too big to control. “Unregulated”, is how authorities have described them — or in other words, more under the control of the market than the state.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/class-dismissed/article35660628.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||An ‘outsider’ but not quite||The biggest surprise in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s choice for the 30th Chief Minister of Karnataka was the absence of any surprise. Following the removal of his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa, after protracted subtle and not-so-subtle manoeuvres, the saffron party played it safe in picking Basavaraj Bommai, or so it appears for now. He is a Lingayat like the BJP’s old war horse Mr. Yediyurappa and has made his loyalty to the 78-year-old evident as he took over. So the Lingayat seers, who had landed on the streets of Bengaluru and warned the BJP that with Mr. Yediyurappa their trusted voter base too would walk away, seem mollified, as does the community’s strongman who has cultivated this vote bank. Less than two years to the next Assembly polls, the party belied the fear or anticipation (depending on one’s ideological leanings) in not choosing a man for the post in the template of Yogi Adityanath. Mr. Bommai, son of former Chief Minister and Janata Party leader S.R. Bommai, was groomed in the Janata Parivar politics and joined the BJP as late as 2008 and has since won thrice from Shiggaon Assembly constituency in north Karnataka. While the man, with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, has earned the reputation of an able administrator — handling key portfolios such as water resources, home and law and parliamentary affairs — Mr. Bommai is not known for hardline Hindutwa stances. Even his age, 61, seems to be a safe middle ground. The circumstances of Mr. Bommai’s choice, amidst several factional pulls within the party, beg a series of questions on what the BJP’s plans and expectations are and how the man in the hot seat will lend himself to them. Will he, and if so how soon, emerge out of the shadows of Mr. Yediyurappa and how will the veteran respond to it? Will he learn the language of hardline Hindutva and how will people of Karnataka respond to it? Or is he, for the party, an interim arrangement until the State is more adequately ripe for a head-on Hindutva agenda? While there are too many imponderables at this moment, there are signs of Mr. Bommai being a political player in his own right, though not quite in the style of his predecessor, who is credited with building the party in Karnataka through “risky operations” such as engineering defections with all the attendant costs. Image makeover For one, while calling Mr. Yediyurappa his mentor, Mr. Bommai has bristled at the suggestion that he will be a “rubber stamp CM” controlled by not just Mr. Yediyurappa but also his son B.Y. Vijayendra. Soon after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, he went so far as to say that the mandate given to him was an image makeover by delivering “a clean and efficient administration.” Mr. Bommai is also shrewd enough to know that Mr. Yediyurappa, while being a master at playing the caste card, is not quite the man who could ensure the ouster of Sadanada Gowda from the CM’s seat (who occupied it under comparable circumstances) when he began to assert himself back in 2012. It cannot be forgotten that Mr. Bommai was not so loyal as to follow Mr. Yediyurappa when he briefly broke away from the BJP in 2012, even though he never burnt bridges with him. Many have also pointed out that Mr. Bommai’s views on issues like the CAA and the NRC or anti-cow slaughter law have never been out of line with the party’s agenda. If symbolism is anything to go by, Mr. Bommai, unlike his predecessor who took oath four times wearing a green shawl that represents the farmers, wore a saffron silk shawl to the swearing in ceremony and entered the State Secretariat bowing at the door in the style of Mr. Modi. By all accounts, Mr. Bommai is a man of measured steps and words and has bided his time to become the Chief Minister of Karnataka in a party where he is still seen with suspicion as an “outsider” without Sangh roots. Is that good enough to keep him in the saddle in the long run, possibly beyond 2023, is the big question. In the short term, the Cabinet expansion exercise he has to undertake soon — when defectors from other parties, hardliners and pro- and anti-Yediyurappa camp followers are sure to pull in different directions — will be a tough test. Which way Mr. Bommai leans in doing so will say something of what the future holds for him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-outsider-but-not-quite/article35660633.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Only PM or HM can clarify on Pegasus scandal’||The Parliament has failed to function effectively for nine consecutive days as the Opposition wants a debate on the Pegasus spyware controversy, with a reply from Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Home Minister Amit Shah. Underlining the lack of intent from the Centre to address many key issues such as price rise and the farmers’ agitation apart from the snooping scandal, Congress’ Chief Whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh says passing Bills in the din is a complete mockery and an insult to the people.  The Parliament has not functioned properly for nine consecutive days. Barring a debate on the COVID pandemic, the Rajya Sabha has not seen any other significant deliberation. Will this continue next week too? The demand of all Opposition parties is first and foremost a discussion on Pegasus with a reply from Home Minister Amit Shah. This is because snooping and surveillance have grave implications not only for the constitutional rights of citizens but also for national security. The government says we can seek clarifications from the new IT Minister. This is a macabre joke since the new IT Minister was himself the target of Pegasus snooping and surveillance. Opposition parties have said that Pegasus is the key priority. Aren’t other issues like high fuel prices, the nine-month-long farmers’ protests equally important? Of course they are! I myself have given notices on both the current economic situation and the ongoing farmers’ protests on July 23 before the Pegasus episode unfolded. A number of my colleagues and also friends in the Opposition have submitted similar notices. We haven’t heard anything from the Chairman on them. Has the government made any attempt to reach out to the Opposition to break the logjam? No. Gatecrashing into meetings of Opposition parties and inviting Opposition leaders for tea as a throwaway line in conversation as Piyush Goyal (Leader of House in Rajya Sabha) and Pralhad Joshi (Parliamentary Affairs Minister) have done shows complete lack of seriousness on the government’s part. We are waiting for Rajnath Singh to call all floor leaders in both Houses for a discussion. When IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw rose to give a statement in the Rajya Sabha on Pegasus, Trinamool Congress MP Shantanu Sen snatched and tore his papers. That day the Opposition could have sought clarifications on Mr. Vaishnaw’s statement. Didn’t you let go of that opportunity? The House has to be in order to be able to seek clarifications. In fact after the IT Minister read out his meaningless statement, the Chairman [Venkaiah Naidu] was moving on to the next item of business when I got up and asked what about clarifications, which is our legitimate right. But I raised it only as a matter of procedure. The truth of the matter is that neither the old nor the new IT Minister is the right person to answer the questions that the nation is asking. Only the PM or HM are in a position to respond to these questions. There is no room for a third person in this one-man show, two-man army government. The government may curtail the session. So far four Bills have been passed in the Rajya Sabha in the din without any substantial debate. In the Lok Sabha, too, we see a similar situation. Your comments? It is abundantly clear that a combined and forceful Opposition has cornered the government on the Pegasus issue. The government wants no discussion whatsoever on this subject. Hence its threats to adjourn Parliament. Passing Bills in the din is a complete mockery and an insult to the people of our country. Pegasus is an issue that affects each and every Indian and undermines our democracy. Farmers issues, issues relating to the economy, prices of essential commodities are also of paramount importance and we have been agitating in Parliament on them as well.  We haven’t heard anything from the Chairman on notices given over the farmers’ protests and price rise||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-pm-or-hm-can-clarify-on-pegasus-scandal/article35660590.ece
01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||No further sentence after life term: SC||The Supreme Court found a Karnataka trial court’s order directing a convict to spend another 10 years in jail after he completes his life sentence rather “irrational”. The top court pondered on what the trial judge meant. A Bench, led by Justice U.U. Lalit, said life imprisonment normally means prison till death. A human being, like all other loving beings, has but one life. How is it possible for a person to serve 10 years of jail after life? Justices Lalit, accompanied by Justice Ajay Rastogi, said it would have made sense had the trial court ordered the prisoner to serve the 10 years in jail before the commencement of his life sentence. Once a convict is sentenced to life, the prison sentence for his other crimes should be served concurrently. That is the law, the top court said. The case was an appeal filed by convict Imran Jalal, through senior advocate Siddharth Dave. Jalal was sentenced for life in three counts and 10 years of prison in another five counts. But what bothered Mr. Dave, which led to the appeal, was the trial court’s decision to have Jalal serve a decade in prison under the Explosives Substances Act after he completes his life term. “The legal position is fairly well-settled that imprisonment for life is a sentence for the remainder of the life of the offender unless of course the remaining sentence is commuted or remitted by the competent authority... Any direction that requires the offender to undergo imprisonment for life twice over would be anomalous and irrational for it will disregard the fact that humans like all other living beings have but one life to live,” Mr. Dave argued, quoting from the top court’s own judgments from the past. The Bench agreed with the senior lawyer’s argument on the finiteness of life, saying, “Once the prisoner spends his life in jail, there is no question of his undergoing any further sentence.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-further-sentence-after-life-term-sc/article35660616.ece
01 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Railways to deploy satellite-backed clocks to ensure uniform time||In a significant shift in policy, the Indian Railways will provide Global Positioning System (GPS) clocks for control offices to enable section controllers coordinate with station masters, loco pilots and other staff directly involved in train operations to ensure uniformity in time. The enhanced safety measure will replace analog clocks and train operations will soon be guided by satellite supported timers known for precision and reliability. Section controllers will set the time for station masters, loco pilots and others to correct their clocks/ watches to uniformity. The Ministry of Railways amended relevant provisions in the rule book to make way for the technology upgrade. Cause of accident The move follows an investigation into the head-on collision of Train No. 18005 Howrah-Jagdalpur Salmeswari Express in East Coast Railway on June 25, 2019, which left three railway employees dead and several passengers injured. The Commissioner of Railway Safety who probed the circumstances that led to the accident concluded that there was a “mismatch in timings maintained in control office, at railway stations, loco pilot, signal power monitoring, data logger and the like” It was found that the instructions prescribed under Rule 4.01 of General Rules on “Timing and Running of Trains” were not followed in many divisions. The rule states that “the section controller shall transmit the correct time at 16.00 hrs daily to all the stations under his control by using a common ring. The station master on duty will adjust the station clock and record any variation in the time variation register…” Rule amended Accepting the recommendations of the Commissioner of Railway Safety that the rule be suitably amended to adopt GPS timings to ensure uniformity of timings maintained at different places and by different set of staff, the Railway Board has directed General Managers of all Zonal Railways to provide GPS clocks in control offices across Indian Railways. “The accuracy in the synchronisation of time in the clocks maintained by the control office, station masters, loco pilots, guards and others is crucial in ensuring safety of train operations. In the accident involving Samleswari Express, there was a block in the section for maintenance work that was lifted without actually ascertaining the clearance of the line for passing the train. Besides other lapses, the enquiry has found mismatch in time maintained by the staff concerned caused the collision,” a senior railway official heading a Signal & Telecommunication Wing of the Railways told The Hindu.  Heritage with modernity The huge clocks at major railway stations would also be modified to GPS technology by replacing the analog mechanism. However, the outer box clock design would be retained to keep the heritage look. In Southern Railway, the process of providing GPS clocks at control offices would be completed in a month’s time, Chief Public Relations Officer B. Guganesan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-deploy-satellite-backed-clocks-to-ensure-uniform-time/article35660618.ece
01 August 2021||Chinsurah,||ASI breathes life into 17th century Dutch cemetery||As early as 1656 after the decline of the Portugese, the western bank of the river Hooghly was occupied by the Dutch. For nearly two centuries, a Dutch settlement flourished at Chinsurah and started intra-Asian trade in spices, cotton and indigo. However, in 1825 when Dutch Commissioner B.C.D. Bouman surrendered Chinsurah to the British government, most of the monumental architecture of the Dutch was destroyed. Of the few remnants of the Dutch architecture, the cemetery, a protected monument remains as the most important proof of strong Dutch presence in the town more than 40 km upstream from Kolkata on the river Hooghly. The Archeological Survey of India, Kolkata Circle had started the restoration of the Dutch cemetery soon after completing the restoration of Danish cemetery at Serampore. But unlike the Danish cemetery which had not more than 50 graves, the Dutch cemetery has around 250 graves that need attention. “The Dutch Cemetery still stands and is a reminder of the golden days of Dutch legacy in Chinsurah. The cemetery contains an assortment of graves scattered under the shade of old trees and surrounded by a high wall. The cemetery has two segments, the older one having graves of Dutch nationals and the other, still in use by the British and native Christians,” Subha Majumder, Superintending Archeologist, ASI Kolkata Circle said. Dr. Majumder said the restoration process might take a few months and is likely to completed by the end of this year. The oldest tomb that could have been identified at the cemetery belongs to Sir Cornelius Jonge who died in Chinsurah in 1743. The other important graves at the cemetery includes that of Daniel Anthony Overbeck, Dutch Governor of Chinsurah, who stayed at the town even after the British took over the town in 1825. He died in 1840 and was interned in a sarcophygus tomb. Enclosed by a high brick wall, the cemetery has mausoleums which are typical to architectural style of the period and are similar to those found in south India. The southern part of the cemetery compound is home to 24 extant Dutch tombs, which are of three types — pyramids, tomb boxes and plain grave stones. “The Chinsurah Dutch cemetery is probably the biggest non-British European cemetery in West Bengal. The challenge is to restore these structures in their original form. There are many structures inside the 4,000 sq m plot which are ornate and have distinct architectural design which illustrates the uniqueness of Dutch architecture in this part of country,” Dr. Majumder said. In 1993 a devastating tornado damaged some of the brick structures in the cemetery which were subsequently repaired by the ASI. Experts also pointed out that the restoration of the structure is necessary because of the frequent tropical cyclones like Amphan (May 2020) and Yaas ( May 2021)over the past few years having an impact and weakening these the centuries old structures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/asi-breathes-life-into-17th-century-dutch-cemetery/article35660622.ece
01 August 2021||New Delhi,||JD(U) delegation to meet PM to seek a caste-based Census||The Janata Dal (United) saw a change in leadership with Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, popularly known as Lalan Singh, taking over as the national president, replacing R.C.P. Singh, who recently was inducted in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet. At a meeting of the party’s national executive in Delhi on Saturday, the JD(U) took key decisions that could put it on a collision course with its ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The party’s national executive decided that a delegation of MPs will meet the PM to press for a caste-based census, a long-standing demand in Bihar. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2011 undertook a Socio-Economic Caste Census to get data on the caste and economic status of every household in the country. The socio-economic data from the census was made public in 2015, but the caste data was withheld, citing discrepancies. Despite repeated demands, the Centre has refused to divulge the data on caste. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar tweeted on July 24: “We believe there should be a caste-based census. The Bihar legislature had unanimously passed a resolution to this effect in February 2019 and again in February 2020 and it was sent to the Central Government. The Centre should reconsider this issue.” His stand was also backed by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). This could become a bone of contention between the JD(U) and its ally, the BJP, with the RJD too jumping into the debate. Mr. Kumar has been arguing that a detailed caste enumeration will help the State identify the really needy people from among the broad categories. The Centre provides 27% reservation to OBCs (Other Backward Class), whereas in Bihar, OBCs get 12% reservation; EBCs (Economically Backward Class) 18%; and women of Backward Classes get 3% reservation. The JD(U)’s resolution also urges the Centre to make public the findings of the Justice Rohini Commission constituted on the sub-categorisation of OBCs. In the backdrop of a draft Population Control Bill put out in the public domain by U.P.’s Law Commission, the resolution adopted by the JD(U) on Saturday said that while the party supported the mission of population control, it cannot be achieved by bringing in a law. The JD(U) has decided to contest in the upcoming U.P. Assembly elections. In 2017, the JD(U) sat out of the U.P. Assembly polls. “Our first priority will be to try and negotiate a seat sharing arrangement with the BJP, but if that is not possible, we will go in alone,” a senior JD(U) leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jdu-delegation-to-meet-pm-to-seek-a-caste-based-census/article35660595.ece

Both sides agreed that in order to maintain peace and tranquillity in the areas around Ao Senden village and Vikuto village as they are known in Nagaland and called as Jankhona Nala / Nagajankha and Compartment No. 12 respectively in Assam, urgent and effective steps are required for defusing the stand-off between the security forces of both States. “In this regard, it is decided that the security personnel of both States shall simultaneously move back from their present locations to their respective base camps. The simultaneous withdrawal of the security personnel shall begin immediately and shall be completed in the next 24 hours as far as possible,” according to the agreement.

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rs. 90 lakh indemnity for woman bedridden due to negligence||The Supreme Court has confirmed nearly Rs. 90 lakh in compensation for a woman bedridden for 15 years after her teachers neglected to get her timely medical aid for a fever she developed during a school tour. Akshatha was a 14-year-old when she left for the educational tour in December 2006. The case records show the group visited several places in north India before she was taken ill. Her viral fever was later diagnosed as Meningo Encephalitis. “The doctors opined that had she been given timely medical aid and attention, she could easily have been cured. Ultimately she had to be airlifted in an air ambulance to Bangalore,” a Bench led by Justice Navin Sinha said. The court noted that she was confined to her bed and the illness has affected her memory and speech with no prospects for recovery. Commission order The State Consumer Redressal Commission ordered the school management to pay her a compensation of Rs. 88,73,798. However, the National Commission reduced the amount to 50 lakh without giving any reason whatsoever. “Judicial discretion is not arbitrary to be exercised sans reason to the prejudice of another. There is no discussion by the National Commission or any reasons spelt out for the formation of this opinion by it to reduce the compensation,” the apex court said. The Bench re-affirmed the State Commission’s order and held that the decision of the National Commission was “arbitrary and unsustainable”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-90-lakh-indemnity-for-woman-bedridden-due-to-negligence/article35660614.ece

Ms. Badal was accompanied by Ritesh Pandey of the BSP, Mohammed Faizal of the NCP and Hasnain Masoodi of the N.C. “We have come here to tell the President that democracy and democratic traditions are under threat and the voice of parliamentarians is being crushed inside Parliament too. This is a big loss for democracy. As the custodian and conscience keeper of the country, he should put pressure on the government to listen to the people’s issues and allow Parliament to function,” the former Union Minister told reporters. Ms. Badal said more than 500 farmers have so far died in the agitation while the government is living in denial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oppn-meets-president-on-behalf-of-farmers/article35660592.ece
01 August 2021||New Delhi,||India and China hold 12th round of dialogue||India and China on Saturday held the 12th round of Corps Commander talks at Moldo on the Chinese side. Details of its outcome are not known yet. The talks began around 10:30 in the morning and concluded around 7:30 pm, a defence official said. The focus of the talks has been on concluding an agreement for disengagement at Gogra and Hot Springs as part of the overall disengagement and de-escalation in Eastern Ladakh to end the standoff which began last year. This has been one of the shortest round of Corps Commander talks, which has sometimes extended for over 16 hours. A lot of time in the talks is spent in translation, one official explained. China had earlier suggested July 26 as a possible date for the talks but the Indian side had conveyed that the day being Kargil Vijay Diwas it would not be convenient. While disengagement has been completed on both banks of Pangong Tso in February, other friction points that remain to be resolved are Gogra and Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang. Buffer zones were established in some places as part of earlier talks which remain in place and the situation on the ground remains stable, one official said. Another round of Major General level talks is also scheduled to be held very soon. In Eastern Ladakh, India and China have two mutually agreed disputed areas, Trig Heights and Demchok, and 10 areas of differing perception. Since the standoff last year, five additional friction points have emerged, which include Km 120 in Galwan area, Patrolling Point (PP) 15 and PP17 and Rechin La and Rezang La on the South Bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-and-china-begin-12th-round-of-dialogue/article35660599.ece

The police said Lamboo visited several training camps of the JeM in Afghanistan and Pakistan. “Out of 19 accused terrorists and supporters involved in the Pulwama attack, seven, including Adil Dar, Mudasir Khan, Umar Farooq, Kamran, Qari Yasir,Sajjad Bhat and Lamboo were killed in encounters. Around seven terrorists and over ground workers have been arrested and five are still absconding,” IGP Kumar said. Lamboo, according to the police, was closely associated with JeM chief Azhar Masood and had infiltrated into this side of Kashmir in the year 2017 through Sakargadh Sector. He was a 'A++' categorized terrorist. “Lamboo was behind the killing of policeman Fayaz Ahmed, his wife and daughter in Tral, this year,” IGP Kumar said. The police added that Lamboo was trying to re-establish and strengthen the JeM terror outfit and utilize Awantipora, especially Kakapora and Pampore area of Pulwama, as a hotbed for receiving new terrorist groups and transporting them to the other parts for carrying out terrorist attacks. The security forces recovered one AK rifle, one M-4 carbine, a Glock pistol and a Chinese Pistol at the encounter site. Srinagar-based 15 Corps, GoC, D.P.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||BJP MP Babul Supriyo says he will quit politics||The two-time Asansol MP was a part of the Union Council of Ministers for the past seven years and was upset at being dropped in the recent Cabinet reshuffle. “Questions will definitely arise, [on] why I have decided to quit politics. Does it have anything to do with being dropped as a Minister? Yes, it does, some of it certainly does,” the MP posted. Mr. Supriyo had unsucessfully contested the West Bengal Assembly election earlier this year from Tollygunj in south Kolkata. He lost to Trinamool Congress leader and Minister Aroop Biswas by a margin of about 50,000 votes. The MP went on to compare the situation in 2014 with 2019, and said that he had been the only BJP MP from West Bengal in 2014, and that the MP from Darjeeling, S.S. Ahluwalia, had won the Lok Sabha polls because of support from the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha. The BJP had two Lok Sabha MPs from the State in 2014 and the number rose to 18 in 2019. Mr. Supriyo also spoke of his differences and “disagreements with the State leadership on some issues” though he did not name anyone. The differences between him and State BJP president Dilip Ghosh have been publicly known on several occasions. Mr. Ghosh had objected when Mr. Supriyo took to social media to announce that he has been asked to step down as a Minister. Asked about the development, the State BJP president said that he had not received any written resignation from Mr. Surpriyo and would not react to “posts on social media”. The development comes as a major embarrassment to the BJP, which is battling dissent and defection after the party suffered a humiliating defeat in the Assembly polls. Mukul Roy, who was national vice-president of the BJP, joined the TMC in June 2021, a month after the Assembly polls. A few weeks ago, another BJP MP, Saumitra Khan, announced his decision to step down as president of the BJP Yuva Morcha but later withdrew his resignation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-mp-babul-supriyo-to-quit-politics/article35660600.ece
01 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||HC disapproves of use of term ‘South Terror’||The Allahabad High Court has disapproved of the use of the term “South Terror” by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad for the Popular Front of India. Two members of the outfit were arrested in February on allegations that they were planning to target leaders of “Hindu” outfits and carry out terror strikes at “sensitive” spots in the State. The court made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by one of the accused, Anshad Badarudheen, through his brother, seeking transfer of the investigation in the case from the ATS to the CBI. Prejudice charge The counsels for the petitioner argued that the probe was not being carried out in a free and fair manner, and alleged that the State authority and the investigating agency were prejudiced against the petitioner as he was a member of the PFI. They said the PFI had been labelled as “South Terror” on the portal of the ATS. The Division Bench of Justices Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Ajai Kumar Srivastava on July 27 said the use of the term did not import bias but expressed concern over its use. “So far as the allegation of use of term ‘South Terror’ on the portal of respondent no.5 is concerned, it is pertinent to mention here that use of such term would not per se import element of malice or bias towards the petitioner. However, we view this fact with profound concern and disapprove use of such term,” Justice Srivastava noted. The court also said it did not view the case as a rare or exceptional one where the investigation needed to be transferred to the CBI. The U.P. Special Task Force claimed that they had recovered heavy explosives from the duo and foiled attacks planned by them. The PFI dismissed the police claims and alleged that the two Kerala men were picked up and illegally detained days before their formal arrest while they were on their way to a Mumbai-bound train from Bihar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-disapproves-of-use-of-term-south-terror/article35660601.ece

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man held for sexual abuse of children||A coordinated effort by investigative agencies worldwide recently resulted in the arrest of one person in Goa by the Central Bureau of Investigation for the alleged sexual abuse of children. The CBI has so far identified 27 young victims. The images and videos, through which the offender and the victims were identified, were originally uncovered in Belgium and uploaded to Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE) database by Europol. It also enabled the Australian officials to provide additional intelligence. Indian national As it turned out, the accused was involved in the sexual abuse of children in Goa and Maharashtra. He would record the acts on his mobile phones, digital camera and other electronic devices. The photographs and video clips were shared with others through the Internet and sold via the dark web. The accused is an Indian national. The agency alleged that the person was in touch with other paedophiles overseas via social networking websites and platforms like Instagram and Whatsapp. The Interpol victim identification task force comprising officers from 11 countries, including India, spent two weeks in early July analysing material selected by the Interpol’s crimes against children unit and its efforts resulted in the identification of 130 abuse locations. Information was sent to the relevant member countries for investigation. Vast database As stated in the Interpol’s website, its ICSE database holds more than 2.7 million images and videos and has helped identify 23,564 victims worldwide. “Using image and video comparison software, investigators are instantly able to make connections between victims, abusers and places. The database avoids duplication of effort and saves precious time by letting investigators know whether a series of images has already been discovered or identified in another country, or whether it has similar features to other images,” it says. The database allows specialised investigators from over 64 countries to exchange information and share data with their colleagues across the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-arrests-man-in-goa-for-sexual-abuse-of-children/article35660613.ece

The petition will now come up for hearing before a single judge. The petitioner had sought a direction from the court either to set up a special investigation team from amongst officers of the ACB to probe the allegations or direct the Central Bureau of Investigation to register a case and investigate the allegations. The petitioner had on November 20, 2020 filed an application before the Governor seeking sanction for prosecuting Mr. Yediyurappa, and then lodged a complaint with the ACB on November 25, 2020, against him and others, but the ACB closed the complaint on December 15, 2020. Private complaint On June 4, 2021, he filed a private complaint before the Special Court for criminal cases against MPs and MLAs. The complaint was dismissed on July 8, 2021 for want of sanction from the Governor though the special court had observed that “no doubt there is some material to refer the complaint for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.PC.” On June 30, the public prosecutor produced before the special court the order passed by the Governor on June 23, 2021 declining sanction for prosecution of Mr. Yediyurappa. The petitioner has been seeking a probe accusing Mr. Yediyurappa of abusing the office of Chief Minister and his family members of receiving a bribe from representatives of Ramalingam Construction Company in relation to a contract of a housing project of the BDA. The petitioner has relied on various materials, including WhatsApp messages exchanged among the contractor and the family members of Mr. Yediyurappa on alleged demand, and payments made and received through various modes, as basis for his complaint. Mr. Yediyurappa’s son, other family members, the former Minister S.T. Somashekar and others have been named as respondents in the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/yediyurappa-graft-case-plea-referred-to-single-judge/article35660650.ece

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Traders protest closure order, demand easing of curbs||The Greater Chennai Corporation’s sudden order asking shops in several commercial areas in the city, including T. Nagar, Purasawalkam and George Town, to be closed till August 9 caught traders unawares and some of them resorted to protests, demanding relaxation of curbs. However, a large number of shops in nine commercial areas remained closed on Saturday. Teams of police and civic officials went around asking traders to down shutters. Shops that were open on roads in the vicinity of Ranganathan Street in T. Nagar were closed by the police. Some shops functioned, letting in customers through the rear entrance. Traders protest A section of traders gathered on Bharathi Salai on Saturday morning and protested against the sudden decision to close shops till August 9. The decision was enforced without giving sufficient time, they said. Shops on NSC Bose Road, Broadway, Bharathi Salai, Triplicane and other places in the commercial areas remained closed. However, when a few traders opened shops in the morning, the civic authorities asked them to close and began imposing fines. This triggered protests. The police and civic authorities had to pacify the traders. Triplicane Traders’ Association president V.P. Mani said, “The authorities should have given us sufficient time. Most traders here deal in perishable items such as meat, fish, and fruits. If the shops are closed suddenly, all the items will go waste.” Assistant Commissioner of Police (Triplicane) M.S. Bhaskar said, “Traders have been advised to buy goods from the regular market and sell on vehicles.” Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu president Vikramaraja said the sudden lockdown in certain areas affected traders. “We are ready to cooperate with the government. But any decision to close shops has to be taken after another meeting without affecting traders,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-protest-closure-order-demand-easing-of-curbs/article35660971.ece

01 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Stalin opposes draft PG medical education regulations||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin on Saturday expressed his strong objection to the Draft Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, recently released by the National Medical Commission. He charged that the draft regulations intended to undermine the role of the States in Post Graduate Medical Education, since their role in the admission of students under their own State quota is sought to be unilaterally removed. In a letter to Union Health Minister Mansukh Laxmanbhai Mandaviya, a copy of which was released to the media, Mr Stalin said it was unfortunate that such draft regulations have been formulated without a proper understanding of the current predominant role of state governments in this domain. “The Union Government and the National Medical Council need to appreciate the fact that it is only the States which have heavily invested their own resources to create most of the PG seats,” he said. Pointing out that Tamil Nadu had consistently been opposing such measures aimed at centralisation of states’ powers, he said the proposed step was not only unacceptable but was also in contravention of the provisions in the Main Act, governing the common counselling for the seats at the State level. Mr Stalin also drew the Union Minister’s attention to Section 11.2 of the draft PG Regulations, “which attempts to centralise and designate the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India as the designated authority for counselling for State quota seats.” He said the section was clearly contrary to the proviso in the Section 15 of the Main NMC Act, 2019, “which explicitly mentions that “the designated authority of the State Government shall conduct the common counselling for the seats at the State level.” Further, “Section 10.1 in the proposed draft Regulations and the sub-clauses under it are again a brazen attempt towards giving effect to the yet to be introduced licentiate examination for enrolment in medical registers and making it serve as a NEET for admission to PG Courses,” he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-opposes-draft-pg-medical-education-regulations/article35661118.ece

On Saturday, the city recorded a day temperature of 37 degree Celsius, which was close to two degree Celsius for the month. Chennai may have a respite during evening hours as the IMD predicts possibility of light rains in some areas till Monday and the maximum temperature is likely to be around 36 degree Celsius.

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Pvt. candidates with disabilities exempted from exams||The Tamil Nadu government has exempted private candidates with disabilities from taking supplementary Class XII exams and has declared them “all pass”. A government order passed to this effect said the Disability Welfare Commissioner, in a letter, had said that all schoolchildren, including those in special schools across the State, had been declared as having cleared Class XII, following the cancellation of their board exams owing to COVID-19. The Commissioner, Johny Tom Varghese, said that persons with disabilities, who were to take up the supplementary exams as private candidates too should be exempted, given the COVID-19 situation, and had asked the government to consider an exemption for them as well. Following a decision taken by the Chief Minister, the Disability Welfare Department said in the G.O. that all candidates with disabilities would be exempted from taking supplementary Class XII exams, which are to begin on August 6. The order referenced Section 17(i) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, which states that suitable modifications can be made in the curriculum and examination system to meet the needs of students with disabilities. For the candidates, the government order also said that the School Education Department would decide on how marks would be awarded. The government, however, has added that candidates with disabilities who wish to go ahead and take up the exams can do so, but the marks scored in the exams would be treated as final. Following the cancellation of board exams, the State government had said that supplementary exams would be conducted for around 39,000 private candidates, since students were awarded marks on the basis of their performance in Class X, XI, and XII public exams and internal assessments. This included persons with disabilities who had registered to take the exams. Disability rights activists welcomed the government’s move. R. Sathish Kumar, a member of the Disability Rights Alliance said candidates with disabilities would have had to face several difficulties if they had to take the exam. “Wearing a mask would be hard for persons with Cerebral Palsy and other issues, where they salivate frequently. Sitting in close proximity to scribes as well as using public transport to get to the exam centres are major points of concern.” Mr. Kumar said for candidates with autism and other related issues, preparing for the exams too have been hard, since the pandemic has caused disruption of their routines. “We are thankful to the government for this move,” he said. T.M.N. Deepak, a disability rights activist and founder of the December 3 Movement, said apart from the risk that the candidates run in coming to the exam halls, the stress and burden of preparing for the exams during a pandemic, on them and their parents, was immense. In June, he had submitted a representation to the government, asking disabled candidates to be exempted from taking the exams.

However, pujas will be performed in the temples on these days. HR&CE Minister P.K. Sekar Babu said the entry of devotees was being barred, keeping in mind the rising number of COVID-19 cases. “We are concerned about the welfare of the devout, who visit temples in large numbers. The Tiruttani temple, for instance, attracts around 2 lakh devotees for ‘ Aadi Krithikai’ , and we even get people from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. If crowds gather, it will not help in controlling the spread,” he said on Saturday. In Chennai, devotees will not be allowed to enter temples, including the Vadapalani Andavar temple and Kandha Kottam Kandaswamy temple, till August 3. Fire-walking, making and offering of pongal, paal kudam and kaavadi will not be permitted.

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||An aspiring singer hopes to make a mark||K. Elangovan, a frail-looking 43-year-old visually impaired resident of the Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUHC), run by the Greater Chennai Corporation on NSC Bose Road, renders Tamil melodies with ease. The other residents drown themselves in the soulful singing and forget their sorrows for a little while. This is a regular affair at the shelter when the television is not switched on. However Mr. Elangovan, who was rescued from Marina recently, is not just a talented singer, he has an M. Phil in Tamil and has acted in the Tamil movie Cuckoo, which was released in 2014. He now wants to be a professional playback singer. “I am from Thanjavur. My uncle brought me to Chennai for schooling. I joined Loyola College in 1999 and completed my under-graduation in Tamil. I did my Masters in Tamil from Presidency College and my M. Phil is also in Tamil literature,” said Mr. Elangovan. He claims that his family did not support him. “When I was undergoing training to sing at the National Association of Blind in Madhavaram between 2012 and 2013, I got a chance to act in a movie along with others. I earned some money. I also used to sing in the Pallavaram subway and earn Rs. 500 a day,” he explained. His passion has always been singing. “He said that he used to take part in singing competitions in school. After he came here, the atmosphere changed. He entertains everyone with his songs,” said R. Thirumalprasanth, co-ordinator and counsellor of All The Children NGO that runs the shelter. Sridhar, a resident of the shelter, said that he forgets all his pain and sorrow when he hears the songs. “Listening to him is better than watching television,” he said. Asha Parekh Nandini, city-level coordinator, SUHC, said there were many talented persons in the shelter. “We are doing everything to bring out their skills,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/an-aspiring-singer-hopes-to-make-a-mark/article35660998.ece

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Delivering the daily news to five Chief Ministers||For years, K. Balakrishnan had to wake up at 4 a.m. every day, irrespective of the weather, to do the most important part of his job — clip important news articles from the morning newspapers and deliver them to the residence of the Chief Minister. In the pre-Internet era, as an office assistant attached to the reference section of the then Information and Tourism Department, he delivered the news clippings to the residences of five Chief Ministers — M.G. Ramachandran, V.N. Janaki Ramachandran, M. Karunanidhi, Jayalalithaa and O. Panneerselvam — between the late 1980s and the early part of the millennium. On Friday, the 60-year-old attained superannuation. “I would cycle from my house in Royapettah to Kalaivanar Arangam, where the newspapers were collected at dawn and articles selected and clipped for the reference of the Chief Minister. I had to reach the Chief Minister’s house before 7 a.m.,” recalls Mr. Balakrishnan. The clippings from Tamil and English dailies would broadly fit into five categories — news of public importance, politics, demands to the government, law and order situation and protests/demands by opposition parties. As someone who joined service in 1987, he considers himself lucky to have been served tea every day at the then Chief Minister MGR’s bungalow in Ramapuram. “The guard there, Manickam, would say Thalaivar does not want anyone leaving the residence on an empty stomach. I had tea every day until Thalaivar died in December 1987. He once saw me and patted me on my back for my duty!” he says. His routine continued when MGR’s wife Janaki succeeded him. “Eventually, I went to Gopalapuram and Poes Garden, and later to Greenways Road, when Kalaignar [Karunanidhi] , Amma [Jayalalithaa] and OPS ayya [Panneerselvam] became Chief Minister. Kalaignar ’s assistant Shanmuganathan would receive clippings from me,” he recalls. Later, he was assigned a different role. In 2006, when the then Information and Tourism Department was bifurcated into the Information and Public Relations Department and Tourism, Culture and Religious Endowments Department, Mr. Balakrishnan was posted in the latter, until his retirement last Friday. Balki, as he is fondly called by his colleagues, hopes for a peaceful retired life. Does he have any regrets? “None! When I got the job in 1987, my father advised me not to take bribe, and I can now say with pride that I kept my word. I am happy with my life. I have two granddaughters and a grandson,” he adds with a proud smile.

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination picks up in industries, availability a challenge||Vaccination has picked up pace across industries in Tamil Nadu in recent days. While hesitancy levels have come down, the availability of doses remains a key challenge. Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu recently told The Hindu that the government had instructed industries to get their employees vaccinated in a structured manner. “For instance, if a company employs 1,000 workers, we have told them to start by covering 200 workers, and proceed further in batches. This will ensure that the work environment is safe, and even if another COVID-19 wave emerges, the industries can operate. We are monitoring the progress, but the key challenge is the availability of vaccine doses,” he said. A senior official from the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine said hesitancy levels had come down to a large extent. “There are always one or two exceptions across society. The plan is to cover a large number of employees who are willing to take the jab, and then to proceed from there,” he said. Last week, the department issued fresh guidelines for workplaces and industries, and said staff and their family should be considered a high-priority group and inoculated with both doses. The official said the department had instructed them to continuously monitor the workforce because there was a possibility of future spread in industries. “For the revival of the economy, businesses should function without facing absenteeism and monitoring is the best strategy,” he said. TVS Motor Company, along with Sundaram Clayton and its group firms, had said a free vaccination drive would be held for all employees and immediate family members. They aimed to cover 35,000 direct and indirect employees across the country. A company spokesperson said around 99% of the firm’s employees had been immunised, and camps were being arranged at regular intervals for employees and families. Senior officials from India Cements said almost 99% employees and their family, except those affected by COVID-19, had been vaccinated. A drive had also been started for those who had recovered. Creating awareness “Initially, there was reluctance among some employees. However, we effectively counselled them and created awareness on the importance of inoculation, and got them vaccinated,” a company official said. A Hyundai Motor India Ltd company spokesperson said through its vaccination drive, 92% of its 15,700 eligible employees, including service personnel, had been covered with at least one dose. However, some service personnel from logistics providers had been excluded as they were being covered by their own employers. Camps have also been started for families of employees. JK Tyre & Industries Limited has about 2,300 employees, including management staff and operative personnel. Vijay Deshpande, adviser-HR, JK Tyre, said in the 45-plus category, the company had covered 100% of its employees with the first dose, while 32% workforce, including permanent and contractual employees, had received both doses. In terms of the workforce in the 18-44 age group, 89% employees had got the first jab, he added. S. Kannan, deputy general secretary, CITU, Tamil Nadu, said vaccination picked up pace because of the State government’s orders, and companies making inoculation a requirement to allow employees inside factories.

But our party functionaries are not working properly towards that.” He also reached out to other community leaders who have been opposing the 10.5% reservation. “To those who oppose 10.5% reservation, please ask who has been getting the education and jobs in the last 33 years and how much your community has been getting from the TNPSC,” he said. “I always stand for social justice. I want to meet those who are opposing this to explain our point of view. I have said the Vishwakarma community must be given 3%, and separate reservation given to Yadavars and Mutharayars. I will fight for it not because they will vote for us,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-needed-for-all-communities-ramadoss/article35661002.ece

01 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Skilled engineers will remain in demand’||Is engineering too hyped or can it really provide a good career? This was the point of discussion at the webinar on career counselling organised by The Hindu Education Plus and Sona College of Technology on Saturday. The panelists said there was a plethora of opportunities, should the students focus on their goals. At the webinar on choosing engineering and finding career opportunities in entrepreneurship and research, the panelists, all of them engineers, emphasised that to carve a career in the domain the candidates must realise their potential and interest. Chockalingam Valliappa, vice-chairman of Sona Group of Institutions, said that thousands of students graduating from his group of colleges had not only built a career in engineering but also turned out to be entrepreneurs. Many of them even took up research. He cited himself as an example of someone who pursued a career in entrepreneurship after doing Ph.D. A critical component to succeed was resilience, said M.P. Pattabiraman, founder CEO of People Radius and former head of Human Resources at McKinsey. He is an alumnus of the college and an entrepreneur. As a HR person, he said he would look for key qualities such as integrity, ability to work in a team, ability to listen and be mentored. Engineers of the future had several opportunities, said T.R. Parasuraman, president and wholetime director and member of the board of Toyota Industries Engine India Pvt. Ltd. Valuable lessons Every challenge was an opportunity, he said and pointed out that even COVID-19 had taught industries many lessons. The company used to hold its meetings abroad. Because of travel restrictions in the last two years, the company had to hold its conferences online. This meant huge savings for the company. This, he said, was a valuable lesson. Mr. Parasuraman said India, with its young population and because of its unique situation as a country entering the manufacturing sector when other major powers with an ageing population were entering the service sector, offered an abundance of opportunities to students. Coupled with technology, the students were in a unique position to reap the dividends of being in a young nation, he said. About students from a humble background pursuing engineering education, Mr. Chockalingam said his institution offered all-India tests, from which eligible students were chosen for scholarships. Also, the Centre offered scholarships for women students interested in joning engineering courses, Mr. Parasuraman added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/skilled-engineers-will-remain-in-demand/article35660982.ece

Mr. Sameeran said on Saturday that except the shops selling essentials such as milk, vegetables and medicines, the other shops will be open only from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the district. All shops except those selling essential items in the Corporation limits on Cross Cut Road, 100-Feet Road, Gandhipuram 5,6, 7 streets, Oppanakara Street, Ramamoorthy street, Saramedu Road, Rice Mill Road, NP Itteri Road, Thudiyalur junction and Ellai Thotta junction will not be permitted to function on Sundays. Restaurants across the district will be open to customers from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and only parcel service will be permitted from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. The restaurants should have only 50 % occupancy. All wholesale markets in the district will be permitted to sell only to wholesale traders and there will not be any retail trade. Further, only 50 % of the shops in the markets can operate on a day. So the shops in the markets will open on alternate days in turns. Anyone travelling from Kerala to Coimbatore should have the RT PCR test report taken 72 hours before or certificates for taking both doses of the vaccination. If there are travellers without either of these, they will have to take random RT PCR test at the checkposts, he said. These were decided after a meeting with the trade and industry here on Saturday. Meanwhile, industries in Coimbatore, including Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprises (MSMEs), are on alert as the cases are on the rise again in the district. “We are all wearing masks, check temperature, and use hand sanitisers at the units,” said Mr. Ramesh Babu. “The government should expedite vaccination for all workers and industry employees. It should allocate more vaccines to industry associations. There is more demand for vaccines now,” said Mr. Ramesh Babu. “Industries will have to be careful and avoid crowding,” said B. Karthigaivasan, general manager of the District Industries Centre. Industry sources say that while it is true that workers are returning to factories after relaxation of lockdown restrictions, there are no major incidents of COVID spread in the factories. “If the cases go up and the government introduces lockdown restrictions, we have no option but to stop operations,” says A. Sivakumar, president of the Coimbatore and Tiruppur District Tiny and Micro Entrepreneurs Association. Different government departments are also conducting regular inspections at industries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-restrictions-in-district-from-monday-as-cases-rise/article35661011.ece

01 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||TPDK alleges construction of discriminatory wall in Pannimadai||Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) has petitioned Collector about the construction of a wall that discriminated against Dalits living at Kondasamy Nagar in Pannimadai. In its petition, the outfit said a realtor developing housing sites opposite the Nagar to form Kannabiran Nagar had handed over four roads to the Pannimadai Panchayat. The four roads served as link roads to Kondasamy Nagar, providing access to different roads to the Dalit residents. Now, the realtor had built a 200m wall of 10 feet height to deny access to the four roads. The height of the wall also suggested that the Dalits should not have sight of what was happening at Kannabiran Nagar, the outfit’s general secretary K. Ramakrishnan claimed and said as the outfit’s petition to the Pannimadai Panchayat did not yield the desired result, it was forced to approach the district administration. He urged the administration to demolish the wall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tpdk-alleges-construction-of-discriminatory-wall-in-pannimadai/article35661008.ece

01 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore receives less than 50% of predicted rainfall||July marks the end of two of the four-month South-West Monsoon season. In these two months, the district ought to have received 111.3 mm rainfall – the average – but it had received less than that. The readings showed that the precipitation in June was 15 mm and in July 30.5 mm as against the average 42.8 mm and 68.5 mm respectively, said Professor S.P. Ramanathan, head, Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The less than the average and predicted rainfall for the current South-West Monsoon season – June to September – was due to the La Nina factor in which the lower sea surface temperature caused less rainfall for South India, he said. The 45.5 mm rainfall in the two months was in eight rainy days as against an average of nine. The centre accounted a day with over 2.5 mm rain as a rainy day. The prediction for August and September was 56 mm and 69 mm respectively and there was every chance the district could receive the predicted rainfall or much more. Though the monsoon had been poor, the water level in the Siruvani Reservoir was at a level that was more than what it was on July 31 in 2020 and 2019. Data from the Coimbatore Corporation showed that the water level stood at 35.11 feet in the reservoir against the full reservoir level of 49.5 feet. In 2020, the water level was at 14.33 feet and the year before 20.47 feet. The Corporation’s water managers said the water level in the reservoir was good enough to ensure adequate supply of water to the residents of the 20-plus wards that were Siruvani-fed. But for the Corporation to continue the same level of supply till Summer 2022, the water level should increase. The comfortable water level had also helped the Corporation to stop the diversion of Pilloor water to the Siruvani-fed wards. It had stopped the diversion over a month ago, said sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-receives-less-than-50-of-predicted-rainfall/article35661037.ece

If it is useful, the system will be installed at all the 40 hairpin bends,” said the official. The Pollachi-Valparai road, which runs for 64 km and has 40 hairpin bends, was inaugurated in 1903. The road is narrow, has sharp bends and deep valley sides. Visibility of vehicles coming in the opposite direction at the hairpin bends is not much and hence there are risks of accidents. The system has been developed to warn the vehicles of those coming in the opposite direction at the bends. The official said two systems were placed at the bend to warn drivers of vehicles coming in both the directions. Each system has four sensors and a display board that are powered by solar energy. When a vehicle passes within five feet of the sensor, it displays a warning message on the board and gives warning blinks. This alerts the driver of the vehicle coming in the opposite direction to slow down, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/safety-system-installed-at-hairpin-bend-on-valparai-ghat-road/article35661013.ece

01 August 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||‘Thozhi’, an exclusive project to help women victims, launched||‘Thozhi’, an innovative and exclusive project to help girl children and women victims in the district was launched here on Saturday. Inaugurating the project, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Dindigul Range) B. Vijayakumari said that protecting the innocent people under the eyes of laws was the prime duty of the custodians of the law. In a complex society, there were many issues happening around. The police had the utmost responsibility to save such gullible people and punish the violators as per the IPC Sections and among others. Under the ‘Thozhi’ scheme, the women police designated in each police station would handle the cases/complaints by reaching to the dwellings of the complainants. Instead of making them visit the police stations, it would be more appropriate to handle such issues on the premises of the complainants. Presenting two-wheelers and laptops to women police in the district, Superintendent of Police Ravali Priya said that rendering timely medical assistance, psychological support and shelter to the victims would be carried out swiftly by the police. After informing the superior officers, the women police constables (WPCs) would reach the spot and conduct the probe. An exclusive toll free number 181 can be accessed by the public. Out of the 48 police stations in Dindigul district, 24 stations would have the ‘Thozhi’ scheme functional from today. The objective of the scheme was to instil confidence among the victims and also to ensure that the violators were given a warning not to indulge in such crimes.

01 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC suspends sentence imposed on Mexican national in murder case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has suspended the sentence imposed on Mexican national Martin Manrique Mansoor by Madurai Mahila Court in 2020 for the murder of his ex-girlfriend and compatriot Cecile Denise Acosta. The court directed that he be enlarged on bail. The trial court had convicted and sentenced Mansoor to life for the murder. A Division Bench of Justices K. Kalyanasundaram and B. Pugalendhi allowed the application for suspension of sentence filed by Mansoor. He preferred a criminal appeal against the trial court’s order, and pending appeal he sought the suspension of the sentence imposed on him by the trial court. Mexican nationals Mansoor and Acosta had been partners since 2003. They had a daughter. At the time of the murder in 2012, Mansoor was pursuing a postdoctoral research in Mathematics at Kalasalingam University in Krishnankoil in Virudhunagar district. Acosta was learning Mohiniyattam at Kerala Kalamandalam in Thrissur, Kerala. The couple had quarrelled over custody of their daughter and it was said that following an argument, she was assaulted and grievously injured. Consequently, she died. In order to conceal the body, Mansoor wrapped it in a travel bag and burnt it with the bag in Austinpatti in Madurai district. Following a complaint by the Austinpatti Village Administrative Officer, a case was registered. Spare part of car The police found a spare part of a car at the place that was said to belong to the car used by Mansoor. The counsel representing Mansoor argued the prosecution had not established that the spare part was missing from the car recovered from Mansoor and it was also not established that the spare part recovered from the place belonged to Mansoor’s car. Taking note of the submissions made, the judges observed that a prosecution witness stated that such a spare part was available in all models of the car brand recovered from Mansoor. An expert said that tyre marks impression near the place of crime were analysed and it did not tally with the tyre marks of the car recovered from Mansoor. The court said that this raised certain doubts. Though the investigating agency collected call details, the same was not established before the trial court. Since the petitioner made certain arguable points in his favour, the court was inclined to suspend the substantive sentence of imprisonment imposed on him, the judges said. He was directed to appear before Madurai Mahila Court on the first working day of every month till further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-suspends-sentence-imposed-on-mexican-national-in-murder-case/article35661115.ece
01 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC tells official to find out fraudulent transactions in document registration||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Tirunelveli District Registrar to consider a complaint and find out if there were any fraudulent transactions made towards registration of certain documents. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that the Registrar was expected to conduct an inquiry and if there were fraudulent transactions, an order to that effect had to be passed and entered into the index as per the circular issued by the Inspector General of Registration. The court said that the findings of the Registrar must be reflected in the index. It goes without saying that the Registrar, while conducting the inquiry, is not supposed to act like a civil court and go into the title regarding the property. The Registrar has limited jurisdiction to assess whether such transactions in question were fraudulent. The court was hearing a petition filed by A. V. Dhakshnamoorthy, K. Vijayarengan and K. Sriraman of Tirunelveli. The petitioners were the absolute owners of a property and patta was issued in their name. In 1972, their family members pledged the property by executing a registered mortgage deed. A portion of the land was also acquired for Adi Dravidar Welfare Board in 1995. Under these circumstances, the petitioners found out that the Sub-Registrar of Nanguneri, who dealt with the property, had executed various sale deeds from 1995 to 2018. Fraudulent sale deeds, nearly 57, were registered based on bogus patta. The bogus patta was cancelled and necessary changes were also made in the revenue records. When the original owners of the land submitted a petition to the District Registrar regarding the fraudulent transactions, they were directed to approach the civil court. The court directed the District Registrar to consider the complaint and find out if there were any fraudulent transactions, and pass the orders in three months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/find-out-fraudulent-transactions-in-document-registration/article35661116.ece

Ramadass on Saturday said the announcement of Union Minister of State for Finance in the Lok Sabha that Puducherry would be granted Central assistance of Rs. 1,724.77 crore during the current financial year as compared to that of Rs. 1,698 crore in the last fiscal was “disappointing.” Mr. Ramadass, in a statement, said the quantum increase of Rs. 26.77 crore was “disappointing, unjustified and unacceptable”. “The Centre has taken the Union Territory for granted and no norm, leave alone scientific principles, had been adopted to decide the quantum of assistance. There is brazen violation of the celebrated cannons of fiscal devolution. The rudimentary test of soundness of assistance is that the current year assistance should at least be more than that of the previous year,” he said. As per the statement given by the Minister in the Lok Sabha, the increase in allocation last fiscal was Rs. 159 crore and 10.26% of the previous year. Now, the increase in allocation had been reduced to Rs. 26.77 crore.

01 August 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Farmers seek permanent DPCs in Theni district||The district administration should establish permanent direct purchase centres (DPCs) in Theni, said the farmers at the monthly grievance redressal meeting. Presiding over the meeting, District Collector K. V. Muralidharan said on Saturday that steps would be taken in this direction in a phased manner. However, he assured that the farmers' suggestions in this regard would be certainly looked into. The objective of avoiding middlemen would be accorded priority, he added. Though 829.80 mm is the normal average annual rainfall for Theni district, in 2020, the district experienced 1078.36 mm rainfall, which was 248.56 mm higher than the normal average. Till July, the Collector said that 632.75 mm rain was recorded against the normal average of 341 mm, which was 291.75 mm higher. Explaining that the rainfall had helped farmers enhance the cultivable area, Mr. Muralidharan said that paddy, sugarcane, cotton, among other crops were being raised on 10,700 hectares this season. He hoped the yield would also be higher as the government had released water from Mullaiperiyar reservoir on June 1. Moreover, officials from the Agriculture Department said that 2,200 ha had been covered under drip irrigation at a cost of Rs. 9.68 crore. This, they said, would help in judicious use of the water. Small and marginal farmers can enjoy a fat subsidy from the governments for setting up the infrastructural facilities. Farmers from Chinnamanur sought the setting up of a warehouse facility wherein they could store banana. They also pointed out that an electric pole near the PTR Canal should be removed as it posed danger for the residents there. To this the Collector asked the Tangedco engineers to attend to it. When many farmers pointed out the encroachment, especially those behind the Paramasivan Temple, Mr. Muralidharan said that they would set up a panel comprising PWD officials. “Soon, we will have a mega drive in this regard,” he assured. District Revenue Officer K. Ramesh, Joint Director (Agriculture) T Alagunagendran, PA to Collector (Agriculture) R. Vishnuram Methi and among others participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-seek-permanent-dpcs-in-theni-district/article35661105.ece

01 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Pack up, Collector tells Sterlite||Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi on Saturday said there was no need for Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant to continue its operations anymore as the COVID-19 situation in the State had improved due to steps taken by the government. During an informal chat with reporters here, after inaugurating two city buses, she said the plant was allowed to operate by the Supreme Court to meet the huge demand for oxygen for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Thanks to the steps taken by the government, many oxygen plants had been installed in several places across the State now. Moreover, steps had been taken to bring medical-grade oxygen from other States, too, if the situation demanded. As the pandemic situation across the State had improved a lot and influx of fresh cases to hospitals had come down considerably, there was no need for medical oxygen generated by Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant. “Since this oxygen plant has to be shutdown gradually, power supply to the plant’s cooling section has to be ensured for some more time. Sterlite Copper will not be opened again, as promised by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin,” Ms. Kanimozhi said. Meanwhile, Collector K. Senthil Raj sent a letter to Sterlite Copper on Saturday to wind-up operation of its oxygen plant as the deadline had ended. The Collector said the plant was allowed to operate on standalone basis till July 31 to meet the medical oxygen requirements during the pandemic. Since the period of operation, as allowed by the Supreme Court, had come to an end, operation of the oxygen plant should be stopped with effect from July 31, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pack-up-collector-tells-sterlite/article35661311.ece

01 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||GH conducts surgeries through new technology||The Department of Cardiology, Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, has conducted four Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) procedures last month. The OCT machine, recently installed at the GH, allows for a three-dimensional view of blood vessels in the heart. This would permit doctors to determine the course of treatment for patients quickly, doctors said. Addressing media persons, Dean, K. Vanitha said that an intra-vascular camera would be used to determine the location and length and breadth of a block in the arteries while an angiogram is being performed. This would accurately determine the percentage of an arterial block. Depending upon the OCT, doctors would decide whether the patient needed a pacemaker or not. In the last fortnight alone, four such cases had been treated, she said.  A. Balasubramanian, Head, Department of Cardiology, said that the OCT and Fractional Flow Reserve (FRR) equipment, cost Rs. 1.35 crore. The FRR procedure allows to measure the speed of the flow of blood through the blood vessels in the heart. "In case of a block, we will be able to see that the extent of the block, too," he said. Three patients have been treated using the FRR in the last week alone. M. Ashok, Assistant Professor, said that the FRR is apt especially in borderline cases wherein the block is only around 60 to 70% Another new technology being utilised at the GH over the last month is a dual-chamber pacemaker. In some severe cases, both the atrium and the ventricle would not be pumping blood properly. In that case, a dual-chamber pacemaker would be inserted. The pacemaker would not only assist in coordinated heart-beating but also keep track of it, in case of a drop or increase in heartbeats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gh-conducts-surgeries-through-new-technology/article35661436.ece

01 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Pedalling to protect Tamirabharani||Collector V. Vishnu and Corporation Commissioner B. Vishnu Chandran on Saturday pedalled for about 18 km to create public awareness of the need to conserve the Tamirabharani, other water bodies, birds and heritage structures along the course of the river. The perennial river — fulcrum of farming operations and drinking water projects — has been seriously polluted by tonnes of domestic and industrial sewage from Papanasam to Punnaikaayal for about 125 km. Devotees, after taking bath in the river at Papanasam, discard their clothes in the water due to belief that their sins would be washed away along with their clothes. Policemen of Manimuthar Battalion and volunteers periodically remove the discarded clothes. Five tonnes of clothes were removed during this week. While the river faces threat from the people, centuries-old granite mandapams along its course are getting defaced and damaged by anti-social elements, who use them as bars in the evening. “Since we have not understood the sacredness and value of the Tamirabharani, the river is getting polluted and heritage structures along the watercourse are also being damaged.,” Mr. Vishnu said before participating in the first cycle rally that started and ended at the Corporation office after going up to Kunnathur on the city outskirts. “So, we have planned to organise cycle rallies every Sunday to create awareness among the public of the need to save the Tamirabharani from pollution and conservethe heritage structures. Moreover, we should also protect the birds visiting the river and the water bodies,” he added. After digitally mapping the water bodies of the district and the Tamirabharani, the district administration has drawn a comprehensive strategyto protect the water bodies with citizens’ participation. The Collector has banned discharge of sewage into the river and has instructed local bodies to put in place a credible liquid waste management system in their areas by installing effluent treatment plants. Corporate firms have also come forward to join hands with the district administration in the exercise that began on Friday. “We will continue to organise the cycle rally on Sundays to explain to the public in a sustained manner the need to conserve nature and heritage. Moreover, the rally will also encourage them to be physically fit,” Mr. Vishnu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pedalling-to-protect-tamirabharani/article35661442.ece

01 August 2021||TIRUPATTUR,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on to prevent illegal sand mining along Palar river||The Tirupattur district administration is taking all out efforts to prevent illegal sand mining along the dry Palar river bed. With limited Revenue Department staff, the district administration has identified 16 areas between Ambur and Vaniyambadi, a distance of 18 km, along the Palar river where illegal sand mining was being reported regularly. Termed as ‘hot spots’, these identified areas are mainly small villages located between the river and the arterial road in the two taluks — Ambur and Vaniyambadi. Some of the key villages that are being used to reach the river bed include Somalapuram, Thennambattu, Komeshwaram, Minur, Karapattu and Bairapalli in Ambur taluk, and Bheemakulam, Kolapalli and Mallangunda in Vaniyambadi taluk. “We also have identified three major routes in these two taluks where illegal sand mining is reported. More police check-posts and CCTV cameras are being set up in these routes,” Amar Kushwaha, District Collector, Tirupattur, told The Hindu . As part of the crackdown, around 20 cases have been booked for illegal sand mining in the district since June. Further, a control room for each taluk has also been set up to get alerts from residents and social activists. These recorded alerts are being monitored by the Sub-Collector on a daily basis. These helpline numbers are: 04179 220091 (Tirupattur), 04179 242499 (Natrampallai), 04174 232184 (Vaniyambadi) and 04174 244255 (Ambur). Tirupattur, Natrampalli, Ambur and Vaniyambadi share nearly 60% of the total water pipelines laid under the Hogenakkal Drinking Water Scheme from Palar river a decade ago. Damage to pipelines The pipelines supply excess Cauvery river from Hogenakkal in Dharmapuri district to water-starved districts like Vellore, Tirupattur and Krishnagiri. Residents in these two taluks (Ambur and Vaniyambadi) fear that such illegal sand mining might damage the pipelines in the river. At present, each taluk in the newly formed Tirupattur district has 40 revenue officials including two tahsildars, five revenue inspectors and 30 Village Administrative Officers (VAOs). Tirupattur, Ambur and Vaniyambadi taluks have 91 villages, most of them located along the river. On an average, a team of seven revenue officials and police are needed for such surveillance, especially during night. However, district officials said that most of the routine revenue works including patta transfers and issuing various government certificates were delayed since last year due to the pandemic. In fact, more than 20,000 petitions for patta transfers were pending in the district as revenue officials had no time to conduct field surveys, sources said.  More police check-posts and CCTV cameras are being set up in these routes.

Official sources told The Hindu on Saturday that TNCSC’s Regional Manager (Tiruppur) S.K.

The residents’ complaint was that the rice bulged after cooking, which they were not used to and did not prefer for consumption. The delay in supply of rice occurred due to rain as the vehicle must travel around 80 km from the TNCSC godown to reach the settlements, which will be rectified in August, according to the sources. G. Chinnappan, a resident of Kattupatti tribal settlement, said on Saturday that the residents have withdrawn their plan to stage a demonstration as the issue has been redressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-visit-tribal-settlements-after-complaints-on-rice-quality/article35661028.ece

For the State that boasts a Chola inscription of around 920 CE in a tiny town of Uttaramerur, about 90 km south of Chennai, dealing with a written Constitution, the celebration carries a special meaning beyond the fact that the legislature has completed 100 years of existence. Inclusive representation Tamil Nadu witnessed elections in November 1920 when electors (only men), accounting for just 3% of the population, were enrolled, as a result of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report and the Government of India Act of 1919. The development paved the way for a more representative body than what it was till then. The proportion of elected members increased to over 70%. The concept of dyarchy came into being with Ministers, who were Indians, gaining limited control over certain subjects such as local self-government and education. It was then that the office of Chief Minister, also called Premier, got instituted. Besides, one seat in each territorial plural-member constituency — 28 in all — was reserved for non-Brahmins. With the Congress boycotting the election, the Justice Party romped home. Eugene F. Irschick, an American historian, in his 1969 work, ‘Politics and Social Conflict in South India, the Non-Brahman Movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916-1929’, points out that the House included 65 non-Brahmin Hindus and 22 Brahmins, apart from five members of the Scheduled Castes who were official appointees. The first Ministry of the Justice Party, a precursor to the present DMK, saw to it that two government orders (G.O.s), famously called ‘Communal G.O.s’, were issued in September 1921 and August 1922. For the first time, caste became the basis for appointment to public services. It took over 70 years for the Central government to follow the principle in its institutions for education and employment. In December 1993, the scheme of 69% reservation for Backward Classes, Most Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes, in vogue in the State only through executive orders till then, got the legal safeguard when the Assembly adopted a Bill. The law was subsequently included in the IX Schedule of the Constitution, through an amendment passed in Parliament, so that its validity could not be challenged. The then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa took the lead in providing legislative support to the scheme of reservation. Talking of the most significant fallout of the 1920 election, M.E. Duraipandiyan, former Additional Secretary of the Assembly Secretariat, points out that as women were not part of the electorate, the Council, in its first session in April 1921, resolved to provide the voting rights to women. Subsequently, it decided to remove the restriction on women getting elected as members. In early 1927, Muthulakshmi Reddy, the well-known medical practitioner and social activist, became the first woman member of the Council and, in no time, became the Deputy President of the Council. There were several moments of pride associated with the Assembly. One of the Congress stalwarts, S. Satyamurti, by rendering the banned songs of Subramania Bharati in the Legislative Council in October 1927, highlighted the issue and got the ban lifted subsequently. The 88-year-old Kumari Ananthan, former TNCC president, who was elected to the Assembly on four occasions and the Lok Sabha once, recalls that when Kamaraj was at the helm of affairs, C. Subramaniam, as Finance Minister, was the first to make a budget speech in Tamil in1957-58. He points out that Si. Pa. Aditanar, as Speaker during March 1967-August 1968, introduced the practice of commencing the House’s proceedings with the recital of a verse from Thirukkural. When Omandur P. Ramaswami Reddiar was the Chief Minister in the late 1940s, the government gave a convincing reply in the Assembly during a debate on the State government’s emblem of temple gopuram and got the issue resolved. During the two-year rule of the DMK founder C.N. Annadurai, the Assembly, in July 1967, adopted a motion renaming Madras State as Tamil Nadu, which later got the approval of Parliament too, Mr. Ananthan explains. Another former official of the Assembly Secretariat points out that during Jayalalithaa’s first innings as Chief Minister, “Tamil Thai Vazhthu” was rendered in July 1991 for the first time at the beginning of Governor’s address. K. Balabharathi, a three-term legislator of the CPI (M), says that to the credit of the legislature, it has passed several landmark laws for the welfare of women, such as Devadasi abolition, equal rights to women in property and constitution of State Commission for Women. Many stalwarts Over the years, both Houses of legislature [now only one] have had many stalwarts. While A. Ramaswami Mudaliar, A. Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar, Satyamurti, T.A. Ramalingam Chettiar, C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer, T.S.S. Rajan, P.T. Rajan, R.K. Shanmugam Chetty, C. Subramaniam and R. Venkataraman were the leading figures till the 1960s, the subsequent period witnessed the debating skills of P.G. Karuthiruman, Saw. Ganesan, K.Vinayakam, V.R.Nedunchezhian, Panruti S. Ramachandran, K. Suppu, Duraimurugan, Mr. Ananthan, N. Sankariah, and R. Umanath. Mr. Duraipandiyan says that while Mr. Panruti Ramachandran and K. Kalimuthu, as Ministers in the AIADMK regime, were sharp and brief in their replies, Mr. Duraimurugan, while representing the treasury benches, could gauge the mind of the Opposition well ahead of the latter completing their observations. In the late 1970s, Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, perhaps, made the longest reply to the discussion on Governor’s address. Mr. Panruti Ramachandran, a seven-term MLA (elected on tickets of four parties), recalls the entire line-up of members of the Opposition in the late 1960s and early 1970s was outstanding. This included Swatantara Party’s D.S. Authimoolam and H.V. Hande (who later switched to the AIADMK and the BJP), Forward Bloc’s P.K. Mookiah Thevar and the Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s A. Balasubramaniyam. The 93-year-old Hande, former Health Minister, who served both the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly during 1964-86, admires the way in which Karunanidhi and his long-standing colleague, K. Anbazhagan, enlivened the discussions in the legislature. Of late, the Assembly is taking steps to use technology in a big way and the State has joined the National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA), a programme meant for digitisation of the working of legislature all over the country. “We are moving towards paperless legislature and to begin with, e-budget will be presented this year,” says M. Appavu, Speaker. The Assembly website now contains the transcript of debates held during 2011-20. Black spots In the long history of the State legislature, there were many moments of black spots too. Scenes of pandemonium were witnessed in December 1972 when the then Assembly Speaker K. A. Mathialagan was removed from office and in January 1988, when 33 MLAs of Jayalalithaa’s faction in the ruling AIADMK were disqualified on the day the Ministry headed by Janaki Ramachandran sought a vote of confidence. In March 1989, when Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi rose to present the State budget and Jayalalithaawanted a privilege motion to be brought in against the Chief Minister, there was a commotion leading to the ruling and Opposition parties using their lung and muscle power. In November 2003, amid protest from the entire Opposition, the then Assembly Speaker Kalimuthu awarded, on the adoption of a motion by the House, a 15-day simple imprisonment to The Hindu ’s then Editor N. Ravi, Executive Editor Malini Parthasarathy and three others, besides S. Selvam, Editor of Murasoli , all for breach of privilege. Another infamous instance of the Assembly acting against a senior journalist was the one concerning S. Balasubramanian, editor of Ananda Vikatan in April 1987. While the Supreme Court had later stayed the operation of the sentence against the senior journalists of The Hindu , Balasubramanian, after being kept at the Central Prison for two days, was released in deference to the wishes of the then Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran. In February 2017, the Assembly experienced commotion when the regime, led by Edappadi K. Palaniswami, won a vote of confidence. Legislature vs Judiciary On the matter of legislature versus judiciary, former Assembly Speaker Sedapatti R. Muthiah, whose tenure of 1991-96 too saw a few breach of privilege proceedings against the Press, including the Illustrated Weekly of India , feels that there is still no clear separation of powers of the legislature and the judiciary. However, he concedes that with regard to disqualification of legislators, there exists the scope for judicial intervention. For several years, there have been voices of concern over the declining quality of debates in the legislature. Mr. Panruti Ramachandran says the problem lies in the selection of candidates. Mr. Duraimurugan, now Water Resources Minister, and who is a long serving member of the Assembly, does not agree with the criticism and says that as in the past, there are legislators who come to the House thoroughly prepared. Stressing on the importance of regular discussions in the legislature, Dr. Hande recalls how an adjournment motion on the language issue, at the heat of the anti-Hindi agitation in January 1965, was taken up for a debate in the Legislative Council, after the chairman M.A. Manickavelu was deftly persuaded by A. Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar, Leader of the Opposition, though the Assembly refused to have any discussion on the subject. Former Deputy Speaker V.P. Duraisamy, now in the BJP, says the Opposition should be given more time to make their points. Former CPI floor leader, G. Palanichamy, quotes C.N. Annadurai, whohad said the ruling party should keep its ears open and the Opposition should keep its mouth open. Former Speaker R. Avudaiappan is hopeful that the situation will improve under the present DMK regime. And this is not just the wish of Mr. Avudaiappan alone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-legislature-turns-100/article35660977.ece

The government, while announcing the extension of the COVID-19 lockdown, asked the Collectors, Police Commissioners, Superintendents of Police and Corporation Commissioners to take effective steps to prevent crowding in public places. There are over 50 roadside shops selling vegetables, fruits, flowers and other items on the road that leads to the Uzhavar Sandhai. As people crowd these shops, the civic body issued directions to the shopkeepers not to open the shops from Saturday. Officials also warned of action against violators and asked people to purchase from the Sandhai. Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan who inspected TVS Road, Gani Market and market areas told The Hindu that following the government order, all the shops on the road outside the Uzhavar Sandhai were not allowed to function. He said spot fines were imposed on those who were not wearing mask properly. Commercial establishments and businesses in areas where people gathered in large numbers were asked to comply with COVID-19 norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-tells-vendors-outside-uzhavar-sandhai-to-close-shops/article35661132.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Seroprevalence stands at 66.2%||T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said the results of the serosurvey might look promising but challenges remained. “The risk is that there is still a susceptible population. If Chennai has a seroprevalence of 82% and cases still happen, it means that the virus can still spread if people do not follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The virus is known for variants, and this is a risk. People will be exposed to variants, and this is why we need to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour till we reach zero cases,” he said. He added that serosurveys would be conducted at regular intervals in the State. According to the DPH report, the overall seropositivity of 66.2% could be attributed to the timing of the serosurvey and vaccination coverage. T he phase III serosurvey was conducted during the declining phase of COVID-19 second wave in the State. Intense vaccination drives conducted from January 16 and inclusion of 18+ age individuals for vaccination would have generated protective antibodies in the population. As of June 10, 97.6 lakh people got vaccinated — either single or double dose — in the State, it said. Western districts such as Erode, Coimbatore and Tiruppur reported around 45% seropositivity, which could be attributed to the consistent reporting of new COVID-19 cases in these regions, the report added. Seroprevalence was more than 50% in 33 districts unlike in the previous two surveys, in which seropositivity remained under 50%. After Virudhunagar, Chennai had the highest seropositivity at 82% as against 49% in the previous round. As many as 11 districts had seropositivity in the range of 70% to 79%. These included Madurai (79%), Tenkasi (78%), Theni (77%), Tirunelveli (76%) and Ramanathapuram (75%). In the last two serosurveys, Erode’s seropositivity stood at 17%. After Erode, Coimbatore had the least seroprevalence at 43%. In the second phase, Coimbatore had a seroprevalence of 20%. Tiruppur’s seropositivity stood at 46% as against 23% in the previous survey. Nagapattinam and Namakkal had 47% and 48% seropositivity respectively. While Nagapattinam recorded a seropositivity of 9% in survey-II, Namakkal had 26% seropositivity. Meanwhile, another serosurvey conducted earlier this month jointly by the Greater Chennai Corporation and the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) and the National Institute of Epidemiology had shown similar results as that of DPH. Unlike DPH’s study, this study conducted in Chennai included not just the 18-plus population, but people aged six and above. The study, which involved 7,026 samples collected from 51 wards, showed an overall seroprevalence of 78.2%. The seroprevalence was 72.2% in the six to 11 age group, 76% in the 12-17 age group, and 82.5% in the 18 and above age group. Among the 15 Chennai zones, Tondiarpet had the highest seroprevalence of 83.3% and Madhavaram the lowest at 72.5%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/seroprevalence-stands-at-662/article35660985.ece

01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ejipura-Koramangala flyover: BBMP opens escrow account||It appears that work on the elevated corridor at Koramangala’s Sony World Junction, connecting Ejipura and Kendriya Sadan, will be taken up again. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has directed the contractor Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. to complete the work as soon as possible. Senior officials told The Hindu that the civic body had earlier contemplated terminating the tender awarded to Simplex and float a fresh tender. However, following several rounds of deliberations with representatives of the company, the civic body decided to allow Simplex to complete the work. Simplex had also bagged the tender for construction of the elevated section of Namma Metro’s Pink Line on Bannerghatta Road. However, with the contractor not able to execute the project as per the tender conditions, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) had terminated the contract. An official said that to ensure that funds released for the Rs. 203-crore elevated corridor project are not diverted by the company towards servicing other financial liabilities, the civic body had opened an escrow account. To ensure that the work is completed soon, minor changes had been made in the design that would allow assembly of pre-cast elements at the work site. Work on the 2.5-km-long elevated corridor had stalled for more than six months. Around 45% of the work had been completed. The delay, officials admitted, is also partly because of a delay by the BBMP in clearing bills. So far, the BBMP has paid Rs. 72 crore to the contractor, an official said. The work order had been issued in May 2017 and the project was to be completed by November 2019. Of 81 pillars for the elevated corridor, only 67 have been constructed. The High Court of Karnataka has taken note of the inordinate delay in completing the work. On July 29, the court directed the BBMP to state a timeline for completion of work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ejipura-koramangala-flyover-bbmp-opens-escrow-account/article35660925.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||KMF to launch milk products in Vidarbha region from today||Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) will sell 10,000 litres of fresh milk every day in six districts of Vidarbha from Sunday. The target is to increase this figure to over 30,000 litres covering the entire region bythe end of 2021. Situated in eastern Maharashtra, the Vidarbha region has 11 districts — Amravati, Akola, Bhandara, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Gondia, Nagpur, Wardha, Washim, and Yavatmal. M.T. Kulkarni, director (marketing) at KMF, said, “The foray into Vidarbha is part of our sales expansion strategy outside of Karnataka. We will launch in six districts to start with, and the idea is to cover the entire region by the end of 2021.” KMF will start with milk, curds, ghee, and long-life products such as milk powder, paaysam mix, badam milk, flavoured milk, milk powder, and cookies, before gradually introducing cold-chain products such as ice cream, butter, cheese, and paneer, said Mr. Kulkarni. Milk would be transported in special tankers from the KMF dairy in Vijayapura to Chandrapur in Vidarbha, where the federation has set up a packing unit. Two more such units would be added later to cover the entire region for milk distribution. Nagpur is to be KMF’s main distribution hub for the region. KMF collects over 90 lakh litres of milk every day from farmers in Karnataka, as against its total sale of around 60 lakh litres. The federation used to sell two lakh litres of fresh milk to Mumbai every day, but the figure has reduced to 1.25 lakh litres now. It sells 90,000 litres of milk and curds to Hyderabad, 25,000 litres to Goa (it was 40,000 litres prior to COVID-19), 10,000 litres to Pune (30,000 litres earlier), and 15,000 litres to Solapur every day. It also sells seven lakh litres of bulk milk to Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Kerala. In addition, 10 lakh litres of its long-life milk GoodLife is sold across the country each day. “Sales volumes have come down because of COVID-19 and floods. But demand is picking up. We still have a surplus of fresh milk. Once we establish things in Vidarbha, we will explore more avenues in other States as well,” Mr. Kulkarni said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kmf-to-launch-milk-products-in-vidarbha-region-from-today/article35660959.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Yediyurappa’s ‘non-interference’ promise not showing in action||Though the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has over the last three days repeatedly claimed that he will not interfere in the Cabinet formation, ministerial aspirants are continuing to meet him seeking a berth in the new Ministry. On Saturday too, M.P. Renukacharya, Ramesh Jarkiholi, Munirathna, and Shivanagouda Naik met him lobbying for a ministerial berth. These are only the latest among a slew of legislators who have met him over the last four days. ‘CM’s prerogative’ “I have told legislators meeting me to instead meet Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, whose prerogative is Cabinet formation. I have no role in it,” Mr. Yediyurappa told reporters recently. However, less than a minute after he made this statement, when reporters asked him about the future of defectors who have said they joined the party under his leadership, he said, “I will advice Mr. Bommai to accommodate them suitably as they are responsible for the BJP to come to power.” A day later after the now customary statement on “non-interference”, answering a question as to whether senior legislator Umesh Katti would be a Minister in the new Cabinet, Mr. Yediyurappa emphatically said, “100%”. Mr. Yediyurappa is also learnt to have been lobbying hard to get his associates anointed as Deputy Chief Ministers in the new Cabinet. Mr. Bommai, on his return from New Delhi on Saturday, told mediapersons that he would go to the national capital again, maybe in two days, to discuss Cabinet expansion. First test The new Chief Minister’s challenge is the Cabinet formation, where his skill to take along and balance the interests of multiple factions in the party will be put to test, said a senior party strategist, adding Cabinet formation would set the tone of the government ahead and was being keenly watched. “The party is especially watching whether he will be able to stave off pressure from Mr. Yediyurappa and emerge his own man,” a former senior Minister said. Meanwhile, Mr. Bommai is in a “Catch-22” situation, party leaders observed. While he is under pressure to not remain a status quoist and instead chart a new course for the party’s government, any attempt to do so may seem like critiquing the former dispensation, risking irritating the veteran leader, said a senior party strategist. “His assertion that his family won’t intervene in administration, that he would give a corruption-free administration, his warning to bureaucracy that he won’t tolerate ‘chalta hai’ attitude and a file clearance drive — all these have the potential to be misread in a faction-ridden party, when leaders are surrounded by a coterie,” the strategist said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yediyurappas-non-interference-promise-not-showing-in-action/article35660945.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Schools reduce size of virtual classes to drive lessons home||After experimenting with online classes for more than a year, private school managements are introducing changes in formats and teaching methods to improve learning outcomes. One of the measures that many schools have embraced this academic year is smaller virtual classrooms with fewer students. This measure was adopted after teachers and principals received feedback from parents who said that their children were unable to grasp lessons in the 2020-21 academic year during online classes. Schools that were only sending pre-recorded lessons for lower classes last year are also now holding online classes for an hour or two and conducting interactive sessions with students in small batches. The mother of a Class III student, who studies in a CBSE school in South Bengaluru, said that last year, there were as many as 40 students in her son’s virtual class. “But this academic year, students have been divided into two batches of 20 for online classes. Teachers are now able to monitor all the children and bring about some discipline. They also have the time to interact and provide individual attention to students,” she said. Dakshayini Kanna, principal of Harvest International School, said that having smaller virtual classrooms has made learning more effective. The maximum number of students in an online class at her school is 15. “Teachers are anyway not allowed to conduct more than three hours of online classes a day. So they will split students in each section and conduct the same online class twice a day. We have found that smaller classrooms increase student engagement,” she said. Lokesh Talikatte, State unit president of the Recognised Unaided Private Schools Association, Karnataka, said many schools had reduced the size of online classes from 60 to less than 20 students per class. To ensure that teachers are not overburdened, some schools have started hiring additional staff. “School managements are financially better off this academic year and are able to hire more teachers as a result. Last year, I had 24 teachers who had to juggle and conduct online classes for six schools run by me. This year, I have managed to recruit more teachers. I have 82 teachers for six schools,” he said. Parents, too, feel their children are more engaged in a smaller class. Suma S., whose daughter studies in Class VI in a private school, said, “The teacher makes sure that at least six out of the 15 students in my daughter’s class engage in a conversation. Or, the students are asked to make a presentation on the topics covered. Students have also been instructed this year to keep their video on throughout the class. This ensures that they are not distracted and are paying attention.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-reduce-size-of-virtual-classes-to-drive-lessons-home/article35660963.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Buffalo meat to be back on menu at BBP||The menu for carnivores at the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) is soon set to reintroduce beef (buffalo meat). The pandemic, followed by the new ordinance on cattle slaughter had kept buffalo meat off the menu. But the park authorities are now finalising tenders for supply of the meat and hope to start feeding the carnivores beef in a week’s time. Vanashree Vipin Singh, executive director, BBP, told The Hindu that carnivores were given beef since inception in all zoos to mimic natural feeding habits because in nature, they feed on gaur, sambal and the like. “But due to COVID-19, there was a break in supply of beef and live animals. We resumed feeding beef in November, December, and January. It was re-tendered because the prices were higher. After the ordinance, other issues cropped up. So, we went back to feeding them chicken,” she explained. This January, the State government promulgated the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, 2020 to ban slaughter of cows, bulls, and bullocks of all ages, and male or female buffaloes aged below 13. The new law makes provisions for stricter implementation of rules regarding transportation of cattle, seizure of vehicles, imposition of penalty, and operation of slaughterhouses. According to BBP authorities, the park needs 500-600 kg of meat a day. “We re-called tenders for meat of buffaloes above 13 years. The tender is getting finalised. Meat will be available in a week’s time,” Ms. Singh added. Though the authorities did not notice any marked difference after chicken became the staple, they want to ensure animals’ nutritional needs are not compromised. “We plan to give them a mix: beef for four days and chicken for two,” she explained. Steady stream of visitors Zoos in the State were hit severely due to the pandemic, lockdowns, and revenues drying up, but saw donations in the form of animal adoptions etc. Now, the park has started seeing a steady stream of visitors. “The response to reopening has been wonderful. We have had very well-behaved visitors. The maximum number of visitors recently was 7,000 last Sunday,” Ms. Singh added. Before COVID-19, the park saw around 17,000 visitors during holiday seasons such as Deepavali, New Year, Christmas, and Dasara, with the numbers even going up to 23,000 one time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/buffalo-meat-to-be-back-on-menu-at-bbp/article35660921.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 tests to soon touch four crore mark in State||Karnataka will soon create another milestone in its pandemic control measures with COVID-19 tests all set to breach the 4 crore mark. The State has been consistently conducting an average of 1.4 lakh tests daily. With 1,38,532 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, the total number of tests stood at 3,86,49,498 on Saturday. Karnataka is the third State in the country, after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, that has tested 6.5 crore and 4.8 crore samples, respectively, to have tested the maximum number. The State had tested a total of over one crore samples from March last year, when the pandemic hit Karnataka, till November 21, 2020. Subsequently, another one crore samples were tested in four months and on March 17, 2021, the total number of tests breached the two crore mark. By June 3, the total tests crossed three crore. Nearly 83% of the total 3,86,49,498 tests conducted till date have been done using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. RT-PCR is the gold standard test that has negligible chances of false negativity. First in south In South India, Karnataka ranks first followed by Tamil Nadu and Kerala. While Tamil Nadu has carried out 3.7 crore tests, Kerala has done 2.7 crore tests. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have carried out 2.4 crore and 2.2 crore tests respectively. From an average 80 tests a day in March last year, the State, till January, 2021, tested an average of over one lakh samples a day. Although the daily tests reduced subsequently, they have again been increased in the last one month. Now, since the beginning of July the daily number of tests have remained high, which is a good measure, said experts. The State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had recommended that the State should continue aggressive testing irrespective of the decrease in number of new cases. TAC chairman M.K. Sudarshan told The Hindu on Saturday that although the testing numbers are satisfactory, there should be “focussed, aggressive and syndromic testing and tracking”, especially in the border districts of Kerala and Maharashtra. “In order to effectively contain the virus transmission, testing provides adequate insights into how the virus spreads,” he said. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka and member of State’s COVID-19 TAC, who was entrusted by the ICMR with the task of expansion of COVID-19 labs in April 2020, said it is important for the State to sustain the same level of testing at least till December. “Testing is one of the important tools to not just prevent the spread of infection but also ensure early intervention in sick patients. We should track and trace at least 20 contacts for every positive case,” he asserted. ‘Silent’ spread Epidemiologist and public health specialist Sunil Kumar D.R., who heads the department of community medicine at Akash Institute of Medical Sciences, said without aggressive syndromic testing, the disease will spread “silently”. By the time severe cases begin to land in hospitals, it will hard to control the transmission, he said. “It is also important to get the test results quickly. The potential spread of the infection is high if results are delayed as people are not likely to isolate themselves till the reports come,” added Dr. Sunil, who is part of BBMP’s death audit committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-tests-to-soon-touch-four-crore-mark-in-state/article35660934.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Public Works Department is facing problem of too many engineers||An excess of nearly 40% engineers over the sanctioned strength in the Public Works Department, coupled with confusion over trifurcation of the department, are causing problems of plenty, including of a large pool of skilled technicians languishing without posts or promotions. While six chief engineers have not been given postings, at least eight posts of chief engineer have either been given to people on contract or to superintending engineers who hold charge of the post of chief engineer. 500 excess posts About 500 posts of assistant executive engineer, executive engineer, and superintending engineer cadre are in excess of the sanctioned strength, thus denying engineers in the lower cadres avenues for promotion. In contrast with the PWD, the Rural Water Supply Scheme in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department is short of engineers. The cadre position in the Water Resources Department is yet to be known, a senior PWD official said. “The confusion in allocating human resources due to the split of departments has led to more than 150 engineers in different cadres ending up without posts. Re-deployment of engineers after promotion has not happened,” sources said. Meanwhile, developments in the PWD over the last four years has affected general category engineers as well as those belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are at loggerheads over consequential seniority. The confusion caused by two Supreme Court orders in recent years — one quashing consequential seniority and another upholding it — has had an impact on the management of the engineering pool, sources said. A majority of assistant engineers belonging to the SC/ST category, recruited in 2003–04 to fill backlog posts, are yet to get their first promotion as the promotions so far made are in excess of the sanctioned posts, said D. Chandrashekaraiah, president of State Government ST/ST Employees’ Association. While several engineers have not chosen one of the three departments even as the trifurcation process is under way, the PWD has posted engineers to the Irrigation Department, which in turn has been returning the services of engineers who have not opted for it. “More than 200 engineers in all cadres are yet to get postings due to this problem,” sources said. On March 22, a meeting convened by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms and chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary to settle the matter remained inconclusive and a follow-up is yet to happen. “Senior officials heading the respective departments have not taken interest in settling the matter,” rued a senior PWD official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/public-works-department-is-facing-problem-of-too-many-engineers/article35660943.ece

01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Paperless session: Speaker blames bureaucracy for delay||Legislative Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri has expressed regret that he could not implement e-Vidhan system in the Secretariat due to “non-cooperative mindset” of the bureaucracy. He blamed both the government and the bureaucratic system for the delay in having a “digital legislature” by implementation of ‘e-Vidhan’ project. e-Vidhan aims at making the State legislature sessions paperless, which would save a lot of public money. The process of rolling out e-Vidhan started in 2014 when a team of officials from Karnataka visited Himachal Pradesh to study the process. Mr. Kageri, who completed two years in office, was speaking to reporters after releasing a book highlighting achievements of the Assembly and its Secretariat. “I tried my level best to see that the e-Vidhan system is implemented in the Assembly Secretariat. But I could not due to the non-cooperative mindset of the bureaucracy. This has been pending from 2014. Bengaluru is called the ‘IT capital of India’ but in this IT capital, the Assembly does not have an e-Vidhan system. I wish and hope that the bureaucracy undergoes transformation in the mindset,” the Speaker said. Award planned The Speaker announced that there was a proposal to give the ‘Best Legislator’ award for which a committee of officers had been set up and guidelines were being framed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/paperless-session-speaker-blames-bureaucracy-for-delay/article35660953.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Need to strengthen ward DETER committees ahead of third wave’||Amidst fears that the third wave of COVID-19 may be imminent, a panel of citizen volunteers and ward nodal officers have suggested decentralisation to fight the virus effectively. Strengthening ward Decentralised Triage and Emergency Response (DETER) committees, is the way ahead, they argued. They were speaking at an online event ‘Lessons from Ward DETER Committees’, organised by the Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy as part of its city politics series on Saturday. “The biggest success we witnessed in the ward DETER committee of Gottigere was team organisation. Be it volunteers, resources or technology, mobilisation was easy due to the decentralised model. We had 80 volunteers who were divided into eight teams. They helped in tele-triaging and counselling COVID-19 patients. We had real-time tracking in the ward war room,” said V.K. Ramamani, nodal officer, ward 194-Gottigere and Deputy Commissioner (IT), BBMP. The Information and Communication team used pictures, videos and other creative messaging techniques to share guidelines, protocols, and advisories. In Ganganagar, the WDC not only focused on patients, but also those facing mental health issues due to the challenges brought forth by the pandemic, said Girisha Shankar, WDC member, ward 20, Ganganagar. In Mahadevapura, while nearly 7,000 citizens came forward to volunteer over the last 18 months, the entire initiative was structured through the WDC, said Jagadish Reddy, from Varthur ward. “We need 198 ward committees fully functional. That is the only way the next wave or any other civic issue or disaster can be efficiently addressed. It doesn’t stop with just setting it up, but empowering it with technology, capacities, and full administrative support to truly make it a decentralised platform for local governance and citizen engagement,” said Sapna Karim, Head, Civic Participation at Janaagraha.  ‘The biggest success we witnessed in the ward DETER committee of Gottigere was team organisation’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/need-to-strengthen-ward-deter-committees-ahead-of-third-wave/article35660940.ece

01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police donate blood for children with cancer||The Deputy Commissioner of Police office in Upparpet was abuzz on Saturday after a part of the premises was converted into a blood donation camp. A group of 75 police officers across all ranks donated blood to children suffering from cancer at the Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology Cancer Research and Training Centre. The camp was organised by Sustainable Environment Development Trust, a Bengaluru NGO, and Lions Blood bank. Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Sanjeev Patil, who started the initiative, said he got the idea while interacting with doctors of many hospitals during the lockdown. Many medical personnel had raised the issue of a dearth of blood donors. “Given the huge gap between demand and supply, many officers decided to donate blood,” said Mr. Patil. The police officers formed a group and took part in blood donation camps. On Saturday, they conducted the camp to donate blood for children. “The initiative not only gives us satisfaction but encourages others to be part of a life-saving exercise,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-donate-blood-for-children-with-cancer/article35660924.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pvt. detective who tied up with habitual offenders to steal bikes arrested||The Madanayakanahalli police on Saturday unearthed a racket where a private investigator allegedly ganged up with four habitual offenders to steal 46 bikes from in and around the city. After forming this unusual partnership, the gang members, all in their 20s, operated under the radar of the police for two years. However, their luck ran out when they were identified by a special police team that had been formed to probe a series of bike thefts. The police analysed footage from over 50 CCTVs in and around Madanayakanahalli before zeroing in on the gang. The accused have been identified as Ravi Kumar, 21, Muniraju, 20, Jagadish, 21, Mohan Kumar, 22, and private investigator Shivashankar, 25. Police Inspector B.S. Manjunath, who led the team, said the prime accused Ravi Kumar and Jagadish are habitual offenders. They were involved in a robbery in 2020, but came out of prison on bail, and took up jobs at a vegetable shop on the outskirts of the city, he said. Shivashankar works at a private detective agency on Dickenson Road. He first met Ravi Kumar through a common friend and later approached him with a business proposition. “He asked Ravi Kumar to steal bikes without number plates, reportedly for his detective work (shadowing). Shivashankar also sent photos of bikes parked in front of houses or offices and their locations to Ravi Kumar,” said a police officer. Ravi Kumar ganged up with the others to steal the bikes. Shivakumar, after using the bikes for his work, would return them to the gang, who in turn sold them to customers at throwaway prices. Using the modus operandi, the accused stole 10 bikes from owners living on the outskirts of the city, and five bikes in Ramanagaram district and other places. Cash reward The police analysed over 100 call record details before identifying the accused, who have been arrested. IGP (Central range) M. Chandrashekhar announced a cash reward of Rs. 50,000 to the investigating team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pvt-detective-who-tied-up-with-habitual-offenders-to-steal-bikes-arrested/article35660927.ece

In one video clip, Mr. Kumathalli, who quit the Congress to get re-elected on the BJP ticket, is seen asking a person in a flood-affected area in Athani taluk to also give him a “quarter”. In the other one shot at a guest house, Mr. Kumathalli is seen expressing his “tough situation”. He is seen telling his followers that there were too many issues and he felt like throwing his cell phone away and going to sleep, fed up of calls from flood-affected people. Embarrassment The video clips shot during his visit to flood-affected areas and one while speaking to his followers some time ago put the ministerial aspirant in an embarrassing situation as the viral videos evoked strong reactions. Following widespread criticism, Mr. Kumathalli issued a statement apologising for his remarks and said he should not have spoken like that. He also said at that point of time he had just recovered from COVID-19 and had only spoken about how he felt at that point in time and did not want to hurt anyone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kumathallis-remarks-on-flood-hit-people-draw-ire-he-apologises/article35660946.ece
01 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Organisations demand ministerial berths for Munenakoppa, Olekar||As several legislators are camping in New Delhi lobbying for ministerial berths, various organisations have begun seeking representation for their leaders. On Saturday in Hubballi, the Girani Chawl Residents’ Welfare Committee and Dalita Okkoota sought ministerial berth for Navalgund MLA Shankar Patil Munenakoppa, in the wake of former Minister Jagadish Shettar voluntarily opting out. Addressing presspersons on behalf of the association and Okkoota, Parashuram Pujar, Hanumanthappa Malapalli, Gurunath Ganjagol, Mohammed Ghouse Paradewale, and Manjunath Ballari said that Mr. Munenakoppa had always strived for the welfare of the Dalits and Backward Classes and had maintained good rapport with all communities. In Belagavi on Friday, office-bearers of the Chalavadi Mahasabha held a press conference demanding that Nehru Olekar, Haveri MLA, should be made a Minister. They also said that that if he was not made a Minister, the community would take out an agitation. President of Belagavi district unit of Mahasabha, Durgesh Metri and other office-bearers said that among the Dalits in the State, around 40 lakh belonged to the Chalavai community. Despite being the lone representative of the community from north Karnataka, Mr. Olekar had not been given proper position by the BJP and at least now he should be made a Minister, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/organisations-demand-ministerial-berths-for-munenakoppa-olekar/article35661147.ece

01 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Show commitment to NK development: AAP||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Karnataka has challenged Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to shift his office to Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belagavi and function from there for at least six months in a year if he is really committed to the cause of developing north Karnataka. AAP national team member and Karnataka observer Romi Bhati, State co-convener Shanthala Damle, Dharwad district unit president Santosh Naragund addressed mediapersons in Hubballi on July 31. Ms. Damle said that there were a lot of expectations from the new Chief Minister from people of north Karnataka as he hails from the region. However, even after taking charge and visiting Delhi, Mr. Bommai had not spoken a word about the long-pending Mahadayi project, for the implementation of which he had once organised a padayatra. AAP would challenge the Chief Minister to implement the Mahadayi project as years had passed after securing in-principle approval. “People have waited for long. Being a Chief Minister from the region, Mr. Bommai should take steps within the next 10 days to initiate the work,” she said. She pointed out to the lack of industrial and infrastructure development in north Karnataka. She cited the case of Infosys, which had set up a campus in Hubballi three years ago, but is yet to start operations. Mr. Romi Bhati said that in the last three years, people of Karnataka had seen three chief ministers. “However, I would like to congratulate people of north Karnataka as a leader from their region has become the Chief Minister now. Hopefully, he will initiate development in the region,” he said. Mr. Santosh Naragund said that another leader from Hubballi, Jagadish Shettar, had served as chief minister, but he did not do much for north Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/show-commitment-to-nk-development-aap/article35661153.ece

01 August 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Activist Tapal Ganesh takes exception to Centre’s reply in RS on boundary survey||Ballari-based miner and activist Tapal Ganesh, who had been fighting against what he called “illegal mining” in Ballari district, took serious exception to the Union government’s reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on the inter-State boundary survey undertaken in Ballari Reserve Forest. In his answer to a question raised by Rajya Sabha member K.C. Ramamurthy on Wednesday, Nityanand Rai, Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs, said that the demarcation of the boundary between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh “was carried out jointly by Survey of India and the representatives of both the State Governments” and “all the field records pertaining to joint interstate boundary demarcation work have been duly signed/accepted by both the State Governments”. Taking objections to the Union government response, Mr. Ganesh, at a media conference in Ballari on Saturday, said that the Karnataka government had forwarded his objections on the border survey to the Survey of India and asked the latter to review its conclusions. “I had raised serious objections to the methodology that the Survey of India followed in the survey for demarcating Karnataka-Andhra border in Ballari Reserve Forest. I had written to the Chief Secretary of Karnataka and other authorities in the State and Union governments. The Chief Secretary referred the matter to the Commissioner of Survey Settlement and Land Records who in turn forwarded the matter to Ballari Deputy Commissioner. The Technical Advisor to Deputy Commissioner wrote a letter to Survey of India pointing out the discrepancies and objections that I had raised and sought a review. Before the Survey of India responded to the objections, the Union government declared in Rajya Sabha that the matter was settled,” Mr. Ganesh said. Mr. Ganesh alleged that the Survey of India was manipulating the records to protect the miners who had obtained mining licences from Andhra Pradesh and illegally undertook mining in Karnataka by altering the inter-State boundary line and encroaching a large iron ore-rich area in Ballari district. “Instead of taking the 1896 map, which has clear markings for village boundaries, the Survey of India has taken the 1890 map, which has no measurements, for the survey and demarcation of the inter-State boundary between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in Ballari Reserved Forest. The existing contours, ridges, streams, and rock marks shown in the 1896 map are not taken into account for fixing the boundary. If the new boundary demarcated by the Survey of India is accepted, Karnataka would then have to give up a large area of its rightful territory having rich iron ore to Andhra Pradesh. This would also make the illegal mining legal and allow the culprits, who had encroached Karnataka’s land and carried out illegal mining on Andhra Pradesh license, to go scot-free,” Mr. Ganesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/activist-tapal-ganesh-takes-exception-to-centres-reply-in-rs-on-boundary-survey/article35661142.ece
01 August 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||DYFI, CPI (M) slam hike in bus fares without public consultation||The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxists) staged a protest here on Saturday against the Dakshina Kannada Regional Transport Authority (RTA) hiking the travel fares of private buses unilaterally without holding public consultation. Speaking on the occasion near the Clock Tower, Sunil Kumar Bajal, secretary, Mangaluru City South unit of the CPI(M), said that bowing to pressure by private bus owners the RTA has hiked the fares up to 50 %. This is against the public interest and no public consultation was done before allowing the private operators to hike the fares. “It is the unilateral move by the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada who also heads the RTA,” Mr. Bajal said, adding that with this the RTA and the Deputy Commissioner have violated the guidelines issued by the State government for hiking the travel fares of private buses. He said that the COVID-19 lockdown has hit not only the private bus operators but common persons in general. Daily wagers, small shop keepers, students, and those who earn low wages used buses for travel. The hike in fares has dealt all of them a double blow. Mr. Bajal said that when the private bus operators earlier had hiked the fares by 20%, the DYFI had submitted a memorandum to the district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary to call the meeting of the RTA, listen to the people, and later take a decision on hiking the fares. The district administration had then agreed for the same. But now without conducting any public hearing the administration has allowed to hike the fares. It showed that the district administration favours private bus operators, he said. The RTA and the district administration now should withhold its order allowing hike in fares, Mr. Bajal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dyfi-cpi-m-slam-hike-in-bus-fares-without-public-consultation/article35661326.ece

01 August 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Pilferage of petroleum products detected||The Bantwal Rural Police booked one person on the charge of pilfering petroleum products being pumped through the Mangaluru-Bengaluru pipeline of Petronet MHB Ltd. Upon witnessing a loss of pressure during the pumping of petroleum products through the pipeline on July 11, officials of PMHB undertook a survey and finally zeroed in on a location in Sornadu, Arala village of Bantwal taluk. Upon digging the earth at 23.5 km of the pipeline, they found it was tampered with and arrangements were made to siphon off petroleum products. The pipeline was about 20 ft below a road leading to the private land of one Ivan and the complainant suspected him to be behind the pilferage. Gate valves were installed at the end of diversion pipe about half a kilometre away from the main pipeline from where the accused allegedly pilfered the products. The exact value of the pilfered products was yet to be ascertained, PMHB official G. Rajan told the police in his complaint on July 27. The police have registered cases against Ivan under the provisions of Petroleum and Minerals Pipeline Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. As the accused has been large ever since the pilferage was detected, the police are on the lookout for him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pilferage-of-petroleum-products-detected/article35661321.ece

01 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Cong. meet: city marred by banners||The road leading to the venue of the divisional-level conference of the Congress here today was replete with banners and buntings of party leaders, marring the cityscape and violating norms on the use of banners. The conference was held at a private resort on the outskirts of the city, almost 10 km away. Though the ban on the use of flex and banners is not applicable beyond the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) limits, the Congress workers had erected large flexes and had tied banners along the median of the Mysuru-Hunsur Road within the MCC limits and other places in the city also. Incidentally, the MCC had ordered a ban on the use of banners and flexes in January this year following which there was a crackdown on such practices. The ban was issued as the flexes and banners were not only an eyesore but marred the visual appeal and aesthetics of the city. However, it was not for the first time that such a ban has been announced. The MCC periodically cracks down on such practices but it tends to re-emerge with huge billboards of self-appointed leaders “’extending their wishes’’ to the public ahead of festivals. In many cases there are billboards of a local small-time leader-in-the-making with political ambitions being wished on his birthday by his coterie. However, such bans tend to be effectively imposed during elections as in 2019 when the Election Commission had banned the use of huge cut outs or the election expenditure observer keeps a tab on the candidate’s spending. Deadline When contacted, a senior official of the MCC said the ban is definitely in force even now but they issue permission, if sought, for conventions and conferences of national political parties. “But the banners and flex boards can be displayed only for 24 hours after which they will have to be removed’’, said the official. He said the dismantling of the billboards and removal of banners and flexes will commence tonight and will be cleared by Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-meet-city-marred-by-banners/article35661342.ece

Prof. Hemantha Kumar told The Hindu that the committee would be submitting its report to the government by August 5. “I cannot divulge the details of our observations but the committee is positive about the proposal,” he replied. He said the committeesought land for the university for a 25-year vision plan. “The university can be set up on the present PG campus. However, over a period of time, the university has to be expanded to accommodate more facilities such as departments.

01 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah sceptical over CM’s ability to secure dues||Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Saturday expressed scepticism over Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai's ability to secure Karnataka's share of grants due from the Centre. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who had grown in politics in the BJP, was himself unable to secure the State’s dues. In such a situation, it is doubtful whether Mr. Bommai, who had joined the BJP from the Janata Dal, can do it. The Centre had not paid State’s GST dues totalling more than Rs. 11,300 crore, let alone grants for various works including rehabilitation for flood affected victims. Mr .Siddaramaiah also emphasised the need for Mr. Bommai to constitute his Cabinet at the earliest. He contended that one person cannot run the government particularly when the State is facing challenges such as COVID-19 and floods. Till the new Cabinet is constituted, the Chief Minister should give instructions to the officials and ensure proper administration of the State. Mr. Siddaramaiah arrived in Mysuru to participate in the divisional-level meeting of the Congress party. AICC General Secretary in charge of Karnataka Randeep Surjewala and KPCC President D.K. Shivakumar are also participating in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-sceptical-over-cms-ability-to-secure-dues/article35661345.ece

01 August 2021||Special Correspondent,KARNATAKA||2nd dose must to enter Chamarajanagar from Kerala over COVID scare||Authorities in Chamarajanagar have made it mandatory for people entering the district from Kerala to have taken both doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Alternatively, they should produce a RT-PCR negative report without which entry will be barred. This is due to the surge in COVID-19 cases in Kerala and a directive by the State government authorising local authorities to take all additional measures they deem fit to curb the spread of the pandemic. Chamarajanagar district has two checkpoints with Kerala where staff have been apprised about the new regulation. The new regulation will come into effect on August 1, according to the Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi who visited Moolehole checkpost on July 31. In view of high traffic movement between Chamarajanagar and Kerala, drivers operating the vehicles have to compulsorily display the RT-PCR negative report once in 15 days. Otherwise, they will be subjected to Rapid Antigen Test at the border, and will be allowed to proceed only if they test negative. The district has six checkpoints with neighbouring States – two with Kerala and four with Tamil Nadu. The new guidelines will be applicable only at the two checkposts on the Kerala border. “We will keep a tab on the situation in Tamil Nadu and take a decision on additional regulations if need be,” said Mr. Ravi. At a meeting with revenue, health and police officials, he took stock of the preparedness to deal with any surge in COVID-19 cases in Chamarajanagar. Besides the movements of goods vehicles, there is significant interaction of people in the border villages with neighbouring States on a regular basis. Hence, the vaccination drive will be intensified to cover all villages in Chamarajanagar district along the border with Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In view of the increase in footfall of tourists, the district administration has directed the local staff to ensure compliance with Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), including maintaining social distancing, avoiding crowded places and temperature check at tourist spots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/2nd-dose-must-to-enter-chamarajanagar-from-kerala-over-covid-scare/article35661348.ece

The five-member team comprising Sujeet Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC); Jain S.K., Adviser, NCDC, Pranay Verma, Deputy Director, NCDC; Ruchi Jain, a public health specialist; and Binoy S. Babu, Assistant Director, Directorate of Health Services, Kerala, interacted with District Collector A. Alexander and district health officials. The team, which attended a meeting of health officials, stressed the need to strengthen measures to tackle the spread of the disease in areas with a high number of cases within containment zones. The team suggested measures to bring down the test positivity rate in areas where it remained high. The Centre deployed multidisciplinary teams following a spike in COVID-19 cases in the State. Officials said the teams were specifically looking at testing, contact tracing, including surveillance and containment operations, availability of hospital beds, sufficient logistics, including ambulances, hospital-wise case fatality analysis, and progress of COVID-19 vaccination drive, in various districts. After visiting other districts, the team will submit a report to the State government. R.V. Ramlal, superintendent, Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) Alappuzha; Sairu Philip, vice principal, Government Medical College, Alappuzha; Anu Varghese, Deputy Medical Officer, Alappuzha; Asha C. Abraham, Deputy Collector (disaster management); T.K. Suma and others attended the review meeting. Meanwhile, the Alappuzha district administration has come up with a campaign titled ‘war against waves’ to tackle the spread of COVID-19. The seven-day campaign includes disinfecting houses, awareness classes for anganwadi, school and college students, putting in place effective measures in offices, shops, and other establishments for breaking the chain of transmission of COVID-19, awareness meetings, and so on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/central-team-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-alappuzha/article35661276.ece

Recently, the SEIAA authorities had visited the hills as a part of studying the feasibility to grant permission to resume quarrying on the ecologically fragile slopes of the hills, Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi president N. Badusha said. Any move to resume the quarry unit would adversely affect thousands of families living on the hill slopes, Mr. Badusha said. The former District Collector had banned all the quarrying activities on the hills after two persons were killed in a landslip in 2018. As many as five landslips were reported near the old granite quarry unit operated on the hills in 2019, Mr. Badusha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/do-not-permit-quarrying-on-muttil-hills-say-greens/article35661214.ece

01 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||No hydro-testing centre in State to inspect CNG cylinders||The absence of hydro-testing centres in the State to inspect and issue safety certificate every three years to CNG cylinders of automobiles has left the owners of CNG-run vehicles a disappointed lot. CNG-equipped autorickshaws and cars made their foray into Kochi and subsequently to other districts three years ago. However, due to the non availability of hydro-testing centres, where the cylinders can be tested for less than Rs. 2,000, the cylinders are being taken in bulk to other States, tested and brought back. This entails an expense of approximately Rs. 4,000, which many, especially autorickshaw drivers, find unaffordable, it is learnt. The safety inspection in centres approved by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) is mandatory every three years as per Gas Cylinder Rules 2004. “Difficulty in obtaining 1.50 acres of land, the real estate cost for each testing centre, and the additional expense on equipment is keeping investors away,” said Meleth Radhakrishnan, patron, All Kerala Federation of Petroleum Traders. “The State already has over 4,000 CNG-run vehicles, including over a dozen buses, mainly in Ernakulam district,” he said. In addition, the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is readying plans to convert 3,000 buses to CNG, to rein in operational expenses. Moreover, CNG retail outlets were getting ready in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode, said Mr. Radhakrishnan. “The testing frequency of CNG cylinders was brought down from 10 years to five years, and now to three years,” said Mathew Joshua, a dealer selling CNG-run passenger and cargo autorickshaws. “For now, it would be ideal if the testing period is temporarily extended to five years due to the pandemic situation. On its part, the government could ready a testing centre or more in the State so that cylinders do not have to be sent to other States for testing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-hydro-testing-centre-in-state-to-inspect-cng-cylinders/article35661244.ece

The boat owners alleged that the agents had threatened not to buy the catch if the discount offered on auction price was not hiked to 16%. President of the association Peter Mathias and general secretary Joseph Xavier Kalapurackal said agents were demanding that the present "auction discount" of 13% be raised to 16%. The auction discount works against the interest of fishers, said the boat owners. The practice is that if the catch in a boat is auctioned for Rs. 100, the discount that is being now offered to the wholesale agent is Rs. 13. The agents now wants Rs. 16. The rate of discount varies from harbour to harbour. However, V.A. Nazar of the All Kerala Fish Merchants and Commission Agents' Association said the market situation had changed drastically in the wake of COVID-19 and that the demand for 16% discount was not a new one. Auction disrupted Fish merchants and agents were in dire financial difficulty and that the demand for the discount was justified, he claimed. He said that the COVID-19 protocol had disrupted the normal auction process at fish landing centres and harbours. Mr. Kalapurackal said buying agents had said that fish sales could be disrupted from August 1 if the enhanced discount was not implemented. He alleged that fish buyers from outside were not being allowed to purchase from the landing centres and harbours. The boat operators’ demand is that the fishing community should be freed from the "exploitation of middlemen" so that the fishers get the true value for their labour. They pointed out that each fishing expedition had turned extremely costly with the price of diesel going up drastically during the last one year. The traditional fishers are in no position to bear the fuel price hike. Meanwhile, sources in the Thoppumpady fishing harbour pointed out that no demand had been raised for auction discount hike by buyers in the harbour. There are around 200 trawler boats, 800 long liners and gillnet boats and 65 purseine boats operating out of Thoppumpady harbour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/annual-trawling-ban-draws-to-a-close/article35661288.ece
01 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fall in number of buses worrisome||The declining number of public-transport buses in Kerala over the past two decades has resulted in availability of buses nosediving to approximately 0.50 per 1,000 people, as compared to the national average of 1.33. The steep fall in the number of buses in Kerala is in stark contrast to even Bangladesh which had 0.97 buses per 1,000 people, while developing countries such as Thailand had 8.42 buses, Malaysia 5.90 buses and Mexico 2.87 buses, as per data released by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. “The steep decline in the number of private stage-carrier buses in Kerala is evident from the fact that their number fell from approximately 35,000 in 2000 to 12,000. The fleet depletion of 20,000 buses over two decades is worrisome, especially in a small State like Kerala where public-transport buses provided cost-effective and low-carbon footprint travel,” said D. Dhanuraj, chairman of city-based think tank Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR), which has done innumerable studies in the sector, based on which recommendations were forwarded to the government. The number of private buses in operation has further fallen from 12,000 (in early 2020) to about 8,000 due to the pandemic situation. “The fear is rife that all this will lead to commuters seeking refuge in private vehicles, increasing congestion and pollution. Contrary to government announcements and public expectation, the KSRTC [Kerala State Road Transport Corporation] has not increased their services either. Even the existing number of private buses will be taken off the road, since the State government notification of 2020 says only KSRTC buses can operate on routes that exceed 140 km. “This is a dog-in-the-manger attitude, since the RTC which is neck-deep in debt is in no position to make alternative arrangements,” said Mr. Dhanuraj. Regulatory body He sought the formation of an independent regulatory body like in the power and telecom sectors, to usher in much-needed quality standards and technological improvements in the sector. “The current policies are focused on KSRTC, with the result that the service provider and the regulator are one and the same.” A strong votary of public transport and Motor Vehicle Inspector of Idukki RTO Bijulal P. Ram said misleading data in the annual economic review released by the State Planning Board, wherein the number of stage-carriage buses in Kerala has been pegged at 48,000, was one of the reasons behind the hiccups in the sector. “A scientific mode must be adopted so that data reflects the truth, based on which proactive policies can be adopted,” he said. Any further delay in helping the sector to get back on track would cause irreparable damage, especially so since the threat of the sector being taken over by bus-aggregator firms based in other States was looming large, said Mr. Ram.

01 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Boat owners call for govt. intervention||The All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators’ Association has appealed to the State government to step in and prevent “exploitation” of fishers by fish buyers and agents, who were allegedly demanding up to 16% discount on the auction price of fish landings in harbours even as the annual trawling ban is set to end on the midnight of Saturday. The boat owners alleged that the agents had threatened not to buy the catch if the discount offered on auction price was not hiked to 16%. Association president Peter Mathias and general secretary Joseph Xavier Kalapurackal said fish buying agents had demanded that the present “auction discount” of 13% be raised to 16%. The “auction discount” worked against the interest of the fishers, said the boat owners.

The fish buying agents are now demanding that it be raised to Rs. 16. The rate of discount varies from harbour to harbour. However, V.A. Nazar of All Kerala Fish Merchants’ and Commission Agents’ Association said the market situation had changed drastically in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown and financial losses and that the demand for 16% discount was not a new one but one that existed earlier. Fish merchants and agents were in financial difficulty and the demand for the discount was justified, he claimed. He also said that the COVID-19 protocol had disrupted the normal auction process at fish landing centres and harbours. Mr. Kalapurackal said buying agents had said that fish sales could be disrupted from August 1 if the enhanced discount was not implemented and the demand had been made on fish landing centres in Vypeen.

The State Wetlands Authority, Kerala, (SWAK) had earlier identified 40 wetlands of importance in the State with the support of remote sensing agencies. The SWAK has written to the Collectors of 11 districts where the identified wetlands are located to fix the dates for consultations with the local bodies concerned. The consultations with the civic authorities of Ernakulam were completed earlier. Kollam has the most number of wetlands, nine, followed by Thiruvananthapuram (8), Kozhikode (5) and Alappuzha and Kottayam, four each, according to the draft list. Poovar-Pozhikkara, Killi, Vellayani, Akkulam, Kadinamkulam and Anchuthengu Kayal of Thiruvananthapuram; Paravur Kayal, Vattakayal and Kottakayal, the Ramsar site of Ashtamudi and Sasthamkotta of Kollam; Kayamkulam and Pullikkal Kayal, Ramsar site of Vembanad Kol of Alappuzha; and Beypore, Kallayi, Kottuli and Korapuzha of Kozhikode are among the wetlands that have found place on the draft list. The public consultations are being held for ascertaining the boundaries of the identified wetlands. The boundaries that were earlier identified using satellite imageries need to be physically verified with the local bodies concerned. Besides fixing the boundaries, the zones of influence of the wetlands also needed to be identified during the consultation process, said Suneel Pamidi, Member Secretary, SWAK. Zone of influence The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 define the zone of influence of a wetland as an area where any developmental activities undertaken are “likely to induce adverse changes in wetland ecosystem structure and (ecological) functioning.” The Rules, issued by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, also prescribe certain restrictions on activities at a distance of 50 metre from the boundaries of the notified wetlands. The authority also had the mandate for preparing integrated management plan for each of the notified wetlands, he said. Online The public consultations, which were put on hold following the COVID outbreak, would resume online shortly, he said. The SWAK will also have to come out with the description of boundaries, zone of influence and the list of prohibited and regulated activities within the wetland and its zone of influence. The draft notification will also be published for public consultations. The general public can respond to it within 60 days of its publication.  The boundaries that were earlier identified using satellite imageries need to be physically verified with the local bodies concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wetlands-of-significance-discussions-to-begin-soon/article35661241.ece
01 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Solution to stalking must go beyond policing: experts||The gunning down of a 24-year-old medical student at Nellikuzhi near Kothamangalam in Ernakulam district by a man she had met over Instagram a year ago points to the need for intervention beyond that of the police, who predominantly look at such instances from the angle of law and order. That the 32-year-old Rakhil’s promise to the police not to stalk her any longer over a month before he shot her dead draws attention to the glaring absence of a professional mental health intervention in between. “There seems to be a trend to settle such things at a police station as if police personnel are best equipped to address them. As commendable are their increasing basket of social services, the police are not ideal to address multifactorial problems like pathological dependence possibly arising from personality disorders or familial circumstances. It is possible that in this case, someone had intimate knowledge about the over-dependence and possessive behaviour of the accused and should have roped in his dear and near ones to arrange for professional corrective interventions,” said psychiatrist C.J. John. P. Vijayan, Inspector General and Director of Social Policing, observed that while preventing a crime was not possible, pre-emptive policing to detect and root out negative thoughts and emotional outbursts before they turn into criminal tendencies held much significance. “Not every problem has a solution in policing and calls for the convergence of multiple agencies pooling together their resources, manpower, and collective authority. No single agency can do the job, and there is the need for cultivating a culture of collaboration. We plan to convert social policing into an ideal platform for that convergence,” he said. Elizabeth Antony, clinical psychologist at the Ernakulam General Hospital, said stalking and youngsters falling prey to relations over the social media were rampant. “The glorification of stalking, including in movies, means that youngsters don’t even seem to realise that it’s a crime. They simply seem ignorant about the possibility of a putting a healthy end to what turns out to be a toxic relation. Also, there seems to be groups at work targeting vulnerable young girls and women on social media,” she said. Nandakishore Harikumar, who runs a cyber security start-up, said the spectre of toxic and even fatal impact of the social media was only going to rise. Fake identities “We are in for an era of Artificial Intelligence-driven fake identities to prey on vulnerable people. Cyber security hygiene should be made part of school syllabus. Just like young ones are taught about good and bad touches, they should also be taught the good and bad things about Internet and social media,” he said.

Should be curbed “The involvement of gun should be taken as an ominous sign of evolving youth violence and should be curbed at the very outset. Gunning down a person in revenge could be perceived as a lot more sophisticated and could even glamorise the crime. It could catch up if left unchecked,” said psychiatrist C.J. John. Ajithkumar Thampan, noted criminologist and former chief investigator with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, London, felt that the incident should not be seen as an isolated one but as part of a larger and more dangerous malaise. Warning to society “It is a warning to society about the changing contours of violence by youth having scant regard for the prevalent social norms and the rule of law. That a gun was available to him to access itself is a dangerous signal. It should also be seen in the context of increasing incidents of suicide by children after falling addict to violent online games,” he said. Rahul Sasi, a cybersecurity expert, however, said drawing parallels between real-life violence and violent online games was not backed by any data-backed evidence. “A real-life violent person may have never played an online game in his entire life. In fact, his life may be devoid of any entertainment or vigour,” he said. Chain reaction Former Director General of Police (DGP) Jacob Punnose said the incident was unlikely to trigger a chain reaction of gun-based violence, since very few guns were around in the State, and that most of them were accounted for. “The possession of guns is discouraged by law enforcement agencies lest they should be used for settling arguments. But how the accused came to possess a gun is a matter of concern and should be seriously looked into,” he said.  Gunning down a person in revenge could even glamorise the crime. It could catch up if left unchecked||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/concern-over-gun-violence/article35661217.ece

He termed as absurd the allegation that the Centre was ‘misusing’ Customs in the State. “We will take action irrespective of the consequences. The State has no locus standi on Customs which is a Union subject. There was never before an instance of diplomatic channel being misused for smuggling. Foreign diplomats (of the UAE) too are part of the show-cause notice issued by the agency,” he said.

The assurance was given after Mr. Premachandran met the Union Minister. Mr. Mandaviya congratulated the management and workers of FACT for turning the company into a profitable one. FACT has been running in profit continuously for the last three years. The company was in profit during 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21. The total profit was to the tune of Rs. 1,490 crore, said a submission by the MP. Though wages revision was affected in the public sector company in 1997, the revised wages were not paid to the employees till June 2001. It was then promised that if the financial condition of the company improved and it was profitable for a period of continuous three years, the arrears would be paid. Consequent to FACT making profit for two years and improving its financial position, the 2007 wages revision effective from January 2007 was implemented in 2010. The wages arrears were then paid to the employees on the company payroll at that time without clearing the 1997 wages arrears for the retirees, said Mr. Premachandran in his submission before the Union Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fact-retirees-promised-arrears/article35661245.ece

Paying guest The deceased, a 24-year-old BDS student from Kannur, doing her house surgency at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Dental Sciences, Nellikuzhi, was shot down by the accused identified as Rakhil, 32, of Melur in Kannur at a house in the neighbourhood of the campus where the victim was staying as paying guest along with her friends. Both the victim and the accused were reportedly known to each other after meeting over Instagram about a year ago. In a statement given to the police, a friend of the accused from Kannur said that he had accompanied the accused to Bihar from where they had procured the pistol. “He claims that they had been in Bihar for 10-15 days in July. But it’s just one of the versions and needs to be verified,” said K. Karthick, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). The trip to Bihar had probably taken place just days after he had assured the Kannur police not to stalk the victim any longer. He was summoned by the police on a petition filed by the victim and her family. A ballistic examination of the firearm held on Saturday found it to be a 7.62 mm country-made pistol. Its source and how the accused procured it are being investigated. Mr. Karthick has formed a special investigation team led by the Muvattupuzha DySP to probe the incident.

01 August 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Pat for green initiative of Coastal police||Every Friday a couple of policemen from the Neendakara Coastal police station take a small trip after their routine parade. During the stroll they ensure that the seedlings they planted in nearby areas are growing well and the drill is just one of their many green initiatives. Since 2016 the station has heavily invested on restoring and preserving the coastal ecosystem and now their efforts have been acknowledged in the form of a biodiversity award. Also the recipient of the Vanamitra award for Kollam district, instituted by the Kerala Forest and Wildlife Department, it is for the first time in the history of the Kerala Police that a unit is bagging both the honours. One of the first initiatives of the station was Suchitwa Theeram, Surakshita Theeram, a project to tackle the plastic waste menace. Along with endeavours to make the coast plastic-free, the team also spread awareness on how indiscriminate use will hamper marine ecology and pose a threat to the livelihood of fishers. The mass campaign was held in coordination with voluntary organisations, clubs, libraries and local support groups. In 2017 they launched a massive mangrove afforestation project in a bid to preserve the biodiverse aquatic habitats. The project aims to develop a green cover across the coastal belt that stretches from Azheekkal to Paravur and the sides of Ashtamudi Lake, Vattakayal and TS Canal. Over 5,000 mangrove saplings were planted as part of the project and in 2019 the police started cultivating Calophyllum inophyllum (Punna). In order to make a switch from casuarina to punna, they started collecting the seeds and set up a nursery in the station. Since Punna is said to protect the coastline, more than 500 saplings were planted. While the station has a herbal garden at one spot, plantains are cultivated at another side. During the pandemic the policemen started feeding strays and herons that were left to starve due to the lockdown. “We continued all our activities during the pandemic without affecting our duty hours. They were carried out in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol and all the staff attached to the station were involved. Apart from us, coastal wardens and employees of police boats also actively participated in the programmes,” says Assistant Sub Inspector D.Sreekumar, convener. The projects are being implemented under the guidance of District Police Chief T.Narayanan while Kerala Police Officers Association Kollam city secretary M.C.Prashantan is the coordinator and Assistant Sub Inspector S. Ashokan is the joint convener.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pat-for-green-initiative-of-coastal-police/article35661273.ece

01 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Only wards with over 80 cases to be declared containment zones||The criterion for declaring containment zones in Kozhikode Municipal Corporation has been changed. From August 1, only wards that register more than 80 COVID cases will be declared as containment zones. The decision came at a meeting chaired by Mayor Beena Philip on Saturday, in which MLA Thottathil Raveendran, the District Collector, the District Medical Officer and other senior officials took part. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the Mayor said the corporation had requested the State government to allow all shops to open five days a week except Saturday and Sunday. “We all have experienced the huge rush on Fridays. Opening shops and establishments for more days is the only solution to this problem,” the Mayor said. Meanwhile, in a first in the State, the corporation has taken up a mission to achieve complete vaccination in two of its wards. The Kappakkal ward that has recorded the maximum number of COVID deaths (26) in the city and the Puthiyappa ward, which has been a containment zone ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, are the two wards. “We need to study the reason behind the condition in both the wards, other than that they are coastal wards. We need to see if complete vaccination can help end issues there,” the Mayor said. It was decided at the meeting that the corporation would be provided more vaccine slots in future, in accordance with its population. The councillors and Rapid Response Teams have been asked to bring in more people for COVID testing, especially those from vulnerable sections, like people working in market places, harbours and those who have constant interaction with the public. The District Collector has assured the corporation that the inaccuracy in COVID data entry will be dealt with soon. The corporation complained that COVID cases from elsewhere were being put into the corporation’s account due to the sloppiness of data entry operators in private labs and hospitals. The Mayor said that the test positivity rate in Kozhikode was high since only people with symptoms or contact with patients took COVID tests. “Most positive cases these days are asymptomatic. People who are in contact with masses need to take the test every now and then even if they did not have symptoms,” she said, adding that more people taking the test was necessary to bring down the TPR, which in turn will help the city open up more.  We all have experienced the huge rush on Fridays.

01 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||With mediatory talks on, truce in the offing in INL||A truce is in the offing between the two rival groups in the State unit of the Indian National League (INL) with prominent Sunni faction led by Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar, who is known to be close to the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) leadership, donning the role of a mediator. Mediatory talks held between INL general secretary Kasim Irikkur and A.P. Abdul Hakeem Azhari, general secretary of the Suni Yuvajana Sangham and son of Aboobacker Musliar, in Kozhikode on Saturday have sent a signal that the Sunni faction is pressuring the warring INL State leaders to bridge the rift in the party. Rival leaders Mr. Irikkur and party State president A.P. Abdul Wahab have indicated that a reconciliation is on the cards. The rift in the INL, which is part of the LDF, imploded in public when members of the rival groups clashed at a hotel in Kochi on July 25 after a meeting convened to discuss internal organisational issues. Subsequently, Mr. Wahab and Mr. Irikkur expelled each other from the party. Both sides signalled their intention to work for a truce following the Communist Party of India (Marxist) State leadership’s reported warningthat the factional feud is indefensible. Open for talks “During our talks with Mr. Azhari, we gave the assurance that we are ready for reconciliation and the other side [led by Mr. Wahab] is also open for discussions,” Mr. Irikkur told The Hindu after the talks. He said he had promised that old issues that triggered the rift would not be brought on the table during the conciliatory talks. Mr. Irikkur, who was accompanied by INL leaders B. Hamza Haji and M.A. Latheef, said the party would not compromise on organisational discipline. It would take the clashes in Kochi seriously as they had damaged the image of the party, he added. When contacted, Mr. Wahab said his side had also conveyed a willingness for reconciliation. ‘Onus on Devarkovil’ “We have expressed our readiness for compromise and urged Ahammad Devarkovil [the INL nominee in the LDF Ministry] to take the initiative for a reproachment,” he said. The mediation of the Sunni faction is expected to kick-start parleys within the INL to end the disunity in the leadership over issues, including the appointment of CPI(M) workers in the personal staff of Mr. Devarkovil, and an allegation that he had accepted Rs. 3 lakh from Indian Union Muslim League MP and businessman P.V. Abdul Wahab for his election campaign in the Kozhikode South Assembly constituency in the Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-mediatory-talks-on-truce-in-the-offing-in-inl/article35661301.ece

Evidence collected during an investigation into one of the recent drug trafficking cases is expected to support the squad in the probe. Because of tight surveillance in trains and on inter-State public transport, smugglers were mostly using private courier services for the shipping of illegally procured drugs. In one of the recent seizures, the trickery had come to light exposing the involvement of some of the newly launched courier service providers. Though such operators have claimed innocence, their role will be investigated. Drugs were reportedly shipped from Goa along with toys to evade checking. In the preliminary investigation, it was found that the Goa-based gang had Kerala youths as members. The role of a woman in smuggling drugs is also being investigated. It was on June 16 that a Thrissur native named Zakkir Hussain was arrested by squads. He was nabbed during a follow-up investigation into an incident in which two Malappuram natives were arrested with costly LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) stamps last year. The arrest of the three had helped the Excise Crime Branch secure crucial digital evidence in the case. According to Excise Department sources, the Crime Branch squad has zeroed in on some of the suspected persons in Goa. The squad would leave for Goa soon, they said. The dedicated Crime Branch wing of the Excise Department was formed recently to take-up follow up investigations into major drug trafficking cases and the speedy submission of First Information Reports. The northern Kerala squad is responsible for carrying out probes into cases registered under Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the Kerala Abkari Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-crime-branch-zeroes-in-on-drug-peddlers-network-in-goa/article35661227.ece

01 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Frequent power outages disrupt online classes||Frequent power outages in the name of repairs at local level have been disrupting online classes of students in Kozhikode city and its suburbs. Students at various educational levels in schools and colleges often go through a harrowing experience during online class hours owing to the disruption in electricity supply. “Sometimes we miss an important period for no fault of ours. And teachers scold us for being absent. They also warn us of deducting internal marks,” said M. Rohan, a class IX student. Often, students complain about missing their entire online classes from morning till noon or at times till evening. “Sometimes, we receive SMS notification that power would be disrupted between specified timings to take up installation of a transformer or pruning branches of trees or LT (Low Tension) and HT (High Tension) maintenance. So our whole day is wasted,” Akhil, who is a class X student, said. Most families have been relying on Wi-Fi or even high-speed broadband fibre or Fibre To The Home (FTTH) services for various reasons including poor mobile data connection. “In the worst scenario, parents allow their children to use Wi-Fi tethering through their mobile phones. But for that too, the connection might appear slow. Now we have to use Wi-Fi dongle for better speed and connectivity,” Russell Lazim, an engineering student, said. Families also have no option but to buy Router UPS that provides uninterrupted internet service lasting for a few hours in case of a power outage. “But the cost of this power backup ranges from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000. Or else we have to install a good power inverter at the asking price above Rs. 20,000,” Lissy, a parent, said. Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) officials said power failure had been minimised in both urban and rural areas with the introduction of new systems in place. Regular maintenance would have to continue especially during the monsoon, they said. “Power supply failure is rare in Kozhikode city. But outages could happen when a tree falls on power lines. Besides, the Outage Management System intimates consumers through SMS about any power disruption at least a day in advance,” KSEB Chief Engineer (Distribution-North) K.B. Swaminathan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/frequent-power-outages-disrupt-online-classes/article35661218.ece
01 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Resident doctors in medical colleges on the warpath||Resident doctors in medical colleges in the State have found fault with the current management of the pandemic, which, they said, was adversely affecting both their academic and practical lives. They have now called for a token strike between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Monday, when they will stay away from all COVID and non-COVID duties. Functionaries of the Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association (KMPGA) said that despite repeated requests to the authorities, their concerns had not been addressed. They claimed that only two batches of postgraduate medical students were available in medical colleges with final-year students having completed their course. The 2015 batch of MBBS house surgeons have already completed their tenure and an extension as well. This was causing a serious shortage of manpower and would affect the treatment of COVID and non-COVID patients if urgent steps were not taken. They said that the admission of COVID patients should be decentralised to non-medical college hospitals in the periphery because the treatment of patients with other diseases had been crippled across the State. They pointed out that medical colleges, the largest medical training facilities, had been overburdened with COVID cases. Postgraduates need proper training, but their academic programmes had been severely compromised with online classes. Surgical specialties had been the worst hit. The KMPGA leaders said that the duty schedule had taken a toll on the residents and non-academic junior residents with proper pay should be appointed through the National Health Mission. With the National-Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for PG courses being delayed, new batches were yet to come. The notification for the appointment of 76 non-academic senior residents was yet to be issued too. The residents in Kerala were yet to be given incentives or risk allowances as in other States. The extra Intensive Care Unit beds should also be shifted to peripheral hospitals and the staff there should be trained to use them, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/resident-doctors-in-medical-colleges-on-the-warpath/article35661212.ece

A large garland made of pink receipts for the fines slapped by the authorities hung from his neck as 38-year-old P.V. Mohammed Riyas criss-crossed Manjeri town. At first people took him for a crack. But the placard he held confirmed his sanity. Mr. Riyas chose to stage a loner’s protest after he was persistently harassed by authorities while carrying laterite stones to construction sites. “We too want to live. I started transporting laterite blocks after the State government announced that pickups carrying building materials, specifically laterite blocks, should not be prevented by the police. But, I was charged by different officers, including those of the Department of Mining and Geology, while transporting laterite blocks,” he said. No empathy Mr. Riyas said he was desperate as the authorities kept on slapping him fines without being empathetic. The fine receipts he made a festoon with included that of his friends. “We too have families, and we too want to live,” he said. The placard he held exhorted the government to allow people to make a living by working. The pink fine slips that hung from his neck varied from minimum Rs. 250 to Rs. 10,000. “The unkindest slap was from the geology team. They charged Rs. 10,000,” he said. Mr. Riyas said his protest was to invite the attention of the government to the pathetic condition the ordinary people in the State were going through. “I have wife and three kids. They wait for my return from work with a lot of expectations every day. Sadly, there were days when I had to go home empty-handed after being fined by the police and other authorities while carrying laterite blocks. It’s terrible,” Mr. Riyas said with a quiver in his voice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-fine-garland-to-state-his-plight-and-that-of-his-ilk/article35661290.ece

The Pathanamthitta diocese of the Syro-Malankara Church on Saturday came up with a welfare scheme for couples who are married after the year 2000 and have four or more children. Priority in admissions The scheme, announced through a circular issued by Samuel Mar Irenios, bishop of the diocese, seeks to offer a monthly financial assistance of Rs. 2,000, besides free pregnancy care for women delivering their fourth child onwards. While the children from such families will be given priority in admissions to schools under the diocese, the members of such families will be accorded prominence in recruitments to the institutions run by it. Beyond the material support, the diocese also offers to designate a priest exclusively for such families to take care of their spiritual needs, along with a nun as their animator. The head of the diocese will convene a union of such families and spend time with them once in a year. The circular also speaks of a plan to operate a pro-life ministry for helping the couples prepare for more children and create awareness on the value of life among them. Meanwhile, the circular also elaborates on the ill-effects of measures to control population and records concern over the negative growth rate of population recorded by Pathanamthitta. According to it, the district has registered a 3.12% drop in its overall population during the decade that ended in 2011, while a quarter of these people are senior citizens. ‘In all religions’ “Notwithstanding the leading positions in terms of education and culture, we, as residents of Pathanamthitta have been propagating a culture of death. It has caused a sharp drop in human resource while the decline in farmers turned cultivable lands into forests and set the stage of wildlife attacks. As many as 20% of the houses in Pathanamthitta now remain closed and we have also lost two Assembly segments,” noted the circular. Emphasising the need to counter the effects of negative growth rate, the bishop also urged families across all religions and castes to prepare for receiving more children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-syro-malankara-diocese-offers-sops/article35661254.ece

As the girl did not return home the same day, the ward member of the panchayat in which her family live, lodged a police complaint. As the victim returned home the next day, the police subjected her to a medical examination and confirmed the rape.

01 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State support for farming of jamun, dragon fruit||Desi fruit Njaval, or jamun as it is called in many parts of India, and the flashy-looking dragon fruit which is native to the Americas are among ten indigenous and exotic fruits whose cultivation is being actively promoted by the State Horticulture Mission (SHM) this year. This is the first time that the Njaval ( Syzygium cumini ) has found a place on the mission’s list of fruit trees/plants whose cultivation would be supported under the Centrally assisted Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) of the National Horticulture Mission (NHM). Though Njaval fruit is a familiar one which evokes sweet nostalgia for Keralites, farmers here have not explored its commercial possibilities to any great extent. Even today one would be hard-pressed to find this oblong, shiny-black, sour-sweet fruit, which leaves a purplish stain on the tongue, on sale in most fruit shops. Health benefits That said, its reported health benefits have been pushing it up the popularity charts. So much so that it is now a common sight in cities such as Thiruvananthapuram to see push-carts laden with jamuns from other south Indian States with price tags of Rs. 300 or more a kilogram. “The State Horticulture Mission was asked to explore the scope of indigenous and exotic fruit plants which could be included under the MIDH component ‘Area Expansion of Fruit Plants’ this year. We have included 10, including Njaval, which are suitable for cultivation in Kerala,” Sreekala S., Deputy Director, SHM, told The Hindu . Those on the list The full list has mango, jackfruit, avocado, rambutan, passion fruit, mangosteen, gooseberry, Malabar tamarind ( Garcinia cambogia, kudampuli in Malayalam), jamun, and the dragon fruit. Assistance The assistance covers 1,310 hectares with a combined outlay of Rs. 2.35 crore (Central + State share) for all the fruits on this list except dragon fruit. As in other parts of India, the dragon fruit has won many fans among fruit growers in Kerala in recent years. Under the MIDH component, the coverage of assistance is for a total of 250 hectares with an outlay of Rs. 75 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-support-for-farming-of-jamun-dragon-fruit/article35661233.ece

This will help the State generate an additional 77 tonnes of oxygen. At a review meeting held here on Saturday to assess the State’s preparations in anticipation of a possible third wave of COVID-19, the progress of the 38 oxygen generation units being established in the State utilising various funding sources was also assessed. The oxygen generation units are being set up utilising funds from Centrally sponsored schemes, State funds, CSR funds and funds from NGOs. The meeting also reviewed the preparations made by the State in the area of paediatric care. Ms. George appealed to the public to maintain utmost vigil against COVID-19 and to maintain all safety precautions as the second wave was still progressing in the State. Those vaccinated should maintain all precautions and mask up strictly as they can still get infected and transmit infection. Vaccines protect the vaccinated individual from serious disease and death but they can pass on the disease to other vulnerable persons. Ms. George said the State still had a chunk of its population who are susceptible to COVID-19. If disease transmission continues unchecked before vaccination reaches every one, it can result in a third wave and the hospitals getting filled up, she pointed out. The State is trying to get as many people vaccinated as possible as and when the State receives vaccine supplies, she added. She asked the Health Department and the Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd. to ensure that all hospital supplies and consumables required for COVID-19 care are stocked in adequate quantities at all hospitals as well as other treatment centres. KMSCL representatives and senior officials of the Health and Medical Education department were present at the meeting.  The meeting also reviewed the preparations made by the State in the area of paediatric care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/oxygen-units-to-be-ready-in-aug-veena/article35661251.ece
01 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Digital parking system at Central station||A Thiruvananthapuram-based start-up has come up with a digital car parking system for the Central railway station at Thampanoor, enabling customers to make payments for the facility through FASTag or other digital cards. With this, the existing system of manually issuing parking slips will slowly be done away with. In the initial period, the automatic parking system through FASTag is enabled only for the car parking area, as two-wheelers are not provided FASTag as of now. Former Technopark staff Anantham Online Private Limited, floated by former employees of various companies at Technopark, developed the system in collaboration with the Southern Railway. It helps customers enjoy trouble-free entry and exit. All that they have to ensure is that the vehicles have an active FASTag with sufficient balance. FASTag has been made mandatory by the Union government for vehicles at toll plazas. The facility at the Central Railway Station can accommodate over 100 cars and 500 two-wheelers. Though the FASTag-based entry, exit and payment are offered to cars alone, UPI or card payments are available for other vehicles and non-FASTag users. “Though we have been into the industry for some time now, as a start-up we always focused on defining digital transformation for enterprises. When it comes to domains like parking, the challenges are many. Convincing stakeholders at different levels, including officials, customers, and our partners, to bring professionalism and technology to a domain that is run purely on manpower was itself a herculean task,” said Prasanth P., founder director, Anantham Online. Locker facilities Apart from FASTag and digital payments, the parking facility is set to offer other value-added services, locker facilities, and advanced parking slot reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/digital-parking-system-at-central-station/article35661430.ece

This was not intended as a blanket extension, authority officials said. Developers who require it should apply in the relevant forms annexed to the Kerala Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2018. The extension, if needed, will be applicable to projects for which the date of completion as per the registration certificate expires on or after April 1, 2021. The authority has also decided to waive the fee for the extension. “The authority has taken cognizance of the adverse effects of second wave of pandemic and the lockdown in the State and resolved to treat this as an event of ‘force majeure’ as per the above provision of the Act (The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016),” as per a July 19 order. This is the second extension given by the authority for the date of completion of projects in response to the pandemic. During the first wave last year, the authority had given a six-month extension. Section 6 of the Act notes that extensions should not exceed a year. The Act requires real estate projects to be registered with the State-level RERA. Public warned K-RERA has warned the public against entering into agreements for real estate projects that are not registered with the authority. Authority chairman P.H. Kurian said notices had been issued to promoters who advertised their projects without registering with the authority. He urged the public to visit rera.kerala.gov.in to check whether the projects were registered or not. The authority could impose fines from Rs. 10,000 a day to 5% of project cost from builders who advertised unregistered projects in mainstream or social media, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/delayed-realty-projects-likely-to-get-extension/article35661384.ece

In an advisory, the official said 359 complaints had been reported in the capital in =six months. The fraudulent practices include phishing, vishing calls, frauds using online selling platforms, those due to the use of unverified mobile apps, and ATM card skimming. Cybercriminals use phishing links that direct victims to share sensitive information on fake websites that appear legitimate. Several persons have fallen for such traps thinking that that they were accessing genuine websites of banks or e-commerce groups. Mr. Upadhyay urged the public not to click on unknown links and to delete SMS or e-mail circulated for the purpose. Vishing calls Through vishing calls, imposters get in touch with customers through telephone calls or the social media to obtain credentials such as user names, passwords, card details, card verification value (CVV) of credit and debit cards, and one-time passwords (OTPs). He warned the public to remain guarded against attempts made by criminals to install skimming devices in ATM machines.

Kerala on Saturday reported 20,624 new cases and 80 recent virus deaths. The TPR for the day was 12.31%. 1,986 new cases in T.N. A marginal rise in fresh infections was recorded for the third day in a row in Tamil Nadu. With 1,986 people testing positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, four districts — Chengalpattu, Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur — saw their daily tally go up by 10 to 25 cases compared with the previous day, while cases fell in Chennai and Erode. Coimbatore’s daily tally continued to rise — to 246 from 230 the previous day. Chengalpattu also registered a rise from 109 to 122. However, in Chennai, where cases were gradually increasing over the past four days, the daily count dipped marginally to 204. The cases took the State’s tally to 25,59,597. The number of samples tested increased to 1,60,897. The State recorded another 26 deaths, taking the toll to 34,076. Andhra Pradesh reported 23 deaths and 2,058 infections on Saturday. The daily toll continued to rise. Telangana recorded 621 cases and two more patients died. Of the new infections, the highest of 80 were from Greater Hyderabad.

01 August 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chittoor braces for third wave of COVID-19||Chittoor district, which recorded over 2.35 lakh COVID cases and 1,734 deaths since March 2020, is bracing for the possible third wave. Top priority is being given to inoculate maximum number of people by the next two months, while enforcing COVID protocols of wearing face masks and surveillance on large gatherings. The district has a population of over 16 lakh below 18 years of age. A survey conducted by the medical officers on COVID duties said that the risk of getting infected with the virus would be minimal for children below the age of 5 as a majority of the mothers were being vaccinated, and by the next few weeks, several of them would be completing two doses of vaccine. Deputy District Medical and Health Officer P. Ravi Raju said a thorough action plan was being chalked out to face the threat of third wave. “All the medical and paramedical staff have been put on alert to the threat. The field staff is given regular orientation about promoting awareness on COVID guidelines, particularly in the rural areas, and to alert the people not to lower guard. Surveillance has been mounted at all commercial establishments and function halls which are vulnerable to large gatherings,” he said. The official said that of the 2.30 lakh COVID cases in the district, about 20% of them were of patients below 18 years, and with near zero casualties. “Our observation is that in case of a third wave, it would not target the 0 to 18 age group alone, but might be general as in the case of first and second waves. The percentage of patients under the paediatric age might go up by about 5 to 10%,” Dr Ravi Raju said. Hospitals on alert The Deputy DMHO said all paediatric wards in government hospitals of Chittoor, Madanapalle and Tirupati divisions were on alert. “All the primary health centres are equipped with oxygen cylinders and infrastructure at the wards is strengthened. With the coordination of the Indian Medical Association, the services of paediatricians in private hospitals would also be utilised to face the third wave threat,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-braces-for-third-wave-of-covid-19/article35660692.ece
01 August 2021||G. KONDUR (KRISHNA DT.),ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP leaders’ bid to visit Kondapalli foiled||The police on Saturday foiled the TDP leaders’ attempt to visit the Kondapalli reserve forest area in the district, and booked cases against 50 leaders of both the opposition party and the ruling YSRCP. Alleging illegal mining in the forest area, the TDP had constituted a fact- finding committee, which planned to visit the area. However, the police placed the members of the committee under house arrest and stepped up surveillance on them. A few YSRCP leaders, who also planned to visit the area, were taken into preventive custody under Section 151 of the CrPC, said Krishna district Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal. Forces deployed The police deployed forces at Kondapalli, Ibrahimpatnam, Mylavaram and Gollapudi in Krishna district and in the Vijayawada Police Commissionerate limits to prevent the TDP team from entering the forest area. A couple of days ago, the G. Kondur police had arrested former Minister and senior TDP leader Devineni Umamaheswara Rao when he visited the forest area. He was later remanded in judicial custody and lodged in the Rajahmundry Central Prison. ‘No permission’ Speaking to The Hindu , Eluru Range Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police K.V. Mohan Rao said the TDP leaders had approached District Collector J. Nivas seeking permission to visit the Kondapalli reserve forest area. “The Collector refused to give permission to the TDP’s delegation in the wake of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. But the opposition party planned to visit the place illegally,” Mr. Mohan Rao said. “As there is no permission for the TDP leaders’ visit, we have placed a few leaders under house surveillance. Police forces have been deployed and pickets arranged as a precautionary measure,” the DIG said. Former Ministers Nettem Raghuram and Kollu Ravindra, former MP Konakalla Narayana Rao, former MLAs Sriram Rajagopal and Tangirala Sowmya, and a few others were kept under house arrest. “The situation is peaceful in Kodapalli village and in the reserve forest,” Mr. Siddharth said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-leaders-put-under-house-arrest-over-kondapalli-visit/article35660648.ece

01 August 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||A steal: copycat art in Hyderabad||The city has a new art installation near the Moazzam Jahi Market. A huge boulder appears to be strung up by a rope and stays in air, as if by magic, below another boulder. Most commuters give it a double glance before moving on. “We were given a photograph by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation officials and asked to create a similar installation. We used fibre glass for the purpose. What appears to be a rope is also made of fibre glass,” says Akalp Mukim, the sculptor behind the installation. A few kilometres and a world away near the Mindspace Junction is another art installation that shows large, perfectly-shaped shimmering feathers stuck to the ground. In the middle of a traffic island, road users see it and go their way. What ties these two art installations is the fact that both are copies of well known art installations from different cultures. The floating rock installation is a copy of the one near the Cairo airport that was created by Shaaban Abbas before the artist died in 2010. The metal feathers sculpture was created by Irish sculptor Alex Pentek. Plan to sue “I see the sculpture in Hyderabad as a blatant copy and IP theft of my original artwork ‘Kindred Spirits’ in Ireland, which represents my career as an artist pioneering new techniques and use of materials in the studio over many years. There is no question that this work is made to be as close a copy of my work as physically possible and I am currently seeking legal advice,” said Mr. Pentek, who has done art installations in Ireland, UK, Canada and Australia. Kindred Spirits showing metallic feathers is testament to the ties between Ireland and Native Americans. “It was made to reflect the history of a donation to Ireland during the Great Hunger from the Native American Choctaw Nation in 1847. Having this work copied without my permission and placed out of context in Hyderabad undermines my original intention and de-values my work,” says the artist. A much stranger location for a copied installation is on the Outer Ring Road near Gachibowli — the Cupped Hands sculpture. The wooden cupped hands installation located in Brandelhow, UK, marks the first land purchase by the National Trust aimed at preserving nature. Ironically, the cupped hands sculpture near Gachibowli is planted in the middle of zipping traffic where people can barely spot it. “Public art installations reflect local culture. They are part of our identity. Telangana artists were at the forefront of the Statehood movement, but by copying art, we are ignoring our own artists and culture. The State has a rich pool of talent but we are nowhere involved with these new installations,” said B. Srinivas Reddy, principal of Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University.

01 August 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||PG admission in TS universities starts||Last year, nearly 16,000 post graduate seats went vacant in Telangana universities and their affiliated colleges, and most of these are in rural areas lagging in infrastructure and quality faculty. This year too, a similar picture is likely to emerge as Osmania University prepares itself for the conduct of the Common Entrance Test for admission into seven universities in the second week of September. The varsity has opened online application process and the last date for applying is August 25. However, candidates can pay till September 3 with penal fee. The Common Post Graduate Entrance Tests (CPGET2021) convenor I. Panduranga Reddy said that the tests will be conducted for 39,065 seats in 94 PG courses, a few PG Diploma courses and five-year integrated courses across seven universities. The tests will be conducted online like the earlier years. ‘Check eligibility’ However, Prof. Reddy asked the students to be very careful while applying for different courses. Lot of students apply without checking the eligibility criterion and later put pressure. It is for the students to check whether they are eligible for the courses or not, he said. In several courses, candidates need to have studied that particular subject at the graduation level. This problem is seen in some courses like Food and Nutrition, Biotechnology, Bio-Chemistry, Genetics, Psychology, Economics and a few others where some subjects are mandatory at the graduation. “Without realising this students apply, write the exam and are rejected at the admissions,” he said. Prof. Reddy said some new courses are also being introduced this year. For example the Palamuru University is introducing Masters in Physical Education and so is Mahatma Gandhi University. However, whenever new courses are approved, students would be kept informed through the university website. University has not raised the entrance registration fee which is Rs. 800 for single subject for OC and BC candidates and Rs. 600 for SC, ST and Physically Challenged candidates. For each additional subject, the fee is Rs. 450 for all categories. Among the 39,065 seats available as of now Osmania University and its constituent and affiliated colleges have the highest at 13,956 seats. Kakatiya University follows with 10,635 seats and followed by Satavahana University (4,963) and Telangana University (3,690 seats).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pg-admission-process-in-state-universities-starts/article35661194.ece
01 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccination is an absolute must: CSIR chief||There is a clear evidence from around the world that vaccination against COVID-19 dramatically brings down hospitalisation rate and, more importantly, deaths, so getting inoculated is an absolute must, said Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) Director General Shekhar C. Mande on Saturday. “The severity of the disease is less on usage of vaccines and we are advocating use of face mask all the time because aerosol spread is the main way in which the virus spreads. Wearing the mask will prevent the infected person from spreading the infection and the other person from inhaling, because the danger of next wave is always looming around,” he said. After inaugurating various facilities at the Intermagnet Choutuppal Geomagnetic Observatory of the CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Dr. Mande in an interaction pointed out that the COVID wave in UK has been just over the peak while the southern states in US are experiencing the next wave. “There would certainly be a third wave; when it will come, how it come, what will drive the wave — whether due to a new mutant or laxity on the part of the people, we don’t know. Therefore, we should be on our guard and be very careful by continuously appealing to people to maintain COVID-appropriate behaviour until we can bring down infections to a low number and to a point where there is no danger,” he explained. The objective is also to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible. “If we are able to do both — adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour and vaccination, then there is a scientific evidence that is emerging very rapidly that the intensity of the wave and number of deaths can be reduced significantly,” he asserted. Concerns Kerala’s rising cases to 20,000 or more daily is a “cause of concern” but close watch is being kept and genome sequencing is being enhanced here and in Maharasthra too. This will be in addition to the work being done by the INSACOG or Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium where CSIR-CCMB here and CSIR-IGIB in Delhi are sequencing 60% of the samples in the country. The idea is to do as much surveillance as possible, share the data with other agencies to look out for a mutant, and alert the Health Ministry as was done with Delta variant. Dr. Mande was quite confident of an efficient drug emerging out of the globalwide research. Within the country, there are promising signs of efficacy of repurposed drugs developed by CSIR labs – Sepsivac and Umifenovir. Another promising drug Niclosamide is under clinical trial, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccination-is-an-absolute-must-csir-chief/article35661169.ece

01 August 2021||NALGONDA,ANDHRA PRADESH||All set for crest-gate operation at Nagarjunasagar Project||As gates of several brimming projects are under operation in the upstream of river Krishna, record inflows are resulting in the water level rising gradually at the Nagarjunasagar Project. On Saturday, around 6 p.m., the Project was 18 feet short of the full reservoir level (FRL) of 590 feet and was holding 263 tmc ft water as against the full capacity of 312 tmc ft. Official estimates showed the upstream Srisailam Project was discharging close to 4.50 lakh cusecs. Superintending Engineer (NSP) Dharma Naik, who inspected the Project on Saturday, forecast that consistent inflows for the next 24 hours would enable operation of the crest gates by Monday evening. He said the operation of NSP gates in the month of July, in the wake of early monsoon and surplus rainfall across the line, was happening after nearly 14 years. And to mark the event and the bountiful supply, Mr. Naik said the Irrigation Department would request Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who is scheduled to tour Halia in the Nagarjunasagar constituency on Monday, for his presence and the gate operation. Anticipating the development, the official said gate maintenance works such as greasing, change of gate rubber seals and other works have already been completed and they were ready for operation. Villages in the downstream of the NSP and around the Pulichintala Project have also been alerted for floodwaters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-set-for-crest-gate-operation-at-nagarjunasagar-project/article35661185.ece

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kottiyoor case: survivor files plea to marry her assailant||The survivor in the infamous Kottiyoor minor rape case in Kerala has appealed to the Supreme Court for permission to marry her assailant, a defrocked priest sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment under a penal law protecting child victims of sexual abuse. She has also pleaded for his release on bail. She was raped as a minor. She later gave birth. The accused had initially tried to frame her biological father. Victim turns hostile The former priest, Robin Vadakkumcherry, was tried and found guilty under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act in 2019 despite the victim turning hostile. A Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari is scheduled to hear her plea seeking bail for him on Monday. In 2018, the Supreme Court had expressed shock at the alleged involvement of priests in sex crimes in Kerala. A Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and Ashok Bhushan (both have retired) had voiced the court’s alarm while hearing the Kottiyoor case. “This is a shocking and disturbing trend to see such cases involving priests,” Justice Sikri had orally observed in open court. The Kerala government, which was represented by senior advocate K.N. Balagopal in 2018, had argued that the accused in the case were influential people. Confession The prosecution had highlighted the fact that the father of the victim was asked to take responsibility for committing the crime. He had later confessed to the police about the alleged involvement of Vadakumcherry in the rape of the 16-year-old girl.  This is a shocking and disturbing trend to see such cases involving priests.

01 August 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Logistics bottlenecks make a dent on granite exports||Enduring the odds induced by the coronavirus pandemic, the granite units in Prakasam district have processed more than 600 container worth natural and artificial stone material. However, the traders are unable to move the containers owing to logistic bottlenecks. Factories in the Building Material Special Economic Zone at Gullapalli in the district alone have more than 400 containers of processed material ready for shipping to various countries. “The shipping lines are quoting four to five times the regular price of about 1,500 to 2,000 US Dollars for various global destinations. Even after this, container spot is not confirmed, making it worse for us,” say a granite unit owner. The ocean carriers also forced shippers to purchase extra products such as customs clearance and insurance to improve shipment prospects. Even after buying the add-on products, there is still no guarantee of shipment of cargo. Pressing for intervention by the Union and State governments, N. Sudhakar of Satya Exports says if the present situation continues for a few weeks more, the production in the SEZ will come to a standstill. “Now a days, most shipping lines are not making a stop at the Krishnapatnam port, forcing them to take the containers to Chennai, about 200 km from there, which incurs additional costs,” explains M. Shivaram, Chief Operating Officer of the Jyothi Granite Exports, a leading player in the SEZ. Importers in need of the building material urgently get it shipped from Mundra and other ports on the west coast. But, others are adopting a wait-and-watch policy, he says. Those who have started units to process the artificial stone material are now ruing as the cost of the raw material have gone up by about 35%. Earlier, they used to access artificial stone material at about Rs. 8,500 per tonne. But, they are forced to shell out Rs. 12,500 per tonne at present. The traders complain that the increase in royalty by the State government up to 50% is compounding their woes at a time when they are facing acute shortage of labourers n the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. A majority of the over 1 lakh migrant workers from Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, who went home during the second wave are yet top return.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/logistics-bottlenecks-make-a-dent-on-granite-exports/article35660690.ece

01 August 2021||Thrissur,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kuthiran tunnel opened for traffic||Ending a wait lasting years, one of the twin tunnels at Kuthiran on the Thrissur-Palakkad National Highway was opened for traffic. Though the tunnel opening was expected on August 1, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari announced it opened on Twitter on Saturday itself. “This is the first road tunnel in the State and will drastically improve connectivity to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The 1.6-km is designed through the Peechi-Vazhani Wildlife Sanctuary,” he tweeted. No official inauguration There was no official inauguration. District Collector Haritha V. Kumar and City Police Commissioner R. Aditya entered the tunnel first. Two-wheelers were allowed to enter the tunnel first followed by other vehicles. Kuthiran is a mountainous terrain on the Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery stretch of the Thrissur-Palakkad highway and is accident prone. In the event of accidents, traffic blocks occur on the stretch. Serpentine queues of vehicles will form on both sides. In 2010 Though the Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery six-lane work started in 2010, the tunnel work started only in 2016. The work was delayed for many reasons in various stages. Pragathi Engineering and Rail Project, the subcontractor which completed a major part of the tunnel, withdrew alleging that it was not paid by the main contractor. The High Court intervened in the project many times. The tunnel will reduce the running time from Coimbatore to Kochi considerably. Earlier, various departments, including the Fire and Rescue Services, finished fitness tests. Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas, who visited the tunnel many times, had announced that the tunnel would be opened in August. The contract company too announced the completion of the work and the final permission was expected from the Union Ministry next week. However, Mr. Gadkari directed the National Highways Authority of India to open the tunnel from Palakkad towards Thrissur on Saturday evening. A formal inaugural ceremony will be held after finishing both the tunnels. Toll collection will be started only after completing the second tunnel. Around 70 % of the second tunnel has been completed. Govt. monitoring The State Government will ensure constant follow-up and monitoring to ensure the timely opening of the second tunnel at Kuthiran, Mr. Riyas said. Addressing a joint press conference in the capital with Revenue Minister K.Rajan, who is also the local MLA, he said the opening of the first tunnel became a reality due to regular monitoring from the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kuthiran-tunnel-opened-for-traffic/article35660657.ece

01 August 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anjanadri is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, assert scholars||The Anjanadri located in the Seshachala Range is the birthplace of Sri Anjaneya Swamy and it is proven from many evidence from puranas, shastras and epigraphy, asserted scholars. The observations were made during a two-day international webinar on the ‘Anjanadri Tirumala-Anjaneya Birthplace’ organised by the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Higher Vedic Studies and the National Sanskrit University that concluded here on Saturday. Many seers, scholars and experts, who participated in this webinar, affirmed that the Anjanadri in Tirumala is the birthplace of Anjaneya Swamy. Acharya Chakravarti Ranganathan of the National Sanskrit University said the Vaishnava literature of Alwar Pasuras clearly indicated that the Anjanadri in Tirumala was the birthplace of Anjaneya Swami, adding that a stone inscription at Sri Ranganatha Swamy temple at Srirangam suggested the same. Acharya Sri Rani Sadasiva Murthy of the National Sanskrit University said Anjanadri was quoted extensively in Padma, Skanda and Brahmananda puranas. He also made a presentation on the scientific and geographic route taken by Lord Rama from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka.

Dharma Reddy said that he believed the whole idea of declaring the Anjanadri as the birthplace of Sri Anjaneya Swamy emerged only by the wish of Lord Venkateswara Swamy. “As soon as Ayodhya was declared as the birthplace of Lord Rama, TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy received many e-mails and WhatsApp messages from pilgrims across the country that the TTD must put efforts to declare the birthplace of Anjaneya Swamy. A Pundit Parishad was set up with scholars under the guidance of Muralidhara Sharma, the V-C of National Sanskrit University for the purpose,” he said. “After four months of research, we have brought out a synopsis with all evidence from epigraphy, puranas, geology and declared the Anjanadri as the birthplace of Lord Anjaneya on April 21 this year. We have also invited people with reservations and requested them to produce evidence to prove their point. So far, none who contradicted with our statement could prove their point. We will bring out a book on the issue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anjanadri-is-the-birthplace-of-lord-hanuman-assert-scholars/article35660695.ece

01 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu slams government for ‘foisting’ cases against Uma||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday slammed the YSRCP government for “foisting cases” against party leader Devineni Umamaheswara Rao and others, instead of initiating stringent action against those involved in illegal mining in the Kondapalli reserve forest area in G. Konduru mandal of Krishna district. Mr. Naidu was addressing the media after calling on the family members of Mr. Umamaheswara Rao at Gollapudi and assuring them of the party’s full support. ‘Misuse of SC, ST Act’ Mr. Naidu wondered how could the police book a case under the SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the TDP leader who was addressing a press conference at the mining site and who later remained in his vehicle for over nine hours following an attack on it by the “anti-social elements.” The TDP president said it was atrocious on the part of the YSRCP “to first engineer an attack on the former Minister and then get cases registered against him by the police.” The government, with the support of the police, was resorting to gross misuse of the Act to victimise the TDP leaders, he alleged. “The mining mafia is out to loot the forest wealth in the Kondapalli region by felling trees used by the local toy-makers,” he alleged. Demanding constitution of a committee comprising senior officers to check the mining mafia, Mr. Naidu warned of approaching the National Green Tribunal and the court of law if the demand was not met. “We will not remain silent to the indiscriminate loot of public wealth. Senior police officers are dancing to the Chief Minister’s tune, and they would have to face the consequences of their misdeeds eventually,” Mr. Naidu said. “The NGT has confirmed illegal mining in the Visakha Agency and ordered a high-level probe,” Mr. Naidu said, and termed the YSRCP rule as “a dark chapter in the democratic history of Andhra Pradesh.” “There is no security for the Dalits in the State,” Mr. Naidu alleged, and cited the case of Sudhakar, a doctor, who was “humiliated, arrested, suspended and deprived of his salary and harassed till his death.” Mr. Naidu also questioned the motive behind the sudden replacement of the Superintendent of Rajahmundry prison after Mr. Umamaheswara Rao was shifted there. Alleging that the rural areas of Krishna district were gradually turning into breeding grounds for rowdy elements, Mr. Naidu asked the people to “stay bold and fight back.” Dalits protest Representatives of the local Dalit organisations, meanwhile, protested against the TDP and raised slogans against Mr. Naidu. Alleging that Mr. Umamaheswara Rao and other TDP leaders were subjecting them to abuse and threats, they said, instead of correcting them, it was unfortunate that Mr. Naidu was supporting his party leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-slams-government-for-foisting-cases-against-uma/article35661375.ece
01 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Venkaiah calls for people’s movement to protect Telugu||Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed the need for a people’s movement to protect and propagate Telugu. “The governments are also obliged to promote the language to the extent possible. It has to be a joint effort by all the stakeholders to pass the language on to posterity,” Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said while addressing a virtual meeting on the promotion of Telugu language organised by ‘Telugu Kootami’ and ‘Veedhi Arugu’, the platforms striving for the cause, on Saturday. Pointing to the manner in which countries such as Germany, Russia, China, Australia, Canada and Portugal kept foreign languages at bay without despising them, he said such an approach was worth emulating. Mr. Venkaiah Naidu further said that he had been a strong advocate of the delivery of primary education in a child’s mother tongue, while using the native languages widely in the government’s administration, court proceedings and judgments, and imparting technical and higher education. “Conversing in the mother tongue within the families will foster love for the respective languages,” he added. Languages would otherwise slowly wane from the spoken as well as literary realms, he said, drawing the attention of the participants to the UNESCO’s observation that the extinction of a language would adversely impact the cultural heritage and diversity. Mr. Venkaiah Naidu lauded the recent initiative of Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana in allowing a woman involved in a marital dispute to voice her concerns in Telugu during a hearing on the matter in the Supreme Court when she had expressed her difficulty to fluently speak in English. Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said some countries went to the extent of communicating R&D activities in their native languages. Retired IPS officer C. Anjaneya Reddy called for efforts to standardise usage of Telugu. He said a Department of Classical Languages should be set up in Central Universities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/venkaiah-calls-for-peoples-movement-to-protect-telugu/article35661368.ece
01 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Online legal case management system will reduce litigation load’||The government will soon operationalise the A.P. Online Legal Case Management System (APOLCMS) that helps in effective implementation of the State Litigation Policy (SLP) by providing a mechanism for monitoring and sensitising the government on important cases, and thereby avoiding delays, according to Chief Secretary Adityanath Das. Addressing a meeting convened by Secretary (Legal and Legislative Affairs & Justice) V. Sunitha on the SLP at the Secretariat on Saturday, Mr. Adityanath Das said the policy would facilitate a coordinated conduct of litigation in a time-bound manner. It would reduce the overall government litigation load in courts, thus providing the much-needed relief to the judiciary. The policy, he asserted, would strengthen the State prosecution service at different levels. Comprehensive database The APOLCMS would create a comprehensive database of cases at all the three levels – District Court, High Court and Supreme Court, he added. Advocate-General S. Sriram said APOLCMS would pave the way for increasing the effectiveness of government pleadings in courts and timely compliance with court orders, or the procedures to be followed in specific instances. He said emphasis was being laid on the law officers’ preparedness in various matters, timely filing of counter affidavits and the response time of departments concerned to achieve better outcomes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/online-legal-case-management-system-will-reduce-litigation-load/article35661370.ece

Addressing the media at the party central office at Tadepalli, the Minister further alleged that Mr. Umamaheswara Rao was involved in illegal mining at Kondapalli during the TDP term, when mining was permitted by recognising all forest lands as revenue lands. Accusing TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu of using the BCs, SCs, STs and minorities only as a vote bank, Mr. Venkataramaiah said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on the other hand, was giving a prominent role to these communities by extending them the 50% reservation system. During the TDP term, all Rajya Sabha seats had been given to the upper castes, and the BCs and other weaker sections were left in the lurch, the Minister alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/uma-involved-in-illegal-mining-during-tdp-term/article35661371.ece

01 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP, Left parties gear up to oppose new property tax regime||The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Left parties and other Opposition parties are gearing up to strongly oppose the new property tax regime in the special meet of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) council scheduled to be held on August 7. The Opposition parties allege that the State government is not bothered about opinion of people on the issue and is ready to go ahead with the decision. Secretary of CPI (M) Greater Visakha City Committee and Corporator of Ward 78, B. Ganga Rao, alleged that the State government is planning to implement the new property tax regime from the coming months ignoring the suggestions/ opinions of the citizens. He alleged that in the special meet the YSR Congress Party is planing to get the proposal passed with its majority. Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Ganga Rao said that the officials claim that they have received around 9,200 responses, but he questioned what about the 15,000-odd signed representations which were received, but not accounted for. He said that the corporation is not even considering the pleas of people. “If the government decides to implement the taxes, what is need of a council and corporators?” he questioned. Mr. Ganga Rao said that people should question the corporators over their stand on the new property tax regime. The CPI(M) will stage a massive protest on August 7 against the property tax, he added. TDP floor leader in the GVMC Peela Srinivasa Rao said that the party will continue to oppose the new tax proposal to levy taxes based on capital value instead of the annual rental value. If the charges are levied as per capital value, the property tax of a land/place or a house increases every time the registration charges increase, he said. Even during the recent council meet, the YSCRP corporators have favoured levying of user charges for garbage collection with their bench strength. Now, they should think about people who have voted for them, he said. “Instead of planning for new tax regimes, the government should focus on the steps to be taken for the possible COVID-19 third wave and stop burdening people,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said adding that the TDP leaders will not let the council pass the proposal. Meanwhile, the resident/apartment and colony welfare associations from the city are planning to stage protests ahead of the meet||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-left-parties-gear-up-to-oppose-new-property-tax-regime/article35661407.ece

01 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Shopkeepers oppose levy of user charges for garbage collection||Even as the State government is asking the corporations to speed up the collection of user charges, owners of various commercial establishments, small-scale businessmen and shopkeepers from the city have been strongly opposing the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation’s (GVMC) decision to levy user charges for garbage collection. They question the decision to levy additional taxes when almost all businesses are hit due to the COVID-19. According to members of the hoteliers association, after the second wave almost 30% of hotels have been closed down due to financial crunch. Another 10% of owners are ready to sell the ownership, but none are coming forward to buy due to fear of third wave and imposing of further restrictions. Most of the owners are financially hit and unable to pay salaries to the workers. They criticise the GVMC for deciding to levy Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,500 per month as garbage collection charges based on the size of hotels and restaurants. “Hotel industry is one of the sectors which are badly hit due to the COVID-19. During the first wave, the government had provided several concessions. But now, the situation is worse. Almost 90% hotels are medium-sized. The government should help us by waiving of taxes this year, but not by levying additional taxes,” said A. Venkata Ramana Murthy, a resident of MVP Colony and the president of the A.P. Hotels Association. The commercial establishment owners said that the government is already proposing to increase property tax and now imposing a special tax to collect garbage and penalties on late payment is not justified. S. Venkatesh, who runs a fast-food centre at Jagadamba Junction, said that already a number of people had stopped coming to fast-food centres due to fear of overcrowding and collecting charges during such a scenario is very unfortunate. “Now we need to payRs. 300 for the fast-food centre and again Rs. 120 for our house,” he said. Several shopkeepers and establishment owners said that the GVMC should have consulted various associations before revising charges. Sri Ram, who runs a meat shop in the city, said that due to restrictions in timings and ban on sale of meat in the weekends for the past two months, the business has been hit. “The situation is only improving now. I was learnt that, I should pay Rs. 700 per month as charges from the next month. Collecting some charge is fine, but Rs. 700 is very high,” he said. “The user charges for fast-food centres, juice shops, bakeries, food points and all other small-scale business should be fixed at Rs. 50, said Sashi, who runs a curry point as well as fast-food centre at MVP Colony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shopkeepers-oppose-levy-of-user-charges-for-garbage-collection/article35661397.ece

01 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||NGRI studying earth’s magnetic fields||Do you know that the earth’s magnetic compass keeps changing? Or, that it takes up to 48 hours for the solar storms to hit the earth despite travelling thousands of kilometre a second and potentially disturb the telecommunication systems? Changes in the geomagnetic fields could affect the GPS systems too based on which the modern travel is dependent on. These fascinating observations as also the underground plate movements along with quakes are taken note of on a continuous basis in the 100 acres verdant off-site campus of CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) where Director General Dr. Shekhar C. Mande inaugurated several new facilities at the Intermagnet Geomagnetic Observatory at Choutuppal, 65 km away from the twin cities. A ‘Component Fluxgate Magnetometer’ and ‘Overhauser total field magnetometer’ to continuously measures the earth's magnetic field at an interval of one second and send the data to ‘Intermagnet’ - the global data repository of geomagnetic observatories, were among those unveiled. CSIR-NGRI director V.M. Tiwari and his senior colleagues Dr. D. Srinagesh, Dr. Kusumita Arora and others explained that this is the only facility of its kind in the country delivering one sec data. The ‘Declination inclination magnetometer’ meant for manual absolute measurements of geomagnetic field, twice a week, was also showcased during the visit. The scientists informed that geomagnetic poles change has been up to 10 degree in Hyderabad alone in the last 50 years so much so that the very directions on which several plans are made will change over a period of time. This facility away from ‘anthropogenic’ influences like any environmental pollution and pollutants originating due to human activity and other disturbances is able to measure the minutest of changes down from places as far as the Pulichitala project. Apparently, a major tectonic activity will bring about a change, however, slight in the earth’s rotational movement. Sudden water surge in filling of heavy dams could also result in this and the observatory data is an effort to understand if the quakes can be co-related with magnetic fields.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ngri-studying-earths-magnetic-fields/article35661205.ece
01 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Officials worry as more people let guard down||After the devastating second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, social media platforms were awash with precautionary notes about preventing further outbreaks. And there is a good chance that you came across this message: ‘The first time, it is a mistake. The second time, it is a choice. The third time, it is a decision’. Going by the concerns of Health officials over people’s casual attitude with regard to safety norms, it just might be a matter of time before teh situation spirals out of control again. Large scale gatherings are back with people visiting family members and friends, and even taking part in festive celebrations. More alarming is the fact that even COVID-positive persons are ignoring isolation norms and stepping out of their homes, as revealed by Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao. Besides indicating recklessness of a few people, the senior official stressed on the importance of masking up to stay safe. He also said that, in future, only those who are vaccinated might be allowed into hotels and shopping malls. However, this is not the first time the issue has come into focus. During the peak of the second wave, there were reports of COVID-19 patients stepping out themselves to get medicines and visiting hospitals when their entire family was infected and there was no one to arrange medical help and run errands. Hospital managements had also pointed out this very issue. On the other hand, political parties have resumed gatherings. Cutting across party lines, political leaders holding public events where several are seen without masks. If an infected person ignores precautions such as wearing mask, and participates in any indoor or outdoor gathering, it opens up the possibility of clustering of COVID-19 cases. Apart from masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing, senior officials from the Health department have advised vaccination to protect oneself from severity of infection, should one contract COVID. Dr Srinivasa Rao said those who have not been infected so far and the unvaccinated population are more susceptible. Delta Plus variants Two Delta Plus variants of coronavirus had been detected in the State, both from Hyderabad, in mid-May, said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao. Samples collected from government and private hospitals are sent to Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology for genome sequencing to know if any new variants of the virus are prevalent in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/officials-worry-as-more-people-let-guard-down/article35661164.ece
01 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Closure of courses to hit girls from marginalised sections||Success or failure of the month-long agitation by students and alumni of the Kamala Nehru Polytechnic College for Women against the closure of certain courses could determine the fate of the aspirations of countless girl students from poor and marginalised backgrounds across the State. It could also determine the future character of the grand old institution set up in 1961 as India’s first women’s polytechnic, and Asia’s third. The institution that has churned out thousands of skilled women professionals over the last 60 years is gasping for lack of government aid, due to which the Exhibition Society running it has decided to convert the courses into self-finance. Four streams, including Civil Engineering, Electronics and Communications, Chemical and Material Engineering, and Commercial and Computer Practice shall be converted into self-finance mode, while four more, including Hotel Management and Catering Technology, Diploma in Garment Technology, Pharmacy and Architecture, will be closed altogether. The decision has drawn consternation from the student community and alumni too, who have begun to protest against it as a measure which would affect girl students from marginalised backgrounds. Support came in from noted social activists and groups too. “If not for these courses in an all-women college, several girls would be married off after their high school by the parents,” says Varsha Bhargavi, a social activist from the Telangana Women and Transgender Joint Action Committee. Renowned social worker and founder of the MV Foundation Shanta Sinha echoed the sentiments, when she said closure of the college in the present situation spawned by COVID-19 pandemic will result in early marriage and violence for scores of girls. “A fourth of these students are first generation learners from poor and marginalised backgrounds. What is the point of all the big talk about skill development, Make in India, and Beti Padhao when you are depriving women of the courses that will give them employment and security?” Ms. Sinha questions. Of the combined annual intake of 1180 polytechnic students across the state, 450 are accommodated in the Kamala Nehru College alone. “Several of us are poor with parents who cannot afford higher education for children. Closure of the courses will also jeopardise our careers as we cannot apply for the regular graduation courses,” says Gali Anusha, a protesting student from Garment Technology. Exhibition Society which runs 18 more institutions apart from the college, blames the government. For the 56 posts of aided teaching staff in the college, only nine remain now, and the government has now scrapped 39 contract lecturer posts too. “Due to pandemic, industrial exhibition could not be held this year, resulting in drastic reduction of revenue. We have to run the show with mere Rs. 4 lakh per annum, which is highly impossible if government does not chip in,” said Gangadhar Rao, Director of the Society. Sixteen pleas to the government and two to the Education Minister Sabitha Indra Reddy had yielded no result, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/closure-of-courses-to-hit-girls-from-marginalised-sections/article35661179.ece

Acting upon reliable information, a team led by District Forest Officer (Vigilance) M. Raja Ramana Reddy nabbed Shiv Balak and Rahul Kashyap, both hailing from Lucknow, and recovered 330 live turtles from them, which belong to species Assam Roofed Turtles also known as Sylhet Roofed Turtle and Indian Tent Turtle, which fall under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Act. On further enquiry, it came out that the turtles were collected from Gomti river in Uttar Pradesh by their accomplices who transferred them to Hyderabad by train for sale to prospective buyers. The accused are involved in such activities regularly, and on several earlier occasions, sold the turtles at the rate of Rs. 400 per pair. Aquarium or pet shop owners who buy these turtles were unaware of their conservation status, and assume that they are the exotic varieties such as Singapore Turtles or Green Turtles.

He said representations should be given to all the TRS MLAs for immediate implementation of the scheme in all the constituencies and not just Huzurabad that is going for by-polls. He said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was not sincere in his approach and wants to deceive Dalits yet again after making tall promises to them before the elections like the first Dalit Chief Minister and three acres to every Dalit family. Mr. Reddy demanded the CM to convene the Assembly on the Dalit Bandhu issue where the Opposition would propose a unanimous resolution for implementation of the scheme. “KCR should not worry about the finances. Funds can be generated. If there is a need, Pragati Bhavan and Secretariat can be auctioned,” he remarked. He also accused KCR of snatching away land given by the previous Congress governments to the Dalits and Girijans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-pitches-for-dalit-bandhu-in-all-constituencies/article35661196.ece

Amarnath Goud of the Telangana High Court had awarded six-month simple imprisonment to two IAS officers, two IFS officers and two other officers in a contempt of court case. Fine of Rs. 2,000 each The judge held them guilty of not complying with the order of the High Court passed in 2009. The judge also imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000 each on the officials. The officers who were awarded jail term and fine included D. Amoy Kumar IAS (Ranga Reddy Collector), A Santha Kumari IAS (Special Chief Secretary of Environmental Forest Sciences and Technology), R. Shobha IFS (Principal Chief Conservator of Forests), Sunitha M. Bhagwat IFS (Principal Chief Conservator of Forests), Janaki Ram (Divisional Forest Officer) and S. Tirupathi Rao (Additional Collector and Forest Settlement Officer). Mohammed Sirajuddin and nine others filed the contempt of court petition in the year 2015 alleging that the officials failed to implement the High Court orders with regard to 383 acres of land in Maheshwaram village and mandal of Ranga Reddy district. The dispute over rights of the said lands (survey numbers 221/1 to 222/20) started in 2008 when the Forest authorities initiated action under Andhra Pradesh Forest Act-1967 to declare the lands as Reserve Forest. The next year, the petitioners moved the High Court by filing a writ petition and challenged the decision of the Forest authorities. The High Court disposed of the petition and directed the authorities to finalise within six months the issue relating to the acquisition of lands for conversion into Reserve Forest. With the authorities not complying with the High Court order, the petitioners filed the contempt of court case in 2015. During the arguments, the petitioners’ counsel contended that Maheshwaram Mandal Revenue Officer (MRO) in year 2000 sent a report to the Collector clarifying that the lands were patta lands. He told the court that authorities moved a proposal to allot 380 acres of land to the petitioners under land bank of Ranga Reddy district as acquiring their lands would require payment of huge compensation to the land owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-awards-six-month-jail-to-6-top-officials-for-contempt-of-court/article35661191.ece

01 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GST-paying educational institutions covered by consumer laws||A district consumer commission disagreed with FITJEE’s contention of being an education institution, and not coming under the purview of consumer protection laws, even as it stated that since the company pays Goods and Services Tax, it brings it under the Consumer Protection Act. It ordered the company to refund course fee, and pay compensation of Rs. 50,000. The District Consumer Commission – II, Hyderabad, was dealing with a complaint filed by Seelam Srinivas. The opposite parties were FITJEE Limited in Saifabad, and FITJEE Limited, FITJEE House, in New Delhi. The complainant stated that his son was enrolled in the opposite parties’ Pinnacle Two Year Integrated Classroom Coaching Programme, and fee in instalments was paid through post-dated cheques. Soon after classes began on June 6, 2019, his son expressed dissatisfaction with teaching and claimed there was a lack of support from faculty. One June 22, the complainant informed the opposite party of his intention to withdraw his son. He also sought a refund, which was refused. For their part, the opposite party contended that the apex court and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held that since education is not a commodity, educational institutions do not provide any kind of service. As such, there cannot be question of deficiency in service.  In connection with the opposite party’s contention of education institutions not being service providers, the commission stated that in a letter to the complainant, the opposite party had mentioned course fee details, and the collection of GST of 18% on the course fee. This, the commission held, ‘implies that the opposite party is not exempted from payment of service tax. “Accordingly the opposite party does not fall in the negative list of Sec 66-D of the Finance Act 1994, and opposite party does not fit into the definition of educational institution as per the finance act. Since under the exemption clause, the educational institutions are exempt from paying GST as applicable by law,” it stated. “This act of collecting full course fee in advance certainly amounts to unfair trade practice which has to be curtailed,” the bench held. The bench directed the opposite party to refund Rs. 4,35,458, after retaining Rs. 10,000 as administration charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gst-paying-educational-institutions-covered-by-consumer-laws/article35661419.ece

Several villages, including Banigallapadu and Jamalapuram, in Yerrupalem mandal and a few other villages in the border mandals of Kallur and Madhira have been identified as potential high-risk areas for ramping up the vaccination drive to rein in the sporadic cases of COVID-19, sources said. High infection rate As many as 156 persons tested positive for COVID-19 at the designated testing centres in the district on Friday, added sources. Around 200 persons in the district had been diagnosed with the infection on Thursday. However, sources in the health department maintained that the COVID-19 daily count significantly dropped from around 300 in the first week of this month to around 156 cases on Friday. Vaccination drive Nearly 4,423 beneficiaries were administered the vaccine at 39 Government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres in the district on Friday. In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, the COVID positivity rate remained below 1%. The supply of vaccine vials has improved in the last couple of days when compared to a fortnight ago, said a staff member at the Primary Health Centre at Sulanagar in Tekulapally mandal. Misgivings among tribals “Misconceptions about vaccine continue to prevail among a section of people living in remote tribal pockets,” Sailu, a farmer from Mutyalampadu village, pointed out, suggesting that an intensive awareness campaign coupled with adequate allocation of vaccine vials to the tribal mandals was the need of the hour to prevent the possible third wave of pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/third-wave-fear-triggers-surge-in-vaccine-demand/article35661171.ece

Uttam Kumar Reddy on Saturday said Telangana was the only State in the country that was not implementing any crop insurance scheme. “Farmers are just abandoned when heavy rains or calamities are witnessed. It is an unfortunate situation in Telangana,” he said, adding that Congress governments in undivided Andhra Pradesh were effective in implementing them. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy reviewed implementation of various schemes and pending issues in Nalgonda town, at the mandal parishad general body meeting. Along with Teachers’ MLC (Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam) A. Narsi Reddy, he addressed concerns raised by local leaders. The leaders said education of children had suffered due to COVID-19 lockdowns and availing online education through smart devices and internet was beyond the reach of many poor families. Mr. Narsi Reddy and Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy observed that the government must accelerate vaccination or establish required infrastructure to resume school and learning activities. The MP took objection to the reportedly slow pace of vaccination in Nalgonda mandal.

01 August 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Public involvement key to preventing third wave: DMHO||COVID-19 incidence in Nalgonda district, which was one of the highest in the State during the second wave with infection rates hovering around 30% before implementation of lockdown and nearly half after that, has reduced to below 3% of late. However, people’s response and preparation against the attack, in the possible event of a third wave, appear casual, say officials and observers. Even though many lives were lost, going easy on masks and distancing shows people are not serious, says Waseem, a shopkeeper in the usually bustling Prakasam Bazaar. He calls it “living with short-term memory”. According to Jayaprakash Reddy, a popular general physician and IMA leader in the town, the younger population is more reckless in not wearing masks. He observes the violation to be about 40%. A COVID-19 survivor himself, he says public gatherings, whether political or religious, should be checked as a preparatory measure to tackle a possible third wave. “The Election Commission must ban all gatherings for election-related purposes. Leaders could go house-to-house, booth-wise and distribute pamphlets,” he says. Nalgonda has been seeing more cases in towns, say health officials. “Government measures and public advisory are a continuous process, but public involvement remains key. More people are coming forward without hesitation for vaccination now. However, the target achieved is a little more than one-third. Masking and social distancing are still the preventive medicine; people shouldn’t be negligent,” says District Medical & Health Officer A. Kondal Rao. There are 43 vaccination centres in the district and on an average, about 5,000 persons are inoculated daily. As of the current week, four lakh of the target 12 lakh population have been vaccinated. There is no shortage of vaccine in the district, and about 10,000 to 12,000 vials of Covishield are received every alternate day, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/public-involvement-key-to-preventing-third-wave-dmho/article35661163.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao, who is going to visit Nagarjunasagar constituency on Monday, should come out clearly on funds for pending projects and the timeline for its completion on war-foot basis,” he said, addressing the media at the party office. Mr. Ranga Reddy and the CPI (M) leaders, who have been persistent of the project demands, through protests and periodic letters to Mr. Rao, reiterated that the pending projects if completed would irrigate six lakh acres in the district. He reminded that Nalgonda was declared drought-affected in the Drought Prone Area Development Programme’s reports several times. And abundance of fluoride content in the ground had also crippled sections of population with fluorosis. However, he said, the State and the Centre have failed in providing quality irrigation and drinking needs. “SLBC tunnel project, Udayasamudram LI, Nakkalagandi LI, AMRP Canal, increasing the capacity of Musi project, modernisation of Nagarjunasgar Project and funds for maintenance of all LI schemes in the district have remained mere poll promises,” Mr. Ranga Reddy said.

He said 74 lakh people, almost 50% of the 18+ population of the city, had been vaccinated with at least one dose. Similarly, 26 lakh people had received both their doses since the start of the vaccination drive, he added. Mr. Kejriwal also stressed the fact that Delhi had the capacity to administer three lakh doses a day but was unable to do so because of a lack of vaccine stock. “Delhi’s vaccination programme has achieved an important milestone. Today, we have reached the 1 crore mark. Among this, a total of about 74 lakh people have been vaccinated, of which 26 lakh people have received both doses. Roughly, 2 crore people live in Delhi, of which 1.5 crores are 18+ and thus eligible for getting the vaccine. So, about 50% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine,” he told at a digital briefing. He thanked the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and all officials involved in Delhi’s vaccination drive for their putting in their best throughout day and night. On the other hand, the people of Delhi were “very enthusiastic” about getting vaccinated, he added. “I am extremely thankful towards them for the dedication they have shown for this cause,” he said. “We are unable to scale up the programme due to a lack of vaccines. At present, we administer 50,000 to 70,000 each day. If we can get sufficient stocks, we possess the infrastructure to administer 3 lakh doses daily. We are in touch with the Central government and hope to soon start receiving adequate stocks,” he added. Challenges ahead While the government was vaccinating as many people as it could depending on the availability of doses there were two challenges ahead: to vaccinate those who have not received a single dose and secondly, to vaccinate those who have received only one shot, he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/over-1-crore-doses-of-vaccine-administered-in-city-kejriwal/article35661067.ece

01 August 2021||Pune/Mumbai,||Ex-minister Ganpatrao Deshmukh dead||Ganpatrao Deshmukh, the longest-serving MLA of Maharashtra and a senior leader of the Peasants and Workers Party, died in a private hospital in Solapur on Friday, evening, family sources said. Deshmukh (94), a former State minister, was hospitalised for the last 15 days and died due to old age-related ailments. He was being treated for stones in the gall bladder and recently underwent a surgery. He represented Sangola in Solapur district in the Assembly for 11 terms since 1962 and served as an MLA for 54 years. He was defeated in 1972, but won a bypoll in 1974. In 1995, he lost by a slender margin of 192 votes, said his grandson Aniket Deshmukh. He had won the Sangola seat in the 2014 State elections for a record 11th time and served in the Assembly till 2019. Deshmukh served as a minister in the government of Sharad Pawar in 1978 and again in 1999 (in Vilasrao Deshmukh’s Cabinet) when his party gave support to the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari condoled the death and paid rich tributes to him. “Deshmukh carved out a niche for himself in public life. He not only represented his constituency for the longest period in the State Assembly and consistently, but he will be remembered for his simple living and high intellect,” Mr. Thackeray said. His last rites will be performed in Sangola.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ex-minister-ganpatrao-deshmukh-dead/article35661268.ece

01 August 2021||Herat,||Taliban clash with Afghan forces in Herat||Afghan and Taliban forces clashed again on the outskirts of Herat on Saturday, a day after a police guard was killed when a United Nations compound in the western city came under attack. Violence has surged across the country since early May, when the militants launched a sweeping offensive as U.S.-led foreign forces began a final withdrawal that is now almost complete. The Taliban have seized scores of districts across Afghanistan, including in Herat province, where the group has also captured two border crossings adjoining Iran and Turkmenistan. Hundreds flee fighting Officials and residents reported renewed fighting on the outskirts of Herat on Saturday, with hundreds fleeing their homes to seek shelter closer to the heart of the city. Herat Governor Abdul Saboor Qani said most of the fighting was in Injil and Guzara district — where the airport is located. “At the moment the fighting is ongoing in the south and southeast. We are moving cautiously and to avoid civilian casualties,” he said. Government forces also called an air strike near a 10-bed hospital in Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand province, that officials said had been seized earlier by the Taliban to treat its wounded fighters. Residents said that Taliban fighters took over the Ariana Afghan Speciality Hospital to treat those hurt. “This morning, the Taliban fighters came and forced the hospital staff to leave,” said Agha Mohammad. “Planes were hovering in the air at that time, and they were following the Taliban, and the air strike happened.” Sher Ali Shakir, provincial public health director of Helmand, said the hospital was destroyed, one person killed, and two wounded. During fighting on Friday, the main Herat compound of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan came under attack from rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire that the UN blamed on anti-government elements. The militants say they will not target foreign diplomats, but have blatantly violated international protocol before. Afghan forces and militiamen of veteran warlord and anti-Taliban commander Ismail Khan have been deployed around the city of 6,00,000 in recent days. Mr. Khan, who previously fought the Soviet occupation forces in the 1980s and then the Taliban during their hardline regime in the 1990s, has vowed to fight the insurgents again to counter their staggering advances in recent months. Flood rescue hit Fighting was also hampering rescue efforts after severe flooding in Nuristan this week killed at least 113 people, with over 100 more missing. “Unfortunately the area is under the control of the Taliban, we were unable to send our provincial teams to the area,” said Tamim Azimi, spokesman for Afghanistan’s state Ministry for Disaster Management. “But we have sent the (local) rescue teams along with the Afghan Red Crescent,” he said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-clash-with-afghan-forces-in-herat/article35660573.ece
01 August 2021||Beijing,||WHO sounds alarm over Delta variant surge||Mushrooming outbreaks of the Delta variant prompted China and Australia to impose stricter COVID-19 curbs on Saturday, as the WHO urged the world to contain the mutation before it turns into something deadlier and draws out the pandemic. China’s most serious surge of coronavirus infections in months spread to two more areas on Saturday — Fujian province and the megacity of Chongqing — in an outbreak that now spans 14 provinces. More than 200 cases have been linked to an original Delta cluster in Nanjing city where nine cleaners at an international airport tested positive. “The main strain circulating at present is the Delta variant... which poses an even greater challenge to virus prevention and control work,” said Mi Feng, spokesman for China’s National Health Commission. The nation where the disease first emerged has rushed to prevent the highly transmissible strain from taking root by putting more than one million people under lockdown and reinstituting mass testing campaigns. Worldwide, coronavirus infections are once again on the upswing, with the World Health Organization announcing an 80% average increase over the past four weeks in five of the health agency’s six regions, a jump largely fuelled by the Delta variant. First detected in India, the strain has now reached 132 countries and territories. “Delta is a warning: it’s a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge,” the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference. Australia lockdown Both high- and low-income countries are struggling to gain the upper hand against Delta, with the vastly unequal sprint for vaccines leaving room for variants to wreak havoc and further evolve. In Australia, where only about 14% of the population is jabbed, the third-largest city of Brisbane and other parts of Queensland State entered a snap lockdown on Saturday as a cluster of the Delta variant produced six new cases. “The only way to beat the Delta strain is to move quickly, to be fast and to be strong,” Queensland’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles said while informing millions that they would be under three days of strict stay-at-home orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-sounds-alarm-over-delta-variant-surge/article35660576.ece
01 August 2021||Washington,||U.S. seizes tanker used to deliver oil to North Korea||The United States on Friday seized a Singapore-owned oil tanker that was used to make illegal oil deliveries to North Korea, the Justice Department said. A New York federal judge issued a judgment of forfeiture authorising the United States to take ownership of the M/T Courageous , which is currently in Cambodia. The ship, which has a capacity of 2,734 tons, was purchased by Singaporean national Kwek Kee Seng, who remains at large, according to a Justice Department statement. “Kwek and his co-conspirators engaged in an extensive scheme to evade... U.S. and UN sanctions by using vessels under their control to covertly transport fuel to North Korea,” the statement said. From August to December 2019, the Courageous stopped transmission of its location. Satellite imagery showed that during that time, the tanker engaged in ship-to-ship transfers of more than $1.5 million worth of oil to a North Korean ship. The Department has accused Mr. Kwek of trying to hide the scheme by using shell companies, lying to international shipping authorities and falsely identifying the Courageous to avoid detection. Mr. Kwek has been charged with conspiracy to evade economic sanctions on North Korea and money laundering conspiracy. Cambodian authorities seized the tanker in March 2020 on a U.S. warrant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-seizes-tanker-used-to-deliver-oil-to-north-korea/article35660583.ece
01 August 2021||Dubai,||Two killed in drone strike on oil tanker off Oman: U.S. Navy||U.S. Navy explosive experts believe a “drone strike” targeted an oil tanker that came under attack off the coast of Oman in the Arabian Sea, killing two on board, the American military said Saturday. The strike on Thursday night on the oil tankerMercer Streetmarks the first-known fatal attack after years of assaults on commercial shipping in the region linked to tensions with Iran over its tattered nuclear deal. While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Israeli officials alleged that Tehran launched the drone strike. While Iran did not directly acknowledge the attack, the strike comes as Tehran now appears poised to take an even tougher approach with the West as the country prepares to inaugurate Ebrahim Raisi, a hard-line protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as President. The American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and the guided missile destroyer USS Mitscher were escorting Mercer Street as it headed to a safe port, the U.S. Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet said in a statement on Saturday. “U.S. Navy explosives experts are aboard to ensure there is no additional danger to the crew, and are prepared to support an investigation into the attack,” the 5th Fleet said. “Initial indications clearly point to a (drone)-style attack,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/two-killed-in-drone-strike-on-oil-tanker-off-oman-us-navy/article35660574.ece
01 August 2021||New York,||UN warns hunger is expected to rise in 23 global hotspots||Hunger is expected to rise in 23 global hotspots in the next three months with the highest alerts for “catastrophic” situations in Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region, southern Madagascar, Yemen, South Sudan and northern Nigeria, two U.N. agencies warned on Friday. The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Program said in a new report on “Hunger Hotspots” between August and November that “acute food insecurity is likely to further deteriorate.” They put Ethiopia at the top of the list, saying the number of people facing starvation and death is expected to rise to 4,01,000 — the highest number since the 2011 famine in Somalia — if humanitarian aid isn’t provided quickly. In southern Madagascar, which has been hit by the worst drought in the past 40 years, pests affecting staple crops, and rising food prices — 14,000 people are expected to be pushed into “catastrophic” acute food insecurity marked by starvation and death by September. And that number is expected to double by the end of the year with 28,000 people needing urgent help, the two agencies said. “Acute hunger is increasing not only in scale but also severity,” FAO and WFP said in Friday’s report. “Overall, over 41 million people worldwide are now at risk of falling into famine or famine-like conditions, unless they receive immediate life and livelihood-saving assistance.” The two Rome-based agencies called for urgent humanitarian action to save lives in the 23 hotspots, saying help is especially critical in the five highest alert places to prevent famine and death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-warns-hunger-is-expected-to-rise-in-23-global-hotspots/article35660580.ece

01 August 2021||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong police arrest man for booing anthem||Hong Kong police have arrested a man accused of booing the Chinese national anthem while watching an Olympic event at a mall. The 40-year-old man was allegedly waving colonial-era Hong Kong flags and booing, while urging others to join him in insulting the national anthem, according to a police statement posted on Facebook. Hong Kong passed a law in June last year that criminalized any actions that insult the national anthem. Violating the law can mean a fine of up to $6,400, and up to nine years in prison. China’s central government criminalised actions that insult the national flag and emblem in amendments to the law last October, which is also applicable to Hong Kong. The suspect was standing in a crowd with others on Friday to watch Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung in a match that would win him gold, local media reported. The booing started at the medal ceremony, when the national anthem began playing. Police said there may be additional arrests and that an active investigation is underway. Hong Kong was rocked by months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in 2019, which led Beijing to crack down on dissent, including arresting leading pro-democracy activists in the city. Hong Kong is a former British colony that was handed back to China in 1997. The city was a bastion of free speech inside authoritarian China and democracy protests bubbled for years until they exploded in a huge popular street movement two years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-police-arrest-man-for-booing-anthem/article35660577.ece

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||SEBI urges peers to rethink bond market curbs||Calling for freer flow of funds from provident and pension funds, insurance firms and banks into corporate and infrastructure debt, capital markets regulator SEBI has urged the RBI, IRDAI and PFRDA to ease investment curbs to make the bond market a more functional source of finance for industry and infrastructure projects. With banks struggling to provide long-term capital, two members of the Securities Exchange Board of India have over the past week, sought an urgent rethink on the investment norms specified by its financial sector regulator peers for participation in the corporate bond market. This would facilitate a quicker economic recovery, they stressed. Observing that while there were multiple players in the debt market, the number of participants in each investor class remained limited due to the current norms thereby constraining the pool of liquidity available, SEBI whole time member Ananta Barua said at a FICCI capital markets conference. Listing out instances of restrictions that limit insurers’ exposure to private debt and infrastructure financing, he indicated that the recent permission for pension funds to invest up to 5% of their corpus in Infrastructure investment trusts (INVITs) was unlikely to work. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)’s nod, Mr. Barua said, was linked to the INVIT having a minimum ‘AA’ or equivalent credit rating for the sponsor as well as requiring a rating from two rating agencies. “It has to be understood that INVITs’ ratings and the ability to service debt is based on cash flows of the project, and has nothing to do with the sponsor,” he said, adding that infrastructure projects were usually rated ‘BB’ or lower in the initial stages. The RBI’s partial credit guarantee enhancement norms to help such projects get a better rating faces practical challenges, while the Centre’s plan to set up a Credit Enhancement Guarantee Corporation, announced in the Union Budget 2019, is yet to take off. The central bank’s partial credit guarantee norms cap the extent to which a bank can provide credit enhancement to 20% of the issue size. “This means it would need at least three banks to get 50% credit enhancement (needed to move from, say, a ‘BBB’ rating to ‘AA+’ needed by insurers and PFs) and it has been difficult to get three banks to provide for a single project,” said Mr. Barua. “Hence, there may be a need to revisit this cap,” he added. ‘Overreliance on banks’ Speaking at another meet on financing, SEBI’s G. Mahalingam warned that relying on banks as an exclusive funding source would not be positive for the economy and more steps were needed from other regulators to develop the bond market. “I would still say that pension funds and insurance companies have to be a bit more forthcoming. There are areas where other regulators will also have to take a more proactive role,” he said, calling for ‘a huge change in mindset that limits’ corporate bond exposures for regulated entities. “In the RBI’s Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), corporate bonds are never accepted as collateral. It’s not legally enabled, but that is not a big problem; you have to take it to the government, come up with a good rationale and it could be done. Today, it is not accepted as part of the LAF and not even enshrined in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR),” he said. “At least you can start off in the top-rated bonds as far as the SLR facility is concerned,” he suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-urges-peers-to-rethink-bond-market-curbs/article35660702.ece
01 August 2021||Bengaluru,||IT offshoring rises as large, multi-year deals spur trend||The proportion of work done offshore has risen for Indian software companies over the past year, spurred by large transformation contracts and multi-year deals that allow more of software services to be executed at locations far removed from client premises. Domestic technology services providers of all sizes — large firms such as Infosys, and Wipro, and mid-tier ones including Mindtree and L&T Infotech — have witnessed the trend. In the quarter ended June 2021, Infosys reported an offshore ratio of 75.9% as against 72% a year earlier. Wipro said its offshore contribution was 54% in the June quarter as against 50% in the corresponding, year-earlier period. Consequently, the quarter saw its onsite ratio declining to 46% from 50% a year earlier. The quarter ended March saw the offshore figure at 54.5% Analysts said most domestic technology services firms now have a higher offshore ratio and have benefited from the pandemic-triggered rise in offshoring in the last four quarters. ‘Clear shift’ “Higher offshoring has been clearly helping tech firms in expanding profitability,” said an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services. “The offshore business operates at higher gross margins and as the mix shifts towards offshoring, it supports [higher] margins,” the analyst added. Confirming a clear shift towards offshoring, Dayapatra Nevatia, executive director and chief operating officer, Mindtree, said work done offshore by the firm had increased by more than 300 basis points in the last one year. “This is because of our growing focus on large transformational programmes as well as multi-year deals, which allow more work to be done offshore,” he said. “The trend has been further aided by greater openness to strategic IT partnerships, specifically in Europe, along with remote and distributed work models,” he added. Sanjay Jalona, CEO & MD, L&T Infotech (LTI), said the pandemic had expanded the perimeter of what could be done remotely. “At 17%, LTI has one of the lowest onsite ratios, and even as we create jobs globally, we expect this trend to continue,” he said. “The resilient tech industry has proved that it is possible to strategise, execute and deliver efficiently through this model,” Mr. Jalona added. However, other industry sources preferred to wait before terming this a trend. How the momentum for remote working pans out as the pandemic ebbs and people return to offices is a key factor, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/it-offshoring-rises-as-large-multi-year-deals-spur-trend/article35660700.ece

A gold would have made the 34-year-old Fraser-Pryce the first woman in history to win three Olympic 100m titles but Thompson-Herah broke away from the World champion at the halfway mark and won comfortably in 10.61s, the second fastest time in history which broke Florence Griffith Joyner’s 33-year-old Olympic record (10.62). Fraser-Pryce (10.74) and Shericka Jackson (10.76) took silver and bronze. Meanwhile World champion USA, disqualified for a faulty exchange in the 4x400m mixed relay heats, was reinstated into the final by a jury decision on Saturday but it could only take bronze with Poland pulling off a shocking victory in 3:09.87s. Later, Sweden celebrated a wonderful day in men’s discus throw with World champion Daniel Stahl (68.90m) and Simon Pettersson (67.39) taking gold and silver. Earlier, discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur became the first Indian in athletics to enter a final in Tokyo after finishing an impressive second in the qualification round with 64m. But former Asian Games champion Seema Antil-Punia, who was competing in her fourth Olympics, failed to make the cut with just 60.57m. Seema had qualified for Tokyo with 63.72m at last month’s inter-Nationals. Only two achieved the automatic qualification standard of 64m. Kamalpreet is now only the 11th Indian ever and the second woman discus thrower to qualify for an Olympic final. The 25-year-old from Punjab, who has a personal best of 66.59m, opened her qualification series with 60.29m and then produced 63.97 and 64m, to finish behind American Valarie Allman (66.42). Long jumper M. Sreeshankar, who appeared to have lost much of his spring in the last few weeks, came up with a weak 7.69m in the qualification round and missed the final. The 22-year-old, who bettered his national record with 8.26m in March, had a disappointing series (7.69, 7.51 and 7.43) and finished 13th in his group and 25th overall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/thompson-herah-defends-100m-crown-in-style/article35660554.ece

Mohammed led from the front with an all-round performance to help iDream Tiruppur Tamizhans grab a thrilling two-run win over Lyca Kovai Kings in the Tamil Nadu Premier League here on Saturday. The Tamil Nadu all-rounder defended six of the last over to help his side to its second win with a brilliant spell of 4/31. The skipper began by removing the openers before he gave away just three runs with two wickets in the final over including that of U. Mukilesh (26), who was looking good to take Kovai Kings home. Chasing 163 for victory, Kovai Kings started off well, thanks to opener V. Ganga Sridhar Raju’s 17-ball 30 before B. Sai Sudharsan, continuing his red-hot form, stroked a brisk 51 (36b, 3x4, 2x6). Earlier, asked to bat first, Tamizhans produced a disciplined batting effort that helped it post 162/7 — its highest total of the season. The highlight of the innings was a 73-run stand for the fifth-wicket between Mohammed (33, 25b, 2x4, 2x6) and P. Francis Rokins (38, 27b, 2x4, 2x6). Opener S. Dinesh gave the innings initial momentum, making 39 (30b, 5x4, 1x6) to help his side make 46 in the PowerPlay. Kovai Kings then fought back with three wickets in quick succession as Tamizhans slumped from 65/1 to 68/4 in the tenth over. After playing cautiously till the 15th over, Mohammed slogged one over mid-wicket off Diwakar. Later, he and Francis managed to find three sixes off part-time leg-spinner Sridhar Raju.

Ganapathy and Nethra Kumanan. “We are proud to host the 12th Monsoon Regatta at Hussain Sagar and look forward to the tight competition and some great action on the water as these results will decide who represents India at the Asian Championships at Thailand,” said Lt. Gen. K.S. Rao. Eklavya Batham of Bhopal is India No. 1 and top seed and claimed the top spot at the practice race conducted on Saturday. Tough fight The two Telangana girls — India No. 1 Jhansi Priya Laveti and No. 2 Vaishnavi Veera Vamsam — are expected to be involved in tough fight in the girls category after returning from the Worlds. Ravali Parandi, also from Hyderabad and ranked No. 3 in India, is the dark horse.

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gibbs accuses BCCI of interference||Former South Africa international cricketer Herschelle Gibbs accused the Indian cricket board of trying to stop him from participating in a T20 league in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Gibbs plans to play for Overseas Warriors in the six-team Kashmir Premier League, which runs from Aug. 6-17. Tensions have been high between Pakistan and India since New Delhi unilaterally changed the semi-autonomous status of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is split between Pakistan and India but claimed by both in its entirety. Pakistan has reduced diplomatic ties with India since then, vowing there will be no peace talks with India until the 2019 move under which New Delhi divided the Indian-administered part of the Muslim-majority Kashmir into two federally governed territories — Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh — is reversed by the Indian government.  Gibbs said in a tweet on Saturday that it was “completely unnecessary” of the BCCI “to bring their political agenda with Pakistan into the equation and trying to prevent me playing in the KPL. Also threatening me saying they won’t allow me entry into India for any cricket related work. Ludicrous.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/herschelle-gibbs-accuses-bcci-of-interference/article35660709.ece
01 August 2021||Tokyo,||Vandana ’tricks as Indian women qualify||Vandana Kataria’s hat-trick inspired the Indian women to a 4-3 win over South Africa in its final group stage game. The side made it to the quarterfinals after Ireland lost to Great Britain later in the day. Rani’s side will face Pool B winner Australia in the last eight. This is the first time the Indian women have qualified for the quarterfinals at the Olympics. The Indians, needing a win to keep alive their hopes of making a maiden appearance in the knockouts, called the shots in the early phase. In the fourth minute, Vandana put India in front. However, the Proteas grabbed the opportunity and equalised in the 14th minute as Tarryn Glasby converted Taryn Mallett’s long pass. Three minutes later, India went ahead again when Vandana diverted Deep Grace Ekka’s drag-flick into the net. However, South Africa struck back with less than 30 seconds left in the second quarter, as captain Erin Hunter got on the scoresheet. India made it 3-2 within two minutes of the third quarter as Neha got into the scoring act. South Africa scored in the last minute of the quarter through Marizen Marais. The final 15 minutes proved crucial as Sjoerd Marijne’s side took the lead for the fourth, and final time, as Vandana tapped home Gurjit Kaur’s drag-flick off a penalty corner. Vandana, 29, became the first Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Olympic Games.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vandana-tricks-as-indian-women-qualify/article35660548.ece
01 August 2021||BUDAPEST,||Hamilton chalks up 101st pole||Seven-times World champion Lewis Hamilton took pole position ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas, who handed Mercedes a front-row lockout in Saturday’s qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. He lapped the 4.3km of a sweltering Hungaroring in one minute, 15.419 seconds, 0.315 seconds quicker than Bottas. Crucially, he was 0.421s quicker than Red Bull title rival Max Verstappen in third. “I think its been amazing teamwork from everyone this weekend,” said Hamilton, after chalking up his 101st career pole and first in six races. “It’s been amazing to see everyone coming together, rallying up and pushing forward,” the Briton, gunning for a 100th win and record ninth at the circuit on Sunday, added.  Verstappen, who leads Hamilton by eight points in the overall standings, was disappointed to miss out on a fifth successive pole. “Clearly, the whole weekend so far we’ve been a bit behind and it showed again in qualifying,” said the 23-year-old, whose rivalry with Hamilton stepped up a gear after a collision with the Mercedes driver put him out of the last race in Britain. The hour-long session was briefly halted in the second phase when Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz spun off into the barriers at the last corner. The Spaniard, fourth in the opening part of qualifying on a strong weekend for the Maranello-based squad, will start 15th.  Starting grid: Front row: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes), Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes); Second row: Max Verstappen (Red Bull), Sergio Perez (Red Bull); Third row: Pierre Gasly (AlphaTauri), Lando Norris (McLaren); Fourth row: Charles Leclerc (Ferrari), Esteban Ocon (Alpine); Fifth row: Fernando Alonso (Alpine), Sebastian Vettel (Aston Martin); Sixth row: Daniel Ricciardo (McLaren), Lance Stroll (Aston Martin).   Seventh row: Kimi Raikkonen (Alfa Romeo), Antonio Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo); Eighth row: Carlos Sainz (Ferrari), Yuki Tsunoda (AlphaTauri); Ninth row: George Russell (Williams), Nicholas Latifi (Williams); 10th row: Nikita Mazepin (Haas), Mick Schumacher (Haas) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamiltons-101st-pole/article35660708.ece

The 30-year-old Pooja could not make an impact on the superior Chinese boxer Li Qian who won their women’s 75kg quarterfinal bout 5-0. Earlier, top seed and medal contender Amit Panghal crashed out after losing his 52kg pre-quarterfinal bout 1-4 to Colombian Yuberjen Martinez, a Rio Olympics silver medallist in light flyweight. The 25-year-old Panghal dominated the first round with his excellent footwork backed by solid shots. The Indian established an early advantage as he won the opener 4-1. However, the experienced 29-year-old Colombian surprised Amit with a change in gameplan. Martinez chased Amit around the ring, spraying punches and making the Indian’s moves ineffective. He took the second round 4-1. The Colombian went on to win the final round 5-0. Satish Kumar (+91kg) is the only Indian male boxer left in the Tokyo Games.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shock-exit-for-amit-pooja-too-bows-out/article35660557.ece
01 August 2021||TOKYO,||Tzu-ying exacts revenge on Sindhu||P.V. Sindhu had beaten Tai Tzu-ying in straight games on way to the silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Tzu-ying, who has beaten the Indian nine times since, got her ultimate revenge five years later as she stormed to a 21-18, 21-12 victory in their Tokyo Olympics semifinal clash here on Saturday. Sindhu will have a shot at a second successive Olympic medal when she takes on China’s He Bingjao for the bronze on Sunday. Tzu-ying will face another Chinese Chen Yufei in the final. Deceitful drops All the shuttlers who’ve played Tzu-ying are aware of her weapon — deceitful drops. Sindhu managed to counter it well in the opening game and raced to a 7-3 lead. But Tzu-ying fought back in style. From 11-11, the Chinese Taipei shuttler dominated the exchanges. Time and again, she made Sindhu dart across the court. However, the Indian used her phenomenal reach and athleticism to keep the rallies alive. There was little to separate the two as they were locked 17-17. At this stage, Tzu-ying profited from a net cord and wrapped up the game with a down-the-line smash. Sindhu began the second game well, but was unable to settle in as Tzu-ying took a four-point lead (10-6). The latter pulled away to 16-8 and sealed the contest 21-12 to reach her maiden Olympic final. “It’s a bit sad that I am not on the winning side, but I have one more match to go. I need to keep my tempo going, recover soon and come back on Sunday,” said Sindhu, adding that her opponent hardly committed any unforced error. Tzu-ying echoed Sindhu's view. “I reduced my errors and produced my best performance,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tzu-ying-exacts-revenge-on-sindhu/article35660559.ece
01 August 2021||Tokyo,||The Dressel, Ledecky caravans roll on||Caeleb Dressel set a new 100m butterfly World record to grab his third gold here on Saturday, as Katie Ledecky underlined her dominance of distance swimming with a third Olympic 800m freestyle title. Explosive Two-time World champion Dressel was always going to be tough to beat, and he exploded from the blocks and turned first, roaring home in 49.45 seconds, ahead of 200m winner Kristof Milak (49.68s) to shatter his own previous world best 49.50s set in 2019. Ledecky led all the way to touch in 8:12.57s and outpaced Australia’s Ariarne Titmus, while Australian backstroke star Kaylee McKeown added the 200m title to her 100m crown in an eye-popping 2:04.68s Britain’s heroics In the mixed relay’s Olympic bow, the British team of Kathleen Dawson, Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkin came out on top.

01 August 2021||Tokyo,||Bencic digs in, takes gold||Belinda Bencic became the first Swiss woman to win the Olympic tennis singles title with a battling three-set victory over Czech Marketa Vondrousova on Saturday. The 24-year-old Bencic edged out Vondrousova 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 on her second match-point after two and half hours on court. In line for double Bencic will be in line for a double when she plays Sunday's doubles final alongside Viktorija Golubic against Czechs Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova. Earlier, men’s World No. 1 Novak Djokovic pulled out of his mixed doubles bronze medal match with a shoulder injury. The 34-year-old Serb, who could become the first man to complete a calendar Grand Slam since Rod Laver in 1969, is doubtful for the US Open, which gets underway on August 30. The withdrawal in Tokyo came after the 20-time Major champion lost his cool and smashed racquets on way to a surprise 6-4, 6-7(6), 6-3 defeat against Pablo Carreno Busta in the bronze-medal match. Elina Svitolina became Ukraine’s first Olympic medallist in tennis, securing the bronze. She beat Kazakh Elena Rybakina 1-6, 7-6(5), 6-4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bencic-digs-in-takes-gold/article35660563.ece

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Residents make green pact with GCC||On August 6, AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association in Velachery will plant 75 tree saplings at AGS Colony to commemorate the 75th year of Indian Independence. AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association is one of many residents’ welfare associations that have expressed an interest in Greater Chennai Corporation’s (GCC) Pasumai Chennai, a citizens-driven initiative that aims to enhance the city’s green cover. The exercise is among the various initiatives being undertaken by GCC to beautify Chennai. In the past week, GCC’s zonal officers were holding meetings with residents’ welfare associations in their zones to persuade them to start a greening exercise in their colonies “Prior to this, the Corporation carried out mass cleaning in various localities; posters were removed from public spaces including flyovers, subways and compound walls of schools; and also from signboards, nameboards, and bus shelters. Further, walls in public spaces are being adorned with artworks. Now, we are approaching residents’ associations to enhance the city’s green cover by raising trees in their respective colonies,” says V Vijayakumari, zonal officer of Zone 7 (Ambattur). On July 29, a meeting was held at Ripon Building which was attended by GCC Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. Under Pasumai Chennai, GCC expects residents to bear the expenses of buying and nurturing the saplings. Though keen on taking it up, residents’ associations draw attention to some challenges. First, the cost factor. Tree guard meshes meant for protecting the saplings will entail a lot of expenditure, contend members of these associations. For example, to keep the costs low, the Rayala Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Ramapuram decided not to buy readymade mesh. Instead, it has bought the basic materials and will be hiring labourers to assemble them into tree-guards. “We have sourced 50 saplings from a non-governmental organisation that were provided free of cost. Now, we have to spend just for the tree guards. The cost of a single mesh ranges from Rs. 150 to Rs. 1,500. The fence has to be at least six feet high to keep it away from the reach of cattle. So, we have bought the basic materials from a wholesale shop in Broadway. With a sponsorship of Rs. 40,000, the association bought materials weighing 200 kg,” says PV Kishore, president, Rayala Nagar Welfare Association. Zonal Officer of Zone 8 (Anna Nagar) P Murugesan underlines that the cost of meshes is a deterrent for some residents’ associations to participate in Pasumai Chennai. Here, T.S. Saravanan, Assistant Engineer, Ward 143 of Zone 11 Valasarawakkam, suggests that instead of buying new tree guards, associations should try to get used ones. “We are also trying to help associations in finding such used tree guards,” says Saravanan. Citing another challenge, Geetha Ganesh, secretary, AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association, points out that the Corporation stipulates a minimum of seven to eight feet tall saplings to be planted. “But an eight feet tall sapling may cost around Rs. 850 when purchased from a private nursery. Non-governmental organisations provide saplings free of cost. But that involves waiting for an indefinite period. For this exercise, our association has set aside Rs. 5,000. But this amount would not suffice. Therefore, we are also approaching textile shops, jewellery shops and builders for financial support. So far, our efforts have drawn a blank. They say the pandemic has dampened their business. Hence, their inability to extend assistance,” says Geetha Ganesh. Other challenges cited by associations are: Overhead electricity cables and stormwater drains. “If both these amenities are found on one side of the road, then we can raise the tree on the other side. But if each of this facility runs on each side of the road, then it poses a hurdle. The Corporation also wants to leave out such roads. In that case, most of the colonies will be left with only a few roads suitable for tree planting. Hence, it is essential that electricity cables are laid underground. Fortunately, at our colony in South Jagannathan Nagar (Ward 9) in Villivakkam (Zone 8) both these facilities are found on one side of the raod. And in some roads, we have underground electricity cables,” says S Vetrivel, secretary, South Jagannathan Nagar Residents Welfare Association. Yet another challenge cited by residents associations is parking of vehicles along the roads, especially where houses and apartments do not have parking facilities. Greater Chennai Corporation is also helping residents by identifying for them the possibilities of sponsorships from commercial establishments. To cite an example, with the financial support of Surya Motors, a dealer of Royal Enfield motorcycles, the office of Zone 14 (Perungudi) has bought 100 saplings at a cost of Rs. 10,000. “Of the 100 saplings, 50 were planted at VGP Layout (Ward 185) in Palavakkam and the remaining at Venkateshwara Nagar and AGS Colony in Kottivakkam (Ward 183). We are also trying to find sponsorship for tree-guards. Residents are expected to water and nurture the plants,” says K Dhanadayuthapani, Assistant Executive Engineer for Unit 41 in Zone 14. Green Velachery, a volunteer group, which is engaged in planting trees across Velachery, is willing to share tree saplings with residents associations. “We are into this exercise for the past three months. We have a good stock of tree saplings. Hence, we can donate saplings to other associations free of cost,” says S. Kumararaja, a member of the group.  With financial support from a company, the office of Zone 14 (Perungudi) has bought 100 saplings at a total cost of Rs. 10,000||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/residents-make-green-pact-with-gcc/article35660854.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Walk to work on the IT Corridor||Waterbirds’ breeding cycles work on the same principle as time-tables. The odd day can shift the hour, even redefine it. That dreaded teacher has not reported for work. Hurrah! That makes it an extra hour at the ground shooting at the goalposts. It can also go the other way with the same dreaded teacher filling in for an absentee colleague through the week, taking an extra hour every day. Sigh! Superimpose this idea on a waterbird’s breeding cycle. It stays sacrosanct till the “odd day” arrives, with too much rain or too little of it, shifting the season this way or the other. Taking in the Sholinganallur Perumbakkam Marshlands, one wonders if this year the breeding season has shifted for some resident waterbirds. This wetland reflects what should be the prevalent picture in most sections of this region. There is sufficient water; and for this time of the year, the wetland looks full, particularly on its eastern side. By extension, food should be in reasonably good supply, if not found in plenty. Salim Ali’s Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan (Volume 1) puts down the eastern purple heron’s breeding season in north India as stretching from June to September-October. And in south India, from November to March. It is an echo of the time-table, inviolable except for that odd season. Local rain patterns and an unexpected bonanza from the skies can shift timelines. The November-March timeline cannot be applied strictly to localities in those parts of south India that are more intensely touched by the south-westerlies. Ornithologist V Santharam touches upon an account from a friend about sighting a purple-heron parent followed by a train of chicks, at a place near Palaghat, as recently as the last week of July. “That section must be getting the full blast of the south west monsoon,” Santharam adds, hinting at the primary cause of variations in local breeding timelines. So, given the continual showers from this SW monsoon in our parts, would the resident purple heron ( ardea purpurea ) be tempted to start its breeding cycle early in Chennai and surrounding areas? It is just a surmise, watching the purple herons put in longer diurnal hours at the Sholinganallur Perumbakkam Marshlands, stalking their prey in characteristic Zen-like stillness. Santharam thinks this conjecture need not be off the mark. It is a possibility that can be borne out by sustained observation. Opportunistic breeding “Waterbirds are opportunistic. There have even been times when they have nested as early as August in Vedanthangal when there are good rains. It all depends on the rainfall. Within that short period, they have to make use of the available resources. They are very flexible in that respect. You cannot say with hundred percent certainty that if the book says so, it has to be like that. There have been good rains here too — in Rishi Valley — and we have noticed that some of the waterbirds have come back,” Shantaram elaborates. While the question of this species opportunistically breeding early remains a question, there is sure ground to stand on where the purple herons of the OMR bio-region are concerned. For one, the species enjoys the the avian version of an advantage gained by some of its neighbours, the IT employees by virtue of not only working on the IT Corridor, but also making it home. It is just “walk to work” for them. So it is for the purple heron. The humongous Pallikaranai Marsh, patches along the Buckingham canal (particularly the one off the ECR Link Road at Akkarai) as it snakes between OMR and ECR, and of course, the Sholinganallur Perumbakkam Marshlands (which in fact is a spit of the Pallikaranai Marsh) offer reed beds and other thick and tall vegetation that make it conducive for this skulker of a bird to spend long hours hidden and stalking prey. eBird records prove the regularity with which the purple heron is seen in these biodiversity hotspots. It sends out a message about what reeds and other seemingly useless vegetation can do for bird habitats. It is also a reminder of what we possess and should not let go. One can safely assume that purple heron engages in nesting activity in the dense reedbeds in these patches, unnoticed. Besides, the commendably-protected premises of NIOT with its trees, in Pallikaranai, serve as nuptial chamber, maternity ward and nursery from waterbirds. Sundaravel Palanivel, a birder from Kamakotti Nagar in Pallikaranai, brings a huge piece to the puzzle. He enjoys a vantage point in observing waterbirds that swim around in a body of water adjacent to the NIOT campus. Fledglings and juveniles of waterbirds get introduced to the rough and tumble of the wild in this naturally formed pool. A majority of these young would have “birth certificates” linked to the campus. “Between January and March, the spot-billed pelican, painted stork, Eurasian spoonbill, black-headed ibis, grey heron and egrets must be breeding at NIOT, having started their nesting activity in November. My assumption is that the purple heron should also be breeding there. Through the month of July, behind my home, I was seeing four to five juvenile purple herons, possibly on their own for three months now. This pattern is noticed around this time every year,” notes Sundaravel. There is a possibility that an odd pair of purple herons or two nest on the lower boughs of the trees. There is a greater likelihood that they build their homes on reed-beds at the Pallikaranai Marsh, in greater privacy. This stand squares up with what is known about the species. While it is not averse to breeding in mixed breeding colonies of waterbirds, it maintains an air of froideur, seeking a patch of quiet even in the madding crowd. Santharam observes: “Compared to other waterbirds, they do not seem to prefer nesting in large colonies. In most of the large breeding colonies in South India, you do not come across nests. The nests could be slightly away from the nesting site or lower down in the reedbeds.” Salim Ali puts this trait of the purple heron this way in Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan Volume 1: “When in mixed heronries with other species, shows a tendency to segregation into its own mohallas .” In that volume of his magnum opus, Salim Ali also underscores the purple heron’s ability to turn the screwpine trees ( thalampoo) , their leaves, into a breeding platform. With that, the OMR bio-region ticks another of the boxes for favourable breeding conditions for the purple heron. Tall, thick and closely-woven stands of screwpine trees present a bulwark around a section of Thaiyur lake. Have the purple herons found this potential home?

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Elon Musk sends Kotturpuram resident over the moon||Elon Musk may be planning his way to space and also creating an elaborate course for others to get there, and expending huge resources in the process. While these out-of-world efforts are in the works and being watched with immense interest, the SpaceX CEO has quietly “rocketed” a Kotturpuram resident over the moon, with the minimum of fuss — with just a tap of his finger. Before the incredible fact that Elon Musk had liked his tweet (dated 20 July 2021) could sink in, Agnishwar Jayaprakash, founder of Garuda Aerospace, was discovering how far that simple act on Twitter could go. Chennai-based Garuda Aerospace is in the business of designing and building drones for applications that range from sanitising crannies in tall buildings to reaching medicines to terrains that are off the map. Its latest effort that caught Musk’s eye and his fortune-altering finger, is Surya drone, one that skimps on water as it goes about solar panels installed in hard-to-reach spaces. “Basically, it was a tweet about Surya drone, a solar-powered drone we have designed, one that reduces the amount of water used in solar panel cleaning from the regular usage level of four litres to just 100 ml or under,” Agnishwar explains. “The drone can be particularly beneficial in areas marked by water scarcity. Solar farms find it difficult to clean the panels and leaving them uncleaned can result in the panels becoming under-productive.” Agnishwar adds that by utilising these drones, manpower is reduced and also quick and efficient way of cleaning solar panels that increases its productivity is introduced. It was Agnishwar’s gain that Musk was also on the same page and made that known to the tweet-consuming world. “Because that tweet had caught Elon’s attention, immediately, a global fund was rushed to us, as within 16 hours of discussion, they had signed a term sheet for one million dollars of funding,” reveals Agnishwar. The news was promptly picked up and reported by business publications, including The Hindu Businessline . The 30-year-old entrepreneur adds that following these developments, the National Thermal Power Corporation had approached Garuda Aerospace in connection with Surya drone. It may be noted that Agnishwar used to be in the news for his exploits in the waters. An accomplished swimmer, his calling card during his swimming days was that he bested the competition in six categories at the World Short Course Swimming Championships, held in Istanbul in 2012, in the process creating six national records; and that eight years earlier, in 2004, when he was aged 14, he became the youngest to represent the country, when he did so at the World Championships in Indianapolis, United States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/elon-musk-sends-kotturpuram-resident-over-the-moon/article35660837.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The challenge of childcare during the pandemic||Sameer Sharma and his wife Anjali, who stay on the IIT-Madras campus, have rejigged their work schedules so that their work hours do not overlap. By doing so, they ensure at least one of them is around their four-and-a-half-year-old son at any given time. A scientist, Anjali has opted for the night shift. Sameer works during the day, sometimes from home, and at other times, out of office. “Ideally, I need to go to the office, but it is flexible. So, whenever I have to, I go to office,” says Sameer, who works for a United States-based start-up. With many companies asking employees to return to work after vaccination, parents who lack the support system to take care of their little children are in a fix. The State Government is yet to grant permission to daycare centres/ crèches to reopen. Those running daycare centres reveal that they are receiving calls from parents requesting that they open at least for some hours every day. Members of Chennai Individual Playschool Owners Welfare Association have been making a representation to the State government to allow them to open their establishments. In a representation to the Chief Minister, they have requested that this being a service industry with a large number of women entrepreneurs and women caretakers they must be allowed to open existing centres. In another representation to the Education Department, they have underlined the challenges in following the regulations that have been framed for playschools. “Please simplify the government order for playschools according to modern social development; and do not compare us with private schools as our services are childcare-specific.” Sujata Vijay, vice-president, Chennai Individual Playschool Owners Welfare Association, points out that 50 rules had been listed by the department. Twenty of them are unachievable. “For example, one rule said that if you were running a daycare centre, there should be no gas cylinder within a radius of one kilometre. There were some regulations that could not be followed and so we asked the department to have them tweaked in such a manner that they benefited working parents and us,” says Sujata, who runs Bamboola. She points out that the Association had around 700 members before the pandemic, but many had to shut down now. “Now we are 100 active members,” says Sujata. Many of the players operated daycare centres from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. which was a big boon for working parents. Even parents of children in kindergarten availed these services that came with a host of activities to keep the little ones engaged. Sujata says some are getting calls from companies to open an onsite daycare facility. “A few organisations working in the textile industry approached us but without a government permission, we cannot go ahead with it,” she says. Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association runs a crèche with a doctor on board and it can accommodate nearly 40 children, but the place is yet to open. A member of the Association says that in the pre-covid days more than 20 children were availing the facility. A majority of the employees hired at the Estate have returned to work, and some of them have found a caretaker to take care of their children when they report to work. But how many of them can afford such a service? Last year, some of the premium daycare centres started ‘at-home services’ where a caretaker was sent in-person to enable working professionals balance professional commitments and child care. Two minds Even if the government were to give permission, some players running daycare centres and playschools say they are wary about opening their centres now. A spokesperson of a national chain that has 40 centres in Chennai says that unless parents, children and the staff are vaccinated they do not have the confidence to reopen. It is difficult to get very small children to follow the precautionary measures — wearing a mask, maintaining social distance and following hygiene practices. Besides promoting hygiene practices, the recommendations from experts include restrictions on the intake of children, routine health screenings and flexible sick leave for the staff. K. Shanmugavelayutham, convenor of Tamil Nadu Forum for Creche and Childcare Services, says institutions may think of reopening gradually but starting from the higher classes. Toddlers cannot follow COVID-appropriate protocols and they must be the last, he says. Offices must offer flexibility to professionals who do not have any support system at home to take care of their children, says Shanmugavelayutham.    A few organisations working in the textile industry approached us to open an on-site daycare centre but without government permission. We obviously did not go ahead with it||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-challenge-of-childcare-during-the-pandemic/article35660858.ece

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Fitness enthusiasts take up a noble exercise||On August 1, cyclists and runners would descend in droves on the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children in Egmore and the Chrompet General Hospital, for a blood donation camp organised by Aalam. A social initiative of We Are Chennai Cycling Group (WCCG), Aalam has mobilised 11 fitness groups from Chennai for the camp specifically meant to benefit children with thalassemia, a blood disorder that requires blood transfusions. The camp is being attended by members of 12 neighbourhood chapters of WCCG and running groups like Marina Dreamers, Madras Mustangs, Pillar Pacers, Porur Racers, Chromepet Cheetahs, Tambaram Thunderbolts, Anna Nagar Dreamers, Vibrant Velachery and Bandit Runners. “Aalam has been conducting blood donation drives since 2016 and it is usually done twice a year but what makes this one special is that we roped in enthusiasts from other groups,” says Lokesh Asokan, organising member of Aalam. “On an average, our drives help us collect 80 to 120 pints of blood.” In the past, they have organised events at hospitals and even at a Montessori school, drawing the general public to these camps. The restrictions in place due to the pandemic has reduced the scope of these events in attracting donors. “Due to the vaccination drive, many hospitals are finding it a challenge to find donors, and that is why we thought of roping in our friends from other running groups,” says Lokesh. Around 70 people have signed up for the drive and the plan is to reach 100, he says. “By associating with other groups, we have been able to spread the word and also get new people to sign up for the cause,” says Lokesh. Srivatsa Vema of Platelet Club, an online platform facilitating contact with donors, points out that the given the blood shortage at government hospitals, more communities should step forward to save lives. “Recently, at a government hospital, a child with AB positive group had to wait for two weeks to find a matching blood group. The surgery was slated for July 14 but the family could only manage one donor before the day,” says Vema. Most doctors keep three to four pints of blood as buffer before a surgery. “But when it comes to babies they always look for fresh blood, and some doctors would not use blood that is more than four days old, so it important that awareness is created and more people come forward to donate blood, especially at government hospitals where the need is greater,” he says. The camp is on from 9 a.m. till noon. Those who would like to be a part of the drive can contact Lokesh at 97899 82110/ Prasanna at 73585 23418.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/fitness-enthusiasts-take-up-a-noble-exercise/article35660846.ece

H Vembu, secretary, Adyar Padmanabha Nagar Fifth Street Residents’ Welfare Association points out that encroachments in the form of sloped pathways are found in the locality. “Constructed over stormwater drain manholes, they leave the manholes hidden. Some have constructed these slopes along their compound wall which considerably eats into pedestrians’ space. Besides, these illegal structures obstruct the free flow of rainwater into stormwater drains, resulting in water stagnation on the roads.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The abyss stares back||A Nielsen survey shows that during the lockdown, there were three genres that readers flocked to: crime, fantasy and horror. It seems inexplicable that faced with the images of dead bodies studding the banks of the Ganga, of hundreds of pyres sending up a pall of smoke, of corpses stacked like wood, people would still turn to reading horror. To understand why is to ask what makes the genre tick. Our fascination with horror begins early. It is the very first thing we read. What is Red Riding Hood but a warning tale about sexual predators? ‘Ring-a-ring-a-roses’ describes death by plague. The wicked sisters of Cinderella self-mutilate, cutting off their toes to try and shove their feet into the glass shoes. And Snow White’s stepmother demands her heart be cut out of her chest. Children face a world where, outside of their tiny lives, everything is labelled: ‘Here There Be Dragons’. All is unknown and vast, draped in shadows, hiding monsters. Growing up, we learn that the shadows are both within and without us, as are the monsters. For the world to make sense these must be worked through. And working them through on the page is to take a journey where we know we will emerge alive. It is to work an exorcism ritual for our own ghosts and the demons of the world. This thirst for horror on the safety of the page stays with us as we grow up. Bludgeoned with images And horrors are everywhere in our violent, out-of-control, decaying world. Cruelty is casually brought to our doorsteps in this age of mobile phones and social media. My first foray into this genre was with a book — Washer of the Dead — that was a direct response to opening the paper every morning and finding at least three stories that concerned violence to women. A prosaic reporting of women doused in petrol and set on fire, stripped naked and paraded as witches, raped and chopped into pieces. Women are forced to walk through the world with their eyes wide open, knowing that even in the home the caress can turn to a fatal blow. It was this headline horror that compelled me to put together Dark Tales as well, using the most disturbing news stories as fodder for fiction. And what excesses we now reap. With reportage becoming instant, we are bludgeoned with images. The surfeit blunts us, even as it haunts us. The more real violence unreels before our eyes, the more blood-spattered the stories become. There are plenty of books in this genre that are sensationalist, but, equally, there are books that raise the horror genre to a lyrical dirge, a savage social commentary, a literary tour de force. A fun-house mirror This is a genre that lends itself well to social commentary. Frankenstein never dies. He returns with every generation in a new retelling as more miracles of science turn from a blessing to curse. If you look at a list of blockbuster horror movies in America, you can actually track the issues that the country has been dealing with, year by year. The first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a protest against the Vietnam war. Closer home, Tumbbad is a scathing indictment of rampant greed and ecological destruction. Horror is a fun-house mirror. It shows us the abomination, the other. But it also shows us that it is just a twisted reflection of ourselves. Above all other genres, it is a genre with a very strong moral core. Most stories feature punishment and justice. One must earn a right to survive. Horror stories are also tales of survival and resurrection. One person will stumble out of the long dark night, changed forever, lessons learnt, demons fought. Fears argue back The genre reminds us that for all the technological advances our opposable thumbs and large brains have brought us, the world is still marked ‘Here There Be Dragons’ — though the dragons might now be based on cloning, genetic mutation, toxic spills. The caveman still warms himself at the lonely fire, glancing over his shoulders, and the night is long and dark and full of terrors. The prehensile brain crouches at the stub of our sophisticated modern brain, teeth bloody, dilated eyes staring into the dark. The Internet is the world-spanning fireplace that we gather at to tell our stories now. As science turns its bright spotlight on the dark, the storytelling becomes even more terrified and frenzied. It is now based on reality and takes new forms. Creepypasta and urban legends abound. Photographs of found objects with stories attached go viral. ‘Lost film’ archives and ‘found footage’ become blockbuster films, proving that no matter what science argues, our fears argue back. Beyond a boo To turn to horror-writing in India is to step back in time. Our fiction is haunted by a very resilient spirit who goes by the name of Ruskin Bond. Long after the British have left, we seem to have failed to emancipate ourselves from tales of lonely hill stations, abandoned houses, schoolfriends playing planchette in the dark. But then along comes a book like Indra Das’ Devourers and shows us what Indian horror can be like when it is all grown up. With the wealth of traditional ghosts that haunt India, with the terrible litany of death and callous destruction that is modern India, we still await the book that will elevate the genre to the bestselling behemoth that it should be in this country. Interestingly, ‘horror’ describes a response, not a genre. Horror is extremely flexible. It can be funny, moving, crossbred with science fiction, satire, romance. But the genre is defined by the response it evokes. We don’t demand of a love story that it make us fall in love. But we demand of a horror story that it scare us. This makes it a very difficult genre to write, because if the writer hopes to do more than produce a ‘boo’ scare, he or she first has to take a look at what truly scares them. It is not a coincidence that Stephen King, one of the bestselling authors in the genre, also confesses to being one of the most phobic. As we all know, when you look into the abyss the abyss looks into you. I grew up in a building in Kolkata that had been originally acquired by the government to house survivors from concentration camps. Little Jewish ladies held out their arms, old men rolled back their sleeves to show me their concentration camp tattoos. My nightmares became of bodies dissolving to fat, of children turning to smoke, of skin stretched to make lampshades, still bearing those sepia numbers. Today, I have a single tattoo at exactly the same spot on my wrist. Tat tvam asi, it says. It is one of the four Mahavakyas of the Upanishads . Each Veda is summed up in a single line that coalesces all the wisdom of the book. Tat tvam asi: You are that. All the light you search for, the transcendence you seek — you are that. But equally, all the darkness, all the descent into the pit — you are that too. I bear it on my wrist to remind me that I am just a decision, a lapse, a step away from choosing darkness. And I write horror as a beacon against the night. The award-winning writer is the author, most recently, ofDark Tales, a collection of horror stories set in contemporary India.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Poverty alleviation and growth||Can large cash transfers, an effective right to work, an accountable public healthcare system, and a sovereign fund that makes all citizens co-owners of the nation’s financial wealth, together create a new development paradigm for India? The present volume could be read in this manner. The collection contains a wide variety of essays on topics ranging from poverty reduction policies, role of property rights and financial inclusion, to caste in India and autocrats in Muslim-majority countries. The common theme is the economist Pranab Bardhan whose contributions, described by the editors as “co-terminus with the emergence of modern development economics,” inspire the essays. The book is targeted mainly towards specialists and students at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, but the depth of treatment as well as level of technical difficulty vary quite a bit. Generally accessible essays on the role of property rights (private and communal) in resource allocation (Maitreesh Ghatak) and the impact of colonial censuses on perception of caste hierarchies in India (Rohini Somanathan) are found alongside long technical pieces on automation and employer power in the labour market (Nancy Chau and Ravi Kanbur). A review of this kind cannot really do justice to all the 12 chapters. My aim is thus not to offer an evaluation of each essay, but rather to draw attention to a few things I found interesting and relevant. Cash-or-kind transfers Dilip Mookherjee’s essay introduces readers to the variety of anti-poverty interventions, as well as problems of corruption and elite capture that have plagued efforts over the years. The piece elaborates pros and cons of type of entitlement (cash or kind), delivery mechanisms, and the issues that arise when one speaks of substituting one type of programme for another (say cash instead of food). This essay sets the stage for subsequent essays on particular policies. The MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) has emerged as a vital social safety net during the COVID-19 pandemic and there have been demands for its extension to urban areas. Even aside from the pandemic, as the world’s largest right to work programme, its economics is of special interest. Martin Ravaillon, a long-time observer of employment guarantee in India, raises the question, might MGNREGA fail to provide work to all who want it despite being adequately funded by the government? The essay presents a microeconomic model where work rationing emerges out of cost-benefit calculations by local officials implementing the programme. It is worth noting that the solutions briefly alluded to in the essay, viz. more robust social audits and grievance redressal mechanisms, are precisely the ones activists have been working hard to achieve on the ground.  Cash transfers have also emerged in recent years, in India and elsewhere, as popular instruments for improving the social safety net. Indeed, it is hard to avoid the “UBI versus PDS/MGNREGA” question with respect to the future of social protection in India. The essay by Bruce Wydick examines international evidence for impact of conditional as well as unconditional transfers on poverty reduction. But the more interesting question raised in the essay is, can cash transfers be transformative, i.e. can they move households into self-sufficiency where they no longer need such transfers? The simple and intuitive answer is that, for this to occur, transfers need to be large enough to finance not just consumption but also savings, and they do not work well unless accompanied by complementary policies such as employment generation. Broken healthcare The pandemic has also brought the failures of the Indian healthcare system into high relief. Based on several years of surveys and RCTs (randomised controlled trial) in Udaipur with the NGO Seva Mandir, Banerjee and Duflo’s essay offers rich insights into the quality of private and public health infrastructure as well as into how poor households decide whether to visit public health centres, private allopaths, or traditional healers. Their findings amply illustrate why healthcare is a particularly difficult commodity for private markets to handle and point to the importance of regulating private providers, training informal practitioners, and improving incentives in the public sector. Wealth inequality A relatively under-researched policy idea, at least in the Indian context, is developed by Parikshit Ghosh and Debraj Ray who argue for a sovereign India Fund, “to be invested in portfolios of equity, bonds, and other financial assets, and managed professionally”. Created via the issuance of a fraction of new shares to the government by every publicly traded Indian company, free of cost, the India Fund transfers a fraction of private capital into social ownership. The returns are paid out as dividends universally or via means-testing. The idea is motivated by two profound consequences of capitalism — increasing pace of automation that creates growth without jobs (also the theme of the essay by Kanbur and Chau), and increasing inequality of wealth (particularly financial wealth). Various other essays on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, autocracy and development, constructing measures for economic growth that take distribution into account etc. are to be found in this volume. Though this makes for a somewhat diffuse focus — no one theme really can be said to dominate the volume — it nevertheless constitutes a valuable resource for public policy debates as well as teaching. And taken together, it is gratifying to see a strong progressive and transformative agenda emerging from the essays.  The reviewer is Associate Professor of Economics at Azim Premji University.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A ‘stranger’ in London||Having won free air tickets to London in a contest, I soon found myself in a flat at Chiswick. Within hours of my landing, with no jet lag, I set out. My host, an eminent Sri Lankan cardiologist, had briefly explained to me about the nitty-gritty of movement in London. “Don’t look directly at strangers. That may invite trouble. A few ‘spirited gentlemen’ may take it as a challenge, a hat thrown into the ring,” he warned rather grimly. I covered myself with a thin cashmere paired with a sweater and a muffler, all under an overcoat lent by the doctor. A deerstalker on my head completed the attire. I thrust my hands deep into the pockets, enjoying the chilly winds and the warmth the layers of my clothes provided. The roads were almost empty. As I stood at an intersection, wondering which way to go, a car pulled up near me. “Good morning, sir. Can you direct me to the road that leads to North Ealing,” asked a silver-haired old gentleman at the wheel. I reeled in wonderment. There I was, a complete stranger to London, nervously re-running the doctor’s cryptic instructions in “doing” London, and here is a motorist asking me for directions. “Search me, sir,” I told him cheerfully. “Just landed in London few hours back. A total stranger, that is.” “Really? But you look like one who has been here for long. Sorry to have bothered you.” Mistaken for a resident? Attaboy! I patted myself. As I started walking towards the station, to catch my train, an old lady vaguely resembling Agatha Christie tapped my shoulder. “Excuse me, young man. Can I bother you to direct me to the local church? You must be knowing it, belonging to this place.” “Belonging to this place? No way. I am a tourist from India. Landed only hours back at Heathrow.” “Indeed? But you do look like one who has been here.” I told her, “My stay here is only a few hours old, nevertheless, without the singular powers of detection of Sherlock Holmes, I can tell you that the church is over there on your right. You can see the spire from here.” She giggled, patted my shoulder and went away. London seemed to be decidedly friendly. I thought I would require guidance on my maiden trip out. Instead, ironically two Londoners sought that from me. jsraghavan@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-stranger-in-london/article35660865.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||In a foreign land||Sabin Iqbal’s sophomore novel, Shamal Days, revolves around Abbas, a Keralite newspaper editor living in a small, unnamed country in West Asia. Abbas’s personal saga unfolds against the backdrop of political and social churnings in the region, opening with reports of violent protests and a suicide bombing in Gaza. In the very first chapter, Abbas reminisces about interviewing Saddam Hussein in his “eerily silent palace in Baghdad.” Abbas has been in the media for over two decades. He is a deeply disillusioned man with an out-of-control drinking habit, and the business of news “seems like a joke” to him. A guarded man who has kept his heart caged over the years, he finds himself alone in his 40s. His preoccupation with sex is a melancholy affair, and it haunts him throughout the narrative, lands him in compromising situations, but never leads to meaningful relationships. In his first novel, The Cliffhangers , Sabin Iqbal wrote of the complex links between religious identity, politics and communalism in contemporary India. In Shamal Days, the focus is on the aspirations and alienation of members of the Indian diaspora in West Asia. The murky politics of newsrooms and of the volatile region are sketched with deft strokes.  Shamal Days flits back and forth in time, tracing the course of Abbas’s working life in the foreign country while weaving in the twists and turns of his personal life. The jumps in time are often jarring. Iqbal also veers off tangent in multiple scenes, randomly throwing in secondary characters and fragmented plotlines revolving around them. The plotline involving Abbas-Ratnam-Bhaskar, the mainstay of the narrative, is given far less room than it deserves. Secondary characters, on the other hand, take up a disproportionate amount of space. The writing see-saws between ecstatically lyrical and dreadfully overwritten. Rain makes the desert bloom as if “reminiscing about a long-abandoned rhapsody,” shamal winds blend the “whiff of parched sand with the depressing reek of emptiness” as  Abbas teeters from darkness to darkness till a wake-up call makes him confront himself. The writer is the author ofA Happy Place and Other Stories.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ripples of rebellion||The story picks up pace after the first 100 pages. In the initial pages, the novelist details the contours of the primary family, the community, the village, the neighbourhood, and the dominant values of the society in which the protagonist Diravi is to grow up. It’s a bildungsroman of sorts. The young Diravi is a passive receptacle of stories of the past from his paternal grandmother, Unnamalai Aachi. It is only when he rejects received knowledge and attempts to script a new way of living for his sister that the story begins to pulsate, and then it leaves you devastated in the rather hurried end. The descriptive parts stand out for their simplicity and rawness. The village, its ponds, fields, huts and bigger homes, its gossip-mongers and Samaritans — all have a visual realness. The plot weaves around the changing times of three generations of the ‘Chettis of Eraniyal town’ in Tamil Nadu. What dominates the narrative is the tragedy of a young bride, Diravi’s sister Nagu, who is capriciously returned home and neither the village elders nor the village deity is able to give her justice. It is left to young Diravi to convince his parents to let his sister remarry to prove a point to the man who abandoned her. The overall idea of how small acts of individual effort contribute to societal transformation gives credibility to this story written by a Sahitya Akademi awardee. Meanwhile, what is wrong with our publishing houses that they allow so many errors to go unchecked? One sentence in this book reads: “It was the third day or what not.” A character in the story is described as “distance and aloof”. Another sentence reads: “The son’s voice was heard all over stacking error street.” Seldom do books and writers get a second chance. Translated by acclaimed writer, Ka. Naa. Subramaniam, and first published in 1997 by Macmillan, Generations gets its rare second go because of the Translation Initiative of Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation. Given this privilege, it’s difficult to comprehend these slovenly lapses. The power of Neela Padmanabhan’s storytelling style, however, carries the reader through.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Poet of witness and an ability to contain multitudes||They ask me what Shahid means: Listen, listen:/It means “the beloved” in Persian, “witness” in Arabic.  Seldom, if ever, does a poet leave behind such consistent milestones in his poetic journey which may be used as signposts later to study his life and work in a purely chronological manner. Agha Shahid Ali’s (1949–2001) work has that contextual quality. The markers have been picked up and put to good use by his biographer, Manan Kapoor, to tell the story of a life that was extraordinary and a body of work deeply rooted in the Indian tradition. Though written in English, his poetic voice draws from other literary traditions — Urdu, Persian and Kashmiri; it speaks of the intensely personal and the political, often blurring the boundaries. Engagement with loss Loss, and the memory of loss, remains Shahid’s lifelong concern. He discovered his engagement with loss early in his poetic career and remained true to it, often returning to an early loss such as the death of Begum Akhtar, his muse. Belonging to multiple worlds — Indian/American, Kashmiri/Non-Kashmiri, English-speaking/Urdu-speaking — and yet not fully belonging to any one, he is in the true sense a poet of witness: he sees and records his experiences as in this elegy In Search of Evanescence : It was a year of brilliant water/in Pennsylvania that final summer/seven years ago, the sun’s quick reprints/in my attaché case: those students/of mist have drenched me with dew, I’m driving... At the University of Delhi, Shahid read Milton and Shakespeare; his parents introduced him to Ghalib and Faiz in their home in Kashmir. He went on to teach English and creative writing at colleges across the U.S. while continuing to write and publish his poetry to much acclaim acquiring a near-iconic status in his own lifetime. His friendships as much as his eclectic reading and experiences find expression in a stunning turn of phrases (‘crimsoned spillages’ for the bloodshed in Kashmir), or a forgotten history (‘The Dacca Gauzes’), or grief over his beloved mother’s death (‘Lenox Hill’); influenced as much by Emily Dickinson as Husain, the martyred hero of Karbala, Shahid’s singular quality is his ability to contain multitudes. Then there are his experiments with the ghazals, such as this sher from Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals : In the heart’s wild space lies the space of wilderness./What won’t one lose, what home one won’t give forever! Diverse interests Making common cause with a host of issues, his poetry reflects these diverse interests: the gayaki of Begum Akhtar, the loss of a way of life that once was in Kashmir, of living in different cities in America, the resistance movement in Palestine. But then there’s also the vexing business of remembering, and remembering things differently from others; as Shahid writes, ‘My memory is again in the way of your history’. Memory, loss, remembrance recur in poetry collections such as: Bone-Sculpture (1972), In Memory of Begum Akhtar (1979), A Walk Through the Yellow Pages (1987), The Half-Inch Himalayas (1987), A Nostalgist’ s Map of America (1991), The Beloved Witness: Selected Poems (1992), The Country Without a Post Office (1997), Rooms are Never Finished (2001), Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals (W. W. Norton, 2003). He also translated the poems of Faiz as The Rebel’ s Silhouette: Selected Poems (1992), and edited Ravishing Disunities: Real Ghazals in English (2000). Like a giant jigsaw puzzle, Kapoor fits in snippets from interviews and essays, anecdotes narrated by friends and family, as well as fragments of poetry to bring out Shahid’s piquant charm, humour, whimsy, zest for life. There are anecdotes, some of them legendary among the legions of his students and admirers, such as this: Asked by a security officer at an airport, “Are you carrying anything that could be dangerous for the other passengers?”, Shahid replied: “Only my heart!”  The reviewer is a writer, translator and literary historian.

Although it’s only the fifth most populous country in South America, it has produced six Miss World winners and Seven Miss Universe winners. It’s also home to Lake Maracaibo, which is in the Guinness Book as the most likely place to see a lightning bolt. What country is this whose name means ‘Little Venice’? 2 On August 1, 1774, British scientist Joseph Priestley discovered a gas, and hence corroborated the prior discovery of this element by German-Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. With this discovery, he answered age-old questions of why and how things burn. Priestley also invented carbonated water and the rubber eraser, identified a dozen key chemical compounds, and wrote an important early paper about electricity. What did he discover that is the active ingredient in our planet’s atmosphere? 3 On August 1, 1785, Caroline Herschel became the first woman to discover a certain astronomical body. She was the first woman ever to receive a salary as a scientist and the first woman in England to hold a government position. After her discovery on August 1, she went on to discover seven more of these entities. What are these entities that get their characteristic look from a long trail of gases they leave behind them? 4 Born on August 1, 1819, Herman Melville was an American novelist and poet. After the Panic of 1837, a financial crisis, he had difficulty holding on to a job. He worked as a bank clerk, land surveyor, ship’s crew member and then finally found his calling as a harpooner on a whaling ship. His adventures at sea inspired him to write the book that made him famous. What book did he write that follows a captain’s search for an albino sea mammal? 5 On August 1, 1900, two brothers, Édouard and André, published a reference guide for travellers in France. Their idea was to encourage more road travel and thereby increase demand for cars, which would help their tyre business. Initially free, it provided useful information about places to eat, maps, tyre repair instructions and petrol stations. In 1926, they started to award stars for dining establishments, a practice that led to a mention in the guide becoming a coveted prize for hotels. What was their family name and what guide is this? 6 On August 1, 1883, this country became the first in the world to start a parcel post, which was seen as the greatest revolution in the postal system since the stamp was introduced 40 years earlier in the same country. Which country is this, which because of its pioneer status doesn’t mention its name on its stamps? 7 On August 1, 1936, the Olympics opened in Berlin with a ceremony presided over by Adolf Hitler. These games were the first to be televised, with radio broadcasts reaching 41 countries. Leni Riefenstahl, who filmed the games, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports. A certain event introduced at these Olympics went on to become a modern tradition, and this followed the reintroduction of the Olympic flame at the 1928 games. What event is this, which took 499 days and was the first to be powered by hydrogen? 8 On August 1, 1941, the first army vehicle of this type was produced. Sold with the tagline ‘As faithful as a dog, as strong as a mule and agile as a goat’, this vehicle was used for any and all purposes. It’s theorised that this led to its name. What vehicle is this whose military designation GP (for Government Purposes or General Purpose) was slurred into one word? 9 On August 1, 1956, this building was opened in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was the very first building in the world to be completely heated by non-fossil-fuel energy. The firm housed in the building, Bridgers & Paxton, was responsible for its then revolutionary design, and it was even added to the National Register of Historic Places. What is the name of this building, which is named after the energy that heats it? 10 On August 1, 1981, this American cable channel began broadcasting in the U.S. It originally aired only music videos, starting fittingly with the song ‘Video Killed the Radio Star’ by The Buggles. What channel is this, which was responsible for introducing English pop and rock music to an entire generation before the advent of the Internet?

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Wear flowers in your hair||Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX may be familiar words in your current affairs dictionary this month. The Internet has exploded with perfectly on-point critique on how capitalist exploitation of workers has fuelled these solitary triumphalist explorations of space. And enough have had a field day with the phallic implications; the online newsletter splainer even had a tremendously fun feature on an adult entertainment company modelling and naming some of its products after said rockets. Many of us also took solace in a Twitter thread from Sim Kern, the spouse of a NASA flight controller, who voiced public sentiment by stressing that space travel was only made possible through the efforts of thousands of experts who stay unnamed. She also made sure to put to rest any envious speculations on “Bezos and Branson sipping champagne next to their space-pool,” for even space had nothing to offer these billionaires except evidence of their own immeasurable void. I felt slightly sad, however, that these forays, unimaginable a few decades ago, created in me no sense of wonder, excitement or even hope for an interesting future. Was it the reputation of Messrs. Bezos, Branson and Musk for narcissism and dubious behaviour that put me off? Or was it just a bad time? Once upon a moon But surely I had some excitement about space travel once. Remember that beautiful photograph in 2014 of staff at ISRO — women in jewel-coloured saris with flowers in their hair — celebrating the success of the Mars Orbiter Mission? Or the fervour surrounding the Cold War-fuelled race to the moon? Or all national space missions for that matter. Bezos vs. Branson does not have quite the same theatrical appeal as America vs. Russia. Individuals who carry the name of nation, community, cause and so on seem so much more worthy of emotional investment than your cheap paperback book-turned-movie of visionary businessmen struggling to poop at the Kármán line. Could we read Messrs. B, B and M, then, as a shining sign of the times? Nations that lose the imagination of nation-state-ness — to paraphrase political scientist and historian Benedict Anderson — will only have despots to show the world. Despots of little imagination, much money, and obscene disregard for the nation-state in particular, but also the world at large. I wouldn’t say I’m a fan of national contestations either, even as the nation-state is embedded in my subject formation. I’m a good modernist subject, who is attached to the nation as much as to a critique of the nation. Said with stamps What comes to mind is a wonderful installation by French-Algerian artist Kader Attia titled Independence Disillusionment that I saw at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in 2014. This was a series of 26 paintings of stamps from African and West Asian countries. Attia was commenting on how postcolonial countries’ hectic bid for modernity could be seen via images on these stamps — images of space shuttles, moon landings, and heroic scientists. To newly independent countries, the need to explore space à la the global modern stemmed from both a bid for legitimacy and the newly felt capacity for freedom. Attia’s installation was also a lament, however, of the state of the postcolonial world many years later in the wake of these images — the preponderance of strife and the absence of prosperity, imagination, or even for that matter, whole nation-states. Let me return, then, to the image of flowers worn by women of the Mars Orbiter Mission. Chennai-based travel photographer Naveenraj Gowthaman has a series on his Instagram page with the hashtag Poochoodal — these are photographs of flowers worn by women in their hair as they go about their daily lives. I have often marvelled at these flowers. Women up and about at the crack of dawn, on foot, bus, bicycle and in trains in Chennai, with beautiful roses, jasmine and crossandra in their hair, off to do the work of propping up the home and the city. Perhaps this is the only sort of verve worth marvelling at, this sense of daily purpose, this willingness to inhabit the day and not some unknown future of bunkers on Mars and escape pods. I think often of that portion of the Berlin Wall that reads “Many small people who in many small places do many small things that can alter the face of the world.” The billionaires can have their spaceships; I’ll take the flowers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/wear-flowers-in-your-hair/article35660906.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Racing against mosquitoes||In 1969, when I was a Captain in the Madras Sappers Centre in Bangalore, Corps of Engineers Day was observed with the finals of games and sports. One of the competitions was in watermanship, held on the Ulsoor lake. It had team and individual events, including assembling pontoon rafts and then racing them, rowing and kayaking. Training Battalion-3’s kayaker was practising hard, but always timed a few seconds more than TB-1’s kayaker, the previous year’s undisputed champion. It was under two weeks before Corps Day that I discovered that I had slipped up, not noticing that the rules required an officer to take part in at least one event. On shamefacedly confessing to my Commanding Officer, he ordered me to take part in kayaking, because at this late stage, joining the rowing or rafting team would upset the team. Our TB-3 kayaker was naturally upset. I was no match for TB-I’s kayaker, but the crisis was of my making. So for the remaining days, wearing shorts, I went morning and evening to the lake to practise kayaking. Since the lake was densely populated by ravenous mosquitoes, I applied mosquito repellent especially on my legs. I practised hard, but my timings were not encouraging. The big day arrived. After reaching the venue, I realised that I had not applied or brought the repellent. I mentally kicked myself because it was too late to do anything about it. The kayak champion was TB-1’s Naik Damodaran (if I correctly recall his name), a muscular Malayali. He was psyching everyone, especially me, with his warming-up routine. We entered our respective kayaks, waiting to go to the start line. That was when my misery began. In the 15 minutes spent in the kayak before the race, I was hard put to scratch my legs, keep hold of the paddle, not attract attention and not capsize. We reached the start line, paddling gently to remain on the start line and in our lanes. Damodaran, in the lane next to mine, nodded politely to me and I grimaced back in my misery while the mosquitoes continued their feasting. When the starting gun was fired, I got off to a decent start, but Damodaran was ahead. I paddled furiously with great vigour, mind focused on the feasting mosquitoes and my mounting misery, and with the aim of finishing the race as quickly as possible. It was only when I crossed the finish line that I was shocked to realise that I had finished just ahead of Damodaran. I had actually won, thanks to mosquito-power! sg9kere@live.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/racing-against-mosquitoes/article35660867.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||An equilibrium with China||India’s relations with China stand at a crossroads after the border crisis of 2020. Where relations are headed, and whether the post-1988 model that saw both countries shelve differences over the border and seeks commonality in other areas is still valid, remain the subject of much debate in New Delhi. (In Beijing, there appears to be some reluctance in acknowledging relations have indeed come to a crossroads, with officials insisting that the basic pattern of ties is unchanged — a view that has few takers in India.) The Kashmir angle The search for an equilibrium, which P.S. Suryanarayana describes as the search for “a positive tipping point”, is the subject of his new book. A researcher at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and formerly a long-time foreign correspondent of The Hindu based in Singapore and earlier in Islamabad, Suryanarayana has put together a collection of 10 essays, presented as separate chapters that examine stand-alone issues in the relationship, from the past to the future. While ostensibly a book on India-China ties, it heavily focuses on the role of a third country in this relationship: Pakistan. The author’s basic argument is that finding a happy equilibrium will not be possible until there is some sort of understanding with the third player in this equation. The book provides a deep account of how Kashmir figures in this three-way dynamic. Recent China-Pakistan developments, the author suggests, don’t bode very well for the India-China front. Indeed, it is the deepening China-Pakistan relationship that may well be driving the recent downturn in ties with China. Turning point Suryanarayana sees 2015 as a turning point. The Narendra Modi government coming to power in 2014 had generated much positivity in Beijing that with “two strong leaders” at the helm, both sides might be better placed to make headway on intractable issues such as the boundary question. In the author’s view, the “promise turned into a mirage” because of two events. In 2015, he writes, China’s President Xi Jinping “took Islamabad firmly under his wings” with the launch of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that came soon after Prime Minister Modi’s visit to China. The Doklam border crisis would follow two years later. CPEC, he suggests, underlines the primacy of the Kashmir issue and its inextricable link to broader security dilemmas. After the Pulwama attack in 2019, he notes, Beijing and Islamabad would agree “to take forceful measures” to safeguard CPEC. This has seen raised stakes for Beijing in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. “It was clear that China adopted from the beginning a proactive military posture to protect CPEC assets in disputed Gilgit-Baltistan,” he writes, which suggests “a new complexity may complicate the security dynamics of the China-India-Pakistan triangle”. The author argues that to arrive at a bilateral equilibrium would require finding a way to better accommodate the other’s core interests. For India, he writes, this includes Delhi’s “quest for political détente and peaceful coexistence” on the basis of “mutual and equal security”, balanced economic relations, and China’s acceptance of India in international institutions including the UNSC and Nuclear Suppliers Group, among others. China, on the other hand, seeks continued perpetuation of its sovereign control over Tibet, a ‘One-China Policy’ vis-à-vis Taiwan, limited depth in India-U.S. ties, and retention of “asymmetric advantages” over India. Reconciling these interests may indeed be a tall order. A “tipping point” would become “less elusive” in his view if “India could improve its comprehensive national strength”. Until then, Beijing might see less incentive to seek an accommodation and the current state of uncertainty may endure.  The Elusive Tipping Point: China-India Ties for a New Order P.S.

But my family is not at all encouraging me. I used to come first in all the races on school Sports Day, and during my +2, I even got selected for inter-college basketball tournament. But I needed to attend coaching classes every day at 5 p.m., and my parents did not like that. When you will study for IIT entrance exam, they asked. Then I got chance for swimming coaching, but my mother said I will get pneumonia if I spend too much time in water. Like that I lost all opportunities. Now seeing Olympic games and the graceful and powerful sportspersons from all countries, I am feeling terribly disappointed. I wish I could also be there. I am sure I could have won at least one medal.  —Fully Offended & Unhappy Lad        Dear FOUL  Relax. You will feel better when I tell you that you are not alone. The country is full of aspiring and able-bodied and agile men and women who can do very well in all sports. But the country is also full of parents, bureaucrats and officials who are even more aspiring and able-bodied and agile. To get past them you have to have the skills of a hurdler from Krypton. In other nations, people become award-winning sportspersons by only playing sports. If you do that in India, you will be a failure. If you want to be Usain Bolt, you need to learn multiple skills. ‘What is Akka saying,’ you are thinking. ‘I need to run, that’s all.’ And that is where you are very wrong. When I list all the skills you need, you will realise that JEE exam is easier. First of all, you need to vastly improve the speed of your typing. Throughout your career, you will be required to send hundreds of emails and applications to various government departments and sporting federations and sponsors. So please practise typing for one hour every day. Second, learn to supplicate. This is a stretching exercise to make your muscles and limbs supple and flexible. A successful sporting career means you have to constantly plead for things that you would otherwise get automatically in other nations. From shoes to training equipment to high-nutrition foods, getting each item involves repeating a specific asana many hundreds of times in many different government arenas. It boosts muscle strength tremendously. That’s why yoga is being encouraged these days. Third, learn how to share. Whether it is special foods or socks, sweatshirts or financial grants, officials will want a bit of it. For example, if you’re going to Berlin for a competition, be prepared to have three or four mandarins accompanying you. It’s their only chance of going to a foreign country. Polishing your sharing skills will also come in handy during training camps. Invariably there won’t be enough beds or bathrooms or boiled eggs for everybody. You will need to share. Fourth, learn how to say thank you. If you get a medal, you have to start by thanking the Prime Minister and work your way down. (You must also thank the PM for vaccine, 12th-century Hoysala temple and Amul butter, but you can practise that later.) Simultaneously, identify one famous actor to play your role in Bollywood film. If you are Malayali, find Punjabi actor. If you are Manipuri, find Punjabi actor. This will ensure unity in diversity. Then, last of all, practise running. Or shotput. Or whatever. As you can see, it isn’t easy. And that’s why India’s Olympics motto is Pitius, Deterus, Trollus.  — AA   agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/mental-marathon/article35660897.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Find the queen||Partner’s club shortness did not do much for the South hand, but it was still a terrific hand. Slam had to be a decent prospect opposite two key cards and four-card support. The opening club lead went to East’s queen and South’s ace. The slam was cold if the trumps split 2-1, but what if one opponent held three to the queen? Which high honour should declarer cash first? This is a recurring problem and experts will make that decision, when there is nothing to go on from the auction, by looking at the rest of the hand. Is there a way to save the contract should one opponent have a sure trump trick? The correct play on this deal is to cash the ace of hearts first. Why? Because the spade suit might still save the contract if there is a trump loser, and you can handle a 4-2 spade split when it is East who has three hearts. After the bad news in hearts, South cashed the king of spades and led a spade to dummy’s ace, followed by a third spade. Should East follow, South ruffs and has enough entries to dummy to set up an extra spade winner even if the suit splits 4-2. Eventually, South will be able to discard his losing diamond on a spade. Should East have only two spades he will be helpless. If he ruffs with his high trump, South will discard his diamond. Should East discard instead, South can continue to set up the extra spade trick the same way, always discarding his diamond if East ruffs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/find-the-queen/article35660901.ece

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Erroneous to conclude we have attained herd immunity’||The fourth sero survey conducted across India found that on an average 67.6% of the population has been infected. Also, over 25% of people have been vaccinated with one dose. In an email, Dr. Srinath Reddy, President of the Public Health Foundation of India and member of the National COVID-19 Technical Taskforce dispels the wrong notion that India is close to reaching herd immunity and explains the uncertainty of protection even among those already infected.  Nearly 29,000 people from the general population and over 7,200 healthcare workers were randomly tested from 70 districts across 21 States. How representative is the sampling for the whole country? Scientists from ICMR have clarified that this survey is not representative of the whole country. They have called for State-level, preferably district-level, surveys across the country using standardised methodology. If we wish to have a truly nationally representative survey, we must sample from every postal code area in the country, which is resource-intensive. The national surveys of ICMR are valuable, even if they are not fully representative of the whole country. By conducting repetitive surveys in the same districts, these studies provide information on how proportions of infected people in the population have increased over time. That helps us to understand how effective our efforts to contain viral transmission have been during the periods between surveys. The seroprevalence is 67.6%, which is far higher than the last survey figure of over 24%. But this is only an average and a couple of States such as Kerala and Maharashtra have far lower seroprevalence. So is it correct to assume that a vast percentage of the population is uniformly protected? There is a great deal of variation across the country, between States. If we do district-level surveys, we will find even greater variation. We must bear in mind that, while the sample size may be adequate at the national level, to provide estimates with a narrow uncertainty band (confidence interval), individual State sample numbers would be small and have wider uncertainty bands. If we accept the figures provided for each State, ignoring such concerns about wider uncertainty bands around the estimates, it is clear that there is no uniformity across the country. It would, however, be erroneous to conclude that all persons who tested positive are immune to infection by the virus. We do not know for sure how long the antibodies last either after infection or vaccination. More important, the tests employed in the surveys only identify antibodies to two viral proteins (nucleocapsid and the spike) but do not measure the ability of those antibodies to neutralise the virus. Estimating the neutralisation power is important in the context of the variants which are displaying capacity for evading the immune response. Will the antibodies produced against the wild ancestral virus infection in January or the Alpha variant in February be effective against the Delta virus in July? There is a possibility that some of those who tested positive for antibodies, especially children, may have cross-reactive antibodies generated by other corona viruses which produce common cold. Counter-posed against such ‘false positives’, we may also have ‘false negatives’ of persons in whom antibody levels may have fallen some months after infection but still may have immunity from memory T cells and other forms of cellular immunity. So, definitive conclusions about individual or population immunity should not be drawn from antibody surveys. Are there chances that people who were infected early last year might not have the antibodies and hence might have been missed by the latest survey? People who were infected early during the pandemic would have a greater chance of testing negative during surveys due to the waning of antibodies over time. The time taken for such disappearance has been variably reported to be between three and six months. There would be a great deal of individual variation, based on the dose of viral exposure, severity of the infection, nature of the variant, age of the infected person, associated health conditions and use of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for treatment during the illness. So, there are likely to be several persons who may have been infected some months ago but were missed by the recent survey. Will infection with the old strain provide sufficient protection particularly against the Delta variant? The answer has been provided by laboratory studies which have shown a diminished neutralisation efficacy of antibodies produced by previous infections against the Delta variant. The study by the Pasteur Institute in France is particularly informative in this regard. However, some protection is still likely. But we do not know how strong and long lasting that immunity would be in any individual, as there would be considerable variation among those infected. Will the metros in India with high seropositivity rate record a large number of cases if a third wave begins? There is no guarantee that seropositivity in a survey is a proof of permanent protection against fresh infection, especially when the virus is frequently changing form. Vaccines provide a greater assurance of protection than a previous infection with a variable viral dose and a different form of the virus than the one that is currently circulating. The numbers infected in the third wave will depend on the numbers of people still susceptible and the nature of variants in circulation. By adopting strong containment measures everywhere, we can protect the susceptible persons even against current and new variants. Is it at all correct to assume that large parts of the country are quite close to reaching herd immunity due to the high seropositivity rate? It is erroneous to conclude that we have attained herd immunity as a population, when there are many variations across the country even according to the antibody survey. This is for several reasons. We do not know if all who tested positive for antibodies have neutralising capacity against the currently circulating variants. We do not also know how long those antibodies will last. Even if the antibodies are protective today, that protection could fade in a month or two. The herd immunity threshold (HIT) for the more infectious Delta variant may be 85% or higher. We are below that level in all States that were surveyed. Considering that two-thirds of India is already infected and over 25% of adults have received one dose of the vaccine, will the third wave be as severe as the second wave? The third wave should be milder for those reasons, if no new variant sweeps through with higher infectivity and undiminished virulence. Even if there are many infections, the immunity provided by vaccines and prior viral exposure should reduce the risk of severe illness or death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/erroneous-to-conclude-we-have-attained-herd-immunity/article35660645.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Benefits beyond the pandemic||The human respiratory tract is a highly efficient oxygenation system with a large surface area and surplus capacity (if all 600 million alveoli are stretched out, they can cover a tennis court). The alveoli, lined by thin flat cells, are exposed to inhaled air on one side and de-oxygenated blood in capillaries on the other. This delicate system is exposed to inhaled noxious insults also – biological (bacterial, fungal, viral), chemical (smoke and particles) and allergy-inducing material (dust, pollen, animal fur), throughout life. As a consequence, many develop progressive lung damage and chronic lung disease – a very common non-communicable disease (NCD) with high morbidity and mortality ( approximately 30% of all NCD deaths). The COVID-19 pandemic taught us the vital importance of the face mask in preventing coronavirus infection. The Hindu was a pioneer to promote universal mask use, and, after initial reluctance, many organisations world-wide adopted this measure. We describe the multiple benefits of face mask beyond the pandemic. Effective intervention Some inhaled viral respiratory infections such as influenza have high mortality at extremes of age; others, like the ‘common cold’ are an important cause for loss of person-hours and productivity. Universal mask-use is an effective preventive intervention against such diseases – it does not completely prevent viral entry, but drastically reduces the viral dose – low doses serve to stimulate immunity with lowered risk of overt disease. With 7,00,00,000 tuberculosis (TB) cases annually, India is the TB capital of the world. TB is the commonest chronic respiratory infection, the most important infectious disease in India, with WHO-estimated annual 26,40,000 new cases, 4,36,000 deaths, 2.8% and 14% multi-drug-resistance in new and old cases, respectively ( 2019 data: https://tbfacts.org/tb-statistics-india/). TB bacilli, expelled by those with pulmonary TB while coughing or spitting are inhaled by others. Unlike viruses with short life-span in atmosphere, TB bacilli in sputum survive even in dried state, for days to weeks and get air-borne. If everyone wears a mask while outside home, spitting in public places and inhalation of TB bacilli will drastically come down. These two benefits – prevented viral infections and TB – can translate into considerably reduced acute and chronic respiratory diseases, loss of lives and livelihoods. India is also the diabetes capital of the world, with urban diabetes prevalence of over 10% in adults above age 40. Diabetes and TB are a deadly combination – each making the other worse – a vicious cycle that afflicts hundreds of thousands in India. Universal masking, continued beyond the pandemic, can minimise the risk of TB in diabetics. Our metros suffer high levels of air pollution with toxic particulate matter, causing progressive irreversible impairment of lung function. In Delhi, air pollution became so bad that Supreme Court had to intervene to improve matters on a war footing. While non-polluting motor vehicles, avoiding crop burning etc. are public health measures to curtail air pollution, face mask offers considerable protection from inhaling toxic particles and to a lesser extent even noxious fumes. Occupational hazard Some occupations expose individuals to inhalation of particulate asbestos, carbon, silica etc. which also progressively impair lung function -- appropriate face masks are an important health imperative for them. Smoking in public, although banned, continues to be a problem in India -- passive smoking puts even non-smokers at risk. Insistence on wearing a mask in public will be a deterrent to smoking and will protect smokers and non-smokers alike. Respiratory allergies As every physician knows, respiratory allergy – ‘allergic rhinitis’ and ‘extrinsic allergic asthma’, mostly due to inhaled ‘allergens’, are very common problems in children and adults, accounting for approximately 20% to 30% of all outpatient visits. Many with respiratory allergy, who consistently wore masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, have found considerable relief from chronic upper and lower respiratory symptoms and intend to continue using masks beyond the pandemic. Hospitals, with their concentration of patients with acute and chronic respiratory infections, pose an important health risk to people working there – a hazard highlighted by loss of lives of many health-care workers during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the risk of other hospital-acquired respiratory diseases cannot be under-rated. Routine use of face masks will certainly reduce the risk to health-care professionals, and should be practised beyond the pandemic. Even those who visit hospitals for healthcare – patients and their bystanders, at increased risk of contracting respiratory infections – will be well-advised to routinely use face masks during hospital visits. Indeed, the simple face mask, which ancient Jain Munis used and promoted, has multiple benefits well beyond the pandemic.  (Dr M .S.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Stellar mid-life crisis: What ails the middle-aged Sun?||Stars like our Sun can go through a mid-life crisis, according to new research carried out by scientists from IISER Kolkata. This can lead to dramatic changes in their activity and rotation rates. The study also provides an explanation for the breakdown of the long-established relation between rotation rate and age in middle-aged sunlike stars. The work has been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters . Stellar middle age At about 4.6 billion years of age, the sun is middle aged, that is, it will continue to live for roughly the same period. There are accurate methods for estimating the age of the Sun, such as by using radioactive dating of very old meteorites that have fallen on the Earth. However, for more distant stars which are similar in mass and age to the Sun, such methods are not possible. One of the methods used is called gyrochronology. There is a relationship between rotation rate and age, that is the rotation rate of a star slows down with age. When the stellar wind escapes from the star, it carries away with it a part of the angular momentum of the star, which results in its slowing down. The stellar wind has two drivers: one is the high temperature of the outer atmosphere of stars – the corona – which results in an outward expansion and hence plasma winds that emanate out. The other is the magnetic field. “The magnetic field actually heats the corona and so when magnetic activity is strong the winds are strong and since wind carries away the internal (rotational) angular momentum of the star, it slows down its rotation,” explains Dibyendu Nandi, one of the authors of the paper. This is called magnetic braking. As the star ages, due to this mechanism, its rotation slows down and this relationship is used in gyrochronology to estimate the age of the star. Age and spin However, there is a breakdown of the gyrochronology relationship, because after midlife, a star's rate of spin does not slow down with age as fast as it was slowing down earlier. Another intriguing fact is that the Sun’s activity level has been observed to be much lower than other stars of similar age. A third observation that is part of the puzzle is that there have also been periods in the past when extremely few sunspots were observed on the Sun for several years at a stretch. For instance, during the Maunder minimum which lasted from 1645 to 1715. The researchers use the dynamo models of field generation designed to explore long-term activity variations and come up with a theory that can possibly explain the above puzzles. According to a press release by the Royal Astronomical Society, they show that at about the age of the Sun, the magnetic field generation mechanism of stars becomes sub-critical or less efficient. This allows stars to exist in two distinct activity states – a low activity mode and an active mode. The star may thus fall into a low-activity mode and suffer drastically reduced angular momentum loss due to magnetized stellar wind. “We have a hypothesis, a theory backed by simulation results which seems to self-consistently explain the diverse puzzling behaviour witnessed in middle-aged stars. We have provided a clear demonstration that the theory can explain certain observations, and, therefore, is a leading contender [to throw light on] their origin. In the future, independent observations may reconfirm or deny our theory,” says Prof. Nandi.  Middle aged stars can exist in two distinct activity states – a low activity mode and an active mode. The star may thus fall into a low-activity mode and suffer reduced angular momentum loss||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/stellar-mid-life-crisis-what-ails-the-middle-aged-sun/article35660639.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Scientists decipher how some bacteria can operate a “reverse gear”||Indian scientists have found a theoretical model explaining a unique kind of motion, called direction reversing active motion, exhibited by some bacteria that feed on other microorganisms, according to a statement released by the the Department of Science and Technology on Friday. This analysis can help in building more efficient artificial micro- and nano-motors used in drug delivery and bio-imaging using the concept to incorporate a reverse gear. Bacteria move by propelling themselves with a velocity that changes direction randomly, which is called active motion. Besides bacteria, this kind of motion is found in living systems ranging from cells at the microscopic scale to the flocking of birds and fish schools at the macroscopic scale. It is also seen in artificial systems, including granular matter self-catalytic swimmers, and nano-motors. Some microorganisms, such as predator bacteria Myxococcus Xanthus and saprotrophic bacteria Pseudomonas putida, exhibit a unique kind of reversing active motion, whereby, in addition to a diffusive change of direction, the motion also completely reverses its direction intermittently, it said.However, very little has been understood theoretically about the statistical properties of such motion. Novel dynamic phase In a recent study published as a letter in the Physical Review E, a team of scientists from Raman Research Institute and S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences has uncovered novel dynamical phases arising from the interplay of diffusion and velocity reversal in the direction-reversing active motion exhibited by such bacteria. The study provided a theoretical understanding of such motion through exact analytical results for the position distribution and target search-time distribution by using a model, the statement said. "This model explains the advantage of directional reversals, namely, faster spread leading to faster searches," the authors pointed out. The authors explained how their research found that M Xanthus relies on the directional reversal to increase its spread, thus making search for a target efficient, in spite of a much slower speed (about a micron per minute) compared to faster bacteria like E. coli (which moves about 30 microns in a second). Further, the most important finding of this work is the prediction of a novel phase where the dynamical laws governing the dispersion along two orthogonal directions are fundamentally different.  This model explains the advantage of directional reversals, namely, faster spread leading to faster searches||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/scientists-decipher-how-some-bacteria-can-operate-a-reverse-gear/article35660634.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Clues from Mars||How does the interior of Mars look like? Since early 2019, researchers from ETH Zurich have been recording and analysing marsquakes as part of the InSight mission. Using this data, they have now measured the red planet’s crust, mantle and core. The data will help understand the formation and evolution of Mars and, by extension, the entire solar system. The researchers have discovered that the Martian crust under the probe’s landing site near the Martian equator is between 15 and 47 kilometres thick. Such a thin crust must contain a relatively high proportion of radioactive elements, which calls into question previous models of the chemical composition of the entire crust. The mantle is 400–600 kilometres down, twice as thick as that of Earth. This could be because there is now only one continental plate on Mars, in contrast to Earth with its seven large mobile plates. The measurements also show that the Martian mantle has a mineralogy similar to Earth’s upper mantle. The seismology reveals differences in chemical composition. The Martian mantle, for example, contains more iron than the Earth’s. The Martian core has a radius of about 1,840 kilometres, making it a good 200 kilometres larger than had been assumed 15 years ago, when the InSight mission was planned. The researchers were now able to recalculate the size of the core using seismic waves. “Having determined the radius of the core, we can now calculate its density,” Simon Stähler of ETH Zurich says in a release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/clues-from-mars/article35660637.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Voices from Maximum City||Raghu Karnad fondly recalls how, out of the blue, he and a friend chanced upon dolphins off the Bandra Bandstand rocks. “It struck me suddenly that we in Mumbai see the sea as scenery, as a backdrop, and not as a living world filled with creatures that are our neighbours,” says the writer and journalist. This sense of wonder was one of the starting points of Marine Lines , a 10-part podcast that Karnad (who won the 2019 Windham-Campbell Prize in the non-fiction category) is hosting. Produced by the Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic and DeadAnt Studios, it explores the city’s “hidden worlds, from the suburbs to the sea”. The conversations cover specific spaces (like the Sanjay Gandhi National Park), the creatures that inhabit them (everything from leopards to sea slugs), as well as broader topics such as urban consumption patterns and sustainability. They seek to introduce listeners to ecosystems that they may not have given a second thought to. “The podcast was pitched to me by the producers who wanted to explore Mumbai’s natural spaces and ecosystems, and I leapt at the idea,” says Karnad over the phone, adding that they recorded most of the episodes during the second wave, in April. “One of the things that I felt deprived of during that time, psychologically, was access to public, shared spaces. So the opportunity to have these conversations, to imagine I’m there with experts who’ve spent a lot of time documenting these areas, appealed to me,” he says. The three episodes so far have featured marine wildlife photographer Shaunak Modi (also director of the Coastal Conservation Foundation), actor Dia Mirza (also UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador), and wildlife biologist Nikit Surve. Future guests include writer Amitav Ghosh, director Paromita Vohra, and film critic Anupama Chopra. The magic of the ordinary Karnad’s guests not only document their own experiences with the natural world, but also point out the various ways in which the lives of entire communities intersect with environmental issues. For example, Surve’s podcast mentions his brief encounter with a young Warli girl living in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, who was nonplussed at seeing a leopard pass by. “I had so many emotions running through me, but she was so casual. She said that leopards often walk past their home, and the next morning we discovered that there’s even a local deity, Waghoba [in Marathi, ‘ wagh ’ covers both tigers and leopards]. For them, the leopard isn’t something out of the ordinary,” he said. Similarly, Mirza’s episode highlighted the various out-of-the-ordinary wildlife sightings during the global lockdown in 2020: a direct result of drastically reduced human activity. “The puma sightings in Chile, the jackals in Tel Aviv, the dolphins spotted in Italian waters and, of course, right here at Marine Drive,” she reminded listeners.     How does one convince the average urban dweller to think a little more about the environment, especially spaces in their immediate proximity? That’s the problem Marine Lines wants to tackle. It is as much of an outreach issue as a scientific one, which is where the podcast can be a great resource: the conversations are accessible and broad-ranging, yet rooted in distinctive spaces. The host comes across not as an expert, but as someone learning with the audience. He says, “Shaunak Modi had this great line in the first episode: ‘You don’t protect what you don’t love and you can’t love what you don’t know exists.’ It made such an impression on me and the producers, and we treated it like our motto for the remaining nine episodes. It captures much of our problems and what we’re trying to do with this podcast.” Although this batch of 10 episodes is Mumbai-centric, Karnad, who grew up in Bengaluru, hopes to host similar conversations for other cities. “I’d love to be able to do them for Delhi — it has The Ridge [in the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor], rivers, and more green spaces than Mumbai,” says the host, whose fourth episode — with Ganesh Nakhawa, chairman of the Purse Seine Fishing Welfare Association — dropped on July 30.

01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Olympics in the classroom||“Aunty, do you know that when Michael Phelps was small, he was scared of water?” piped up a young voice in class. We were chatting about the greatest Olympian of all time. “And Simone Biles was adopted, my mother told me,” added another, incidentally an adoptee herself. As a story educator, I have come to realise this wonderful way to introduce past and present athletes to children of all ages, opening a window into lives so different from their own. With the torch lit and the Olympic spirit in full force, it wasn’t difficult to turn their attention to a few specific picture biographies. The Story of Simone Biles by Rachelle Burk (2020, Rockridge Press) charts her life from a foster child to the greatest gymnast in the world. Wilma Unlimited: How Wilma Rudolph Became the World’s Fastest Woman by Kathleen Krull (1996) documents the journey of a child with polio to that of an Olympic gold medallist. Stories from Greek mythology have always been popular in my area of work as children are fascinated by how they trace the etymology of common words and expressions. Last week, we began with how the ancient Olympics were held in honour of Zeus; of Kallipateira, who defied the stringent laws that did not allow married women to watch the Olympics, so she could watch her son compete; and Pheidippides the messenger’s run at the Battle of Marathon, a historical event which today’s race commemorates. These stories created a huge buzz about the Games among my students, as they tracked its journey to its modern avatar. The new Olympic motto, ‘Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together’ also helps them learn to appreciate our diverse world.  The backstory : The Story of the Olympics by Mina Lacey (2010) is perfect for younger children, while Richard Brassey’s book by the same name (2011) will satisfy the curiosity of the older ones. You Wouldn’t Want to be a Greek Athlete by Micheal Ford (2004) places the reader in the story, dealing with the nudity and violence of the ancient games deftly and with humour that both educates and entertains. Key events such as the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, and Goddess Nike on the medals, have all piqued a deeper interest in Greek mythology. The Hour of the Olympics (1998) and its companion book Ancient Greece and the Olympians from theMagic Tree Houseseries (2004) are a perfect combination of fiction and non-fiction reads.  Indian athletes: Sportswomen like weightlifter Mirabai Chanu — who won a silver on day one, badminton player PV Sindhu, and boxer Mary Kom have sown little dreams in the hearts and minds of my students. While, unfortunately, there are no books available about current athletes, India at the Olympics by Seetha Natesh (2021, Harper Children’s) celebrates 100 years of Indian athletes’ participation in the games. Shuttling to the Top: The Story of PV Sindhu by Krishnaswamy V (2020, HarperSport) and Unbreakable by MC Mary Kom (2013) are inspiring reads for teens.  Geography : The Olympics offer the perfect opportunity for children interested in geography  to familiarise themselves with the location of the countries and their flags. A good picture atlas and book of flags are invaluable resources to have on hand. Children’s Picture Atlas by Collin Kids (Collins, 2019) and The Book of Flags by Rob Colson (2017) are great options.  Culture: The host country, Japan, with its unique heritage on display at the opening ceremony had the children talking about manga, anime and a host of cartoons. Japanese folktales like The Boy Who Drew Cats by Anushka Ravishankar and Christine Kastl (2009), and Urashima Taro and Other Japanese Children’s Favourite Stories by Florence Sakade (2018) will give them a peek into the country’s rich traditions.  Science: Does Farting Make You Faster? by Glenn Murphy (2012) and The Secret Science of Sports by Jennifer Swanson (2021, Black Dog & Leventhal) are my choices to keep a child fascinated by the science of sport.  Poetry: I cannot resist suggesting the fun book of Olympic Poems: 100% Unofficial by Brian Moses and Roger Stevens (2016), as this is a genre not appreciated by many of my children.  Inclusivity : What Are The Paralympic Games? by Gail Herman (2020, Penguin Workshop) details why the paralympics was started, while two Indian published sports themed books Against All Odds by Ramendra Kumar (2016) and Kittu’s Very Bad Day by Harshikaa Udasi (2017) appreciate diverse abilities.

01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women beat officers bring in sense of security, comfort||In 26 years of her service in Delhi Police, this is the first time that Head Constable Sunita has been made a beat officer. She is three months pregnant, but she chose to be a beat officer when asked a month ago. In a first, all 11 police stations in North West district of the Capital has four women beat officers each — including a Sub-Inspector, Assistant Sub-Inspector, Head Constable and Constable — as part of an initiative undertaken by DCP (North-West) Usha Rangnani. The officials share their experience of being beat officers. “There are so many times that male officers ask us to come along because they believe we will be able to handle the situation better. Things have really improved for us,” said Constable Monika Yadav (29). Ms. Yadav is posted in Ashok Vihar police station while her sister is a Constable in the East district. “It was our mother’s dream that we join police.” Talking about a typical day, Constable Kiran (38) who is posted in the Bharat Nagar police station — very calm yet firm in her command — said she reports to the police station as per her shift for the day and then proceeds to her beat where she and Constable Rinku take a few rounds of the area — mostly residential with a hospital, temples and a market. They then stay at their booth and move around the area every few hours. “Seeing women officers, people would initially ask us if we are there only for show-off. We told them it will be a regular affair now and so far, the response has been good from both men and women,” Ms. Kiran said. ‘A matter of assurance’ Seeing a women officer in public is a matter of assurance for other women that they are not alone, Constable Preeti (25) posted in Ashok Vihar police station. “They feel safer and comfortable. For them, approaching us is a lot easier than approaching a male officer. Women have felt so proud that they have come forward to take selfies. I remember a mother of a little girl told me that the child wanted to be a police officer when she grew up,” she smiled. Sharing another experience, Constable Monika said they received a PCR call in her beat area and the caller — a woman — refused to open the door to male staff. But when Ms. Monika reached and spoke to her from outside the gate, she opened it. Using fear tactics Constable Rinku remembered ending a fight between a rickshaw puller and his neighbours. “I intervened and used fear tactics,” she said. With women beat officers, senior citizens in their areas feel a lot more at ease, they said. Constable Rinku receives a call from an 83-year-old woman almost every day “just to talk” because she doesn’t have people to talk to. “We give our personal numbers to senior citizens in our areas. A few days ago, an aunt called me and asked me to come home. When I went, she wanted to feed me gol gappas she had made. I was touched,” the official said. Constable Uma Mehra is posted in Mukherjee Nagar police station. The area has girls’ hostels and paying guest accommodations for students studying in the North Campus and many preparing for Civil Services examinations. In presence of Ms. Mehra and Constable Poonam Singh Bora, women in the area reportedly feel safe. “We have met many girls in the last four weeks and they feel a lot better. They don’t have to come to the police station physically for every little complaint. Often, we meet them and resolve their issues,” she said. The beat officers also receive calls from house helps who share their problems, including harassment by unknown men and domestic issues. Residents’ Welfare Association members also call the officers and appreciate them, they said. Families of all of the officials are extremely supportive of their work, they all claimed. “Our families also realise that times are changing. They support us no matter irrespective of our job timings,” said Head Constable Sunita. At the police station, the officials have a scooty at their disposal whenever they are at work. A senior officer said crime prevention and detection have increased significantly because of this initiative of deploying dedicated women beat officers. “We can see the crime numbers falling — thefts, snatching, molestation — and people feeling secure. Women officers are practically more sincere than male officers,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/women-beat-officers-bring-in-sense-of-security-comfort/article35661057.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Is RBI planning a digital currency for India?||The story so far: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently said it will begin testing its own digital currency. In a speech, RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar delved deep into the reasons for introducing a digital rupee and the possible risks. Several economies, including the U.S., the European Union and China, have been working to issue their own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The Bahamas launched the world’s first CBDC last year. What is a Central Bank Digital Currency? A CBDC is no different from the cash that we hold in our wallets, except that it exists in a digital form in a digital wallet supervised by the central bank. Economically, the digital rupee is similar to rupee coins and notes. It is simply a form of fiat currency that is backed by the central bank and does not possess any intrinsic value. In fact, it is similar to private digital currencies in the sense that people accept these currencies merely because they believe that others will also accept them. It should be noted that the RBI’s digital rupee will not directly replace demand deposits held in banks. Physical cash will continue to be used by banks and people wishing to withdraw cash from banks can still do so. But they can also opt to convert their bank deposits into the new digital rupee. Why are central banks issuing digital currencies? Central banks claim that there is increasing demand for digital currencies. CBDCs are promised as sovereign-backed alternatives to private currencies, which are unregulated. Critics, however, note that the demand for private currencies comes mainly from people who have lost faith in fiat currencies. They say central banks have been creating too much money, forcing many to switch to private currencies whose supply is limited by design. Central banks also believe that the cost of issuing electronic CBDCs is far lower than the cost of printing and distributing cash. Another likely reason for the introduction of CBDCs is that they can be easily tracked by authorities. What are the risks in adopting CBDCs? Central bankers fear that people may begin withdrawing money from their bank accounts as CBDCs become more popular. Many depositors currently use bank accounts to safely store their money. When CBDCs can serve the same purpose, people could move money out of banks. What could check this is the interest offered by banks. The withdrawal of bank deposits can also affect the amount of loans created by banks. However, this could happen not simply because banks will have fewer cash deposits to lend to borrowers. Contrary to popular belief, banks do not loan out actual cash deposits. Instead, they use cash deposits as a base on which they create a pyramid of electronic loans far in excess of the cash deposits. So, banks hold lesser cash in their vaults than what their depositors and borrowers could demand from them. The real reason banks will be able to create fewer loans is that when customers convert their bank money into CBDCs, banks will be forced to surrender at least some cash and will thus possess an even smaller cash base on which to create loans. Also, when bank customers convert their deposits into CBDCs, the RBI will have to take these liabilities onto its own balance sheet. What lies ahead? Central banks may cap the amount of money that an individual can hold in the form of CBDCs and also impose negative penalties to prevent the mass withdrawal of deposits from banks. Central banks may also have to inject money into banks so that their ability to create loans is not compromised. As noted earlier, banks’ cash reserves determine the amount of loans they can create. Interestingly, CBDCs could eventually take over the role that cash reserves play in the current banking system as more and more physical cash gets converted into CBDCs and are deposited in banks. In that case, both CBDCs and electronic loans created would simply be digital forms of the same currency. This could eliminate the risk of bank runs as banks will then no longer have to satisfy the cash demands of customers. But it can also lead to rampant money creation by banks.   Central banks are promising sovereign-backed alternatives to private currencies, which are unregulated. Critics, however, note that the demand for private currencies comes from people who have lost faith in fiat currencies||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/is-rbi-planning-a-digital-currency-for-india/article35660571.ece
01 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Govt. busy in event management’||The Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, on Saturday said in the name of the new education policy, the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party (BJP-JJP) government was only doing ‘event management’ and nothing concrete was being done to improve the standard of education. “Education standards have been plummeting continuously in Haryana since the BJP government came to power. Instead of opening new schools, the government has closed several. About 50,000 posts are lying vacant in the education department. The fact is that 50% of the schools do not even have a head teacher. In such a situation, it is only unfortunate that the BJP-JJP government is celebrating the new education policy,” he said here. ‘Education hub’ Mr. Hooda said Haryana was emerging as a global education hub during the Congress government. “We established one central university, seven State universities, 23 deemed universities, 35 government colleges, 481 technical institutes, six medical colleges, 132 ITIs, 2,623 schools in the State. We established Rajiv Gandhi Education City project and students started coming to Haryana for education,” he said. “Education is critical to creating new opportunities and our government had laid the foundation for the bright future of Haryana. It is painful that not a single such project or institution came to Haryana in seven years of the BJP government. On the contrary, works on institutions sanctioned during the Congress government were suspended and cancelled during the present government,” he said. Rural schools closed Mr. Hooda said ‘Kisan Model Schools’ were also started to improve the level of education in rural areas during the Congress government, but these were closed by the BJP government. “The Aarohi schools started during the Congress government have also been brought on the verge of closure. The standard of education cannot be raised without strengthening the basic infrastructure of education. The NITI Aayog report shows that Haryana has lagged behind the neighbouring States.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-busy-in-event-management/article35661049.ece
01 August 2021||August 01 2021 00:00 IST,||End-to-end genome sequencing||The story so far: On May 27, a preprint titled “The complete sequence of the human genome” was posted in the online repository bioRxiv . In this preprint, scientists from the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium, an international collaboration of around 30 institutions, reported the most complete sequencing of the human genome until now. They have, in the process, discovered over a hundred new genes that code for proteins. The total size of the genome they have sequenced is close to 3.05 billion base pairs. This adds 200 million base pairs to the last draft of the human genome that was published in 2013. The results come with the caveat that about 0.3% may still have errors, and that among the sex chromosomes, only the X chromosome has been sequenced. What is significant about this announcement? The Human Genome Project that began in 1990 gave the first results of the complete human genome sequence in 2003. For the first time, we were able to read the blueprint of human life. However, though it was announced as the complete human genome, about 15% of it was incomplete. Due to limitations of technology, scientists were not able to piece together some repetitive parts of the human genome. Solving some of the problems, an updated “complete” version was released in 2013, which still missed out on 8% of the genome. Now, the researchers have nearly completed the job, adding 200 million base pairs and 115 new protein-coding genes to the list. What is special about protein-coding genes? The human genome is the entire set of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) belonging to a human. This resides in the nucleus of every cell of the human being. The DNA consists of a double-stranded molecule, each of which is built up by four bases – adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Every base on one strand pairs with a complementary base on the other strand (A pairs only with T, and C only with G). In all, the genome is made up of 3.05 billion such base pairs, approximately. Of these, there are long stretches that do not seem to have a particular function. On the other hand, protein-coding sequences or protein-coding genes are DNA sequences that get transcribed on ribonucleic acid (RNA) as an intermediate step. These in turn make the proteins responsible for various functions such as keeping the body healthy or determining the colour of the eye — proteins carry out the instructions encoded in the genes. Whose DNA was sequenced? The DNA used did not belong to any person. According to a report in Nature , it was a cell line derived from a tissue known as a complete hydatidiform mole. This is the tissue that forms when a sperm inseminates an egg that has no nucleus. Hence, this tissue has the chromosomes of just the father. What are the gaps in the study? For one thing, it has no information about the Y chromosome. We know that all chromosomes in an arbitrary cell’s nucleus are found in pairs – we have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. However, the sex cells such as sperm and egg cells contain only one of each pair of chromosomes (haploid cells). So, while egg cells always carry a copy of the X chromosome, sperms can carry either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. The cell line that the researchers studied had an X chromosome only and no Y chromosome. Therefore, information about the Y chromosome is missing in this release. It is also not 100% complete. The researchers say that about 0.3% of the genome may have errors. What will this genome draft be useful for? One of the most important uses of this release will be that it forms a standard for comparison in future sequencing attempts, according to Dr. Satyajit Rath, a visiting faculty member at Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, and an expert on immunology. Just as the standard of time is given by the beats of a caesium clock placed in the International Bureau of Standards, this sequence of the human genome will be a gold standard of reference for future attempts. The level of accuracy is unprecedented and while earlier, people were trying to piece together strands of DNA that were a few hundred base pairs long, the technology used by the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium used sequencing technology that could scan 20,000 base pairs at one go. This is a significant technological feat.  One of the most important uses of this release will be that it forms a standard for comparison in future sequencing attempts, according to Dr. Satyajit Rath, an expert on immunology||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/end-to-end-genome-sequencing/article35660569.ece
01 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gangster wanted in more than 25 cases finally in police net||Delhi Police Special Cell nabbed a wanted gangster on Friday in an operation they called D-24. The Haryana-based criminal, Kala Jathedi, who had a bounty reward of Rs. 6 lakh on his head was arrested along with his accomplice Anuradha Chaudhary, the police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Manishi Chandra said that Jathedi was wanted in more than 25 cases across States — was arrested with Chaudhary near Sarsawa toll at Saharanpur-Yamuna Nagar highway in Uttar Pradesh. Describing the operation, Mr. Chandra said that in the last year and a half, the team has already apprehended 20 important members of the gang in different operations. Interrogations of previously arrested criminals led to drawing up of an operation for nabbing the kingpin Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi. Team trail work The team worked for over four months before it came across some leads in Goa. The team started trailing the identifiers from Goa and the search led them to Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand. “They were finally able to grab a footage which showed Kala Jathedi in a Sikh attire along with Anuradha. Thereafter, the operation was code-named ‘Op D-24’ to signify that the criminal was running ahead of us by only 24 hours and it was a race against time to reduce this to D-20/16/12 and so on,” Mr. Chandra said.  The police said that after the escape of Jathedi from Haryana Police custody in 2020, he and Anuradha alias Revolver Rani were jointly heading a major international criminal alliance. Under disguise Talking about Anuradha, the police said that she has a long criminal history of abduction, extortion, Arms and Excise Act violations, cheating and is known to have fired from AK-47 to intimidate victims. After spreading rumours that he had fled the country, Jathedi had disguised himself as a Sikh and started growing a beard and wearing a turban, the police said, adding that after Anuradha Chaudhary joined him. They got fake identities as husband and wife and were constantly shifting bases across different States to avoid any trail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gangster-wanted-in-more-than-25-cases-finally-in-police-net/article35661053.ece
