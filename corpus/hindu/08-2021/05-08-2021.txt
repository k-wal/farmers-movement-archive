05 August 2021||New Delhi,||Oppn. rejects Venkaiah’s truce offer to discuss farmer protests||The Opposition parties on Wednesday sent out their message in one voice — a debate in Parliament on the alleged Pegasus cyberattack first, rejecting a peace deal offered by Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu. Five Bills — three in the Rajya Sabha and two in the Lok Sabha — were passed amidst shrill protests from Opposition members holding placards and shouting slogans against the government. “The opposition parties stand firm and united on their demand for a discussion on Pegasus issue in both the Houses, replied to by the Home Minister, as this has national security dimensions,” said a joint statement issued by the Congress, Trinamool Congress, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD, NCP, Shiv Sena, National Conference, IUML, CPI(M), CPI, Aam Aadmi Party, Revolutionary Socialist Party and Loktantrik Janata Dal. It stated, “The opposition has also unequivocally conveyed that the discussion on the farmers’ issues and agitations arising from the three anti-farmer and black agri-laws should follow the discussion on Pegasus.” Mr. Naidu offered truce by admitting the motion under Rule 267 to suspend the business of the day to discuss the ongoing farmers’ agitation, following a meeting with the Opposition leaders and the government. But the Opposition snubbed the offer. Mr. Naidu, reading out the names of those who had moved notices to debate various issues, said that he was admitting the notices given under rule 267 (to set aside the business of the day to debate a certain issue) by Ramgopal Yadav and Vishambhar Prasad Nishad of the Samajwadi Party and V. Sivadasan of the CPI(M) over the farmers’ agitation on the three farm laws. “I have gone through it. It is an ongoing issue but important. So it is admitted for discussion,” he said. The notices submitted by Trinamool’s Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, Mallikarjun Kharge and K.C. Venugopal of the Congress, CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem and Mr. Sivadasan, and Binoy Viswam of the CPI over the Pegasus issue were rejected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/opposition-rejects-naidus-truce-offer-to-discuss-farmer-protests/article35735423.ece
05 August 2021||BENGALURU,||Bommai inducts 29 into Cabinet||After intense political manoeuvring over two days, Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai expanded his Cabinet on Wednesday by inducting 29 Ministers. This is the highest number to be sworn in in one go in the recent past. With this,Mr. Bommai has managed to put in place almost a full-fledged Ministry within eight days of becoming the Chief Minister, with only four berths vacant. The new Ministers were administered the oath by Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday afternoon. The Chief Minister said portfolios would be allocated to the Ministers in a day or two. A highlight of the new team is that the recent practice of appointing Deputy Chief Ministers has been given a go-by, though there was a proposal to appoint three or four earlier. The plan was shelved by the party high command given that there were too many contenders. One of the reasons being attributed for the time taken to finalise the ministerial composition is the alleged demand by the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to give a ministerial post to his son B.Y. Vijayendra. However, the party high command reportedly rejected the demand for now, as he is yet to become a legislator and also his elder brother is already an MP. Nothing drastic Though speculations were rife that there would be a complete rejig of the old Ministry led by Mr. Yediyurappa by leaving out most seniors, Mr. Bommai did not resort anything drastic. However, while veteran leaders such as K.S. Eshwarappa and V. Somanna are part of the team, seven former Ministers, including Jagadish Shettar, S. Suresh Kumar, Aravind Limbavali, and C.P. Yogeshwar besides the former Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi are not in the new Ministry. Among others who did not find a place in the Ministry are both Mr. Yediyurappa’s detractors, including Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and Aravind Bellad, as well as his close aides such as M.P. Renukacharya and Nehru Olekar. Meanwhile, six new faces have been included. There is near status quo with respect to ministerial berths for legislators who had come from other parties to help the BJP form its government, with two dropped and one new face inducted. Community combination But what has taken a beating in the process of ministerial expansion is regional representation as 13 of the total 31 districts do not have any Ministers. The party leadership attributes this to compulsion of giving ministerial berths to MLAs who came from outside as this has limited the Chief Minister’s choices. In terms of community combination, the team has nine Lingayats, including the Chief Minister, seven Vokkaligas, seven OBCs, three SCs and an ST.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bommai-inducts-29-into-cabinet/article35735443.ece
05 August 2021||HUBBALLI,||Farmers of 14 villages again oppose KIADB move to acquire land||Opposing the acquisition of farmland in 14 villages of Dharwad taluk under the proposed Suvarna Karnataka Corridor, which is part of Bengaluru Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC), residents of the 14 villages staged a protest in Dharwad on Wednesday. Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) has initiated the land acquisition proceedings and the residents of these villages have registered their opposition earlier too. And, on Wednesday, they again staged a protest under the aegis of BMEC Bhooswadhina Horata Samiti and Raita Krishi Karmikara Sanghatane (RKS) affiliated to All India Krishak Khet Mazdoor Sanghatan (AIKKMS), in front of the office of KIADB in Dharwad. Staging the protest, they raised slogans that they would not part with their fertile land for the economic corridor project. Addressing the protestors, district president of RKS Laxman Jadagannavar said that KIADB had initiated the process of acquiring fertile land of farmers of these 14 villages located along National Highway No 4. Already, farmers have registered their opposition to the project. Although there are court orders that prohibited acquisition of fertile land on the pretext of development, the KIADB was going ahead with the process of acquiring fertile land, he said. Mr. Jadagannavar said that as per law, the government can acquire land that are unfit for farming. However, in this case, the process has been initiated in clear violation of court orders. He said that there is a need for farmers of these villages to unite and set up committees to systematically fight land acquisition. District secretary of RKS Sharanu Gonawar said that land acquisition is being carried out in the most undemocratic and unscientific manner. Mr. Gonawar said that farmers are being threatened in the name of COVID-19 and that they will be issued notice for protesting in violation of the health protocol. However, it was the wrong move by KIADB officials that has forced farmers to congregate in large numbers and protest. Responding to their plea, KIADB officials clarified that the acquisition will be carried out only with the consent of farmers and their objection letters will be sent to the State government. An altercation followed this clarification. However, subsequently, farmers said that they will once again submit their objection letters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-of-14-villages-again-oppose-kiadb-move-to-acquire-land/article35735716.ece

05 August 2021||CHENNAI,||T.N. to provide 7.5% quota to government school students in professional courses||The Tamil Nadu government has decided to introduce 7.5% horizontal reservation for students of government schools in admissions to engineering, agriculture, veterinary and fisheries courses from the coming academic year. A similar reservation policy is already being implemented in medical admissions since the 2020-21 academic year. At a meeting of the State Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin at the Secretariat on Wednesday, it was decided that a Bill seeking to provide reservation for government school students would be introduced in the Assembly session this month. “The admission rate of students from government schools in these courses was found to be low, and the government asked a Commission, headed by Justice Murugesan, to study the reason behind this and suggest remedies. The government accepted his recommendations and decided to introduce 7.5% reservation for government school students in professional courses,” an official press release said. A senior official said that while government school students accounted for around 3% of the tally of students in such professional courses, the figure was not even 0.5% at premier institutions in the State. This factor also contributed to the government’s move. The Cabinet also decided to present a separate Budget for agriculture in the coming Assembly session, as promised by the DMK in its poll manifesto. The Budget will be presented on August 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-to-provide-75-quota-to-government-school-students-in-professional-courses/article35735505.ece
05 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. allows shops to open for six days||The government has allowed traders to open for business on all days except Sunday. The administration would impose ‘triple lockdown’ only in areas that report more than 10 new COVID-19 cases a week among a local population of 1,000. The government has lifted the Sunday weekend lockdown on August 15 and 22, given Independence Day and Onam. It has extended shop timings from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. However, traders should ensure that customers obey the protocol. They should assign 25 square feet of space to a single customer. Ideally, only persons who are RT-PCR negative or have already received at least one dose of the vaccine should visit shops. The ban on indoor dining remains. However, hotels could give takeaways and set tables in the open or serve food inside parked cars. The accent is on home delivery and processing orders online. Theatres, schools, colleges, tuition centres, and shopping malls would remain closed for now. Hotels and resorts could admit vaccinated guests following the COVID-19 protocol on all days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-allows-shops-to-open-for-six-days/article35735766.ece
05 August 2021||New Delhi,||L-G’s meeting with officials irks Kejriwal||The Delhi government and Raj Niwas found themselves at loggerheads yet again on Wednesday after Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal chaired a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation in the national capital. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused Mr. Baijal of holding a “parallel meeting behind the back” of the elected government and asked the L-G to “respect democracy”. “Reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Delhi and future preparedness with Chief Secretary, ACS (Home&Health), Divisional Commissioner, Secretary (Health), MD-DMRC & other officials concerned,” the L-G tweeted. In response, Mr. Kejriwal posted, “It is against Constitution n SC CB judgement to hold such parallel meetings behind the back of elected govt. We r a democracy. People hv elected a Council of Ministers. If u have any Qs, pl ask ur ministers. Avoid holding direct meetings wid officers Lets respect democracy, Sir (sic).” According to a senior government official present at the meeting, Mr. Baijal advised the Health Department to ensure commissioning of all PSA plants, LMO storage tanks and cryogenic bottling plants latest by August 31. The L-G also asked the officials to make provisions for adequate buffer of medicines for treatment of COVID-19 and black fungus. According to the official, the L-G expressed concern over reported violation of COVID-appropriate behaviour in metro and other means of public transport and advised the Divisional Commissioner, Delhi Police and MD, DMRC, to ensure that protocols are strictly enforced. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, in a letter to the L-G on July 17, had alleged that Mr. Baijal was chairing meetings on matters in the domain of the elected government without informing the Minister concerned. In response, the L-G had termed these “insinuations and statements” devoid of “any merit and without any evidence”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lets-respect-democracy-kejriwal-tells-l-g/article35735588.ece
05 August 2021||Mumbai,||Mumbai gets its first genome sequencing lab||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday inaugurated Mumbai’s first next-generation genome sequencing (NGS) laboratory at the civic-run Nair Hospital. Mr. Thackeray dedicated the unit to the public and launched another project to provide Spinraza treatment to people with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), as part of the hospital’s centenary celebrations. He also released Rage Against The Dying Of The Light , a book authored by Dr. Shishir Srivastav, an alumnus of the hospital. NGS is a method of characterisation of pathogens. This technology is used to determine the order of nucleotides in genomes or targeted regions of RNA or DNA. It helps in understanding differences between two strains of the virus, thereby identifying mutants. Its speciality is that a large number of samples can be processed in a short time at high speed. Mr. Thackeray said, “In the current pandemic, this test has many benefits, especially in hotspots, and in unique clinical presentations. Identification of mutants and variants in the virus can be established, enabling public health policy decisions.” The equipment has been donated by Illumina, U.S., through Albright Stonebridge Group (ASG), and ATE Chandra Foundation, and facilitated by Nair hospital alumnus Dr. Mehul Mehta, a retinal surgeon at Harvard Medical School and CEO of ASG. Illumina has donated two genome sequencing 9 Nextgen 2000 units, NextSeq reagents, a rapid bioinformatics analysis platform and four years of servicing worth Rs. 6.4 crores. This is part of Illumina’s broader philanthropic drive to provide access to the technology across the world.  Spinraza therapy Nair hospital said the California-based NGO, Direct Relief, is providing the new drug Nusinersen (Spinraza) for treatment of SMA under the Spinraza Individual Patient Humanitarian Access Program. An independent, international Medical Expert Committee of SMA specialists has selected 17 most eligible candidates for Spinraza. The drug will be imported by August for administering it to patients. Seven doses are given in the first year of the treatment, followed by three doses every year after, for the rest of the patient’s life, the hospital said. “All injections will be administered by the intrathecal route. At present, a single dose of injection of Spinraza costs Rs. 87 lakh. The total annual cost of the therapy for one patient is nearly Rs. 6 crore in the first year and nearly Rs. 3.2 crore in subsequent years. Once selected, the patient will receive this therapy lifelong,” the hospital added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mumbai-gets-its-first-genome-sequencing-lab/article35736018.ece
05 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Rajbhar denies alliance prospects with BJP but keeps option open||Two years after Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party president Om Prakash Rajbhar was sacked from the Uttar Pradesh government led by the BJP following his rebellion before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the OBC leader seems to be inching towards his old ally again. The speculation was triggered after Mr. Rajbhar called upon BJP’s Uttar Pradesh president Swatantra Dev Singh on Tuesday. The SBSP chief described the one-hour meeting as a courtesy visit but admitted that politics was on the table. “I come from the ‘ pichdi jati (backward caste)’. He also comes from the ‘ pichdi jati ’. So we often have these courtesy meetings,” he said. Though Mr. Rajbhar dismissed that he would join hands with the BJP for the 2022 Assembly poll, he laced it with a caveat. He told a news channel that he would consider an alliance with the BJP if it fulfilled his five demands, including having an OBC Chief Minister. “Let the BJP implement these. After that I will think about it. But not before it because I have tasted betrayal,” he said. SBSP general secretary and Mr. Rajbhar’s son, Arvind Rajbhar, issued a statement on Wednesday ruling out an alliance with the BJP. “The SBSP will not have any alliance with the Bharatiya ‘Jhooth’ Party [BJP]. The meeting was personal. Yes, political discussion was held. BJP [U.P.] president said 2022 will be difficult without you,” Mr. Arvind Rajbhar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rajbhar-denies-alliance-prospects-with-bjp-but-keeps-option-open/article35735593.ece
05 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||COVID third wave may not hit Telangana till December, says DPH||Two of the most asked questions these days is will COVID-19 third wave set in Telangana, and if so, when can it be expected. State Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao has estimated that the third wave might not set in till December. However, this estimation is conditional. The senior health official said that the time period depends on whether people take precautions against COVID-19, and if they get vaccinated against it. While the onus now lies with the people, equal responsibility is on politicians. Though second wave has declined in the State, it is still active with around 600-650 new infections in a day. People, Health Care Workers (HCW), and others have pointed out on multiple occasions in the recent past that people are congregating in large numbers for marriages, festival celebrations, political events, and at pubs. Scores of people were seen not masking up, or did not maintain physical distancing. All this points out that COVID-appropriate behaviour is not being maintained by everyone, which means one of the two conditions to prevent the third wave in not fulfilled. Second condition There are around 3.5 crore people in the State. Of them, 2.2 crore people, who are above 18 years, are eligible to get jab against COVID. The vaccination programme was rolled out on January 16 this year. In the six-and-half-months, 51.3% (1.13 crore) of the 2.2 crore eligible beneficiaries were given at least one dose of the vaccine. And of the 1.13 crore, 36.41 lakh people took the second dose. One crore more people are yet to be vaccinated. The senior official said that new variants of coronavirus are seen when large section of people are not immunised, or do not have antibodies to fight the virus. “No one knows how long the antibodies (in vaccinated and infected) last. Booster dose might be needed. This is one of the reasons we urge people to take precautions against COVID-19 despite getting vaccinated or infected, so that there is no spread,” Dr Srinivasa said, explaining the relation between precautions, new variants, and immunity. The precautions have to be observed more so by people who are susceptible: those not infected with coronavirus, or did not get vaccinated yet. In other words, those who do not have immunity against the infectious disease come under the ‘susceptible’ category. Focal point of preventing the third wave is vaccination, and COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.  New variants of coronavirus are seen when large section of people are not immunised, or do not have antibodies to fight the virus.

05 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Temples in Kukke Subrahmanya, Dharmasthala and Kateel to remain closed on weekends||The Dakshina Kannada administration has barred entry of devotees on Saturdays and Sundays to temples in three popular pilgrimage centres — Kukke Subrahmanya, Dharmasthala and Kateel — till August 15 to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the district. Besides weekend closure of temples at these locations, the administration has barred all kinds of sevas, utsavs, distribution of tirtha and prasada as well as annadana at these temples during weekdays when they remain open between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Devotees can only have darshan of deities during weekdays, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said in his order issued under Section 144 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 34 of the Disaster Management Act on Wednesday. Rituals On Saturdays and Sundays, the temple authorities are allowed to conduct routine rituals with the help of archaks, while the entry of devotees has been completely barred. Hotels and lodges in these places are also prohibited from extending accommodation to devotees on weekends. During the weekdays also, those intending to avail of lodging facilities should compulsorily produce COVID-19 test negative certificate obtained through RT-PCR process that is not older than 72 hours, Dr. Rajendra said. No additional occupants are allowed in lodging rooms to ensure social distancing, he added. Sri Subrahmanya Temple at Kukke Subrahmanya, Sri Manjunatha Temple at Dharmasthala and Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple at Kateel attract a large number of devotees every day from across the State and elsewhere. The numbers swell in multiples of thousands during weekends and the administration a fortnight ago itself indicated that it may impose curbs on visitors. Dr. Rajendra said that despite strict enforcement of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour in the district after the government threw open several activities, the number of positive cases is on the rise. If stringent measures are not taken now itself, it may become difficult to handle the situation when a possible third wave hits the region. Already, COVID-19 test negative certificate has been made mandatory for people from Kerala visiting Karnataka and more restrictions are being found necessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/temples-in-kukke-subrahmanya-dharmasthala-and-kateel-to-remain-closed-on-weekends/article35735871.ece

At the opening session of the two-day IBSA Coffee Festival on Wednesday, ICO executive director Jose Sette said India, Brazil, and South Africa have several opportunities to work together to address common issues they face in the coffee growing, processing, and marketing fronts. Suresh K. Reddy, Ambassador of India in Brazil, said coffee production had increased 34% in that country in the last two decades although the area under production had only reduced. Indian coffee community had to adopt cost-effective growing techniques and yield enhancing practices from Brazil, he recommended. India’s per capita coffee consumption is around 200 grams while it is 6 kg in Brazil. Andre Aranha Correa do Lago, Ambassador of Brazil in New Delhi, said, India was beginning to see a lot of speciality coffee coming via exports and this would open up newer opportunities for coffee entrepreneurs in India to process, value add, and re-export.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nations-should-jointly-combat-issues-in-coffee-sector/article35735900.ece

At the opening session of the two-day IBSA Coffee Festival on Wednesday, ICO executive director Jose Sette said India, Brazil, and South Africa had several opportunities to work together to address common issues they face in the coffee growing, processing, and marketing fronts. India produced over 3,20,000 tonnes of green coffee in the last harvest season that ended in March 2021. Karnataka alone accounts for over 70% of the country’s total coffee production, with Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, and Hassan districts being the State’s coffee heartlands. Coffee Board chairman M.S. Boje Gowda said, “It is great that we are joining hands with the international coffee community to improve the coffee scene of India and this exercise means a lot for coffee farmers across the country, and especially for an army of them in Karnataka.” Suresh K. Reddy, Ambassador of India in Brazil, said coffee production had increased 34% in that country in the last two decades although the area under production had only reduced. Indian coffee community had to adopt cost-effective growing techniques and yield enhancing practices from Brazil, he recommended. “We are also looking forward to collaborating with Brazil in enhancing domestic consumption of coffee in India,” said Mr. Reddy. India’s per capita coffee consumption is around 200 grams while it is 6 kg in Brazil. Mr. Reddy further said time had come for the commodity apex body, Coffee Board, to position itself as a holistic organisation for the overall development, promotion, and growth of Indian coffee. Jaideep Sarkar, High Commissioner of India in South Africa, said under the free trade agreements of WTO regime, it was tough for individual governments to promote their own coffees beyond a point and therefore working together was the best option for the global coffee growing community. Andre Aranha Correa do Lago, Ambassador of Brazil in New Delhi, said, India was beginning to see a lot of speciality coffee coming via exports and this would open up newer opportunities for coffee entrepreneurs in India to process, value add, and re-export. “We want to be part of the growing India coffee story and IBSA is an ideal platform for a unique partnership between these coffee producing countries,” Mr. Lago added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nations-should-jointly-combat-issues-in-coffee-sector/article35735441.ece

The party has pointed out that Mr. Banerjee was on his way to Tripureswari Temple in Agartala when “he came under violent attack from certain anti-social elements who had placed themselves on the route”. “What was shocking was that the anti-social elements, while holding BJP flags, were carrying iron rods and sticks and other articles which were meant to cause harm to Shri Abhishek Banerjee.” The complaint claims that the attack was “meticulously planned by the ruling dispensation in Tripura”. The TMC has demanded the registration of an FIR and an investigation resulting in the arrest of the perpetrators. Ever since a team of representatives of the Indian-Political Action Committee were allegedly not allowed to go out of a hotel in Agartala and charged by the Tripura administration, the TMC has sent three teams to the State. It has made it clear that it has set its eyes on the 2023 Assembly polls in the northeastern State. TMC supporters staged protests in Kolkata and other parts of the State over the alleged attack on the convoy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tmc-seeks-action-against-perpetrators-of-attack-on-abhishek-banerjees-convoy/article35735821.ece

05 August 2021||Chennai,||Dahiya storms into final, India assured of another medal||It was a gripping Wednesday for India at the Tokyo Olympics, and Ravi Kumar Dahiya led the charge. The wrestler registered a sensational triumph against Kazakhstan’s Nurislam Sanayev in the freestyle 57 kg semifinal bout and grappled his way into Thursday’s final against Russia’s Zaur Uguev. India is assured of a silver. Trailing 2-9, Dahiya reduced the deficit to 7-9 before pinning his opponent down; he was eventually declared ‘winner by fall’. The 23-year-old from Haryana became the second Indian wrestler to qualify for an Olympic final, his predecessor being Sushil Kumar at the London Games in 2012. Dahiya’s effort capped a remarkable day for the Indian contingent in which its medal hopes never waned. Lovlina Borgohain lost the women’s welterweight (64-69 kg) semifinal to Turkey’s Busenaz Surmeneli, but the boxer from Assam already had the bronze in her kitty by virtue of having qualified for the last-four stage. Bronze would be the target for the women’s hockey team too after its 1-2 defeat to in the semifinal. In Friday’s third place play-off, India will play Great Britain. India’s medal hopes gained a fillip through Neeraj Chopra’s maiden throw of 86.65m in javelin. It ensured his qualification for the final. The automatic qualification was pegged at 83.5m and Neeraj went past that without fuss.

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI recuses himself from A.P.-Telangana case||Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana on Wednesday recused himself from hearing a petition filed by Andhra Pradesh accusing Telangana of depriving its people of their legitimate share of water for drinking and irrigation. The Chief Justice, who said he hailed from both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, withdrew after A.P. rejected the court’s suggestion to send the case for mediation. “The matter requires adjudication,” advocate G. Umapathy, for Andhra Pradesh, informed the Bench, also comprising Justice Surya Kant. “In that case, if you do not want mediation, I cannot hear this case. Let it be listed before another Bench,” the CJI said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, said that he personally and the government had “full faith” in the Chief Justice in the case and urged him to not recuse. “Thank you, but I cannot hear this case,” Chief Justice Ramana said. In the previous hearing, he asked the Andhra Pradesh counsel to get instructions on whether they wanted the case to be sent for mediation or continue with the adjudication. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who represented the State, had asked for some time to get instructions. ‘KRMB directions ignored’ A.P., in the petition filed through counsel Mahfooz A. Nazki, accused Telangana of refusing to follow the decisions taken on river water management in the Apex Council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act of 2014. It said its neighbour also ignored the directions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), constituted under the 2014 Act and directions of the Centre. “Fundamental rights, including right to life of its citizens, are being seriously impaired and infringed on account of unconstitutional, illegal and unjust acts on the part of the State of Telangana and its officials, resulting in the citizens of the State of Andhra Pradesh being deprived of their legitimate share of water for drinking and irrigation purposes,” the plea said. The focus of the petition is a Telangana Government Order (G.O.) of June 28 that said, “To tap more hydel generation in the State, the government has taken a decision to generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity”. A.P. said the G.O. was issued only days after the Ministry of Jal Shakti, in a communication on June 17 to Director (Hydel), TSGENCO, urged the latter “to stop further release of water immediately through Srisailam Left Power House and follow the water release orders issued by KRMB, except in case of extreme grid urgency”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cji-recuses-himself-from-ap-telangana-case/article35735421.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Efforts to track emerging COVID-19 variants shrink||While the second wave is yet to trough and there are signs that a third wave may be round the corner, India’s efforts to sequence genomes to track for emerging variants plummeted after April. Data from the National SARS-CoV-2 Genome Consortium (INSACOG), a network of 28 labs across the country equipped to sequence genomes of the coronavirus for emerging variants, shows that in July, only 184 genomes were sequenced. In June, 4,381 samples were sequenced, which is itself a stark decline from May (13,142 samples) and April (15,546 samples). The latter two months were when India bore the brunt of the second wave that saw daily cases grow to as many as 4,00,000. As of July 30, INSACOG had sequenced 58,240 genomes, of which 46,124 samples had been analysed and their lineages (variant history) ascertained and submitted to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), according to the response to a question in the Lok Sabha. However, INSACOG data visible on a website maintained by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the key INSACOG labs, shows 49,770 genomes as having been analysed and assigned to 232 lineages. These numbers include genomes sequenced by Kerala and Maharashtra, which have their own genome surveillance programmes. In absolute numbers, Maharashtra accounts for a fifth of the national genomes surveyed and Kerala about a tenth. Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, which coordinates INSACOG, said that the numbers available on the public website weren’t the latest for June and July. “This is not the complete data for June or July. So this gives you data only of sequences analysed and this is not real-time. We now have a real-time portal and soon its link will be available,” she told The Hindu . A scientist from one of the INSACOG labs said that there was always a lag in when the samples from a region, from any month, were analysed, and that there would an increase in July samples in the coming weeks. However, there are challenges in the programme. The INSACOG initiative was originally planned for three months, and because the project has only recently been extended, the funds available to labs for carrying out sequencing were delayed. The other reason, this source said, was that many States were not sending samples: “The National Centre for Disease Control has specified that at least 300 samples should be sent from each State per month. Very few States are actually complying with this directive.” The Health Ministry said in the Lok Sabha last week that the existing guidelines were to sequence 15 samples from every sentinel site in every 15 days from each State so that districts are represented from an epidemiological point of view. Every State is expected to have 10 such sentinel sites, which are notified laboratories and tertiary care hospitals. “This is a more diverse sampling strategy as against a random 5% sample sequencing,” the Ministry noted. The INSACOG database has the contribution of 28 States and Union Territories. Thus, ideally, there ought to be 8,400 samples a month, which as the numbers for June and July suggest, are far below the requirement. The dominant variant across India continues to be the Delta variant but limited sequencing means that it will be impossible to track if new variants may be driving surges. Currently, Kerala reports about half the daily caseload, and rising trajectories are seen in several northeastern States. Meghalaya, Mizoram, Assam andTripura have each contributed less than 200 samples for genome sequencing, according to the INSACOG database.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/efforts-to-track-emerging-covid-19-variants-shrink/article35735418.ece

05 August 2021||Kolkata,||Amenities await Bengal’s long-distance bus travellers||West Bengal aims to make long-distance road travel within the State more passenger-friendly by introducing facilities normally not expected in government-run buses. Starting Thursday, on a trial basis, the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) will provide passengers travelling in its Volvo AC buses on the Kolkata-Bolpur-Suri route (Santiniketan is located in Bolpur) with a free 500ml bottle of drinking water. Additional bottles will be chargeable. “Moreover, a small newspaper room would be provided. Ten newspapers — in Bengali, Hindi and English — will be kept in each bus for the benefit of passengers during their journey,” said WBTC managing director Rajanvir Singh Kapur.  “There will also be a small food corner, stocked with biscuits, chips and other snacks. Passengers can buy these instead of waiting for the bus to stop. The whole idea is to make the journey a little comfortable,” he said. These facilities would be eventually extended to Volvo AC buses running on all long routes. The WBTC runs many long routes to tourist destinations such as Bolpur, Digha, Mayapur and Bakkhali. Commuter-friendly steps “There are also plans to provide free WiFi in all long-route buses, starting with AC Volvos,” he said. Mr. Kapur, ever since he took charge as the WBTC MD in January 2020, has initiated a string of commuter-friendly measures. Early this year, the WBTC launched a daily travel pass entitling passengers to unlimited travel in Kolkata’s buses, trams and ferries. The Travelpass costs Rs. 100 and benefits particularly those wanting to explore different corners of Kolkata and also get a taste of tram travel and a ride across the River Hooghly. He is also the brain behind Tram World Kolkata, a cultural centre planned in the still-functional Gariahat tram depot, where 12 trams are on display, their interiors exhibiting pictures from the bygone era.

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Air Quality Commission Bill for National Capital Region cleared||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Bill to formalise the Commission for Air Quality Management For National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas. The body has a full time chairperson and a range of members consisting of both representatives from several Ministries as well as independent experts and will have the final say on evolving policy and issuing directions to address air pollution in Delhi and the adjoining regions. The Centre, facing flak earlier this year from farmers protesting the farm laws, had committed to removing a clause in the Air Commission Bill that would penalise farmers for burning stubble, an important contributor to noxious air quality. The text of the Bill does away with this clause. The body first came into being in October, 2020 on the back of an ordinance — a temporary measure — and the law requires that a formal Bill be presented to Parliament within six weeks of it reconvening — in this case — January 29 when the Budget Session began. Before a Bill is tabled in Parliament, it needs to be approved by the Union Cabinet. However, in spite of several Cabinet meetings since January, it wasn’t taken up for discussion due to which, the tenure of the body expired, without ever making it to Parliament. As The Hindu had reported in March, members who were part of the Commission said they were taken aback by the sudden dissolution of the body. The dissolution happened despite the nodal Union Environment Ministry submitting the paper work to the Union Cabinet Secretariat, required to give legal backing to the Commission. The Commission was revived on April 13 after another ordinance was promulgated by the President.  The Centre had said the new organisation would be a ‘permanent’ body to address pollution in the National Capital Region Delhi and address sources of pollution in Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The all-powerful body assumed several powers to coordinate action among States, levy fines — ranging up to Rs. 1 crore or five years of prison — to address air pollution. While the Central Pollution Control Board and its State branches have the powers to implement provisions of the Environment Protection Act for air, water and land pollution, in case of dispute or a clash of jurisdictions, the Commission’s writ would prevail specific to matters concerning air pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/air-quality-commission-bill-for-national-capital-region-cleared/article35735149.ece
05 August 2021||Srinagar,||2 years on as U.T., Kashmir militancy yet to wane||As Jammu and Kashmir completes two years as a Union Territory (UT), militancy remains a major challenge to the security apparatus amid growing fears that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is likely to increase the striking capabilities of militant outfits, especially the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM). Official data accessed by The Hindu suggested that J&K saw 82 militant recruitments in the first seven months, with the JeM’s focus growing on capital Srinagar, where it managed local recruits around three or four. Earlier, the JeM would focus on the Pulwama-Awantipora-Tral belt in south Kashmir. In 2020, 163 locals were recruited into the militant ranks. “JeM’s strength in J&K is 44, including 10 locals and 34 foreigners. We managed to kill seven JeM terrorists so far, including two foreigners and five locals. JeM No.1 and No. 2 were killed recently,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar told The Hindu .  Though more than 60% recruits hail from districts in south Kashmir, there is growing recruitment in Srinagar, where the frequency of militant attacks saw a major spur this year, and in north Kashmir as well. In a sustained pressure maintained by the security agencies by launching multiple anti-militancy operations every day, at least 89 militants were killed so far, including the top brass of most of the militant outfits operating in the Valley. In July, 31 militants were killed in 15 encounters. However, a fresh list of 10 local militants released by the police again highlighted that local militants continue to command and control outfits such as the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the The Resistance Front (TRF) in the Valley. The wanted list included Hizb chief Farooq Nali, LeT chief Riyaz Ahmad Dar and TRF chief Abbas Sheikh.  According to the police record, Sheikh, a resident of Rampora Qaimoh in Kulgam, is the ‘operational chief commander’ of the TRF and is involved in more than 30 FIRs. “Sheikh is a recycled terrorist,” a police report said. A recycled militant is one who is arrested for his activities and jailed, but rejoins the militant ranks after his release.  Meanwhile, multiple security agencies are working on an on-ground assessment of the likely fallout of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A police officer suggested fears were growing within the security apparatus over the JeM and the HuM augmenting their striking capabilities. “Both the outfits are known for attacks in Kashmir. They have their cadres fighting along with Taliban. If the Taliban takes over Kabul, the fallout is likely to grow starker,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-years-on-as-ut-kashmir-militancy-yet-to-wane/article35735351.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||50% funds allotted for ongoing MPLADS projects lapse||Virtually half of the belated Rs. 2,200 crore allotted for completing the ongoing MPLADS projects in 2020-21 simply lapsed as the Finance Ministry granted “barely a week” to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) to release the funds — inviting the ire of the Standing Committee on Finance. The resultant funding crunch would have hit several local area development projects under implementation across the country, especially in the five States that went to polls this year as no funds were released for these States and constituencies citing the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). Spending under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) had already halved before the government suspended the scheme for two years in April last year and diverted the funds for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. From Rs. 5,012 crore spent during 2018-19, expenditure of just Rs. 2,491.45 crore was taken up under the scheme in 2019-20. Unfinished projects Each MP is granted Rs. 5 crore under the scheme, adding up to Rs. 3,950 crore a year for 790 MPs, to undertake development projects in their respective constituencies. After the scheme’s suspension, several MPs and parliamentary committees, including the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), had asked the government to release MPLADS funds due from previous years for projects already sanctioned. On March 16 this year, an SCF report on the Statistics Ministry’s demands for grants pointed out that many MPLADS projects that began earlier were “left unfinished midway despite the sanction letters being issued and funds for the same were withheld”, citing the suspension of the scheme. The panel had sought the release of funds for these projects so that MPs could fulfil their promises to the public. Condition attached The very same day, the Department of Expenditure (DoE) conveyed its intent to allot Rs. 2,200 crore for such projects to the Statistics Ministry. However, the actual allotment of funds by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) took place on March 22, with the condition that the funds must be spent or allotted further for eligible projects “within financial year 2020-21 itself, so that the amount is not lapsed”. The Statistics Ministry said it cleared eligible proposals received till March 31 noon, amounting to Rs. 1,107.5 crore, leading to the balance Rs. 1,092.5 crore lapsing. In a fresh report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, the SCF headed by BJP MP Jayant Sinha has sharply criticised this “ad-hocism” and noted: “The Committee are unable to comprehend the reason as to why Rs. 2,200 crore were allotted to MoSPI barely one week before the end of FY 2020-21… This constitutes a serious lapse in fiscal management with negative consequences for communities across India.” “Only those proposals which were not found eligible due to lack of documents and non-fulfilment of eligibility criteria as per MPLADS guidelines, and in those districts where the Model Code of Conduct was under implementation due to Assembly elections in five States/UT and by-elections in some constituencies, the Ministry was not able to release pending instalments,” MoSPI informed the committee. The Statistics Ministry said it wrote to the Finance Ministry on April 7, to allot the remaining funds towards MPLADS this year so that the pending instalments as on March 31, 2020, may be released. ‘Tighten norms’ The Finance Ministry has also asked the Statistics Ministry to further tighten the scheme’s guidelines by September this year, so that “if a work sanctioned by an MP is not used for five years, it will automatically lapse even if there is a committed liability for the work to be completed”. Currently, funds released to district authorities under MPLADS is not lapsable, while funds not released by the government in a particular year are carried forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/50-funds-allotted-for-ongoing-mplads-projects-lapse/article35735375.ece
05 August 2021||Kolkata,||PM calls Mamata on flood situation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday spoke to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the flood situation in south Bengal. “PM @narendramodi spoke to WB CM @MamataOfficial on the flood situation caused by water discharge from dams in parts of the state. PM assured all possible support from the Centre to help mitigate the situation. PM Modi prays for the safety and wellbeing of those in affected areas,” the Prime Minister’s Office tweeted. Hours after the conversation, Ms. Banerjee wrote to Mr. Modi urging “for a holistic and long-term solution” to ensure that West Bengal was “spared the regular devastation and suffering from man-made floods perpetrated by huge release from the DVC [Damodar Valley Corporation] dams”. “Moreover, despite the State being regularly ravaged by natural disasters in the form of cyclones and ‘man-made’ floods, which we are presently witnessing, no financial help has been forthcoming from the Centre. The State has to cope with compensating the loss of lives and property from our current resources,” she said. Ms. Banerjee referred to the low pressure resulting in high rainfall in West Bengal and Jharkhand, but emphasised that nearly 2 lakh cusecs of water was discharged from the Panchet, Maithon and Tenughat dams of the DVC, leading to severe flooding of huge areas in Hooghly, Howrah, Purba Bardhaman, Paschim Bardhaman, Birbhum and Paschim Medinipur districts. She alleged that heavy release from the DVC dams had led to “man-made” floods year after year in 2015, 2017, 2019 and now in 2021. In the letter, Ms. Banerjee referred to the loss of 16 lives, unprecedented displacement, suffering and loss of livelihoods. During the day, she was supposed to conduct an aerial survey of the flood-affected region, but the helicopter could not take off due to adverse weather. She visited Amta block in Howrah district by road and spoke to the locals. “When the situation improves, I will visit Khankhul [flood-affected area in Hooghly district]. I will advise the administration to rescue the people in advance before the areas get flooded. We will extend all help to people. You all can see there are lightning strikes. The situation is not favourable, “she told people, standing in ankle-deep water. She said Ministers and local representatives have been asked to visit the flood-affected regions. Along with the Chief Minister, Minister Manas Bhuniya and Ghatal MP Dev visited the areas. Teams of the NDRF and the Army have also been deployed to rescue people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-calls-mamata-on-flood-situation/article35735373.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||RTE entitlements to be paid through cash transfers||The Centre plans to pay students their Right to Education (RTE) entitlements in the form of cash transfers as part of a revamp and extension of its flagship school education scheme that was approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday. The Samagra Shiksha scheme, which has been extended till March 2026, will have a financial outlay of Rs. 2.94 lakh crore, including a Central share of Rs. 1.85 lakh crore, and several new initiatives on early childhood education, foundational literacy, and numeracy and language education. Higher Central share Samagra Shiksha is an integrated scheme for 11.6 lakh government and aided schools with over 15 crore students and 57 lakh teachers. It involves a 60:40 split in funding between the Centre and most States. The Centre’s share now works out to about Rs. 37,080 crore per year, higher than the amounts allocated over the last three years. “In order to enhance the direct outreach of the scheme, all child-centric interventions will be provided directly to the students through DBT [or direct benefit transfer] mode on an IT-based platform over a period of time,” said an official statement issued after the Cabinet meeting. This DBT would include RTE entitlements such as textbooks, uniforms and transport allowance, Education Ministry officials told The Hindu , although it is not clear whether the tuition fees for students in the economically weaker section quota in private schools would also be paid directly to students as a cash transfer. The stipend for children with special needs will be paid in this mode, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rte-entitlements-to-be-paid-through-cash-transfers/article35735363.ece

Things came to a head after the House was adjourned at 3:15 p.m. Four of the six members tried to enter the chamber. MP Arpita Ghosh, sources said, in the melee ended up breaking the glass door of the chamber. The glass splinters hit a security officer in her neck causing minor abrasions. “After the House was adjourned for the day, 4 of us 6 Trinamool MPs who were suspended for the day, tried to enter Rajya Sabha. We were prevented from doing so. Our suspension was over once the House was adjourned for the day. Why were we stopped ? Democracy hits new low #Parliament,” TMC MP Dola Sen tweeted.

While Assam has nominated Ministers Atul Bora and Ashok Singhal for the meeting, Mizoram has not named its representatives. “Two of my senior colleagues… will visit Aizawl tomorrow (August 5) with message of peace from people of Assam,” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted on Thursday. His Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga responded by tweeting, “I am sure important steps will be achieved for the solution of the border problem.” The messages from the two Chief Ministers coincided with a heated exchange between the ruling and Opposition members of the Assam Assembly over the boundary clash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-mizoram-ministers-to-discuss-boundary-conflict/article35735159.ece

In a statement issued on the eve of the second anniversary of the reading down of Article 370 that gave special status to J&K, Gupkar alliance spokesman M.Y. Tarigami said, “Unconscionable suppression of civil and democratic rights continues unabated, indiscriminate arrests and harassment of all sections of our people, including employees on different pretexts continues. An ‘adverse police report’ cannot be a substitute for being found guilty in a court of law. This amounts to violation of the most sacred principles of the justice system”. Mr. Tarigami said the BJP’s ‘Naya Kashmir’ slogan “is a joke now”. “By demolishing the Constitution of J&K, it had crossed all the limits of constitutionality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/past-two-years-saw-people-being-silenced-losing-jobs/article35735165.ece

Lokur and former Kashmir interlocutor Radha Kumar, who head the Forum for Human Rights in J&K, have warned that “human rights abuses will continue unchecked till J&K remains under a Lieutenant-Governor administration and without an elected government”. The report said, “Most of the rights violations, including arbitrary detentions, prohibition on Assembly, remain valid still. Close to 1,000 people are still in prison, including minors and elected legislators. The J&K administration added a new vigilantism against government employees, whose social media content is now subject to police scrutiny for ‘anti-national activities’, potentially leading to dismissal. Eighteen government employees have already been dismissed”. The report was released a day ahead of J&K completing two years as a Union Territory. The report suggested that the June 24 meeting between J&K leaders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “raised hopes”. “The PM’s offer, however, fell far short of expectations,” it said. It pointed out that the ceasefire agreement between Indian and Pakistani Directors-General of Military Operations “restricted the infiltration by armed groups and raised hopes of a peace process”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-rights-abuse-will-go-on-until-elected-govt-is-in-place-report/article35735166.ece

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||In about one hour, RS passes 3 Bills||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed three Bills in about one hour, while the Opposition continued its protest against the government on the Pegasus spyware issue and demanded the repeal of the three farm laws. The Bills were introduced, discussed and passed amid din. The House was also adjourned for 15 minutes in that time. Asked to speak on the Bills, many of the Opposition MPs chose to raise the issues they have been protesting over, leading to the chair cutting them short. The Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill 2021, which seeks to encourage the start-up ecosystem and further boost ease of doing business, was cleared. The Bill was passed in 20 minutes with neither the speeches of the members nor the reply by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clearly audible. Demands for a division were ignored as Deputy Chairman Harivansh said the House was not in order. Sujeet Kumar (BJD), Kanakmadela Ravindra Kumar (TDP) and M. Thambidurai (AIADMK) spoke briefly in support of the Bill. The Rajya Sabha also passed the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 after a brief discussion, amid disruptions from the Opposition. Ms. Sitharaman said it was in the interest of small depositors. The House also passed the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which would change the definition of “major airport” and allow the government to club together smaller airports. Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the Bill would include airports in smaller cities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-about-one-hour-rs-passes-3-bills/article35735147.ece

Responding to a question on electoral reforms, the Law Minister, in a written reply, said the Law Commission in its 244th and 255th reports had extensively dealt with the subject. “The Election Commission of India has proposed to link the electoral roll with the Aadhaar ecosystem with a view to curbing the menace of multiple enrolment of the same person at difference places. The matter is under consideration of the government,” he said to a specific question. The Minister also answered separate questions on the pendency of cases and the advice given to government departments that are engaged in a number of litigations. Talking about pendency of cases, the Minister said according to the information available on National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), over 3.93 crore cases were pending in the lower and subordinate courts as of July 30 this year. “No time frame has been prescribed for disposal of various kinds of cases by the respective courts,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ec-proposal-to-link-electoral-roll-with-aadhaar-under-study/article35735152.ece
05 August 2021||New Delhi,||Assam CM’s ‘expansionist’ tendencies cause of clashes: MP||Assam is illegally occupying more than 509 sq. miles of the Mizo territory, Mizo National Front (MNF) Rajya Sabha member K. Vanlalvena said in an interview with The Hindu . He blamed Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s “expansionist” tendencies for the recent flare-up between Mizoram and Assam. On July 26, an exchange of fire between the police forces of both the States left six Assam policemen and a civilian dead, and 60 injured. Assam claimed that the firing was one-sided and unprovoked, while Mizoram said they had retaliated to the aggression by the Assam police. Mr. Vanlalvena was booked by the Assam police for his public comments on the clashes, where he said the Mizoram police should have “killed them all”. The case has been withdrawn now as the two sides are trying to work out a peace deal. The MNF government in Mizoram is backed by the BJP. When asked if the BJP was responsible for this recent flare-up, Mr. Vanlalvena said, “I cannot pin the blame on any one party. I think we have reached this situation because of the uncontrolled influx of the Bangladeshis. The population of ‘infiltrators’ is now 60% in Assam”. The July 26 clashes, Mr. Vanlalvena said, had been in the making for the last several months. He said the Assam police made several “incursions” into the Mizo Territory. In total, he said, 509 sq. miles of Mizo area had been captured by Assam. “This is part of the expansion policy of the newly elected Assam CM. During the recent campaign for Assembly election, he had promised to provide land to rehabilitate the Bangladeshi immigrants. And since he cannot accommodate them in his State, he wants to expand further into our territory,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-cms-expansionist-tendencies-cause-of-clashes-mp/article35735352.ece

The scheme raises the amount from Rs. 12,500 to Rs. 50,000 for grievous injuries, and from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 for death where the vehicle responsible for a crash can’t be traced. The scheme supersedes the Solatium Scheme, 1989. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has sought comments from stakeholders in 30 days. The proposed scheme provides a timeline of 60 days for conducting an inquiry and settling a claim from the time an application is made. The compensation will be awarded from a dedicated account for such accidents under the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-gratia-for-hit-and-run-cases-likely-to-increase/article35735161.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India witnessing growth in legal landscape: CJI||Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana on Wednesday said the legal profession was no longer a career of “last resort” and India was witnessing an unprecedented growth in the legal landscape, especially in commercial law. “Despite the pandemic in 2020, India recorded over 350 mergers and acquisitions deals worth $ 37.5 billion. The cross-border deal activity recorded over 140 transactions with deal values worth $21 billion. Moreover, 2020 saw record private equity deal-making activity in India, with investments worth $40 billion, 28% higher than the previous record witnessed in 2019, with around 950 deals,” he noted. As a first-generation lawyer himself, the CJI stated, he was at the receiving end of scepticism about his career choice. “People would ask ‘why are you studying law?’, ‘did you not get any employment elsewhere?’, ‘do you not want to get married?’” he said. For a first-generation lawyer, a sustainable practice in courts was a dream that was rarely realised. Therefore, it was often considered as a degree of last resort. “Speaking from personal experience, due to lack of resources, most of us learnt while practising,” Chief Justice Ramana observed in his virtual address during the release of a coffee-table book of the Indian Society of Law Firms. The event was also graced by Attorney General K.K. Venugopal and senior advocate Fali Nariman. Chief Justice Ramana said law firms have been in the forefront of the country’s economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-witnessing-growth-in-legal-landscape-cji/article35735361.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nod for continuation of Fast Track Special Courts||The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the continuation of 1,023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) for another two years, at an outlay of Rs. 1,572.86 crore. The Centre’s share of Rs. 971.70 crore will come from the Nirbhaya Fund. Since October 2019, the Department of Justice of the Ministry of Law and Justice has been implementing the Centrally sponsored scheme for expeditious trial and disposal of pending cases of rape and offences against children under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012. The scheme includes 389 FTSCs exclusively for POCSO cases. Each FTSC is expected to dispose of 41-42 cases in each quarter and at least 165 cases in a year. At the time the scheme was launched, the government had set a target of disposing of 1,66,882 cases of rape and POCSO Act cases pending trial in various courts. Earlier this year, a Parliamentary panel on Home Affairs had noted that only 597 fast track courts out of the total 1,023 had been set up in the country and expressed its concern at the delay in implementing the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nod-for-continuation-of-fast-track-special-courts/article35735150.ece

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Efforts to track emerging COVID-19 variants shrink||However, INSACOG data visible on a website maintained by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the key INSACOG labs, shows 49,770 genomes as having been analysed and assigned to 232 lineages. These numbers include genomes sequenced by Kerala and Maharashtra, which have their own genome surveillance programmes. In absolute numbers, Maharashtra accounts for a fifth of the national genomes surveyed and Kerala about a tenth. Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, which coordinates INSACOG, said that the numbers available on the public website weren’t the latest for June and July. “This is not the complete data for June or July. So this gives you data only of sequences analysed and this is not real-time. We now have a real-time portal and soon its link will be available,” she told The Hindu . A scientist from one of the INSACOG labs said that there was always a lag in when the samples from a region, from any month, were analysed, and that there would an increase in July samples in the coming weeks. However, there are challenges in the programme. The INSACOG initiative was originally planned for three months, and because the project has only recently been extended, the funds available to labs for carrying out sequencing were delayed. The other reason, this source said, was that many States were not sending samples: “The National Centre for Disease Control has specified that at least 300 samples should be sent from each State per month. Very few States are actually complying with this directive.” The Health Ministry said in the Lok Sabha last week that the existing guidelines were to sequence 15 samples from every sentinel site in every 15 days from each State so that districts are represented from an epidemiological point of view. Every State is expected to have 10 such sentinel sites, which are notified laboratories and tertiary care hospitals. “This is a more diverse sampling strategy as against a random 5% sample sequencing,” the Ministry noted. The INSACOG database has the contribution of 28 States and Union Territories. Thus, ideally, there ought to be 8,400 samples a month, which as the numbers for June and July suggest, are far below the requirement. The dominant variant across India continues to be the Delta variant but limited sequencing means that it will be impossible to track if new variants may be driving surges. Currently, Kerala reports about half the daily caseload, and rising trajectories are seen in several northeastern States. Meghalaya, Mizoram, Assam and Tripura have each contributed less than 200 samples for genome sequencing, according to the INSACOG database. Though July has the least number of samples, the proportion of Delta variant samples has fallen to 73% from being over 85% of the samples in May and June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/efforts-to-track-emerging-covid-19-variants-shrink/article35735156.ece

It said its neighbour also ignored the directions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), constituted under the 2014 Act and directions of the Centre. “Fundamental rights, including right to life of its citizens, are being seriously impaired and infringed on account of unconstitutional, illegal and unjust acts on the part of the State of Telangana and its officials, resulting in the citizens of the State of Andhra Pradesh being deprived of their legitimate share of water for drinking and irrigation purposes,” the plea said. The focus of the petition is a Telangana Government Order (G.O.) of June 28 that said, “To tap more hydel generation in the State, the government has taken a decision to generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity”. A.P. said the G.O. was issued only days after the Ministry of Jal Shakti, in a communication on June 17 to Director (Hydel), TSGENCO, urged the latter “to stop further release of water immediately through Srisailam Left Power House and follow the water release orders issued by KRMB, except in case of extreme grid urgency”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cji-recuses-himself-from-andhra-telangana-case/article35735157.ece

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||HC order to PIL litigant to deposit Rs. 3.9 cr. harsh: SC||The Supreme Court has said it was “rather harsh” of the Bombay High Court to direct a PIL litigant to deposit Rs. 3.9 crore to prove his bona fide . A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah agreed with the petitioner that it would be an “unbearable burden” to pay such a huge amount as costs for instituting a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition. The petitioner in question here is Arvind Tukaram Shinde, a corporator with the Pune Municipal Corporation. He had filed a PIL plea in the Bombay High Court against a Rs. 390-crore sewage treatment plant project. On June 30, the High Court ordered him to deposit one per cent of the project cost by July 5. Mr. Shinde, represented by advocates Vipin Nair, P.B. Suresh and Karthik Jayashankar, moved the top court saying that the High Court order “effectively prevents him from pursuing the PIL in court”. On July 19, the top court reduced the amount of the court deposit to Rs. 10 lakh to prove his bona fide . Taking up the case again on Tuesday, the court recorded that Mr. Shinde had paid the amount. “We are of the view that the order for deposit of 1% of the project cost would be rather harsh,” the apex court said in its order on Tuesday.  Setting aside the June 30 order, the Bench asked the High Court to take up Mr. Shinde’s PIL petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-order-to-pil-litigant-to-deposit-rs-39-cr-harsh-sc/article35735162.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supreme Court to hear pleas on Pegasus today||A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana is scheduled to hear on August 5 a petition filed by senior journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar for an independent probe headed by a former or sitting top court judge into the mass surveillance of over 142 potential “targets”, including journalists, lawyers, Ministers, Opposition politicians, constitutional functionaries and civil society activists, using military-grade Israeli spyware Pegasus. The Supreme Court would also hear separate petitions filed by Rajya Sabha member John Brittas and Supreme Court advocate M.L. Sharma on the same issue, which has seen more petitions being filed, including one by the Editors Guild of India for an independent investigation into the Pegasus allegations and another by five journalists who were targets of surveillance. Mr. Ram and Mr. Kumar, in their petition, have said mass surveillance using a military-grade spyware abridges several fundamental rights and appears to represent an attempt to infiltrate, attack and destabilise independent institutions that act as critical pillars of our democratic set-up. They have sought a full disclosure from the government on whether it has authorised the snooping, which seems be an attempt to muzzle free speech and to chill dissent. The government, the petition said, had still not given a straight answer to whether the illegal hack was done with its blessings. The journalists have contended that spying has caused serious dents on the rights to free speech and privacy. It has no legal basis. In fact, the legal regime for surveillance under Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act seems to have been completely bypassed, and civilians have become targets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-to-hear-pleas-on-pegasus-today/article35735163.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘No active surveillance to detect cases in Kerala’||Coming down heavily on Kerala, which has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases recently, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has written to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday, stating that the COVID-19 case detection in several parts of the State was mainly through testing of those reporting to health facilities with COVID-19-like illness coupled with no active surveillance to detect cases. Kerala is presently reporting more than 20,000 cases per day. In his letter, the Minister said in view of the continued upsurge of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, a Central multi-disciplinary team was deputed to the State on July 30, and the team in its report submitted to the Ministry noted lapses in the manner in which the virus was being tackled in the State. The Minister’s communication said the team found a continued high number of COVID-19 cases being reported from almost all districts of the State, and highlighted that stringent containment measures were needed. “The ongoing ABCD classification made in the State has not yielded desired results, and technical guida- nce from the Central gover- nment on defining containment zones and active case search within such zones is crucial for controlling high case positivity,” he said. He added that any restrictions once imposed may be for a period of epidemiological significance, that is, at least 14 days, and may be effectively monitored. “The number of contacts traced per positive case is also quite low,” the Health Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-active-surveillance-to-detect-cases-in-kerala/article35735413.ece

The BRO has created a record in high-altitude road construction, the Ministry said. “It has constructed a 52-km long tarmac road through Umling La...” The strategic road built under ‘Project Himank’ passes through the Umling La Top and connects Chisumle and Demchok villages. The road is close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and will allow quick movement of troops and equipment. A Defence official said the road construction had a number of phases and the project had been under way since 2017.

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Vibhava experiences||In the Gita, the Lord explains the purposes of His incarnations, namely, to protect the good, to destroy the evil doers, and to establish dharma. Apart from the ten main avatars of the Lord, acharyas have pointed out that there are many more when God intervenes for these purposes. Vedanta Desika shows that His avatars give the jivatmas the chance to experience His auspicious qualities and His greatness, pointed out Asuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. For it is true that He can accomplish all these purposes and whatsoever He wishes by His mere Sankalpa and from His abode, the Parama Pada, without choosing to be born in this world. Paratva is His swaroopa in Parama Pada which is the experience of the Nityasuris and Muktatmas. But the Vibhava experiences available to the jivatma are unique and precious. It is not only enjoyed by those who had the great fortune to live contemporaneously but to the entire posterity. For even today, as is seen in the hymns of azhwars, we continue to be overwhelmed and moved emotionally when contemplating, for instance, the extent to which Krishna goes to help the Pandavas; or when we wonder at the ease with which He mingles with the simple folk in Ayarpadi. What Saulabhya in stealing butter and trying to escape being caught and then allowing Yasodha to catch Him, and bind Him to the grinding stone with a rope? There is no end to such experiences of His auspicious qualities that draw us to Him and enable us to seek Him. He seems to indicate, “I am your permanent friend and relation and you should always be with Me. I may be the Paramatma, but I am available to all of you without any exception.” As the antaryami in all beings, He can be bound by true bhakti; but He remains aloof to those who are not his bhaktas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vibhava-experiences/article35735353.ece

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Twitter violated principle of natural justice’||The government on Wednesday said that the labelling of tweets as “manipulated media” by Twitter does not come under the purview of the new IT Rules. However, the U.S.-headquartered microblogging platform has been told that by doing so it violates “the principle of natural justice”. In May this year, the government had asked Twitter to remove the “manipulated media” tag from certain tweets by some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including the party’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra, related to a “Congress toolkit” allegedly used to defame the government’s efforts related to COVID-19. Fairness and equity The government had reasoned that “the tags affixed prejudicially” should be removed in the interests of fairness and equity, and that investigation by law enforcement agencies would determine the veracity of the content. Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha: “The issue of labelling of user tweets as manipulated media does not come under the purview of the above said Rules. Further, on the issue of manipulated media, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has pointed out to Twitter that they are violating the principle of natural justice and urged Twitter to be transparent and equitable in applying the criteria.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/twitter-violated-principle-of-natural-justice/article35735155.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||4 with links to IS-inspired module held||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested four persons allegedly associated with an Islamic State-inspired module, following searches in Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir in coordination with Central intelligence agencies and local police. The accused have been identified as Obaid Hamid, a resident of Srinagar; Muzammil Hassan Bhat, a resident of Bandipora; Ammar Abdul Rahman from Mangaluru; and Shankar Venkatesh Perumal alias Ali Muaviya, a resident Bengaluru. They were involved in raising funds, radicalising and motivating others to join the Islamic State, the agency said. During the searches earlier, the four accused were detained along with a woman from Mangaluru. It was alleged that she had attempted to travel to Afghanistan. The module was unearthed about a year ago when the intelligence agencies came across an Instagram channel named “Chronicle Foundation”, comprising more than 5,000 persons from different parts of the world, which had allegedly been indulging in Islamic State-related propaganda. The agencies gradually established the identities of several members of the module. As it turned out, some associated members were planning to visit Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, while some had even made unsuccessful attempts to travel to Afghanistan via Iran in April 2019. The alleged leader of the module, identified as Mohammed Ameen, intended to travel to Pakistan and J&K to join terror groups. Some suspects were also involved in raising funds and even transferring a portion to entities operating in J&K.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/five-with-links-to-is-inspired-module-held/article35735358.ece

He said 1,950 persons were still stranded in flood-hit areas and efforts were on to rescue them. Rail services between Shivpuri and Gwalior and telecom services in Morena district were badly affected, he told reporters. The rescue operations using helicopters resumed again on Wednesday, after being affected due to the bad weather on Tuesday. Aerial survey The Chief Minister undertook an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas on Wednesday afternoon. “The flood situation in north Madhya Pradesh is grim... 1,225 villages in Shivpuri, Sheopur, Datia, Gwalior, Guna, Bhind and Morena districts are affected,” Mr. Chouhan said. The State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Army and the BSF together succeeded in evacuating 5,950 people from 240 villages, he said. “Four columns of the Army, BSF, NDRF teams and 70 teams of the SDRF have been deployed for the rescue work. More teams of the NDRF are coming ... five helicopters of the Air Force, including four in Gwalior and one in Shivpuri, have also been pressed into rescue operations,” the Chief Minister said. But, it was a matter of relief that the water level was coming down in some places, he said. Villages submerged Some villages in Sheopur district were completely submerged, but the people stranded there were safe. The Army was reaching those villages for the rescue operations, he said. The Army also reached Datia, where 1,100 people were rescued from 36 villages, the Chief Minister informed. Some people were airlifted from a place in Datia district where all the main roads were shut due to inundation, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/flood-situation-grim-in-north-mp-over-1200-villages-hit-chouhan/article35735367.ece

05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||White Paper on Aug. 9, first e-Budget on Aug. 13||The Assembly will witness its first paperless Budget session, with Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan set to present the revised Budget for 2020-21 on August 13. Ahead of this, Mr. Rajan will release a White Paper on the State’s finances on August 9. “The situation is worse than what the previous releases have shown,” Mr. Rajan told The Hindu on Wednesday . “This [White Paper] is something that I was committed to, and I am fulfilling it. I wanted it to be as comprehensive as possible. It is 10 years’ worth of mismanagement. Before we go to the Budget, it is good that the people of the State understand what is the true state of affairs,” he said. The White Paper, likely to be of 120 pages, will focus on the State’s debt burden and the finances of the Electricity, Local Bodies, Water Resources and Transport Departments, among others. The Minister said it took a long time to get the data together due to the pandemic. “It is important that what we put out is accurate. I am not saying it is comprehensive. We might need to do a few more things like White Papers on GIM-1 [Global Investors Meet] and GIM-2 and Rule-110 announcements. Right now, it [White Paper] is a limited context on what is the true financial situation of the State,” he said. He said once the White Paper was put out in the public domain, other questions might arise and more clarifications sought. Based on these, the Chief Minister might want to resolve issues raised when the DMK was in the Opposition, he added. Paperless Budget A notification issued by Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Wednesday said the House would be convened at 10 a.m. on August 13. In February, the then Finance Minister, O. Panneerselvam, had presented the interim Budget for the year, ahead of the Assembly election. The Budget, including the full session with the demand for grants of all departments, will be paperless. The Assembly Secretariat has already installed all-in-one desktop personal computers on the desks of the legislators at the makeshift Assembly hall in Kalaivanar Arangam to facilitate the reading of the Budget as it is presented. The MLAs will also be provided with a tablet, the Budget papers and the demand for grants books five minutes after the Budget is tabled in the Assembly. Sources in the Assembly Secretariat told The Hindu that a special software would be used to ensure that the e-Budget proceedings go smoothly. This is being done in coordination with the Information Technology Department, the National Informatics Centre and ELCOT. “We conducted a drill yesterday [Tuesday] and it worked well,” a source said. The first agriculture Budget will be presented on August 14, the Additional Chief Secretary, Finance Department, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/white-paper-on-aug-9-first-e-budget-on-aug-13/article35735514.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Man gets implant for mitral valve leakage||A 41-year-old man, who was suffering from heart failure and was put on the heart transplant list, underwent a MitraClip implant to fix a leaky mitral valve at Apollo Hospitals. Severe leakage The patient, a farmer from Vijayawada, had no comorbidities and was healthy until he suffered from heart failure early this year. He had suffered severe mitral valve leakage, causing his heart function to reduce to 15%, according to Sai Satish, senior interventional cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals. After being hospitalised for a month in Vijayawada, he was shifted to a hospital in Hyderabad but his heart function continued to deteriorate, and he was put on the transplant list, he said. “The patient had spent 90 days hospitalised. His heart was very weak. He was shifted to Apollo Hospitals and underwent the MitraClip implant five days ago. He can sit up and walk now. His heart function has improved from 15% to 30%. We wanted to do a bridge for heart transplant. With careful medical attention, I hope he will not require a heart transplant,” Dr. Satish told reporters on Wednesday. According to a press release, MitraClip is a small metal clip with a polyester fabric inserted to fix a leaky mitral valve. It clips the mitral valve leaflets, and ensures that the blood flow is in the right direction. The procedure was done percutaneously, he said. Patients with moderate to severe or severe primary and secondary mitral regurgitation, who are not improving on medical treatment, can opt for this minimally invasive solution. Preetha Reddy, executive vice-chairperson, Apollo Hospitals Group, said 70% of MitraClip procedures in India were performed at Apollo Hospitals, Chennai. Dr. Satish said in the last three to four months, when COVID-19 cases were raging, they were able to perform the procedures in very sick patients with heart failure. He also presented the earlier cases of an 86-year-old and a 72-year-old patient, who received MitraClip implants.

The number of deaths rose to 38, when compared with 29 on Tuesday, taking the toll to 34,197. With the fresh infections marginally rising from 1,908 to 1,949, districts like Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Pudukottai, Salem, Tiruvallur and Tiruvarur registered a small rise in cases.

As many as 114 people tested positive in Chengalpattu. In Tiruvallur, 99 people tested positive, when compared with 84 on Tuesday, while both Salem and Tiruppur saw a slight rise in cases — 83 cases in the former and 92 cases in the latter. When compared with the previous day, cases fluctuated in a number of districts such as the Nilgiris (51) and Pudukottai (42). Among the 38 fatalities, Tiruvallur recorded five, and Coimbatore and Tiruvarur three each. Chennai saw one death. There were no deaths in 16 districts. Of the 38 deceased, 32 had co-morbidities. Four people in their 40s succumbed to the infection. This included a 40-year-old man from Erode who did not have co-morbidities. He was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital on August 2 and died the next day due to COVID-19 pneumonia. A total of 2,011 people were discharged after treatment, taking the total figure to 25,13,087. The active caseload stood at 20,117.

05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CMRL planning to fix seepage problems in phase I extension||Just six months after the opening of the phase I extension project of the Metro Rail, the tunnels on the underground stretch have already begun witnessing leakages. The phase I extension project was constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,770 crore over a stretch of 9 km between Washermenpet and Wimco Nagar. While the Washermenpet to Tondiarpet stretch has been built underground, the rest of it is elevated. According to sources in Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), groundwater has been seeping into the tunnels of the underground stretch. To curtail this, grouting will be done again. “We have called for tenders to do grouting again in this stretch. This is a process where we inject cement into pores to plug any gaps and prevent water seepage. Grouting was done during the construction stage by the contractor. But we have to do it again,” an official said. Phase I as well This is going to be done in the underground sections of the phase I project since the problem persists there as well. “The water table is high and that could be a reason for the issue. But once we do this grouting, the issue may not arise. One of the important reasons this problem has to be stopped at the earliest is that the track circuit gets affected, and this results in trains applying emergency brakes. Sometimes, there could be a delay in operations,” another official said. Sources said if the previous contractor in the phase I extension project had carried out grouting well, the problem would have not emerged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmrl-planning-to-fix-seepage-problems-in-phase-i-extension/article35735525.ece

A senior official of the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) said a call was received by the control room about the fire in the godown, which was used to stock car accessories and decorative sets for cinema productions. More than 10 fire tenders were pressed into service, alongside several water tankers, to douse the blaze. But by the time they started dousing the fire, a major portion of the godown was already destroyed.

As part of the process to obtain environmental clearance for the greenfield project, the first public hearing was conducted by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) at Sunguvarchathram in Kancheepuram district on Wednesday. Some participants sought service lanes in their localities. Those affected by the project wanted enhanced compensation for their land. District Collector M. Aarthi, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) Project Director P.T. Mohan and TNPCB District Environment Engineer (Sriperumbudur) P. Ravichandran, along with other officials, were present at the hearing. The public hearing for the stretch running through Tiruvallur district would be held on August 18 at Mappedu junction. Of the total 262 km, 106 km would pass through Tamil Nadu. The expressway, which would be designed for speeds of 120 km per hour, would take two years to construct. Though land is being acquired for eight lanes, the road would initially have four lanes of 22.5 m width and a sunken median of 21 m width. “The public mood seems to be for this project. If we obtain environment clearance, it will take a few more months to begin work,” explained a source in NHAI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/public-hearing-for-expressway-held/article35735535.ece

In a statement, Law Minister S. Raghupathy said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, when he was the Opposition leader, had sought a ban on online rummy, following which the AIADMK government had urgently enacted an amendment to the Act to ban the game. He said despite the government putting forth its views on the ban on online games, in a case that challenged the ban at the Madras High Court, the court had refused to issue any blanket ban on such games and struck down the amendment to the Act. Public welfare Mr. Raghupathy said following the verdict, the Chief Minister had said that public welfare was of utmost importance. Therefore, proper guidelines, rules and reasons must be framed to ban such online games without any delay, Mr. Stalin said. Based on the Chief Minister’s directions, a law will be brought in to ban online rummy and other such games very soon, the Minister added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-to-frame-laws-to-ban-online-rummy/article35735506.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil textbook drops caste surnames of eminent scholars||The caste identity of U. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer, known as Tamil thatha (grand old man of Tamil), has never come in the way of the recognition he gained through his immense contribution to Tamil. However, the Tamil Nadu Textbook Corporation has dropped the part of his name denoting his caste, perhaps thinking it is wrong to use the caste identity. In the Tamil textbook for Class XII students, there is a lesson titled ‘ Pandaiya kalathu pallikoodangal’ (Schools of ancient times) by Swaminatha Iyer. He has been referred to as U.Ve. Swaminathar instead. Sources said the name was changed in line with an order issued by the State government years ago to dispense with caste names in streets and other references. In 1978, while addressing the centenary celebrations of Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, then Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran announced that his government would take steps to remove caste references from the names of streets and roads. Subsequently, a government order was issued for the same. In 1997, following communal riots in southern districts, then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi removed the names of leaders given to various districts. Even transport corporations had to give up names like Pallavan, Pandian, Cheran, Chozhan and Pattukottai Alagiri. The Tamil Nadu Textbook Corporation did not stop with Swaminatha Iyer. His teacher, Meenakshisundaram Pillai, is identified as Meenakshisundaranar. Mayavaram Vedanayagam Pillai, author of the first Tamil novel, is referred to as just Vedanayagam; Sri Lankan Tamil scholar C.W. Thamotharampillai is now Damodaranar; and poet Namakkal Kavignar Ramalingam Pillai has become Ramalinganar. However, titles like Dikshitar and Desikar remain unchanged. When asked for his opinion, V. Arasu, former head of the Department of Tamil, University of Madras, said the scholars whose caste identity was part of their personality could be given an exemption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-textbook-drops-caste-surnames-of-eminent-scholars/article35735516.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||7 sentenced to death for neurosurgeon’s murder||Nearly eight years after the sensational daylight murder of neurosurgeon S.D. Subbiah in Chennai, which was captured on CCTV camera, a sessions court on Wednesday awarded the capital punishment to seven of the 9 accused in the case. The two others were sentenced to life imprisonment on two counts. Dr. Subbiah, 58, was repeatedly stabbed with deadly weapons by a hired gang when he came out of the hospital where he worked at Raja Annamalai Puram on September 14, 2013. He sustained serious cut injuries in 20 places and was rushed to hospital. He later succumbed to his grievous injuries. The investigation revealed that he was murdered over a land dispute between him and his relative, P. Ponnusamy, 55, at Anju Gramam in Kanniyakumari district. Ponnusamy, his wife Mary Pushpam, their sons Basil, 26, an advocate, and Boris, 24, an engineer, and associates William, 31, an advocate, and Yesurajan, 26, a kabaddi player — all hailing from Kanniyakumari — and Dr. James Sathiskumar, 37, Murugan, 25, Selvaprakash, 23, and Ayyappan, 24, from Tirunelveli district, were arraigned as accused in the case. According to the prosecution, Ponnusamy promised to give half of the sale proceeds of the disputed property to the assailants — Selvaprakash and Murugan — if they eliminated Subbiah. The three were working with a medical practitioner in Kanniyakumari, who was an acquaintance of Basil. The prosecution said Basil and Boris, a cargo staff with an international airline, conspired with the others and ordered the murder following a long-standing dispute over a 2.4 acre plot at Anju Grammam owned by Dr. Subbiah. Ayyappan, who was identified as a “facilitator” in the case, later turned approver, following which the remaining 9 were tried in the first additional sessions court. “As many as 57 witnesses were examined during the trial, and 173 pieces of documentary evidence and 42 material objects were produced before the court,” Special Public Prosecutor N. Vijayaraj said. On completion of the trial, I additional session judge S. Alli pronounced the judgment holding that the prosecution proved the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The judge awarded the death penalty on two counts to Ponnusamy, Basil, Boris, William, James Sathiskumar, Murugan and Selvaprakash for offences under Sections 302 (Punishment for murder) and 120B (Criminal Conspiracy) of the IPC. He ordered that they be hanged, subject to confirmation of the sentence by the Madras High Court. The judge sentenced Mary Pushpam and Yesurajan to life imprisonment on two counts and imposed a fine of Rs. 50,000 each.

Delay in seeking treatment left him blind in one eye and almost endangered his life, the doctors said. Swamy (name changed), who was severely diabetic, had contracted COVID-19 several months ago. Soon, he began having problems with his sight and was diagnosed with rhino-orbital-cerebral syndrome, owing to mucormycosis. It spread to his nose, sinuses and right eye, eventually extending to the brain. At a super speciality hospital, ENT surgeons operated on him, and he was discharged a fortnight later. But it did not relieve him of the pain. The man consulted several ophthalmologists without relief until he was referred to Krishna Eye and ENT Hospital in the city. Ophthalmologist P. Kanthamani, who examined him, said he was in denial of COVID-19 infection though his chest CT scan indicated infection. ENT surgeon and hospital founder G. Sundhar Krishnan, a specialist in skull base surgery, said the fungus had extended into his eye socket and brain, freezing eyeball movement. “He was operated on twice earlier and given ampotericin B but did not improve. The disease further spread to the cavernous sinus, orbital fissure and skull base. I removed the fungus completely. He was treated post-operatively with ampotericin B with the help of an infectious diseases specialist,” Dr. Sundhar explained. “It has been almost four weeks now. He lost his sight two to three months before coming to us. The disease had spread. His life was also in danger. We gave him a guarded prognosis that we could clear the disease. The eyeball movement has returned,” he said. “The optic nerve is very sensitive and any loss of blood supply will damage it quickly. We should treat it at the earliest. In this patient, we could not do much because he came very late,” Dr. Sundhar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-treated-for-mucormycosis-in-city-hospital/article35735531.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu tells HC of decision to repeal Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act||The State government on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court that it has decided to repeal the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act of 2021 promulgated during the AIADMK regime in February for establishing a university, named after the former Chief Minister, with territorial jurisdiction over Villupuram, Kallakurichi and Cuddalore districts. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy were told that a Government Order was issued by the Higher Education Department on Tuesday, expressing the State’s intent to repeal the legislation. Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram produced the G.O. during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by former Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam. The judges asked the A-G to share the G.O. with senior counsel Vijay Narayan, representing the former Minister in the PIL petition, and adjourned the case to Friday so that counsel could get back after perusing the order. The G.O. stated that Annamalai University, established at Chidambaram in Cuddalore district in 1929, was the second oldest university in the State. However, the university continued to remain a unitary institution and not an affiliating institution since inception. Its status did not change even after it was brought under government control in 2013 due to poor financial position. A senior IAS officer appointed as its administrator had made a series of recommendations in 2015 for reviving the finances of the university. One of those recommendations was to convert it into an affiliating university with jurisdiction over Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Ariyalur districts. Nevertheless, the recommendation was not implemented till date and the government continued to sanction money on a monthly basis to pay salaries to the employees of Annamalai University. Affiliating university Therefore, now the government had decided that it would be more purposeful if the university could be converted into an affiliating university with jurisdiction over Villupuram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi and Mayiladuthurai districts by amending the Annamalai University Act of 2013 and repealing the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act of 2021, the G.O. read. Mr. Shunmugam accused the DMK government of neglecting the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University and sought a direction to provide necessary funds for its smooth functioning and upkeep. The litigant also urged the court to restrain Thiruvalluvar University — which was bifurcated to establish the new university — from operating postgraduate extension centres in Villupuram in violation of the provisions of the 2021 Act. Mr. Shanmugam said the new university was established following a request made by him last year in his capacity as an MLA representing the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-told-of-decision-to-repeal-dr-j-jayalalithaa-university-act/article35735542.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Registration Dept. tightens norms to prevent fraud||To prevent the registration of fake documents and fraudulent property transactions, the Tamil Nadu Registration Department has introduced a new rule mandating the affixation of a scanned copy of the document writer’s or the advocate’s photograph on the last page of the document. The document writer/advocate has to enter his/her licence/registration number on the document, certifying that the draft has been duly verified. The move will also avert touts posing as document writers or advocates, offering to assist people in the process of registration. In the existing system, the photo of the buyer and seller was captured by a software, and they also had to affix their left thumb impressions, besides submitting their original proofs of identity and address at the Sub Registrar Office. The signature, along with the address proofs of the two witnesses, was obtained. Fake entries However, despite these measures, several irregularities in the registration of documents have continued, such as impersonation, sale of the same property to multiple persons, registration after cancellation of power of attorney by fraudulent means, registration of fake documents to create false entries in the encumbrance certificate and the sale of properties despite attachment by banks under the SARFAESI Act, among others. According to Section 2(d) of the Tamil Nadu Document Writers’ Licence Rules, 1982, a document writer should verify and ascertain the ownership of a property before preparing the draft of the document. Similar norms apply for the advocates too. Such document writers/advocates enter their name and signature in the document. However, it came to light that in fake documents, the signatures were found to be of fictitious persons. After conducting a series of review meetings, the Minister for Commercial Taxes, Registration and Stamp Law, P. Moorthy, instructed officials that a scanned photo of the document writer or the advocate, along with their licence/registration details, should be compulsorily made part of the registered documents. This is part of a few other steps taken by the Minister to prevent the registration of fake documents. “Now there will be a bigger responsibility on the part of the document writer/advocate preparing or certifying drafts of property registrations, since their professional credibility is involved. Another advantage is that the menace of touts preparing drafts and fleecing peopl will end, since they cannot make formal entries in documents now,” a spokesperson of the Tamil Nadu Registration Department Officials’ Association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/registration-dept-tightens-norms-to-prevent-fraud/article35735509.ece

Describing the attitude of the DMK government as “surprising,” C.Ve. Shanmugam, the party’s steering committee member and Villupuram district secretary, said it looked as if the regime had not employed senior lawyers and got proper reasons adduced before the court in support of the law. Mr. Shanmugam, former Law Minister, urged the government to get a stay order immediately from the Supreme Court on the High Court’s verdict. This had to be done for the welfare of the youth, he added. ‘Ensure no recurrence’ In a separate statement, the AIADMK’s coordinator, O. Panneerselvem, and co-coordinator, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, deplored the violence carried out at the office of a Tamil television channel and wanted the government to bring to book the guilty, apart from ensuring that there was no recurrence of any such event in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-finds-fault-with-dmk-government/article35735543.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 39,600 may have missed second Covaxin dose in Chennai||Despite targeted efforts from the Greater Chennai Corporation, vaccination data for the city showed that close to 40,000 people may have missed their second dose of Covaxin within the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-advised window of a maximum of six weeks. However, Corporation officials said the actual numbers were likely to be far lower as there could be duplication and other such technical issues in the data available on the CoWIN portal. According to data available on vaccine doses administered through government-run centres till August 2, a total of 4,69,225 people have received their first dose of Covaxin and 3,32,254 had received the second. As per the ICMR guidelines, those who received their first dose till June 20 must have received their second dose by August 2 as it marked the end of the six-week window. However, the numbers showed that while a total of 3,71,861 people had received their first dose as on June 20, only 3,32,254 had received the second dose as on August 2. The difference of 39,607 probably missed their second dose in the six-week window. From June 20 to August 2, the Corporation administered more second doses of Covaxin than first. A total of 97,364 first doses and 1.21 lakh second doses were administered in the period. While the special drives and tracking of those who missed their second doses certainly helped in bringing down the numbers from above 60,000, the latest data showed that many people may have still missed it. A senior official from the Corporation, however, said such high numbers may not have actually missed their second dose. The official said that a vast majority of these numbers can be attributed to issues with data collection. Another official pointed out that there could be instances where a person providing a different mobile number or identification details while taking the second dose may be mistakenly recorded as taking the first dose. He said there could also be instances where people who took the first dose in the city may have taken their second dose elsewhere. The senior official said the situation on availability of Covaxin, the primary reason earlier for many missing their second dose, had improved. “Both the off-take and the demand for the second dose of Covaxin have reduced,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-39600-may-have-missed-second-covaxin-dose-in-city/article35735530.ece
05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 900 applications received after extension of deadline for RTE seats||Following the extension of the deadline for admissions under the Right to Education Act in Tamil Nadu, the Directorate of Matriculation Schools received over 900 applications on Wednesday. “Till about 6 p.m., we had received 912 applications through the RTE portal and the numbers will increase by the end of the day. Keeping the pandemic situation in mind, we have decided to extend the deadline from August 3 to 13 and are hoping more parents will submit applications during this period,” said S. Karuppasami, Director of Matriculation Schools (DMS). While the DMS had received around 1.2 lakh applications in 2020 and 1.19 in 2019, this year so far the department had received only a little over 73,000 applications. “Over the years, the awareness about the RTE Act has increased. The dipping numbers this year might be due to the pandemic,” said an official from the Education Department. Parents were hesitant to admit children into LKG as they might have to face added expenses or due to health concerns, the official added. At the district level, the department had been working towards reaching out to parents about the admission process. This year, there had also been a marked increase in the number of parents opting for admissions in government schools. K.K. Prahalathan, co-founder, Bhumi, an NGO which has been helping parents with the application process under the RTE Act for the last few years, said they had put in place a helpline (8144-22-4444) for parents with queries about the RTE Act. A team of volunteers would help them with the online admission process. “We hope that more parents will submit applications over the next week. The application process started in July and we have received over 14,000 calls from parents so far,” he said. They also have a websitehttps://ilavasakalvi.in/where anyone who knows of parents wanting to get admission for their child under the RTE Act can submit their details so that volunteers from Bhumi will reach out to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-900-applications-received-after-extension-of-deadline-for-rte-seats/article35735534.ece

Jaishankar, requesting the Union government to intervene and pressure Sri Lanka to stop its Navy from firing on Indian fishermen in international waters. Mr. Stalin said on August 1, the Sri Lankan Navy fired on an Indian fishing boat from Kodiakarai, in which one fisherman, Kalaiselvan, was injured. Nine others miraculously escaped. “It is highly condemnable that practices of international law are not being followed and our fishermen are being attacked. We cannot be silent in this situation and a solution must be immediately found,” Mr. Stalin said in his letter, a copy of which was circulated to the media. The Chief Minister said it was India’s duty to ensure that Sri Lanka adheres to international laws. The island nation must stop attacking Indian fishermen and destroying their boats and fishing nets with immediate effect, and India must pressure it on the issue, he said. He demanded that a lasting political solution be found to the issue, which was affecting the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Indian fishermen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pressure-sri-lanka-to-stop-firing-on-fishermen/article35735507.ece

The University of Madras has been allowed to offer 30 programmes and Anna University three. These include undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Madurai Kamaraj University has been permitted to offer 25 programmes whereas the Physical Education and Sports University will offer two programmes — B.Sc and M.Sc in Yoga. The permission comes in the backdrop of the Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association’s rejection of the UGC’s proposal to adopt blended learning. Association president T. Veeramani said teachers were against online education. The proposal to offer 40% of courses online could render teachers without jobs in the long run, he said, and added that, “Teachers can be anywhere. We do not know who will get the job of teaching students online.” 2.5 lakh applicants As of Tuesday, as many as 2.5 lakh candidates had registered for undergraduate programmes offered in the 143 government arts and science colleges. A total of 1.84 lakh aspirants had paid fees.

05 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. to resume supply of meals in anganwadis||The State government on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court that it would recommence the supply of cooked meals to around 11.77 lakh children, aged two to six, at 54,439 anganwadis in the State by September 1. The supply has remained suspended since March 17, 2020, due to COVID-19; instead, the beneficiaries were being given dry rations. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu were informed by Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram that no pre-school activities would be conducted for children when the anganwadis reopen the next month, but their parents and guardians could collect the cooked nutritious food between 11.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. on all working days. The submissions were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by the Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group, an NGO, which said the supply of hot cooked nutritious meals to needy children could not remain suspended indefinitely, especially in the light of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013. Passing interim orders in the case on Wednesday, the judges appreciated senior counsel N.L. Rajah, representing the NGO, for bringing an important issue to the notice of the court, and the A-G for having held a meeting with Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu on July 27, at the instance of the court, to ensure that the nutritional requirements of the children were met by the State. In a letter addressed to the A-G on Tuesday, the Chief Secretary said the NFSA mandates the provision of supplementary nutrition, containing 500 kilo calories and 12-15 g of protein a day for 300 days a year to children between the age of three and six.  However, as far as the Puratchi Thalaivar MGR Nutritious Meal Programme, under which 41.23 lakh students of government and government-aided private schools are benefited, was concerned, the Chief Secretary said it would not be possible to provide cooked food to those children until the schools were allowed to reopen. Given the high number of beneficiaries, it would not be possible to provide cooked food to all of them during the pandemic, he said. Mr. Anbu said the government was nevertheless providing dry rations at the schools. The judges adjourned the PIL petition to September 3 for reporting progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-to-resume-supply-of-meals-in-anganwadis/article35735508.ece

Thiyagarajan, who had been fighting to bring transparency in the Corporation’s administration. The Corporation had stopped posting online the resolutions the council under the special officers had passed since November 2017. From November 2017 to May 2021, the council had passed over 2,800 resolutions in 72 meetings, he said. By failing to post online the resolutions the Corporation had kept in dark the public as the term of the elected council had come to an end and the State Government had empowered commissioners with the powers of the council by designating them special officers, he said. A cursory look at the resolutions made public in the recent exercise revealed that a majority of them were related to works in South and West zones, the civic activist added. Mr. Thiyagarajan had filed petitions under the RTI Act, filed appeals, moved the Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Ombudsman and also the High Court to make the resolutions public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/last-set-of-corporation-council-resolutions-made-public/article35735564.ece

05 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||RTI reply reveals civic body delayed collecting dues from tenants||At a time when the Coimbatore Corporation is trying to improve its financial health by cutting down expenditure and increasing revenue collection, an RTI reply has revealed that the civic body has not been keen on collecting dues. The data showing the dues is in the Corporation’s reply to a petition from lawyer M. Loganthan, who had sought details on the shops rented out at the Gandhipuram Central Bus Stand, the monthly rent to be paid and rent due from the shopkeepers. The 36 shops in the Central Bus Stand owed the Corporation over Rs. 82 lakh, as per the RTI reply. The reply was not just about how much the shopkeepers owed the Corporation but also for how long, Mr. Loganathan said and pointed out that a shopkeeper had not paid rent for over seven years. He owed over Rs. 11.62 lakh. There were others who had not paid rent for 14 months, 76 months, 12 months and two months. It was surprising that the civic body had chosen to not to act against the defaulters because at one end it was trying to mobilise resources by cancelling tenders to save money. It was also surprising because the Corporation that went after residential property tax defaulters chose to do nothing about the defaulting shopkeepers. This appeared to be the case with the Corporation in other prime commercial locations as well, the RTI petitioner said and added his objective was only to get the civic body to act. Interestingly, the list of defaulters included India Post (Department of Post), which owed the Corporation Rs. 2.86 lakh for the first premises it had rented and Rs. 9.20 lakh for the second premises it had rented. For the first premises, India Post had not paid for over eight years and for the second over 10 years. Likewise, the list also shows the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation with dues worth Rs. 6.97 lakh. The Corporation was yet to respond to queries on the reasons for delay in collecting rent dues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rti-reply-reveals-civic-body-delayed-collecting-dues-from-tenants/article35735562.ece

According to the police, the youth sexually assaulted the 17-year-old girl after marrying her in May 2019. The Mettupalayam police initially registered a case related to the missing of the girl based on the complaint lodged by her parents. The police traced the girl to the youth and rescued her.

Sources in the harbour said the mechanised boat owned by Sahaya Antony of Kanniyakumari ventured into the sea at 5 a.m. on Tuesday. When the boat was four nautical miles away from the fishing harbour while returning to the base, a fire broke out in the engine that spread to other parts of the boat immediately as the wind was heavy at that time. As their efforts to douse the flames failed, all the 14 fishermen jumped into the sea. They were rescued by another boat returning to Chinna Muttom Fishing Harbour. Fisheries Department officials, who visited the spot where the accident happened on Wednesday, said a technical snag in the engine might have triggered the fire. Following the fire accident, the fishermen of Chinna Muttom abstained from fishing operations on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fire-destroys-boat-in-sea/article35735681.ece

05 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘No trains run in Pollachi-Madurai section’||Palani Rail Users’ Association has complained that no train was being operated on Coimbatore-Pollachi-Palani-Madurai route though it has been four years since the broad gauge line was commissioned. The association has sought Madurai MP, Su. Venkatesan’s intervention getting the express trains back on the route that not only help thousands of passengers, but would also put to good use the huge funds spent on the gauge conversion project. This section connects important towns in southern districts like Madurai, Rameswaram, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi, Tiruchendur, Kanniyakumari, Palani, with places in Western Tamil Nadu like Coimbatore, Mettupalayam, Pollachi and Udumalaipeti by way of the shortest railway route, said association secretary, A Pachaimuthu. Prior to gauge conversion several trains including Rameswaram - Coimbatore daily overnight express and daytime passenger, Madurai - Coimbatore daily intercity express, Thoothukudi - Coimbatore daily train were being operated with good patronage. K. Mohankumar of Welfare Association of Railway Passengers from Pollachi, said that train operation on the said section was going on smoothly during metre gauge days, when the Pollachi junction was under the Madurai division, The junction had pitline facilities for the metre gauge section that enabled operation or more trains between the south and west. “But the pitline facilities were not restored when gauge conversion work was taken up after Pollachi was brought under Palakkad division,” he said. Mr. Pachaimuthu said that while Pollachi-Kinathukadavu section was under Palakkad division, Kinathukadavu-Podanur was under Salem division. “Since three railway divisions had their jurisdictions within 22 km of railway line stretch, it created lot of administrative issues in operation of additional trains,” he said. The association has sought the MP’s help to bring Pollachi, Kinathukadavu and Podanur railway stations under Madurai railway division to help operate more trains between Coimbatore and southern districts. It will help tourists proceeding to Kodaikanal, Madurai, Dhanushkodi, Ooty, Valparai, Munnar would get better connectivity. Similarly, it would also help pilgrims reach Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, Lord Ramanathaswamy temple, Ervadi Dargah, Lord Murugan temple in Palani, Marudamalai temple, Anaimalai Maasani Amman temple near Pollachi, Thirumoorthy hill temple near Udumalaipettai. Agriculture products from Madurai region, textiles and manufacturing products from Coimbatore, coir and coconut products from Pollachi, vegetables from Udumalaipet and Oddanchatram market would also benefit, the association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palani-passengers-rue-lack-of-trains-in-pollachi-madurai-section/article35735671.ece
05 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Take steps to implement Witness Protection Scheme: High Court||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the High Court Registry to take steps through the government to notify the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018, and implement the various clauses under the scheme in all districts. Justice G. Chandrasekharan observed that the Witness Protection Scheme came into effect following a Supreme Court direction. However, there is a mention in the scheme that it would come into force from the date of government notification. The scheme provided a standing committee in each district to be chaired by the District and Sessions Judge with the head of the police in the district as a member and the head of the prosecution in the district as its member-secretary. A Witness Protection Fund should be created and a Witness Protection Cell had to be established for duly implementing the order. Also, specially designed ‘vulnerable witness courtrooms’ had to be created. The special arrangements in these courtrooms would have live video links, one way mirror and screens, apart from separate passages for witnesses and the accused, option to modify the image of the witnesses and to modify audio feed of witness voices. A report submitted to the court by the Registrar General, Madras High Court, said the copy of the scheme was circulated to all Principal District Judges. Steps were taken to set up centres for examination of vulnerable and child witnesses and vulnerable witness deposition centres. The judge then directed the Registry to take steps through the government to notify the scheme after getting approval of the Chief Justice of Madras High Court. The court passed the direction while hearing the bail petition of an advocate, Chokkar, one of the accused in the murder of advocate K. Ranjith Kumar in Uthamapalayam in Theni district. The murder is said to have taken place following a dispute over a property settlement. The court took into account the fact that investigation in the case was completed and a final report was filed. The court granted bail with conditions to Chokkar, 63, after it was submitted that he was suffering from a heart disease and other ailments. In a connected matter, the court cancelled the bail granted to the other accused in the case. The bail granted to Jeyaprabhu, Rajesh and Ananthan was cancelled in view of the fact that they had threatened the complainant and family members after their release on bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-steps-to-implement-witness-protection-scheme-high-court/article35735664.ece
05 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||For the first time, Keeladi site yields iron dagger with wooden handle||An iron dagger with a wooden handle was found inside a burial urn unearthed at Konthagai village, which is part of the Keeladi cluster where the seventh phase of excavation is in full swing to establish the existence of an urban civilisation in the Sangam era. The second season of digging started in February at Konthagai where 25 burial urns have been unearthed so far and 11 of them have been opened, according to R. Kaviya, one of the four Site Archaeology Officers. These urns measure 95 to 105 cm in height with a circumference of 80 cm. Some of the urns contained iron weapons, shaped like knives, and spears and small terracotta vessels. The latest, a 40-cm-long iron dagger with 6-cm-long wooden handle was found at a depth of 77 cm. The urn filled with soil sediment had the five-cm-thick dagger, associated with femur bones, a skull and an offering pot. It is a type used by warriors belonging to the Sangam period, contemporary to Keeladi dating, according to R. Sivanandam, Director of Keeladi Excavations. This was the first time that they had stumbled upon a weapon with a wooden handle, and it would be very useful for exact dating of the evidence found so far, he said. Though extremely fragile, the wooden handle was preserved in rare natural phenomena and collected carefully in foil covers. The sample would be sent to Beta Analytical Lab, Florida, USA, for exact dating, added Mr. Sivanandam, who is also the Commissioner (FAC), Department of Archaeology. The skeleton samples were handed over to experts at Madurai Kamaraj University, where a DNA testing laboratory is coming up. Disturbed lid Ms. Kaviya said the urn was found with a disturbed lid. The broken portion of the lid was retrieved inside the urn at a depth of 80 cm. There was a possibility that the broken portion of the urn lid fell on the iron dagger, as two urn lid pieces were found on either side of the dagger, which was also damaged. The Keeladi excavations are being carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India under the supervision of Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu and B. Chandramohan, Principal Secretary, Tourism, Culture & Religious Endowments Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/for-the-first-time-keeladi-site-yields-iron-dagger-with-wooden-handle/article35735662.ece

The amendment to the Act would allow the government to bring down its stake in state-owned general insurance companies. Vested interests The speakers at the demonstration said that some BJP leaders at the Centre had vested interests to safeguard their friends in the corporate circuit. The insurance sector was nationalised in 1971 and the country had a vast network of branches across all districts. The Union government received a dividend of Rs. 75,000 crore from the annual premium earned through general and other insurance companies, they said. On the pretext of increasing revenues, the Union government planned to disinvest its shares and the move would only weaken the public sector, they said. Stir to continue The employees of insurance companies across the country would intensify their stir in the coming months, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/insurance-sector-employees-stage-demo/article35735665.ece

Inaugurating the World Breastfeeding Week celebrations at the Rajiv Gandhi Women and Children’s hospital, Ms. Soundararajan stressed the need for a rural breast milk bank facility on the lines of the one in Puducherry.

05 August 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||‘Partial supply of urea’||Farmers enlisted for supply of urea through the Rajagiri Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Society have alleged partial supply. In a statement, V. Jeevakumar, a progressive farmer said the society intimated to the Joint Director, Agriculture, Thanjavur, during the third week of this month that 135 tonnes of urea were required to fulfill the requirement of 62 farmers who took loans to raise kuruvai crop this season. However, the society has received around 70 tonnes of urea only till July 23 and supplied it to the farmers, he said while claiming that a sum of around Rs. 48 lakh had been credited in the society’s account with the Thanjavur Central Cooperative Bank branch at Thirukattupalli on July 20. Further, the silence over the crop insurance cover for kuruvai crop where the insurance premium was usually detected from the cash or from the fertilizer component of the crop loan has caused immense confusion among the farmers. For instance, at Rajagiri Society, he said, the amount credited in the Society’s account includes Rs. 39 lakh as cash component, around Rs. 2.50 lakh towards seeds and Rs. 6.90 lakh to assist 62 people in taking up kuruvai cultivation. The Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to CPI(M), has alleged non-availability of urea in Orathanadu taluk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/partial-supply-of-urea/article35735641.ece
05 August 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Farmers want focus on mechanisation||Delta farmers expect the Tamil Nadu government to present its maiden Agriculture Budget with focus on farm mechanisation activities in such a manner that all sections of the farming community stand to benefit. Stating that the steep increase in labour cost in view of non-availability of adequate farm hands and as well as the agriculture engineering department’s capricious assistance in taking up mechanised farming activities over the years have forced them to look for latest farm equipment to cut down the cost of cultivation, they said that the sale price of such equipment have resulted in a situation wherein only affluent section of farmers could be able to venture into such activities. For instance, the cost of power tillers, rice transplanting machines, combined harvesting machines and other machines that were approved for purchase under the Central government sponsored Sub-Mission on Agriculture Mechanization (SMAM) aimed to establish custom hiring farm machinery banks in appropriate locations require investments in lakhs of rupees which could be affordable to the affluent farmers only, they said. The Tamil Nadu government should chalk out schemes and allot necessary funds to ensure that even medium and small farmers were able to carry on the agriculture activities using their own farm equipment, pleaded progressive farmers such as G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam and S.Rajendran of Okkanadu Kizhaiyur in Thanjavur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-want-focus-on-mechanisation/article35735634.ece
05 August 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Extend IT return filing date’||The All India Federation of Tax Practitioners has urged the Central Government to extend the last date for filing Income Tax returns to March 31, 2022 in view of the problems in the new e-filing website launched by the Income Tax department. In a statement issued here on Wednesday, its national coordinator R.Ravichandran said that several windows /links in the new e-filing website remains inaccessible and there were problems in bank record verification process to avail tax refund. Stating that the new website was non-user-friendly for the individual taxpayers attempting to file their income tax returns, he said that the denial of access to the tax practitioners including the tax practitioners who have cleared the eligibility test to file GST returns have compounded the problem. The federation urged the Income Tax department to initiate steps for rectification of defects in the new e-Filing website on a war footing and asked the Centre to extend the last date of filing of income tax returns .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/extend-it-return-filing-date/article35735645.ece

Senthil Raj has said. After inspecting the sand accumulated at the estuary in Manappad, Dr. Senthil Raj said that since the Minister for Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Anita R. Radhakrishnan was keen on removing the sand deposits at the Manappad estuary and constructing groyne to prevent recurrence of sand accumulation, an announcement in this connection would be out very soon. Dr. Senthil Raj also said Manappad would get a cold storage facility so that the fishermen could sell their catches whenever the price goes up. ASP, Tiruchendur Harsh Singh, District Revenue Officer, Tiruchendur Kokila, Joint Director of Fisheries Amal Xavier and Assistant Director Vijayaraghavan were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sand-deposit-on-manappad-beach-to-be-removed/article35735674.ece
05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Delay in construction of pumping station||Construction of a pumping station, as a part of the new drinking water scheme for the five wards of the Tiruchi Corporation, is unlikely to be completed soon due to the flow of water in the Cauvery. Planned with an aim of supplying 135 litres of drinking water per head to the residents of 61,62,63,64 and 65 wards in Tiruverumbur, Kattur and adjoining areas, the corporation began construction works in 2017. A sum of Rs. 63.70 crore was allotted. While construction of water tanks and laying of mains and branch pipes have been completed, construction of a pumping station on the banks of the Cauvery near Melur is still dragging on. The civic body included the entire work of building a pumping station in the third package of the project. Besides erecting a collector well, a footbridge will have to be constructed across the river from the pump house up to Kambarasampettai for laying a main to bring water. From there the water will be carried to Kattur and Tiruverumbur areas through the mains. The third package faces several hurdles since its formulation. The corporation had to hold several rounds of talks with the farmers, who opposed the move to tap water from the Cauvery, to convince them. They objected that it would deprive them water for farming operations. The delay over getting the mandatory clearance from the Public Works Department played its part. Flow of water in the Cauvery is also playing its part in holding up the work. It requires no water flow in the Cauvery for about six months to build the pumping station and raising pillars for the foot over bridge across the Cauvery. When the contractor was about to start the work in May-June 2020, water was released from the Mettur from June 12. The flow continued up to February this year. Construction works began after the water dried up in the river. By the time the works picked up momentum, the Mettur dam was once again opened on June 12 this year. It has forced the contractor to move the construction materials from the work site. Sources said that it was not possible to carry out works when water was flowing in the river. As per the standard practice, it was expected that water flow would be maintained up to the second week of February 2022. The work could be resumed only after that. However, all possible steps would be taken to complete the works before opening the Mettur dam for irrigation in 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-construction-of-pumping-station/article35735647.ece
05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Drop in number of people getting vaccinated||The number of people taking the COVID-19 vaccine witnessed a dip during the last few days. According to officials of the Health Department, only 30% of the population in the city has taken at least one shot of the vaccine. The scene at the Kalaiarangam and Devar Hall in the city was quite the opposite of what had transpired there over the last few weeks. While 1000 doses of the vaccine were distributed to each of the two centres to inoculate people with the second dose of Covaxin, by noon, only around 200 were administered. The medical officers at the site were contemplating whether they could open up the vaccination site to people to get the first dose. ‘We cannot waste the vaccine. If we get 10 people, we will open a vial and inoculate them,’ a staff at Kalaiarangam said. While over 2,000 people used to gather at these locations each time a vaccination camp was announced, the crowd was sparse on Wednesday. ‘Many thronged to get the vaccine last month as they were asked to return to their workplaces with a vaccination certificate. However, the dip in COVID-19 cases has reflected in the turnout too,’ A. Mohammed Hakkim, doctor in charge of the vaccination drive in the city said. Dr. Hakkim said that vaccine hesitancy continues to be an issue amongst the informal sector and people who do not venture outdoors. ‘Many have told me that they do not need the vaccine as they do not go to crowded places. Similarly, small shop owners, street vendors, etc., say they will lose a day’s wages if they take the vaccine,’ he said. Another doctor said that the inconsistent supply of vaccines too may have had an effect on the turnout. The public must depend on information on social media and the newspapers to be informed of the vaccination sites of the day. ‘We are unable to operate all our vaccination sites every day because we are getting fewer doses than we can administer,’ they said. Meanwhile, S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, Tiruchi, said that Adi Perukku celebration may also have affected the vaccine turnout.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drop-in-number-of-people-getting-vaccinated/article35735649.ece
05 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Damaged bridge poses a risk||Residents risk their lives to cross a damaged minor bridge across a canal in Thiruvanaikovil between Thimmarayasamuthiram and A.I.B.E.A. Bank Colony. A ration shop, bus stand and other essentials lie on the other side of the bridge, and without them, the residents must take a two-km long detour to access them, they said. A. Vanitha, a resident of Thimmarayasamuthiram, says that many times she has nearly fallen into the canal. However, she said it was either taking the risky path or walking an additional two km while carrying ration from the ration shop, which was more difficult. A large number of residents depend upon the PDS shop for ration. People from the other side cross over the bridge to access a bus stand. The bridge was built at least 15 years ago to connect the two localities. It was wide enough for two-wheelers to travel. However, over a year ago, during the monsoon season, rains battered the already weak bridge. Though vehicle users started taking a circuitous route via the Chennai Bypass Road or the internal road around the Bank Colony, the residents decided to put a wooden plank to connect the broken parts of the bridge so that pedestrians could cross it. Barricades have been placed to ensure that vehicles do not attempt to cross the stretch. “The damaged bridge is a mishap waiting to happen especially at night when there is low visibility. With no street lights illuminating the area, they have to depend on a small torch. The wooden plank also gets slippery,” she said. The residents claim that they have submitted several petitions to authorities but in vain. “Over the last year, we have approached authorities in the Tiruchi Corporation and even a few representatives of political parties. However, we have not got a favourable response,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/damaged-bridge-poses-a-risk/article35735636.ece
05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Horses brought for sale at Manapparai shandy||Horses were brought in for sale, reportedly for the first time, at the weekly Manapparai shandy this week. The shandy is usually held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. A separate enclosure was made for exhibiting the horses. According to sources, 19 horses belonging to indigenous breeds were brought to the shandy. While four horses each were brought from Karur and Tiruchi, a few horses belonging to Manapparai, Valanadu and Manjampatti were exhibited. As news spread about the arrival of horses, many traders, who specialise in bull, cow and sheep and goat trades, made a beeline to see the horses. Four horses were sold during the shandy that began on Tuesday afternoon and concluded on Wednesday. “It is a good beginning. There is no established shandy for horses in the State except for the annual shandy at Anthiyur in Erode district. We hope that horse trading will become a regular feature at Manapparai shandy,” said N. Periathambi, a horse and bull rearer in Manapparai. He said that the number of horses would double in the next week. Similarly, more traders were expected from different parts of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/horses-brought-for-sale-at-manapparai-shandy/article35735640.ece
05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||IIIT-Tiruchi to double intake of students for B.Tech. programmes||The Indian Institute of Information Technology - Tiruchi, which would soon be moving to its permanent 56-acre campus at Sethurapatti on the outskirts of Tiruchi, is looking to double its student intake for its B.Tech. programmes for 2021-22 academic session. The intake will be doubled for each of its two B.Tech programmes - Computer Science Engineering and Electronics and Communication Engineering - from 30 to 60, according to official sources. Last year, the overall intake for the two programmes was 74 including the admissions made under EWS (Economically Weaker Section) quota and supernumerary quota. This time around, the intake for the two B.Tech programmes is expected to get close to 150. The institute will have to secure the approval of its Board of Governors before announcing the number of seats to be filled based on Joint Entrance Exam scores. The IIIT-Tiruchi had admitted 60 students for each of the two programmes at the time of its launch in 2013. It started functioning on the premises of Bharathidasan Institute of Technology. The intake was halved after it was shifted to National Institute of Technology - Tiruchi (NIT-T) in 2016, due to space constraints. Besides increasing intake in B.Tech programmes, the IIIT-Tiruchi will also be restoring the M.Tech programmes in VLSI Design, and Computer Science Engineering from 2021-22. There will be an intake of 23 students for each of the two PG programmes. The admissions are being made through CCMT (Centralised Counselling for M.Tech./M.Arch./M.Plan. admissions) coordinated by Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur. Applicants for the M.Tech programmes constituted those who had cleared the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) in 2019, 2020 or 2021. Since there has been progress in placements, the institute is expected to admit students with better cut-offs for the B.Tech programmes. In 2020-21, the highest package for ECE was Rs. 19.5 lakh per annum, and for CSE, it was Rs. 19 lakh per annum. Last year, the highest package was Rs. 18 lakh. The placement percentage has also registered a rise from 50 last year to 63 this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iiit-tiruchi-to-double-intake-of-students/article35735642.ece
05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Daily feedback mechanism on impact of Kalvi Channel working well for teachers||Timely supply of free text books coupled with the daily-feedback mechanism initiated by the School Education Department that requires teachers to update data pertaining to the content completion through watching Kalvi TV Channel in the Education Management Information System (EMIS) portal has apparently infused confidence among school heads that the entire portions could be covered this year even if the classroom sessions are disrupted by the pandemic. Having distributed copies of programme schedule of Kalvi Channel to the students, the teachers have been mandated with the task of obtaining daily feedback on the learning impact, and upload the same on the EMIS portal. The teachers had already uploaded in the portal details of students who have access to gadgets for online education and those who can afford to watch only television. ‘The new system of daily monitoring of academic progress looks promising. Since the students have the text books, it has become easy for us to give them daily assignments. Students are required to submit the assignments in their respective schools once a week,’ James, a teacher of a government-aided higher secondary school in Tiruchi said. Now that the teachers are required to attend the school on a daily basis, they are able to utilise their time to keep a tab on the academic progress of the students. ‘We even go on surprise visits to the houses of students to determine if they are watching the Kalvi Channel telecast of particular subjects at the assigned time,’ Parthiban, another teacher said. ‘On a random basis, we talk to five of six students every day in the evening to make sure that they have understood the concepts explained by subject experts and experienced teachers through the TV channel,’ he said. More often, the head of the family who is the only person using a smart phone in a family, has to go out to work during the course of the day. The teachers, therefore, interact with the students in the evening hours when they have access to the phone and assign writing tasks through WhatsApp. Since there is no indication that the offline classes will begin any time soon, the systematic completion of portions, no matter whether or not the students have access to gadgets supporting online education, will stand the students in good stead when the term examinations are conducted during the course of the year, school heads say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/daily-feedback-mechanism-on-impact-of-kalvi-channel-working-well-for-teachers/article35735644.ece

05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Parents unhappy with CBSE over Class XII marks||Several parents of CBSE schools are an aggrieved lot over the tabulation of Class XII marks for their wards based on its formula due to the cancellation of pen and paper examination. The scores are decided based on 40% contribution of the marks of class XII based on Unit Test/ Mid Term/ Pre-Board exams; 30% contribution of marks of class XI based on the theory component; and 30 % of the marks of Class X based on the average theory component of best three performing subjects out of main five subjects. Result committees were constituted by every school purportedly to ensure accuracy and fairness of results. ‘Those schools that had skipped the Class XI portions to concentrate on class XII content have been caught on wrong foot. The dismay of parents over the marks is a clear indicator of the arbitrariness of the private CBSE schools in the awarding of marks for Class XI,’ A.Devarajan, adviser-cum-spokesperson of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Parents Association, Tiruchi, said. The content in Class XI is vital for students to score well in NEET, JEE and other competitive exams. The CBSE should ideally appoint officers region-wise to monitor the academic activities of the schools, in consideration of the steady rise in the number of schools following the Board’s pattern across the State, Mr. Devarajan said. According to a principal of a CBSE school in Tiruchi, the mandate of the Sahodaya School Complex mechanism is limited. Literally meaning ‘rising together,’ the concept came into being over two decades ago to facilitate synergy of ideas among the schools in geographical clusters for excellence in education. The Sahodaya School Complex is meant to share innovative practices in all aspects of school education including curriculum design, evaluation and pedagogy with other sahodayas all over the country and abroad. But redressal of grievances of parents is altogether a different area, he said. An aggrieved parent complained that the school where his ward had completed Class XII had accorded differential treatment to the students. ‘We have nowhere to go to register our complaint,’ he said. Official sources said the students who were unsatisfied with their marks could approach the Disputes Settlement Committee. A detailed process will be communicated to the students shortly to address complaints of students who have any dispute regarding their result preparation, according to a CBSE circular.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/parents-unhappy-with-cbse-over-class-xii-marks/article35735654.ece
05 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fine imposed for ignoring safety norms||In an attempt to check a possible third wave of the pandemic, the city police have launched a special drive to create awareness among the public and ensure adherence to COVID 19 safety protocol, especially wearing of masks and maintaining personal distancing in public places.

Inaugurating one such programme near Palayamkottai Market on Wednesday, Collector V. Vishnu appealed to the public to strictly follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour to shield themselves from the viral infection. Since the number of new cases were predicted to go up in the days to come due to violations, people should wear masks while going out of their homes, keep physical distancing and avoid visiting crowded places. Those who had even mild symptoms should undergo COVID-19 test as the district administration had put in place arrangements to conduct a minimum of 3,000 tests a day to ensure early intervention. Apart from checkposts, samples were being lifted in the Tirunelveli Railway Junction from passengers arriving here with COVID-19 symptoms. On the availability of medical-grade oxygen in the district, the Collector said steps had been taken to install oxygen generator in the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital since it was getting patients from almost all southern districts while an imported oxygen generator, sponsored by a private firm, was supplying the life-saving gas to 100 beds in Koodankulam Government Hospital. “The district, which had established COVID Care Centres at nine places during the ‘second wave’, will create more such centres if the situation warranted during the ‘third wave’,” Mr. Vishnu said. The Collector, who appealed to the public to get vaccinated at the earliest, also distributed ‘kabasura kudineer’, ‘nilavembu kudineer’ and ‘amukkara’ tablets in the presence of Corporation Commissioner B. Vishnu Chandran to the public as an attempt to boost the immunity. Thoothukudi In Thoothukudi, Collector K. Senthil Raj distributed ‘kabasura kudineer’, ‘nilavembu kudineer’ and COVID-19 awareness pamphlets to the public at Old Bus-Stand. He said the public could get the siddha formulations, which were being given to strengthen immunity against the viral infection, in the special camps being organised across the district. Kanniyakumari In Kanniyakumari district, Collector M. Aravind, while inaugurating the ‘kabasura kudineer’ distribution at Government Ayurvedi College, appealed to the public to take all preventive measures even though they were vaccinated against the viral infection. The Collector informed that special medical facilities had been created in the paediatric wards of government hospitals and the Government Medical College Hospital in Aasaaripallam as ‘third wave’ was likely to affect the children.

05 August 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||102 criminals detained under Goondas Act over seven months in Tirunelveli||The district police have detained 102 criminals, mostly those who were arrested in connection with murder and attempt to murder cases, under the Goondas Act over the past seven months since January 1 last. Of these 102 criminals, who were posing serious threat to the public tranquility, 82 are facing serious charges of murder, attempt to murder, burglary and robbery and seven others were arrested for selling ganja and other narcotic substances, which is on the rise in the district as the ganja peddlers get dried cannabis via Madurai. Since bootlegging was a major lucrative industry in the past in Tirunlveli district and it led to bloody caste clashes when the criminals belonging to different castes entered the business, more attention is being paid to uproot the making and selling of liquor illegally. “In this connection, we have arrested six persons for illicit brewing, who have been later detained under the Goondas Act,” says N. Manivannan, Superintendent of Police. Similarly, the illicit sand mining also leads to detention under Goondas Act in the district as four persons from Tirunelveli are now behind the bars under this Act. “After bootlegging, the criminals resort to illegal sand quarrying for making quick and big money,” he pointed out. Rivalry in this business has also led to several murders in the past. “Hence, those who enter this business are arrested and detained under the Goondas Act,” Mr. Manivannan said. The remaining three are POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act offenders, who are on the prowl. District Collector V. Vishnu said the detention of history-sheeters under the Goondas Act was intensified with the objective of ensuring rule of law across the district by bringing the criminals behind the bars and subsequently guaranteeing the safety of every resident from the aggressive designs of the thugs. More importantly, those who are fanning caste rivalry between different castes are being monitored closely and appropriate actions taken. “At the same time, we are giving due importance to sort out the problems in rural areas like drinking water, access to cremation ground, temple festivals, encroachments etc. as these trivial issues are blown out of proportion after caste colour is given. So we are attaching due significance for finding the just solutions to nip the problems in bud,” Mr. Vishnu said.  Goondas Act will be invoked for sure against bootleggers, ganja peddlers, illicit sand miners, says Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/102-criminals-detained-under-goondas-act-over-seven-months-in-tirunelveli/article35736011.ece

05 August 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Traders down shutters for 90 minutes; oppose registration of cases under SC/ST Act||Condemning the registration of fake case under the SC/ST Act against a few traders of Tirunelveli Town, all shops, including leading textile showrooms on North and East Car Streets downed the shutters for about 90 minutes on Wednesday. The token strike by the shops that started at 9 a.m., was withdrawn at 10.30 a.m. The protesting traders, having their shops on North and East Car Streets of Tirunelveli Town, said the pavement hawkers, who were blocking the way to their shops were creating problems for them for the past several years. When the traders opposed this, cases under SC / ST Act were registered in Tirunelveli Town police station based on the “false complaints” filed by a few pavement hawkers. President of North Car Street Traders’ Association Sankaranarayanan said the Corporation and the district administration should find a separate place for pavement hawkers who were chocking the passage to their shops. “Since our customers are being denied access to our shops by the pavement hawkers, it often triggers altercations between them. As we support our customers, they turn their ire against us and file false complaints that get registered by the police under SC/ST Act, which should be withdrawn. This is only a token agitation. If this protest fails to evoke positive response from the official machinery, we’ve decided to close the shops indefinitely,” Mr. Sanakaranarayanan warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-down-shutters-oppose-registration-of-cases-under-scst-act/article35735678.ece

05 August 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||President appreciates ‘grit and determination’ of Armed forces||President Ram Nath Kovind appreciated the “grit and determination” of the armed forces in dealing with the situation at the border and also during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing student officers of the 77th staff course of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, on Wednesday, Mr. Kovind referred to the pandemic and said that it has impacted all walks of life. “Very recently I had an opportunity to interact with our officers and soldiers in the Kashmir valley. I felt very happy to observe their high morale and dedication to duty. Most of you have been among the frontline warriors, dealing with these challenges. The country appreciates your commitment and contribution,” he said. “The recent past has been very difficult for the entire humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all walks of life. I have been told that Defence Services Staff College has successfully run the scheduled courses by effectively adopting a hybrid system blending conventional and online learning,” he said. Mr. Kovind said that the armed forces of the country were among “the most respected entities” of our great nation. “They have rendered invaluable service to the nation during the times of war and peace. They have discharged their duties with dedication and courage while facing internal and external security challenges, and in times of natural calamities,” he said. The President also emphasised the challenges and changing complexities of national security and defence. “Geo-strategic and geo-political compulsions and many other factors have made the security landscape more complex. Low-intensity conflicts, counter- terrorism and non-combat conflicts pose different challenges. There is a need to have a thorough understanding of all aspects. In these changing times, we have to think of new ways to secure our national interests and ensure our national security. This would require a fresh approach,” he said. “The emerging threats in the cyber world, and space require state-of- the-art technological responses. Use of advanced technology by non-state actors also calls for upgraded response. Issues like climate change may have impact on security preparedness. All such issues influence the security calculus of the nation. You have to comprehend their implications so that you are better prepared to deal with them,” he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/president-appreciates-grit-and-determination-of-armed-forces/article35735537.ece

05 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Virudhunagar district fully geared to fight the third wave||Though Virudhunagar district has recorded the highest seropositivity of 84% in a recent survey conducted in the State, the district administration has not lowered its guards and is taking all steps to contain COVID-19 infection. Simultaneously, it has geared up its hospital infrastructure to face a possible third wave of the pandemic, according to Collector J. Meghanath Reddy. “We are in a ‘prepared mode’ and our approach remains the same, whether there is third wave or not,” he told The Hindu on Wednesday. He said on a daily basis the positivity rate was being analysed. “Though it is around 0.5% we have not reduced the number of samples taken. Every day around 3,000 samples are being lifted,” he said. Besides, for every positive person, contact tracing – both primary contacts and worksite contacts – were being traced. “At least 20 contacts are being tested. Moreover, the areas where the infected person is located is swept with health officials conducting fever survey,” he said. The administration was not waiting for people to come to hospitals to get themselves vaccinated. “We are targeting different types of vulnerable people, like those with non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension, physically disabled, ante-natal and lactating mothers, government employees and MGNREGS workers,” he said. As the State witnessed a surge in the number of daily positivity rate, Virudhunagar district administration had banned entry of devotees to all places of worship till August 11. “We have done it to stop large congregations during the festival season,” Mr. Meghanath said. Though commercial establishments and markets had been warned against violating mask rule and social distancing norms, dedicated teams would soon be deployed in each taluk to monitor market places and commercial establishments. The Collector said stringent measures would be taken against those violating the standard operating procedures. Even as preventive steps had been successful in bringing down the daily new cases to around 25, the district administration was ready with adequate number of beds and oxygen supply for COVID-19 patients. Government Virudhunagar Medical College Hospital (VMCH) had already provided oxygen supply to 400 beds. Another 100 beds had been allocated for paediatric unit. “We may increase the number of beds with oxygen supply by another 100,” the Collector said. Similarly, out of the 1,200 beds in other government hospitals, 650 beds had been readied with oxygen supply. Meanwhile, the district has got two oxygen generators put up in private factories that would be supplied for the GHs. Besides, oxygen generators had been established in Virudhunagar Medical College Hospital and at Rajapalayam GH. Installation work was under way in Aruppukottai GH and plans were afoot to provide oxygen generators in Tiruchuli and Kariyapatti GHs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/virudhunagar-district-fully-geared-to-fight-the-third-wave/article35735680.ece

05 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Two rejoin Ministry, two dropped and two not considered||It was an interesting day for Belagavi politics on Wednesday when the State Cabinet was formed. Two legislators re-joined the Ministry, two were dropped and two others hoping to join the Cabinet were not considered. Umesh Katti and Shashikala Jolle were administered the oath of office but Lakshman Savadi, who served as Deputy Chief Minister, and Srimanth Patil, who defected from the Congress to become Textile Minister, were not re-inducted. Three-time MLA Abhay Patil and young legislator P. Rajeev, who were hoping to make it, had to postpone their visit to the Raj Bhavan. The Jarkiholi brothers, Ramesh and Balachandra, both former Ministers, were not considered either. There was speculation that the party will induct Balachandra Jarkiholi in the place of Ramesh Jarkiholi who resigned over allegations of sexual harassment. But their followers are now claiming that one of them will become a Minister in the next reshuffle. Hukkeri MLA Umesh Vishwanath Katti, who said that he was hoping to be made a Deputy Chief Minister, had to be content with being a Cabinet Minister. A late entrant to the B.S. Yediyurappa Cabinet, Mr. Katti served as the Food and Civil Supplies Minister for around five months. The leader who recently celebrated his 60th birthday has said that he will become the Chief Minister in the next 15 years of his active public life. He was hardly 25 when his father, the veteran Janata Parivar leader Vishwanath Katti, died in 1985. Later that year, he won the bypolls from Hukkeri to become the youngest member in the Assembly. Hailing from Bellad Bagewadi village near Hukkeri, he dropped out of pre university. He has a total assets of Rs. 27 crore and liabilities of Rs. 5 crore, as per his 2018 election affidavit. Starting out as a young cooperative society leader, he has now grown to be among the senior-most legislators in the State winning seven general elections and a bypoll. He has been a Minister four times, holding important portfolios, including Food and Civil Supplies. He has led cooperative institutions, including the Hukkeri Electricity Supply Cooperative Society and the Belagavi District Central Cooperative Bank and also sugar factories. He has attracted controversy by seeking statehood for North Karnataka, a few times. The senior Lingayat leader had strongly opposed the demand for religion status for Lingayat. He has attributed his desire to become the Chief Minister of undivided Karnataka, to his habit of loud thinking. Nippani MLA Shashikala Annasaheb Jolle is among the few women in leadership positions in the cooperative sector in the State. The 52-year-old leader is actively involved in the activities of Sahakara Bharati, an RSS-affiliated federation of cooperatives. Along with her husband and Chikkodi MP Annasaheb, Ms. Shashikala Jolle runs the Beereshwara Multi-State Cooperative Society and the Jyoti Multi-Purpose Souharda Sahakari Society. The Beereshwara Cooperative Society has branches in Karnataka and Maharashtra and offers diversified financial services. With assets of over Rs. 35 crore and liabilities of Rs. 16 crore, she is among the wealthiest women legislators in the State. She founded a school for physically challenged children in her home town of Examba two decades ago. The Lingayat leader regularly hosts cultural activities related to Sharanas and Vachana literature. She has denied allegations of bribery levelled against her by some TV channels in the supply of eggs to anganwadis in the State. With the induction of Prabhu Chauhan, the BJP seemed to have filled the Lambani quota in the Cabinet. This reduced the chances of P. Rajeev of the Karnataka Lambani Tanda Development Corporation who was hoping to make it to the Ministry. The 44-year-old leader had made a few trips to Bengaluru and New Delhi to meet party leaders. Belagavi South MLA Abhay Patil had refused to be appointed to boards and corporations saying he would prefer a Ministry. The student leader-turned-politician belongs to the Jain community. He told journalists a few weeks ago that he was a follower of former Union Minister Ananth Kumar and would like to be recognised for his merit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-rejoin-ministry-two-dropped-and-two-not-considered/article35735722.ece

05 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Civic body launches sero survey||The city’s civic body has launched a sero survey, which will be completed in the next one week to understand the prevalence of the virus, its severity, and resistance among citizens. Based on the results of the survey, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will lay out rules and restrictions in the coming days to prevent the spread of the virus in the city. A total of 2,000 people will be surveyed under the exercise. Out of them, 30% will be under 18 years of age, 50% will be above 18 years, and 20% above 45 years. To also understand the impact of vaccines, blood samples of 1,000 vaccinated individuals and 1,000 non-vaccinated individuals will be collected, to determine the amount of antibodies present, BBMP officials said. ASHA workers and the civic body’s ANM workers have identified people to be surveyed in every ward through a door-to-door survey. While the serum sample will be tested at a laboratory for antibodies, the throat swab will be tested for RT-PCR, sources said. Primary healthcare centres will spearhead the survey. “The sero survey will help us understand infection resistance and severity. The survey will show how many people have been infected, how many have not been infected, and how many have antibodies in their bodies. It will help us tackle the virus in days ahead,” said Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commissioner, BBMP, who inaugurated the exercise in the city on Wednesday. Though the case positivity rate in the city was less than 1% with around 400 cases daily, the city’s civic body is pulling up its socks trying to prevent the spread of the virus. Mr. Gupta addressed Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and trader associations in the city on Wednesday, asking them to strengthen COVID-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) on their premises. Mr. Gupta expressed concern over more number of cases being reported from a few apartments in the city and sought more caution in all apartments across the city. “One must immediately be isolated as soon as the infection is detected. In addition, the primary, secondary contacts, and the neighbours should be tested and isolated. All RWAs must comply with COVID-19 rules in case of any social event being held in their apartments and party halls. It is better such gatherings are avoided as far as possible. Precautionary measures must be taken at common areas of the apartments and gyms,” he said. In his meeting with trader associations, he observed CAB was not being followed in many business hubs. “The staff at the shops and customers must wear masks and follow social distance. The shops must also have sanitisers. If guidelines are not followed marshals, Home Guards and police officers will visit the site and impose a fine,” he warned. He added that all staff must be regularly tested for COVID-19 and in case of any symptom, they must be tested immediately. He also said vaccinating all employees was a priority.

Kalasad, MD, KSRTC, said, “Among employees who have sought transfer from Bengaluru, 90% are from BMTC. There are applications from KSRTC employees too. A majority of them are from northern parts of the State. Due to various factors such as cost of living in the city, to stay with family members and others, they want to move out from Bengaluru.” Employees who want to move out from Bengaluru are either seeking transfers to North Western Road Transport Corporation or Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation. Scrutiny on The official said that the scrutiny of the applications is in progress. Priority will be given to those who have completed more than ten years of service, not facing departmental enquiry or serious charges, and availability of vacancies in receiving corporations, among other factors . Mr. Kalasad said that as per the policy decision, transfer is limited to only 2% of the cadre strength of the corporations. The transfer process likely to be completed by August 15.

05 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Regional representation takes a hit amidst political compulsions||Regional representation has taken a hit in the political manoeuvring that appeared to have focused mainly on taking different factions in the BJP into confidence as 13 of the total 31 districts do not have representation in Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s ministry. Though the Chief Minister had been referring to the need for ensuring regional representation, this aspect is missing amidst various political compulsions. On their part, the party insiders blame it on the compulsion to accommodate legislators who came from other parties to help the BJP rise to power. But the fact that a sizeable chunk of districts have gone without representation has already started causing concern among party cadre as that may come in the way of poll preparations. This is more so in districts coming under the Old Mysore region as several of them lack political representation in the ministry especially at a time when the party is trying to establish its identity by making inroads in these districts. There is no representation in the ministry for districts like Mysuru, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, Vijayapura, Davangere, and Ballari where the party has a strong base and strong network. The other districts which lack representation are Chamarajanagar, Ramanagaram, Kolar, Hassan, Kalaburagi, Raichur, and Yadgir. At the same time, there is a mismatch as Bengaluru has seven Ministers and six other districts, including Belagavi and Shivamogga, have two Ministers each. The situation is unlikely improve with only four vacant berths out of a possible 34. Responding to this, Chief Minister said that Ministers from other areas would be given the responsibility of effective implementation of developments works. In contrast to regional balance, the Chief Minister appears to have tried hard on balancing caste equations. Eight of his team members belong to the dominant Lingayat community to which he too belongs, while seven are from the other dominant community of Vokkaligas. There are seven OBCs, three from the Scheduled Castes, while one Minister belongs to Scheduled Tribes. Mr. Bommai explicitly spelt out the caste combination in the press conference. There were discordant voices on caste representation too. For instance, Sri Krishna Yadavananda Swami, while referring to community MLA Poornima Srinivas (Golla) missing on ministerial opportunity, alleged that the BJP has given importance only to dominant communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/regional-representation-takes-a-hit-amidst-political-compulsions/article35735482.ece
05 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BJP high command stood firm on Vijayendra’s exclusion||Former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is reportedly upset that he could not secure a Cabinet berth for his son B.Y. Vijayendra(in picture), despite lobbying hard till the last minute. However, the father-son duo were seen enthusiastically participating in the swearing-in ceremony at the Raj Bhavan on Wednesday. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai landing in the city Wednesday morning said the party high command was yet to give him clear directions on two issues, one being that of Mr. Vijayendra. Shortly after, J.P. Nadda, BJP president, and Arun Singh, in charge of party affairs in the State, reportedly spoke to father and son and communicated the high command’s decision not to induct Mr. Vijayendra into the Cabinet and tried to placate them, sources said. The high command has reportedly assured Mr. Yediyurappa that his son’s “future will be taken care of”, but not by offering a Cabinet berth at present, as it would attract the charge of dynastic politics. The high command also did not want other power centres within the Cabinet, it is learnt. Mr. Vijayendra will continue to work in the party organisation for now, sources said. Mr. Yediyurappa had reportedly been lobbying to make his son a Deputy Chief Minister under a non-lingayat Chief Minister, a proposal that was out of question with Mr. Bommai at the helm. Later, he lobbied hard to secure his son a berth in the Cabinet till late on Tuesday night, reportedly causing anxious moments. However, the central leadership did not relent and stood firm, sources said. Meanwhile, the Cabinet expansion exercise has been a mixed bag for the former Chief Minister. While many of his followers failed to secure a berth, almost all his detractors who publicly criticised him have also been kept out of the Cabinet. Mr. Yediyurappa was pushing for his detractors not to be included in the Cabinet, sources said. Several ministerial aspirants who failed to secure a berth in the Cabinet, M.P. Renukacharya, Raju Gowda, and others, made a beeline for Mr. Yediyurappa’s residence. The former Chief Minister unhappy over the non-inclusion of his son may emerge as a rallying point of many ministerial aspirants who did not make it, the party fears.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-high-command-stood-firm-on-vijayendras-exclusion/article35735476.ece
05 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Those who openly criticised party colleagues lose out||The BJP high command, in picking Ministers in the Basavaraj Bommai-led ministry, seems to have kept out legislators who had opened fronts against party colleagues in public – either against or in defence of B.S. Yediyurappa, adversely impacting the party’s image. “This is a clear message from the party to the legislators and cadre that indiscipline will not be tolerated,” a senior party leader said. C.P. Yogeshwar, who became a Minister in January 2021 and later turned a bitter critic of Mr. Yediyurappa, made frequent trips to Delhi and speculated on leadership change, found no place. Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, a trenchant critique of the former Chief Minister who was also served a show-cause notice by the party, Aravind Bellad, who alleged the government had tapped his phone, also did not make it. M.P. Renukacharya, who was political secretary to Mr. Yediyurappa, Nehru Olekar, and other aspirants close to him who had openly attacked other party leaders did not get berths. Amidst speculation that many seniors will be axed, K.S. Eshwarappa, who had complained against the then Chief Minister to the Governor, emerged survivor. “His commitment to the party and lack of other credible leaders from among Kurubas, the biggest OBC community, has given him a new lease of life,” a senior party leader said. Another senior leader who survived is Govind Karjol, who belongs to the Dalit (left) community, a key votebank for the BJP. Senior former Ministers who did not make it back to the Cabinet include former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, who decided to sit out, former Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, senior Ministers S. Suresh Kumar and Arvind Limbavali. “Mr. Savadi had a great opportunity when he was made DCM, but he seems to have squandered it. He was dropped to prevent over-representation of Belagavi,” a strategist said. Mr. Limbavali was let go to cut down the dominance of Bengaluru in the Cabinet, sources said. Meanwhile, party sources said Mr. Kumar had lost face after the oxygen shortage tragedy that led to the death of 24 COVID-19 patients at Chamarajanagar, which he was in charge of.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/those-who-openly-criticised-party-colleagues-lose-out/article35735474.ece
05 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Mechanism in place to tackle monkey menace’||The State government on Wednesday told the High Court of Karnataka that there is a mechanism in place to tackle the monkey menace, which is prevalent throughout the State. The government has also told the HC that bodies of monkeys found in gunny bags near Belur in Hassan district on July 28 was a result of attempt made by the residents of Ugane and Kyathanahalli villages to capture monkeys through private persons to overcome repeated damage caused by the animals to their crops. Delhi model won’t do In response to the court’s earlier query, the direction to evolve a scheme like the Delhi model to tackle the monkey menace, the government told the HC that the scheme evolved in Delhi appears to be not yielding desired results as other monkeys are found occupying the places from where the authorities were capturing a group of monkeys, and the Delhi government itself has sought help from Karnataka in this regard. The government provided these details to a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda during the hearing on two separate PIL petitions, one fined by advocate B.S. Radhanandan on the monkey menace in Bengaluru city, and another petition initiated suo motu by the court on the issue of 38 monkeys found dead near Beluru. In 2010 The government has stated that Circle Chief Conservators of Forests across the State were authorised back in 2010 to issue orders to capture problematic monkeys and release them to their suitable natural habitats as and when local authorities got complaints of the menace. Monkey park proposal As a sustainable solution, an area of 170 acres has been identified in Mathikai village of Hosnagara taluk in Shivamogga district to set up a monkey park to rehabilitate captured, injured and sick monkeys from different parts of the State, the government said while pointing out that officials have studied the monkey menace by visiting Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. A mobile veterinary operation unit has been prepared under the guidance of Project Director of Kanrataka Cattle Development Board and veterinarians are being trained in behavioural aspects, capture, sterilisation and release of monkeys, it said in its statement while pointing out that 56 cases of menace were reported in Bengaluru city alone during 2018-21. It was also informed that there exists a helpline with the BBMP for issues related to the snake and monkey menace in Bengaluru city. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to look at the legal issue over permitting private monkey catchers as the definition of hunting of animals in the Wildlife (Protection) Act also covers capturing of animals leading to violation of law as well as raising question over expertise. In the Belur instance, the Bench asked the government to examine the loophole in registration of the FIR as accused persons should not benefit from it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mechanism-in-place-to-tackle-monkey-menace/article35735466.ece
05 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cabinet nod for separate Scheduled Tribe Welfare Secretariat||An hour after swearing in ceremony of 29 ministers, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai chaired a full-fledged Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and decided to establish a separate Scheduled Tribe Welfare Secretariat for faster approval of schemes and effective utilisation of funds meant for the community. At present, there are separate secretariats for Other Backward Castes (OBCs) and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Cabinet decided to form the separate ST Welfare Secretariat for quick approvals, effective supervision, and faster implementation of schemes meant for the welfare of the community, the chief minister told media persons after the meeting. At present, the different departments allocate funds for the Scheduled Tribe Plan (STP). Formation of the separate secretariat would help the government to allocate funds in one department. STs constitute around 7% of the State’s population. “With today’s decision, the government has fulfilled a long-pending demand of the community,” Mr. Bommai said. Floods challenge Floods and possible threat of the COVID-19 third wave are major challenges before the new government. To handle these twin challenges, the CM said ministers have been instructed to visit districts assigned to them on Thursday to inspect and review both flood situations as well as take steps to prevent the third wave of the pandemic. All 29 Ministers have been assigned districts. He also instructed Ministers to pay compensation to those affected by floods depending on the availability of funds and if necessary, submit reports seeking more funds for providing compensation to farmers and people who had lost crops and houses on account of floods in 13 districts. ‘Mission’ for women On the lines of Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan and Tribal Sub-Plans (SCSP/TSP), the Cabinet has taken a decision on forming a Mission headed by the CM for effective implementation of women’s safety and welfare programmes in various departments. The Mission would function under the direct supervision of the Chief Minister, as announced in the Budget 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cabinet-nod-for-separate-scheduled-tribe-welfare-secretariat/article35735471.ece

He has directed all Ministers to tour the respective districts allotted to them and camp there. While Govind Karjol will be in charge of Belagavi, a key district ravaged by floods and a district bordering Maharashtra, where COVID-19 cases are raising, A. Shivaram Hebbar will be in-charge of Uttara Kannada, another flood hit district. R. Ashok will oversee COVID-19 management in Bengaluru, S. Angara in Dakshina Kannada, Kota Srinivas Poojary in Kodagu and S. T. Somashekhar in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar and Araga Jnanendra in Chikkamagaluru, all districts of concern for COVID-19. A new task force on COVID-19, headed by a Minister, would be reconstituted after allocation of portfolios to Ministers, he said. Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan was heading the task force on COVID-19 in the B.S.

05 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||SEC not bound by Cabinet decision to postpone elections to local bodies: HC||While declaring that the State Election Commission (SEC) is not bound by the State Cabinet’s decision to postpone elections to local bodies till December in view of COVID-19, the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the government to justify the decision to postpone elections. Also, it directed the SEC to take a decision by August 13 on issuing a calender of events for holding elections to city corporations, ZPs , city municipal councils, and other local bodies. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition initiated suo motu by the HC in the issue of violation of constitutional provision in not holding elections to several local despite despite expiry of term of the elected bodies. Pointing out that the State Cabinet’s May 17, 2021, decision to postpone elections to local bodies was taken when the COVID-19 situation was serious, the Bench asked why the election cannot be held now when the government has relaxed COVID-19 restrictions allowing people to visiting various places, including temples, by following a queue system. Observing that the Karnataka is perhaps the only State where the elections to the local bodies are not held within the time frame fixed in the Constitution, the Bench questioned how could the State government decide on postponing the elections when it is the prerogative of the SEC to decide on holding elections. When the Bench questioned the counsel for SEC on why the elections were not declared for the local bodies even after relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, the counsel, while clarifying that SEC was not bound by the Cabinet decision, has clarified that a meeting of the SEC was held in this regard on July 20 and a decision on holding elections would be taken shortly. Further hearing has been adjourned till August 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sec-not-bound-by-cabinet-decision-to-postpone-elections-to-local-bodies-hc/article35735468.ece

The order, signed by Mr. Pant on August 1, was executed on August 4, with an explanation that prohibitory orders were issued on the recommendation of the State Disaster Management Committee on July 31 to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the prohibitory orders are applicable across Bengaluru till August 16 midnight, bus stands, metro stations, railway stations, and the airport have been exempted. “Even though the number of positive cases in Bengaluru have come down substantially, it is considered necessary to impose certain restrictions in accordance with the government’s aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases in the city,” says the order.

05 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Too many contenders led to removal of Dy. CM post||Much against the expectation of creating posts of Deputy Chief Ministers, the BJP high command has done away with them. The party had appointed three Deputy Chief Ministers in the regime of then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. This had set hopes of creating three to four such posts his time too. However, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the party high command has decided against it. According to sources in the party, the proposal was shelved as too many senior leaders started throwing their hats into the ring. The party is learnt to have felt that intense lobbying would lead to groupism. Power centres Also, it appears that the high command did not want the Deputy Chief Ministers’ posts to become alternative power centres. The party specifically created these posts in the previous regime to nurture alternative leadership keeping in mind the imminent transition of power. Former Deputy Chief Ministers R. Ashok, C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Govind Karjol, and K.S. Eshwarappa had set their eyes on the post while emerging Valmiki community leader B. Sriramulu was also keen on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/too-many-contenders-led-to-removal-of-dy-cm-post/article35735480.ece

05 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Supporters of Nehru Olekar, Arvid Bellad stage protests||Amid celebrations by followers of BJP leaders who have been inducted into the new Cabinet, supporters of MLAs who missed out on berths took to the streets in Haveri, Hubballi and Dharwad on Wednesday and blocked roads for some time. While in Haveri supporters of three-time MLA Nehru Olekar blocked the Hosamani Siddappa Circle in protest against their leader being left out, supporters of two-time MLA Arvind Bellad blocked Jubilee Circle in Dharwad for some time. Staging a demonstration in Haveri, BJP leaders and followers of Nehru Olekar registered their protest by conducting Urulu Seve. They blocked the road and raised slogans against the party leaders for not considering Mr. Olekar. Several of them, including Shrikanth Pujar and Manjunath Itagi, participated in the Urulu Seve at the circle saying that their leader has been meted out injustice. They said that a backward community leader who has been elected thrice to the Assembly has been neglected during Cabinet formation. BJP leaders Babusab Momingar, Lalita Gundenahalli, Girish Tuppad, Ratna Bhimakkanavar, Jagadish Malagod and several others took part in the agitation. Shettar, Joshi blamed In Dharwad district, where the former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar has opted out of the Ministerial race, supporters of Mr. Arvind Bellad took to the streets in Dharwad and Hubballi to register their protest against their leader not being inducted in the new Cabinet. And, they blamed senior leaders of the district, including the former Chief Minister [Jagadish Shettar] and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi for non-inclusion. Mr. Arvind Bellad, a two-time MLA, was earlier projected by a section of the media as one among those in the race for the Chief Minister’s post and he has now failed to even make it to the Cabinet. However, in his place Shankar Patil Munenakoppa, who belongs to the same community as that of Mr. Bellad (Lingayat Panchamasali), has been made a Minister. This naturally irked Mr. Bellad’s supporters who blocked the road at Jubilee Circle in Dharwad on Wednesday and raised slogans condemning the party’s decision not to consider Mr. Bellad for a Ministerial berth. The protestors blamed senior leaders of the district for Mr. Bellad missing the bus. When the protestors tried to continue the road blockade for some more time, the police intervened to disperse the crowd. Some of them entered into an altercation with the police but subsequently senior police officials pacified them and cleared the road. A demonstration was held by Mr. Bellad’s supporters in Hubballi too. Some of the BJP workers led by BJP Raita Morcha president Mahadevappa Pujari and others held a press conference in Hubballi blaming Mr. Jagadish Shettar and Mr. Pralhad Joshi for Mr. Bellad not being made a Minister. They said that these leaders were directly responsible for Mr. Bellard not becoming a Minister. “Mr. Shettar and Mr Joshi are responsible for Mr. Bellad not getting a Ministerial berth. They are apprehensive that if Mr. Bellad becomes a Minister, then they would be sidelined. We condemn this and will soon block the national highway to register our protest. We will also protest in front of the residence of Mr. Shettar and Mr. Joshi,” he said. Subsequently, these BJP members, along with several others, staged a demonstration at the landmark Kittur Chennamma Circle for some time. They demanded that Mr. Bellad be made a Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/supporters-of-nehru-olekar-arvid-bellad-stage-protests/article35735730.ece

05 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Protest against postponement of odd semester exams||Post-graduate students on Mangalore University campus staged a protest in front of the administrative building on Wednesday against the university again postponing the odd semester examinations of the academic year 2020-21 scheduled to begin on Thursday on an instruction by Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada K.V. Rajendra. The students, led by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), said that it is not fair to have postponed the examinations citing as reason a rise in COVID-19 cases and fearing that it is being spread from Kerala. They demanded that the examinations should be conducted as scheduled. The students said that many students have arrived to join hostels on campus from far-off places. There is no clarity when the examinations will be rescheduled again. They are caught in a Catch 22 situation not able to return to their houses without clarity on the next date of examinations. Some students said that they hired taxis to reach Mangalagangotri campus to appear for the examinations by avoiding public transportation. Also, a few students from other States arrived in the city by air. But the Dakshina Kannada administration is least bothered in understanding their plight and the trauma which they were undergoing due to frequent postponement of examinations, online classes due to COVID-19 and lockdown this year. They said that undergraduate students too are facing similar trauma. Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya, who received a memorandum from the students, told them that the Registrar (Administration) and the Registrar (Evaluation) will meet the Deputy Commissioner late on Wednesday and explain to him the prevailing situation. The Deputy Commissioner will be persuaded to allow the university to hold the examinations. He said that the university, at the same time, will have to cooperate with the administration to curb the spread of COVID-19 infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-against-postponement-of-odd-semester-exams/article35735886.ece

He told the Academic Council in its meeting that the university was forced to postpone its odd semester undergraduate and post-graduate examinations of the academic year 2020-21 following an instruction from the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada. The post-graduate examinations were to commence on August 5, while the undergraduate examinations began on August 2. “If there is no respite from COVID-19 and the attending restrictions, the university will explore conducting examinations online as it has happened in some States. A Pune-based agency has developed the required software,” he said. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the university is also preparing to introduce digital evaluation system and bids have been invited for the project. He told the council that the university will introduce a common regulation to offer certificate and diploma courses in different disciplines. At present, there are independent regulations for each discipline and they are scattered. Stating that the university had obtained B grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) during the second assessment cycle, he said that the university challenged the “data verification validation” process before the council but to no avail. Now, as per the procedure, it will opt for re-accreditation next year.

Rajendra here on Wednesday. Chairing a virtual meeting with officials at the district, taluk and panchayats levels, Dr. Rajendra said: “The ward-level/ village-level task force has been given the discretionary power of allowing home isolation in exceptional circumstances,” he said. The members of ward-level and village level COVID-19 task force were asked to actively involve themselves in preventing spread of COVID-19. Apart from ensuring neighbourhood watch to ensure COVID-19 infected people do not roam around, the task force members were asked to make sure that family members of the infected persons get ration, milk and other essential items every day. They were also asked to keep track of vaccination in their areas and ensure that all get two doses of vaccine at the earliest. If there are more than two positive cases in a house, Dr. Rajendra said, such houses should be considered as micro containment zone and posters stating the same should be pasted outside the houses. If an infected person is found roaming around, action should be taken to register an FIR, he said. Reiterating the need of RT-PCR negative certificate for those entering Dakshina Kannada from Kerala, Dr. Rajendra said daily commuters from the border areas should undergo RT-PCR test once every week.

05 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Merger of Konkan, Indian Railways sought||Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Development Shobha Karandlaje on Monday urged Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnav to take immediate steps to merge Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL) with the Indian Railways. Ms. Karandlaje, representing Udupi-Chikkamagaluru Lok Sabha constituency, told the Minister that KRCL, formed as a joint venture of the Railways with Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala being stakeholders, has failed to fulfil the aspirations of coastal Karnataka. She said that when compared to other railway zones of Indian Railways, KRCL as a public sector undertaking, has completely failed to respond to the needs of the region. Hence, it should be merged with Indian Railways and brought under the control of South Western Railway (Karnataka-Goa) and Central Railway (Maharashtra). This has been a long-pending demand of the people of the region, she added. Ms. Karandlaje also reminded the Minister of her earlier letter seeking restoration of the tri-weekly day train between Karwar and Yeshwantpur that has been cancelled between Karwar and Mangaluru Junction by Konkan Railway. Rail patrons in the region say that KRCL, which did not start even one train for the people of Karnataka, was happy to cancel trains that were got introduced through legal battles. They gave the example of cancellation of Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar overnight express last year as a condition by KRCL to introduce a direct overnight train between Bengaluru and Karwar. The Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru overnight train, now named Panchaganga Express without touching Mangaluru, was introduced only after the existing overnight express was cancelled, they point out.  Though KRCL network in Karnataka expands to over 250 km, the corporation has not developed any minimum facilities for stabling (halting) of trains in any of the district headquarters. Even train watering facility is not available in Karwar affecting the introduction of services from coastal Karnataka, they say. Meanwhile, Dakshina Kannada MP and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, who met the Railway Minister on Monday, urged him to merge the Mangaluru Railway Region, now under Southern Railway, with the Mysuru Division of South Western Railway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/merger-of-konkan-indian-railways-sought/article35735470.ece

05 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mysuru region ignored again||Mysuru region, including Mysuru and adjoining districts of Chamarajanagar, Kodagu and Hassan, which did not have representation in the B.S. Yediyurappa Cabinet for the last two years, has not been represented in the newly sworn in Council of Ministers of Basavaraj Bommai’s government either. However, the inclusion of K.R. Pet MLA K.C. Narayana Gowda has ensured representation to Mandya district. The BJP had three MLAs in Mysuru district – S.A. Ramdas representing Krishnaraja Assembly segment, L .Nagendra representing Chamaraja, and Harshavardhan representing Nanjangud. While the party had one MLA – Niranjan Kumar representing Gundlupet – in Chamarajanagar district, it has two – K.G. Bopaiah representing Virajpet and Appachu Ranjan representing Madikeri. Mr Preetham Gowda is the lone MLA representing the saffron party in Hassan district. But, all the four districts have been neglected in the recent Ministry-making exercise. Though BJP leaders from the region said they were hoping for a berth this time, they admitted that the regional representation in the Ministry had to be overlooked for the sake of political exigencies such as accommodating the new entrants from other parties, who had helped form the BJP government two years ago. Mr. Ramdas, a former Minister, who was among the aspirants, said his followers have time and again complained about absence of representation to Mysuru district in the BJP government’s Cabinet. In the absence of any Minister from the district in the Yediyurappa government, the responsibility of Minister in charge of the district had been entrusted to Ministers from Bengaluru City. V. Somanna, representing Govindarajanagar constituency, was given the job first and was succeeded by S.T.

05 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Police unearth baby sale racket||The Mysuru district police have intensified their probe into a possible child trafficking racket after the Nanjangud police unearthed the sale of two babies to childless couples through a 60-year-old intermediary and her daughter during the last fortnight. Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Superintendent of Mysuru district police R. Chethan said the police rescued both the infants, produced them before the Mysuru District Child Welfare Committee, and sent them to a government-recognised child care and adoption centre. The police began the probe after an anganwadi worker Shashikala, who was visiting the house of Jyothi, a resident of Thyagaraja colony in Nanjangud, as part of her duty to provide nutritious food to pregnant women, found the baby missing and informed the jurisdictional assistant child development officer, who lodged a police complaint on July 17. During the investigation, the police learnt that Jyothi, who had lost her husband recently, had handed over new-born male baby to the main accused, Shrimathi, an intermediary, who had sold the infant to a childless couple in Holenarsipur for Rs. 4 lakh. When Ms. Shrimathi was interrogated, it came to light that another child born to Manjula, also a resident of Nanjangud, had been sold to a childless couple in Kollegal town. Ms. Shrimathi’s daughter Lakshmi had reportedly played a role in the sale of the child born to Manjula to the Kollegal couple. The police is yet to ascertain the amount involved in the sale of girl child. Though Mr. Chethan said both the new-born children had been sold due to the ‘poverty’ of the biological mothers, the amount of money paid to them by the intermediary is yet to be established. Ms. Shrimathi, who runs a play home for children in Nanjangud, and her daughter have been arrested for their role in the sale of the babies. Police said the accused used to identify pregnant women, who did not wish to raise their babies due to poverty, before contacting childless couples and strike deals with them. After the deals were struck, the intermediary would admit the pregnant women to a private hospital on Shivaji Road at N.R. Mohalla in Mysuru, where the names of the biological parents would be replaced with the childless parents. The police has booked a case against the hospital its role in facilitating falsification of documents. Nanjangud police inspector Lakshmikant Talwar said the investigation is continuing into the case to find out if more babies had been sold as part of the racket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-unearth-baby-sale-racket/article35735915.ece

Most of the children involved in the earlier racket had been born to unwed mothers at private maternity homes in Mysuru before they were sold to childless couples in different parts of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-warn-against-illegal-adoption/article35735914.ece
05 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||The menace of feeding wildlife continues in Bandipur||A television journalist from a national channel was penalized for feeding a deer while driving along the Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The incident took place recently but the photograph of the individual feeding a spotted deer crossing the road went viral on social media and came to light on Tuesday. The Forest Department personnel tracked down the taxi in which the individual was travelling and said that the person who was guilty of feeding the wild animal was a TV journalist with a national channel. A release issued on Wednesday said the department personnel imposed a fine on the individual and let him off with a stern warning. Feeding of wild animals by tourists and motorists traversing through national parks and wildlife sanctuaries has become a menace and is rampant in Bandipur. This is because the tiger reserve is bisected by two national highways – one cutting across the forest to connect to Wayanad in Kerala and another to Mudumalai and Ooty in Tamil Nadu. Given the popularity of Bandipur, Mudumalai, Ooty and Wayanad all of which are connected to Mysuru, the traffic is not only high, so are the incidents of people feeding herbivores. This was brazen in the old reception centre from where the safari used to commence. It was common to witness cliques of monkeys approaching tourists without fear and snatch a bite. But the safari point has now been shifted to Melkamanahalli and the cliques which were habituated to snacks from tourists can be found along the highway. Wildlife activists have cautioned time and again that such practices – of feeding wild animals - was fraught with danger for animals as they tend to loose their fear of human beings. In the process such animals become more susceptible to be trapped and poached. The animals can also venture into human landscape and could be trailed by carnivores and this could escalate human-animal conflict, according to the wildlife activists. This apart, if the animals become habituated to being fed by humans, their instinct to forage for fodder in the wild and survive through tough times could be lost over a period of time. In addition, tourists on the move tend to chomp on salty and deep fried delicacies which could be injurious to animals health, according to the activists who have cautioned against feeding wildlife.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/the-menace-of-feeding-wildlife-continues-in-bandipur/article35735732.ece

Ramdas, who was among the aspirants for a berth in the Basavaraj Bommai Council of Ministers, has expressed disappointment over his non-inclusion with a sarcastic tweet. Taking to the microblogging website, the four-time BJP MLA representing Krishnaraja Assembly constituency in Mysuru on Wednesday tweeted “Congrats to the new Ministers, who have built, developed the party and get qualified to the post. I hope and believe you strive in making Karnataka no. 1 state in the country. May Maa Chamundeshwari bless you all”. Mr Ramdas, who had served as Minister for Medical Education as well as Minister in charge of Mysuru district during an earlier tenure of B.S. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister, was apparently taking a dig at the inclusion of new entrants to the party into the Council of Ministers. Mr. Ramdas, however, did not hide the fact that he was among the aspirants for a berth. He also pointed out that he had been serving the party since 1992, including his two stints as the party’s State unit Yuva Morcha President. Mr. Ramdas said he would not be disillusioned, but would take it as a challenge to convert his constituency into a model constituency by taking up developmental works. Fielding queries from reporters, Mr. Ramdas said he did not believe in lobbying. But, he claimed that he had received congratulatory messages on the inclusion of his name among the probables. But, the scenario changed overnight, he regretted while recalling a similar experience during the earlier Ministry-making exercise taken up by Mr. Yediyurappa two years ago. Asked to comment on the reasons for his exclusion, Mr. Ramdas said he does not believe in “post-mortem”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ramdas-disappointed-makes-it-known-with-sarcastic-tweet/article35735912.ece
05 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Season tickets for train travel valid again||The Mysuru Division of South Western Railways has begun issuing season tickets for train commuters which was suspended following the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020. In the pre-pandemic times, nearly 7,000 season tickets used to be issued from Mysuru, facilitating daily commuters to travel from the city towards Bengaluru, Hassan-Arsikere and Chamarajanagar sections. Season ticket holders were eligible to travel on a daily basis upto a distance of 150 km in one direction and hence it came in handy for thousands of workers from Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. But once the trains went off track due to the pandemic and only select services began to be unrolled, the authorities had put the issuance of season ticket on hold. The railway authorities in Mysuru said that season ticket travel has become valid again with effect from August 3. Season ticket holders will be permitted to travel only by unreserved trains and unreserved coaches. There are at present six pairs of unreserved trains operating between Mysuru and Bengaluru. Chamundi Express, which was among the most patronised service by season ticket holders in the pre-pandemic period, continued to operate as a MEMU service and is a fully unreserved train. The Rajya Rani Express to has been converted into a MEMU service and hence the season ticket holders are eligible to travel in it. There are three pairs of unreserved trains on the Mysuru-Arsikere section and one pair of trains between Mysuru and Chamarajanagar. In the pre-pandemic times, 51 pairs of trains, including reserved and non-reserved, were operating from Mysuru. So far, the services of 30 pairs of trains have been restored. Suspension of train services has resulted in season ticket holders losing a number of days despite holding a valid season ticket issued prior to March 23, 2020. It has now been decided to extend the validity of such season ticket to the extent of days lost and will be enabled from August 9 onwards across UTS counters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/season-tickets-for-train-travel-valid-again/article35735913.ece

As per initial estimates, garlic in over 100 acres was damaged in the farms at Puthur, Perumala, and Keezhanthur at Kanthallur. The cool-season vegetable cultivating villages of Kanthallur and Vattavada are the only places in the State where garlic is commercially cultivated. Though small in size, garlic traditionally cultivated here is known for its quality and efforts are on to get the GI (geological indication) tag for it. Garlic cultivation is popular here as it fetches Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 a kg for farmers and ayurveda companies are the main buyers. It is estimated that nearly 75% of the farming area is now under garlic for the first cropping season in August/ September. Compared to other crops, the cost of cultivating garlic is high. Farmers say they had to pay thrice the normal price for seeds brought from Tamil Nadu during the lockdown period. Sundaram, a farmer, says his cultivation in Puthur was fully damaged after the farm got waterlogged. The crop has started to decay and is of no use as the plants have swayed. He says many farmers like him could not even sell their produce properly due to the pandemic situation last season. They have also purchased seeds at a higher price as there were restrictions on moving to Tamil Nadu for purchasing seeds. Sivadasan, another farmer, says he had sown seeds with great expectations as he did not cultivate garlic for the last two seasons. His cultivation in nearly 30 cents have gone waste with the crop getting damaged in the rain. An official of the Agriculture Department says many farmers at Kanthallur have turned to garlic cultivation as it is more profitable if the prices and weather conditions are favourable. Small farmers There are only small and medium farmers having a land area of 30 cents to 3 acres in both the villages. In addition to garlic, potato, beans, carrot, beetroot, and cabbage are also cultivated at Vattavada and Kanthallur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/garlic-farmers-bear-the-brunt-of-rain-wind-in-idukki-district/article35735845.ece

Sivankutty is among the accused. K. Balachandra Menon, deputy director of prosecution, Thiruvananthapuram, has written to the State government seeking clarification on the prosecutor who should appear in the case when the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Court, Thiruvananthapuram, considers the case on August 9. Besides Mr. Sivankutty, K.T. Jaleel, MLA, and four former legislators of the Left Democratic Front have been arraigned as accused in the case. The developments in the case attain significance as the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has been clamouring for the resignation of the Minister. Retirement S. Jailkumar, assistant public prosecutor, Thiruvananthapuram, has been assigned the responsibility of handling the case after S.S. Beena Satish, deputy director of prosecution, Thiruvananthapuram, who had appeared in the case earlier, was transferred to Alappuzha. Mr. Jailkumar retired from service on May 31. The clarification on who should appear in the case has been sought since the order for conducting the case is issued in the name of Mr. Jailkumar and he is no longer in service, legal sources said. The role of the prosecutor in the case has been mired in a controversy ever since Ms. Satish allegedly refused to toe the government line of withdrawing the prosecution against the legislators. Transferred Ms. Satish was transferred to Alappuzha after Mr. Sivankutty reportedly complained to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan that she colluded with the then Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala against the government in the case. It was also alleged that Ms. Satish had refused to put forward the arguments for withdrawing the prosecution in the case. Refuting the allegations, the former prosecutor said she had discharged her duties faithfully and had not colluded with anyone in the case. “Only those steps that were good in law were taken in the case. I refused to budge to some illegal external and unwarranted interference from certain quarters,” she said. Incidentally, Mr. Chennithala, who has impleaded in the case, has demanded the appointment of a special public prosecutor in the case.  V.

The State government, Greater Cochin Development Authority, and the Kochi Corporation have joined hands for setting up the project. Beneficiaries of the project were identified during the term of the previous council, said P.R. Renish, chairman of the Development Standing Committee of the Kochi Corporation. Families who had been residing at the colony for over 40 years are the beneficiaries of the scheme. The piling work for the housing project is in the final stages. Each dwelling unit will have a carpet area of nearly 600 sq.ft., he said. ‘Priority for project’ The rehabilitation of the families of the colony is one of the priority projects of the Kochi Corporation, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. The civic body has offered all possible support to the construction agency for competing the project in time. Monthly review of the project will also be done, he said. The project will require Rs. 16 crore for completion. The civic body has earmarked Rs. 12 crore for the project and hopes to raise the balance amount from the Corporate Social Responsibility funds of companies. The State government has also offered to mobilise funds through the CSR support scheme, he said. Efforts for raising CSR funds will be initiated during the final stages of the construction, as the funds thus raised will have to be utilised in one year, he said. The families of the colony, said Poornima Narayanan, who represented the area in the previous council of the Kochi Corporation, had to be rehabilitated during every monsoon season, as the area gets regularly inundated. Most of the houses also lacked proper toilet facilities. The women of the colony had staged a few protest meetings before the Kochi Corporation office during the term of the previous council demanding rehabilitation measures, she said. It was during the tenure of C.N. Mohanan as the chairman of the Authority that the rehabilitation project was mooted, Ms. Narayanan said.

The marginal increase of 20% sanctioned by the government this time may not be adequate, if there is an increase in the number of students shifting from the unaided sector to public schools in the new academic year. Previous trends showed that many students from the CBSE and other Central boards had switched to Plus One courses offered by the government and aided schools. The intake capacity for Plus One courses in government and aided schools in the district is 26,750 based on the ratio of 50 students in a batch. Around 32,100 students in Ernakulam had cleared the SSLC examination held in March this year, according to the data. There was a shortage of 320 seats based on the average calculation of enrolment in the last five years. It had stated that only 80.3% of the aspirants were seeking admission to Plus One courses in government and aided schools. The government had decided to go for a 20% marginal increase in each batch this academic year. The hike was made following the spurt in the number of students who became eligible for higher studies. The number of students across the State who had won A plus in all subjects had also witnessed a record this time (around 1.21 lakh). In Ernakulam, around 11,600 students had won A Plus in all subjects. The 20% marginal increase will result in an additional 5,350 seats in government and aided schools in the district. The department authorities have stated that the chances of a shortage in seats for Plus One in Ernakulam were remote. A clear picture will emerge after the first allotment of seats. Parents and students had expressed concerns on whether they would get a seat nearby their homes. The surge in the number of students who won A1 Plus in all subjects had triggered doubts among aspirants on whether they would get a course and school of their choice.

Eid Gul from Kabul was arrested from Bowbazaar in West Bengal on June 21 on the charge of visa violations after absconding from the city while working for a sub contractor engaged by Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL). The police had registered a case after CSL reported him on after turning suspicious of his identity. He was found to be using a fake identity document with an Assam address. He reportedly confessed to the police that his family had stayed in several parts of Pakistan when he was very young before moving to Afghanistan when he was a teenager. He cannot recollect the year of the stay, which was, according to his claim, mostly in and around Karachi. A probe is on to verify his account, said police sources. Gul had come to India on a three-month medical visa in June 2019 reportedly to escape his war-ravaged country. His father was of Afghan origin while his mother was reportedly of Assam origin. A police team is likely to be sent to Assam to find the contacts who helped him to secure the fake identity proof in the name of Abas Khan when his application to renew the visa was rejected. Though the court had granted his custody to the police for eight days, he spent four of those days in hospital on account of health issues before being returned to judicial custody. The police are also going through his contacts. The south police had booked him under Sections 14 (a) (whoever remains in any area in India for a period exceeding the period for which the visa was issued to him) and Section 14 (b) (whoever does any act in violation of the conditions of the valid visa issued to him for his entry and stay in India or any part thereunder) in connection with the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-into-afghan-residents-background/article35735791.ece

According to Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal, a portion of the Rs. 50 crore set aside in the State Budget for the protection of waterbodies can be used for this. “Compared to other backwaters, the presence of pollutants is less in Ashtamudi Lake. While ensuring the water flow, measures should be taken to maintain the piscean wealth,” he said at an online meeting convened by the Corporation on Wednesday. The authorities are planning to launch a comprehensive programme to protect the lake and removing the garbage and weeds will be a priority. “A popular movement should be formed for Ashtamudi,” said the Minister. Mayor Prasanna Earnest said a committee will be formed in consultation with the State government. “As part of preparing the action plan, a technical workshop will be held on August 10,” she said. Kollam MP, N.K.Premachandran sought a nodal agency for lake rejuvenation and he said that possible funds will be released for the same. “Projects tapping the tourism potential of the lake should be considered and the help of Non-Resident Indians can be sought for that,” said NoRKA-Roots chairman K.Varadarajan. State Human Rights Commission had decided to convene a high-level meeting to protect the lake following reports of rampant waste dumping. Commission member V.K. Beenakumari had visited the stretch of the lake near the Kollam KSRTC bus stand last week and instructed the authorities to clean the canal that routes plastic waste to the lake.

05 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Fishers doubtful over efficacy of Karunya marine ambulance||Fishermen and boat owners at the Beypore harbour have expressed strong concern over the efficacy of the newly launched Karunya marine ambulance for sea rescue operations. Those who recently took up the matter with the district administration and the Fisheries Department alleged that the multi-crore customised boat was of no use during rough weather, and that it could hardly withstand the strong rolling motions in the sea. Highlighting the limitations of sea ambulance in rescue operations, All Kerala Fishing Boat Owners and Operators Association called for the hiring of a well-equipped larger fishing boat for the purpose. According to them, the small marine ambulance with all its limitations and small size will never be a wise choice to depend on during crisis situations. Association leaders said bigger boats alone could effectively withstand rough waves and the rolling motion during unfair weather. A small boat like Karunya with a length of just 22.5 metres can never be used for rescue operations in the rough seas, which will even endanger the life of rescue operators, they argued. “During the trawling ban, the Fisheries Department and the district administration were reluctant to hire fishing boats for rescue operations citing availability of the ambulance. In effect, dependence on an ineffective rescue boat cripples rescue services,” said association vice president Karichal Preman. He added that those who were associated with rescue operations had encountered problems while using the boat. It was nearly six months ago that the Rs. 6-crore customised boat was brought from Kochi to Beypore. It was also claimed that the boat was designed to cover the entire Malabar coast. In addition, nursing staff were deployed on the boat on contract, besides equipping it with rescue accessories to attend to 10 persons at a time. Some fishermen from Beypore said the customised boat was used for coastal patrol recently and stressed the need to use it for productive purposes. According to them, two boats launched to cover the southern coast had a similar fate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-doubtful-over-efficacy-of-karunya-marine-ambulance/article35735775.ece

05 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||People’s panels to help convince fishers of housing scheme||With sea erosion on the rise and fisher families increasingly reluctant to relocate to safer areas, the Fisheries Department has decided to form new people’s committees, with the help of local bodies, under the Punargeham project to speed up its implementation. In the first phase, the committees will be formed for Beypore and Kadalundi coastal areas. Under the project, a family will be given Rs. 10 lakh in various stages to purchase three cents away from the coast and build a 600-sq ft house. Though it was launched years go, less than 25% of the eligible families have cooperated with its implementation. Most are not keen on accepting the package as such. The new committees will identify such families and prompt them to cooperate with the project. In Kozhikode district, 2,606 families have been identified. Of them, less than 600 have accepted the package. Many are of the view that the package does not meet their actual requirements. Most coastal families are big, and they are hesitant to shift to smaller houses. According to them, a sum of Rs. 10 lakh will not suffice to purchase land and build a house at the existing market rate. They have now sought a major revision in the package. Distance factor Another reason for the opposition is the possible distance of the new properties from the coastal area. Most fisher families want a living space closer to harbours and fish landing centres, as it reduces their travel time. Moreover, the affinity for coastal areas too is preventing them from accepting the offer. Meanwhile, Fisheries Department officials made it clear that fishermen’s families living close to vulnerable coastal areas will have to shift to safer places. Efforts are on to identify unused revenue land in urban areas for their rehabilitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/peoples-panels-to-help-convince-fishers-of-housing-scheme/article35735776.ece

Mayor Arya Rajendran said that amendments, if required, would be made in the financial statement, based on some discrepancies as pointed out by some of the Opposition councillors. The reports were placed in the council for discussion as per the demands raised by the Opposition councillors at a previous council meeting. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors Anilkumar and Karamana Ajith alleged that there were discrepancies in the number of vehicles owned by the Corporation, as per the administrative report and in replies to RTI queries. Some vehicles were indicated as missing in the administrative report. The councillors demanded that the Corporation file a complaint with the police and take action against the officials responsible, for failing in their duty. Works standing committee chairman D.R. Anil said that he had revealed the issue of the missing vehicles in a previous council meeting and hence the BJP councillors should desist from presenting it as their finding. Search panel Ms. Rajendran said that a search committee had been constituted to ascertain which vehicles were actually missing. Some of the vehicles had been found to be abandoned at various locations, as they were earlier used for decentralised waste collection, which was not happening any more. The possibility of reusing some of these vehicles would be looked into. A complaint would be filed with the police only for vehicles which had actually gone missing. Housing projects BJP councillor M.R. Gopan also questioned the figures regarding housing projects in the administrative report. He said that hardly any house had been completed under LIFE project in the Corporation. Welfare committee chairman S. Salim countered these allegations, saying that the state had increased funding for PMAY housing projects too, in line with the LIFE projects, and hence gave more funds to the beneficiaries for house construction than all other States. Tax liability In the discussion on the annual financial statement, BJP councillor P. Ashokkumar alleged that the report was ridden with errors. There was a large tax liability of Rs. 200 crore in the report. The details of the persons or the institutions which owed taxes had to be publicised, he said. The Deputy Mayor Rs. 55 crore was part of the outstanding tax amount which had been passed down over the years.

05 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||New channel of KITE Victers likely this month||As it celebrates 15 years, the KITE Victers (Versatile ICT-enabled resource for students) channel is taking another big leap during this COVID-19-induced crisis. Post a successful trial run, the second channel of Victers may go on air this month. A decade-and-a-half after it was inaugurated by the former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan on August 3, 2006, Victers is the mainstay of First Bell, the State government’s digital education programme for school students during the pandemic. It is estimated that Victers reaches out to nearly 50 lakh students. A challenge The pandemic, says Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) Chief Executive Officer Anvar Sadath K., could be one of the biggest challenges Victers faced. Firstly, because it was unexpected and secondly, as it entailed a lot of coordination in rolling out the digital content. Mr. Sadath, who has been in charge of KITE and Victers for a decade, says the culmination of two decades of efforts since the introduction of IT education in the State made it possible to rise up to the COVID-19 challenge. Victers, he points out, does not function in isolation. It is backed by digital infrastructure in schools and the teachers who provide the content. Together, all have made it possible to realise digital classes for students. The biggest challenge, however, was positioning Victers as a channel on the cable network after its launch. Receive only terminals (ROTs) were needed earlier to receive the channel. It was only in 2009 that it got a slot on Asianet, a breakthrough of sorts. Other important events in the Victers’ journey were live telecast of State School Art Festivals in Kollam and the State capital in 2008 and 2009, he says. A milestone was bagging the top slot in TAM ratings, courtesy the Haritha Vidyalayam educational reality show, Mr. Sadath says. 24 classes now Today, KITE telecasts 24 classes in 12 hours — from 7.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. The second Victers channel, a demand of the COVID-19 times, will allow telecast of more classes during the day and cater to more groups of students, he says. The pandemic also helped to make the channel very visible, especially as it is available on direct-to-home services, besides the cable network, says Mr. Sadath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/victers-second-channel-likely-this-month/article35735773.ece

Sakeer said here on Wednesday that appointments had been made from all rank lists as per vacancies. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Sakeer said the PSC had followed Article 13 of the PSC Rules of Procedure 1976 regarding extension of 493 rank lists. “The maximum time period for a PSC rank list is three years. The rules do not allow selective extension for any specific list. Such extension would rob the opportunities for lakhs of aspirants who are aiming for the vacancies that are arising after the expiry of the existing lists. The PSC approached the High Court regarding the Kerala Administrative Tribunal order to extend a rank list, as it goes against existing PSC rules. It was not a confrontation with the rank holders. The High Court also approved this,” said Mr. Sakeer. Comparative figures Presenting comparative figures of appointments over the past decade, he said that 10,434 advice memos were issued out of 35,361 jobseekers on the current Lower Division Clerk Rank list (29.28%), while 11,452 out of 46,687 (23.52%) were appointed from the 2015 rank list and 11,830 out of 56,807 (20.82%) on the 2012 list. An additional 1,401 vacancies have also been reported now from the current list, which would take the percentage even higher. He said the protesting job aspirants themselves should be aware of the rules as they will have to work within these in the future. The High Courts and the Supreme Court have in the past observed that not everyone who is included on a rank list will get appointment, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/30000-postings-during-pandemic-psc-chairman/article35735806.ece

Stringent lockdown measures will be imposed in wards with a WIPR of more than 10. As part of enforcing the new regulations in the district, inspections will be intensified in shops, Ms. Khosa said.

As part of the initiative, clear guidelines had been formulated for the certification of hospitals. Apart from the 10-point quality indicators of the UNICEF and WHO, a quality standard certification with 130 check points had been drawn up by the State for certifying hospitals as mother and baby-friendly, Ms. George here on Wednesday. She was inaugurating virtually the national breastfeeding week observance and the mother and baby-friendly hospital initiative of the Health Department. Lags in breastfeeding Despite the achievements of the State in reducing maternal mortality and infant and neonatal mortality, the State still lagged when it came to the early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the baby, which were very crucial indicators that impacted child health. In a literate society like Kerala, families and society as a whole had a huge role in encouraging and promoting breastfeeding for the health of future generations, Ms. George said. Apart from creating mass awareness initiatives, facilities with adequate privacy would be created in public spaces with the help of other departments for promoting breastfeeding, she added. Senior health officials, representatives of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, the National Neonatology Forum and the UNICEF were present at the online function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hospitals-in-state-to-be-made-mother-and-baby-friendly/article35735781.ece

As per the Vidyakiranam portal launched by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in connection with the Vidyakiranam scheme to bridge the digital divide and make available devices to students, the maximum requirement of laptops is in Palakkad district – 1,13,486 in 1,121 schools. Malappuram follows with 91,887 laptops required in 1,625 institutions. Mr. Vijayan said parent-teacher associations in each school had determined the number of students who did not have digital devices such as laptops or tablets in their institution. They had also reached out to the people at the local level such as alumni or volunteers who were willing to help students. The government had contacted industry organisations and non-resident Malayalis too to help bridge the digital divide. The Chief Minister said the government would set up the Chief Minister’s Education Empowerment Fund on the lines of the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund to meet the educational requirements of students. The Vidyakiranam scheme portal would enable individuals, groups, or organisations to understand the requirements and place orders for laptops to students or schools or contribute an amount in case the contributor did not want to specify the name of the beneficiary school or number of laptops. Payment options were also available on the website as also the laptop models for which orders could be placed. Vidyakiranam would be implemented through the local bodies. Contributions General Education Principal Secretary A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish told The Hindu that though the government was expecting a requirement of 7 lakh to 8 lakh laptops, the final figure came to nearly 4.72 lakh. After the tallying was done, the government waited for 10 days to finalise the figures. After the Chief Minister’s intervention, people voluntarily contributed via various sources in the months of June and July, leading to a drop in the requirement of laptops, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nearly-472-lakh-students-require-laptops/article35735804.ece

05 August 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police academy to ink pact with France||The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA), the country’s premier police training school, is all set to enter into an agreement with the French government for the exchange of cadets for imparting training. This cutting-edge foreign attachment would further sharpen the skills of IPS probationers to tackle new-age challenges back home. Cybercrime, terrorism, urban policing are some of the evolving areas of concern so far as policing is concerned. Speaking to The Hindu , SVPNPA Director Atul Karwal said Ambassador of France to India Emmanuel Lenain, along with some senior police officers of his country, had visited the SVPNPA a few months ago to explore the possibilities of exchange of IPS probationers from India and French senior police officers for advanced training here. “We have to wait and see where it takes,” Mr. Karwal said. For the past few years, the academy has been sending its probationers for foreign training in Israel. However, due to international restrictions amid the pandemic, the foreign attachment programme has been called off. Going forward, the SVPNPA will also be looking at training collaborations with Russia and Sri Lanka. Two years ago, the institute added Mauritius to its list and had been training police officers from there, apart from officers from Nepal (since 1954) Bhutan (since 1965) and Maldives (since 1998). Further, the Director said the academy reoriented its training modules to suit the contemporary policing challenges as each problem required distinctly different methods to control the situation on the ground — be it Kashmir insurgency, northeastern States’ peculiar problems, Left Wing Extremism and organised urban criminal policing. “Apart from various other modules, we have introduced a riot control module, creating a practical situation of stone pelting and to see how our trainee officers would tackle the situation. We rope in our staff and people from neighbouring areas to first throw tennis balls, followed by stones and other objects on the officers for real-time experience,” Mr. Karwal said, adding that such tactical exercises would enhance their skills. Foreign roots Mr. Karwal said the academy had become a centre of excellence in the entire sub-continent as senior police personnel from Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Mauritius had been trained here. “They find their roots in Hyderabad, which in turn helped IPS officials [whom they are trained with] to have seamless coordination with their counterparts in the neighbouring countries.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-academy-to-ink-pact-with-france/article35735384.ece

05 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Maiden indigenous aircraft carrier begins trials||The much-awaited sea trials of the country’s maiden indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-1), built by the public sector Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL), began here on Wednesday. The 40,000-tonne behemoth, whose keel-laying was done in 2009, is expected to join the Navy as INS Vikrant late next year. Its induction will give a fillip to the ‘sea control’ capabilities of the Navy in the Indian Ocean Region, a theatre of growing geostrategic competition. While the Navy now operates one aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, it has been trying to impress upon the government for a second IAC (IAC-2) as its perspective plan envisages three carrier battle groups so that two can remain serviceable on either flank at any given time. At sea, the IAC-1 will have its propulsion plants put to rigorous testing in addition to the trials of various navigation, communication and hull equipment. Once the equipment calibration is done, the successive stages in the year-long trials will witness flight trials followed by weapon trials. “It is a red-letter day for Indian shipbuilding industry. Significant capabilities have been developed by the CSL in areas of ship design, construction and network integration,” said Madhu S. Nair, CSL chairman and managing director, on the commencement of the sea trials. The carrier construction project was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security in 2002 and the contract for the first phase of construction was signed with the CSL in 2007. While the basic design of the IAC-1 was done by the Directorate of Naval Design, the detailed engineering, construction and system integration were done by the CSL. The project cost nearly Rs. 20,000 crore. Italian firm Fincantieri helped in designing and system integration and Russia in developing the aviation complex. But the project gave a boost to indigenisation, starting from the development of warship-grade steel for the ship’s hull construction to the development of a large ancillary industry ecosystem. Room for 30 aircraft The IAC is equipped with numerous high-end technologies, including network-centric distributed data processing and control systems, and state-of-the-art weapons such as the Barak LR-SAM (long-range surface to air missile) and sensors. It can carry about 30 assorted aircraft, including fighter jets and helicopters, is capable of a top speed of 28 knots and a cruising speed of 18 knots with an endurance of 7,500 nautical miles. The ship, which is 262 m long, has over 2,300 compartments and is designed to have a complement of about 1,700 people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/maiden-indigenous-aircraft-carrier-begins-trials/article35735388.ece
05 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala HC expands rape definition||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday held that the definition of rape contained in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code will take in sexual assaults, including the sexual acts committed between thighs of the victim. The Bench led by Justice K. Vinod Chandran, while dealing with an appeal in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( POCSO) case, observed that “Section 375 takes in sexual assaults beyond penile penetration into vagina, urethra, anus, and mouth, the known orifices in the human body to which such penetration was imaginably possible”. The court further observed that “any part of the body of such woman, as mentioned in Section 375(c) of the Indian Penal Code, brings within its ambit a penile sexual act committed between the thighs held together, which do not qualify to be called an orifice”. The court added that the definition of rape covered “any manipulation of the body of a woman in such a manner as to simulate an effect, providing sexual gratification, akin to penile penetration”. The court said when penetration was thus made in between the thighs held together, it would certainly amount to “rape” as defined under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-hc-expands-rape-definition/article35735386.ece

05 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Issue of art trafficking back in the spotlight||The decision of the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to return 14 works of art to India has brought the key issue of trafficking of cultural properties back in the spotlight. “Our cultural wealth is scattered around the world even as we mark the 50th anniversary of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, an international treaty that aims at preventing theft of cultural property,” says Professor Amareswar Galla, an India-born Australian citizen and UNESCO Chair in the Asia Pacific on Museums. “The onus of conducting due diligence before acquiring cultural property lies on the institution acquiring the material,” he insists, adding that even the Code of Ethics of the International Council of Museums calls on cultural institutions to follow the rulebook. However, museums face the challenge of antique dealers producing fake certificates of ownership and vouch for their authenticity. “Several western cultural institutions have fallen in the ‘trap’ and a few have deliberately colluded to acquire the material,” he says. On the NGA acquiring the illicitly-trafficked objects from notorious dealer Subhash Kapoor, Prof. Galla says quality research would have precluded the museum from acquiring the material for what was then the Indian Gallery in Canberra, where the objects were initially showcased. Prof. Galla attributes the NGA move to investigations by journalists like Michaela Boland and national embarrassment caused by both the Commonwealth and the State governments that led to the Australian Minister for Culture to mandate provenance research and a critical look at the acquisition of objects by the cultural institutions in the last five years. “Objects returned to India in the last three years are a result of government intervention,” he says. Indian art has been the target of the illicit market for almost a century and conservative estimates put the scale of the loot to more than Rs. 100 million a year. Gangs go on recces scouting for sellable art and systematically loot them and smuggle them out of the country via sophisticated supply chains involving art storage, movers, art experts and restorers. “India is yet to receive the bulk of the promised 200 artefacts from the United States (part of the Subhash Kapoor seizures and promised to the Prime Minister in June, 2016). Hundreds of antiquities from just that seizure await India’s claim,” says S. Vijay Kumar, co-founder of the India Pride Project (IPP) and author of The Idol Thief . IPP is a global effort to track and reinstate the country’s stolen heritage and currently, it is working on over 46 cases of major idol thefts from across the country, tracked to various museums and auction houses. Mr. Kumar says Australia has agreed to return the idols because of the existence of documented and archival photographs and publications in the sites of Tamil Nadu. “There are other museums and auction houses in America, Singapore, United Kingdom and EU who are reluctant to follow in Australia's footsteps,” he says. A.P. treasures Mr. Kumar says in Andhra Pradesh, there is no attempt to investigate the spate of thefts (three thefts) from the Buddhist site of Chandavaram in the early 2000s. “We have matched many objects from the same site to museums in the United States, Singapore and UAE,” he says. Though there are FIRs for these objects, the Andhra Pradesh custodians made no attempt to link the case to Kapoor, nor have they followed up on seeking their return, he says. “Security of these valuable collections and archaeological sites should be a priority,” insists Prof Galla, adding that sufficient staff and digitised documentation will help a great deal. “A digital document helps to generate an ‘Object ID’ as soon as something is stolen. It should immediately be shared with the Ministry of Culture, Interpol and the World Customs Organisation in Tokyo,” he recommends insisting that information about stolen objects needs to travel faster than the object. The current pandemic times with reduced vigilance and staff, he says, creates an ideal landscape for antique dealers to unleash loot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/issue-of-art-trafficking-back-in-the-spotlight/article35736042.ece

05 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||NRTS not to comment on ICON project||The Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu Society (APNRTS) has stated that the State government has given its consent to continue the NRT ICON project without any changes in its priorities. The society said in a press release that the APNRTS always acted responsibly towards protecting the interests of the investors and had shown interest to continue with the execution of the NRT ICON project. It had been communicated with the investors between June 2019 and November 2019 explaining to them the progress of the NRT ICON project as on date like obtaining the approvals, pre-grounding works, etc. Initially, allottees were willing to continue with the project after the government’s nod. But, in due course of time, more than 85% of the investors/allottees themselves decided to withdraw from the project. They showed their unwillingness to continue with the project despite the APNRTS and the government’s willingness to continue with the NRT ICON Project as proposed, the press release said. A couple of allottees had approached the High Court to refund the deposited amount fully along with interest and penalties despite knowing that good part of it was spent on the project itself (Land Purchase, Permissions from different government departments, hiring consultants and architects, inauguration etc.) during March and April 2019 with presumptuous false allegations on the APNRTS. “As the matter is currently with the court, APNRTS would not like to comment any further in this matter,” the society said in press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nrts-not-to-comment-on-icon-project/article35735425.ece

Mr. Veerraju said that the DPR of Kovvur-Bhadrachalam line had already been completed, but the lines were yet to be sanctioned and that this new line would reduce the distance to key junctions and be a crucial link in the Bharatmala project. It would create economic and development opportunities for the Scheduled Tribes in the region. Visatdome coaches As far as the train to Araku is concerned, Mr. Veerraju said the train that goes via Kirandul was not serving the needs of tourists and that two Vistadome coaches were sanctioned, but yet to be provided. Referring to the special trains from Visakhapatnam to Varanasi, Mr. Veerraju said the trains were sanctioned in 2015, but have been pending since then owing to the lack of rakes. He mentioned that the establishment of the South Coastal Railway Zone with Visakhapatnam as its headquarters was a welcome initiative that would cherish the dream of the people of Andhra Pradesh. He expressed confidence that the new zone would yield a lot of economic benefits to people in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veerraju-urges-railway-minister-to-sanction-projects-to-state/article35735950.ece
05 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three officials suspended over leak of sensitive information||The State government has placed three officials of the Finance Department under suspension for leaking ‘sensitive and confidential’ information to the media. Assistant Secretary Nagulapati Venkateswarlu, and Section Officers Kasireddy Vara Prasad and D. Sreenu Babu have been suspended based on a report submitted by Director General of Vigilance and Enforcement K.V. Rajendranath Reddy. They have been directed not to leave the headquarters without permission from the government. Principal Secretary (Finance) Shamsher Singh Rawat issued three GOs in this regard on Wednesday. The GOs, said the government had ordered a vigilance inquiry in the light of series of reports against it in the media, leading to the suspicion regarding the leakage of ‘sensitive and confidential’ information, which were ‘twisted to malign the government and cause undue panic among the public.’ Mr. Vara Prasad’s role in leaking a ‘confidential report’ under circulation in the e-office prior to the approval by the competent officers has been indicated. The information regarding government guarantees was allegedly leaked to the media by Mr. Vara Prasad. “Despite being aware of the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information, Mr. Vara Prasad caused unauthorised transmission of information, which primarily gives the suspicion of a deliberate leakage,” said Mr. Rawat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-officials-suspended-over-leak-of-sensitive-information/article35735956.ece

Jayasurya on Wednesday pulled up the State government for not clearing the bills amounting to Rs. 1,794 crore under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) for the 2019-20 financial year. Taking strong exception to the government’s claim that Rs. 413 crore had been paid against the total outstanding of Rs. 1,794 crore, the bench said that it would brook no further delay in clearing the dues. Principal Secretary (Panchayat Raj and Rural Development) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi and Commissioner M. Girija Shankar, who were present during the hearing, informed the High Court that the balance would be paid in four weeks, even as the petitioner’s counsel argued that only Rs. 40 crore had been remitted during the year and that the government still owed about Rs. 2,500 crore. Vigilance inquiry The bench agreed to it, but directed the government to furnish full details of the payments made village-wise in the form of an affidavit on August 18, to which date the case has been posted. Chief Justice Goswami and Justice Jayasurya questioned Mr. Dwivedi about the outcome of the vigilance inquiry into the circumstances that led to the inordinate delay in making the payments and the persons responsible for it and ordered him to submit the information. The bench expressed dissatisfaction at the absence of a top official of the Finance Department who was supposed to give an explanation, and ordered that he should appear in person during the next hearing on August 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-tells-govt-to-clear-pending-nregs-bills/article35735948.ece

According to statistics made available by the Health Department, from July 1 to July 30, 3,587 cases were reported in the district. Of these, 1,427 cases were people below 30 years of age. This includes 1,034 cases in the age group of 18 to 30 years. In the same month, 835 persons in the age group of 31 to 40 and 583 persons between 41 to 50 years of age were also infected. Similarly, 742 persons above 51 years of age had tested positive in July. “Those in the age group of 18 to 30 were mainly affected by the virus as most of them are yet to be vaccinated and many not adhering to COVID safety norms. The same was seen for people in the age group of 31 to 40. It is very important for them to adhere to COVID-19 precautions,” said a senior official from the Health Department. 10% cases are children As many as 393 children, comprising 10% of the total cases in July, who had tested positive were found to be below 18 years of age. This includes 137 children below 10 years and 256 children between 11 and 18 years. However, officials said that there is no need for panic and almost all cases were asymptomatic. There is no concrete evidence confirming that children will be most affected in the third wave. However, the children need to be given proper care. In the meantime, the district administration is strengthening paediatric care keeping in view the possible third wave, they said. District Medical & Health Officer (DMHO) P. Surya Narayana said that exclusive paediatric wards are being set up at the Family Welfare Ward of the Government Hospital for Mental Care (GHMC), King George Hospital (KGH), and Gosha Hospital. “Apart from them, paediatric facilities like special newborn care units and newborn stabilisation units will be strengthened and used as paediatric care units,” he added. The DMHO said that around 75% of people above 45 years of age have received at least one dose of vaccine in the district. “People who were not vaccinated are mainly testing positive. So, people should come forward for vaccination,” he said. 77 new cases The district has reported 77 COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours ending Wednesday morning, taking the cumulative tally to 1,53,325. The death toll has also increased to 1,055 after one more person succumbed to the virus.

The number of recoveries increased to 1,50,711, which is about 98.2%.

05 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||MLA, corporator face off over eviction of vendors||Ward 39 corporator Sadiq Mohammed and Visakhapatnam (South) MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar are at loggerheads over the eviction of 16 vendors in Old Town area of the city. The vendors in the Old Town area were evicted by GVMC, around 10 days ago. While the MLA claims that the vendors, who have been running makeshift shops in the vicinity of MVDM High School for the last four decades, were evicted without prior notice or a rehabilitation plan, the corporator says the action was carried out in accordance with GVMC procedures. The interesting aspect to this clash between the corporator and the MLA is that both of them owe allegiance to the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). While Mr. Mohammed is a party loyalist, Mr. Ganesh Kumar who was with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) switched his loyalties to the YSRCP last year. Mr. Sadiq said that the MCDM High School was renovated at a cost of Rs. 55 lakh under the State government’s ‘Nadu Nedu’ scheme, and the makeshift shops beside the school were proving to be a menace to the students, teachers and parents. “Some of the shops were selling tobacco products and contraband like drugs and ganja. Anti-social elements were smoking in front of the school and there were incidents of eve-teasing. Even teachers were not spared and some time back, a few drunk youth barged into the principal’s cabin and threatened her,” Mr. Sadiq alleged. Countering the allegations, the MLA said that there were no such incidents and if that was the case, why did the police not intervene. According to Mr. Sadiq, the police were informed and 13 cases were booked and are pending in the One Town Police Station, including a couple of ganja peddling cases. Mr. Sadiq also said that the rehabilitation of the vendors has been taken care of and an alternative location has been identified for rehabilitating them. “I have even promised to give each of the vendors Rs. 10,000 from my funds, to enable them to build their shops and resume their livelihood,” he said. The corporator pointed out that the decision to evict them was not taken overnight. “It was taken up after a detailed deliberation in the council.

05 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tribals fear revival of mining in Kalyanapulova||Tribals living in the Kalyanapulova reservoir area in Ravikamatam mandal are a worried lot, as they fear that the mining activity that was stopped a few months ago after a sustained fight, might revive once again. After visiting the area on Wednesday, P.S. Ajay Kumar, general secretary of AIARLA (All India Agricultural Rural Labour Association), said that a new road was being laid and he alleged that it was being done by the mining companies to facilitate their mining activity without obtaining the necessary permissions from authorities concerned. For the past few years, the tribals have been campaigning for the revocation of mining permits in the Kalyanapulova reservoir catchment area, which irrigates about 5,000 acres. About 20,000 farm workers from ten major panchayats in the Ravikamatam zone depend on the reservoir for farming. “Road construction on agricultural land requires the RDO’s approval and we have brought this to the notice of the authorities. A new Revenue Survey No. 84 has been created in the reserve Fforest illegally, to facilitate mining,” Mr. Ajay Kumar alleged. Mr. Ajay Kumar also alleged that all these activities have resumed after the officers, including the earlier ITDA project officer, who had taken up the issue seriously, were transferred. The tribals who accompanied Mr. Ajay Kumar, pointed out that the mining site is bordering the reservoir catchment area. If mining begins here, the streams from the hills into the reservoir will be blocked and the cashew plantations of tribals will be damaged, they said. For every 100 tonnes of stone mined by the mining companies, about 80 tonnes of waste is generated, which is pushed into the reservoir, the tribals pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tribals-fear-revival-of-mining-in-kalyanapulova/article35736041.ece

Dr. T. Padmavathi, president of OGS, Visakhapatnam, said that breast milk constitutes a primordial form of health and development in infants. Breastfeeding establishes itself as the ideal food for infants during the first six months, she said. Dr. D. Hemalatha, Medical Superintendent of the hospital, said that the first hour of skin-to-skin contact while breastfeeding regulates a newborn’s body temperature and exposes them to good bacteria from the mother’s skin. These bacteria protect babies from infectious diseases and help in building their immune system, she said. Dr. Leela Digumarti, Public Awareness Committee in-charge of OGS, Visakhapatnam, said that breastfeeding was highly recommended even during the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/breast-milk-is-best-for-newborns-say-doctors/article35736057.ece

05 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sewer deaths throw light on violations||Tuesday night’s accident in which two labourers died after getting into the sewerage lines of GHMC takes the lid off the saga of negligence by contractors and government officials towards human lives. The tragic incident ironically comes on the heels of Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s recent assertion that manual labour in sewage cleaning is a thing of the past in Hyderabad. While GHMC desperately attempts to shift the blame, violation of rules at several levels is apparent to a discerning eye. GHMC issued a statement on Wednesday morning, when the deaths came to light, washing its hands off the responsibility and claiming that the lines were of storm water carriage and not sewerage. However, eye witnesses confirm that they were sewerage lines. In the note, the corporation blamed the contractor who had been awarded the works for de-silting of storm water drains in the area with an estimated cost of Rs. 12.7 lakh. The contractor had to carry out the works at Saheb Nagar, Vaddera Basthi, Hariharapuram, Balaji Nagar and SKD Nagar. On Tuesday night, as part of the de-silting works using ‘Bucket Cleaning Machines’, one labourer Shiva entered the 10-feet deep manhole to down a rope into it. When he failed to return, the second labourer Anthaiah too, went in and disappeared, officials informed. A look into the lapses galore reveals that the de-silting of storm water drains inside the colonies should have been completed by May 31, before the onset of monsoons. The civic body does not officially permit its contractors to carry out de-silting works in the night, as it could prove risky. Officials deny any knowledge of the works on Tuesday night, but wife of one of the deceased labourers vouches that her husband received a call from the GHMC officials, who summoned him to work on the fateful night. “I kept calling him till 11 p.m. urging him not to get into the manhole. He kept assuring me that he won’t,” she told media persons, alleging that officials forced them to enter the death trap. Meanwhile, sources informed that the contractor was in a hurry to finish the works as the sewage maintenance was set to be handed over to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board starting from August 31. Orders were issued recently for transfer of the sewage operations and maintenance in the peripheral circles to the HMWS&SB. Be it sewage or storm water, there are standing instructions against labourers entering the manhole chambers to clean up the lines. Even when they are deployed, providing proper safety gear along with oxygen cylinders is mandatory — a rule which is more observed in violation than adherence. Hue and cry is raised occasionally when deaths occur, but largely, officials condone blatant violation of this rule. On the ground, no sewerage worker is seen wearing safety gear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sewer-deaths-throw-light-on-breach/article35735746.ece

Srinivas Goud at Hyderabad Airport on Wednesday. “I am honoured to be welcomed in this manner. I assure you that I will continue to work harder and win many more laurels,” Ms. Sindhu said. “It is always a great feeling to be back in my home town where the warmth and affection is something unique. Yes, looking forward to meeting some of my friends and relatives whom I have missed in the last few weeks because of training and also sharing my moment of joy with them,” she said. “My special and sincere thanks to the State government, especially to Srinivas Goud sir and Srinivas Raju sir (SATS VC & MD) for immediately accepting my request to train at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium since February for the Olympics,” she said. “We are all proud of Sindhu’s achievement and wish her many more successes at the highest level. Winning two Olympic medals is not an ordinary feat,” the Sports Minister said. "She brought name and fame to Telugu-speaking States with her achievements. We were also hoping for the gold. Anyhow, I am 100% sure she will win the gold in the next Olympics," the Minister said. And back home, the parents preferred to stay away from the media limelight and let Team Suchitra and coach Park Tae-Sang share the moment of joy. Suchitra’s Praveen Raju said they are honoured to be involved in Sindhu’s journey to Tokyo Olympics. “We understand the workload she requires and the never-complaining girl is always humble. A perfect role model and a champion athlete,” he said. Pradeep Raju, head coach at Suchitra, said they are glad to realise the dream of Sindhu winning multiple medals in Olympics. “The entire journey reminds that every minute counts when you aim to scale the pinnacle and I must say she is lucky to have Park as coach whose analysis of her game is just amazing,” he said. Sindhu signed off the evening also thanking the Union Sports Ministry, Badminton Association of India, all the support staff and Baseline Ventures’ Yashwanth for helping her to win another Olympic medal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sindhu-gets-rousing-reception/article35735739.ece
05 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Make State govt. implement SFC report’||The Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has appealed to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to direct Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar to take action on the recommendations of the Telangana State Finance Commission (TSFC) and release sufficient funds to the civic bodies, especially to the cash-strapped Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). In a communication to the Governor, a copy of which was released to the media, FGG secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy charged that the TSFC had submitted its report and the recommendations to her and in turn to the government, but no action has been taken. It has not even been placed in the State Legislature which is a violation of Article 243-1 of the Constitution, he said. TSFC’s role is to review the financial position of gram panchayats (GPs) and urban local bodies (ULBs) to make recommendations to the Governor for distribution of the net proceeds of the taxes from the State. In fact, the government did not bother to appoint the chairman or other members till the FGG approached the High Court, he said. The report was submitted in October 2020 and this was sent to the government. Among the recommendations were to transfer 11% of net State’s own revenue to local bodies; new GPs, mandal praja parishads and zilla parishads to be given special grants for their infrastructure development, division of the pooled resources among GPs and ULBs to be in the ration 60:40 respectively. Distribution of funds to be on the basis of population as per 2011 census; transfer of funds to begin from April to December in 10 equal instalments, recarpeting of metal roads, accountability in spending public funds, annual audit and annual maintenance of public roads were the other recommendations. Mr. Reddy said the State governmenthas an annual budget of Rs. 1.76 lakh crore for 2021-22 - which means Rs. 20,000 crore has to be released to GPs and ULBs. The Centre has been giving Rs. 1,365 crore per annum to GPs and equal amount from State government, which means monthly Rs. 114 crore is being accrued to GPs though the latter claimed to be releasing upto Rs. 300 crore. In this context, the GHMC with 30% population and generating 70% of revenue is starved of funds with no money to pay salaries or pending bills. In the last six years it was able to spend Rs. 2,882.11 crore - Rs. 4,317 crore while budgets have been approved for Rs. 5,550 crore – Rs. 6,150 crore but the substantial funding from the government has been lacking for infrastructure development, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/make-state-government-implement-sfc-report/article35735737.ece

He said that Ranjeeta Sharma (borne on Rajasthan cadre) and Shreya Gupta (borne on Tamil Nadu cadre) topped the 2019 batch of IPS officers. Ms. Sharma is also the first woman in IPS history of NPA to win the IPS association’s Sword of Honour for Best Outdoor Probationer. Reiterating the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on changing the negative image of police in the country, which he shared with the probationers during a virtual interaction last week, Mr. Karwal said that change of image is a continuous process, and has been extensively discussed during the training, both indoor and outdoor. The academy had also launched ‘Training Needs Analysis’ to monitor the attitude and behaviour of IPS officers after they pass out from the police training school. French connection SVPNPA is all set to enter into an agreement with the French government for the exchange of cadets for imparting training. This cutting-edge foreign attachment would further sharpen the skills of IPS probationers to tackle new-age challenges back home. Cybercrime, terrorism, urban policing are some of the evolving areas of concern so far as policing is concerned. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Karwal said that Ambassador of France to India Emmanuel Lenain, along with some senior police officers of his country, had visited the NPA a few months ago to explore the possibilities of exchange of IPS probationers from India and French senior police officers for advanced training here. “We have to wait and see where it takes,” Mr Karwal said. NPA will also be looking at training collaborations with Russia and Sri Lanka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/16-ips-probationers-women/article35735748.ece
05 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC directs Collectors to identify govt. lands||Telangana High Court on Wednesday instructed the Collectors of all 33 districts in the State to identify government lands in their respective jurisdictions. The Collectors should pass on the details of such parcels of government lands to the Sub-Registrars concerned. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy ordered that the Sub-Registrars should not execute sale deeds relating to any of such government lands by third parties. PIL petition The bench issued directions while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition over alleged encroachment of Waqf lands admeasuring nearly 130 acres in Patancheru village of Sangareddy district on Hyderabad outskirts. Three social activists filed the plea alleging that some private persons were illegally occupying the land and sought protection of the lands. When the matter came up for hearing, the Chief Justice observed that “this court is frequently noticing that several parcels of government lands in different districts of the State are being illegally encroached upon”. The Chief Justice also noted that “fraudulent sale deeds are being executed and registered in favour of third parties while the government was not taking adequate steps to protect such land parcels”. The bench said that in such a backdrop it decided to expand the scope of the PIL petition and pass specific directions to the authorities. The bench instructed the Collectors to commence survey of government lands in their respective districts in a time-bound manner. Details of government lands must be collated and maintained in a register. The register should also contain details of the geo-survey of the areas. On steps taken Details of all such government lands should be communicated to the Sub-Registrars concerned. They should not execute sale deeds related to these properties by third parties, the bench made it clear. The bench ordered that, by next date of hearing, each District Collector should file separate affidavits explaining steps taken to conduct survey, protect government lands. The CJ Hima Kohli made it clear that the exercise of identifying government lands should commence immediately. The bench instructed AG B.S. Prasad to circulate its direction to the District Collectors and secure compliance of the orders within one week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/identify-govt-lands-hc-to-collectors/article35735756.ece
05 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Claims, counter-claims over contempt case costs||The Telangana High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the State government in a PIL petition which challenged sanctioning of Rs. 58.95 crore towards expenses for pending contempt of court cases against Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed the government not to release any money under GO Routine No. 208 (Revenue) which was issued on this June 7. The CJ said “no question of releasing money” under the said GO till further orders from the court. The bench directed Revenue Secretary, Finance Secretary, Director of Treasuries and Accounts and Chief Commissioner of Land Administration to file counter affidavits in the matter within four weeks. The petitioner Prabhakar Chouti, a research scholar from Osmania University, stated that Revenue department had issued GO 208 allocating Rs. 58.95 crore towards expenses for pending contempt cases against Somesh Kumar holding the posts of Chief Secretary and Chief Commissioner of Land Administration. The petitioner stated that more than 180 contempt of court cases were pending against Mr. Somesh Kumar. The petitioner’s counsel, presenting his contentions, said an amount of Rs. 32.57 lakh was being spent for each of the contempt case on an average. He stated that the GO had multiple illegalities. The GO would send wrong signals that the State government was sponsoring litigation to violate court orders. After hearing contentions of the petitioner, the bench issued notices to the government and posted the matter to October 27. The bench sought to know under which head of the account the money was sanctioned. The government needs to be explain what were the norms followed by Treasuries department to release such amount. Within hours of the HC orders, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, who also holds the post of Revenue Secretary, reportedly filed an affidavit in the HC clarifying that the sum of Rs. 58.95 crore was not meant for expenses towards contempt of court cases against him. The money pertained to revalidation of the amount sanctioned for satisfaction of the execution petitions in Land Acquisition Original Petitions as directed by the bench in PIL petition No. 345/2017. According to him, the government gave administrative sanction of Rs. 457.79 crore for disposal of pending execution petitions in Land Acquisition Original Petitions. Some District Collectors said the Treasury department returned the bills due to freeing of the budget. Eventually, that amount lapsed as it was not withdrawn during the financial year of 2019-20. This compelled the government to place a request for revalidation for the year 2020-21. Stating that the averments made in the PIL petition were unfounded, Mr. Somesh Kumar requested the High Court to dismiss the plea and impose exemplary costs on the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/claims-counter-claims-over-contempt-case-costs/article35735755.ece

In a statement here, he said that the High Court questioned the release of Rs. 58 crore for fighting the contempt cases, predominantly filed against the Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and few other officers. “Why is the government engaging lawyers from New Delhi by paying huge amounts of fees when Advocate General, Additional AG, GPs and AGPs were supposed to fight on behalf of the government?” Bureaucrats were the custodians of the Constitution but in Telangana some of them were blindly dancing to KCR’s tunes, he alleged. “There are 290 contempt cases filed against the Chief Secretary and taxpayers’ money cannot be used for his cases.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-delhi-lawyers-when-ag-and-gps-are-here/article35735997.ece

05 August 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Officials are collecting bribes, say ZP members||The Zilla Parishad (ZP) meeting held here on Wednesday witnessed heated arguments with members pointing fingers at officers holding them responsible for ganja being smuggled and sold in the district. They also came down heavily on the officials alleging that they were collecting bribes to clear the audit report. They also stated that district panchayat department officials were collecting bribe in real estate ventures and turning a blind eye on illegal constructions. The ZP meeting was held here on Wednesday presided over by chairperson P. Manjushree and attended by Legislative Council pro-tem speaker V. Bhoopal Reddy, MLAs M. Bhupal Reddy, P. Manick Rao, and Collector M. Hanumantha Rao among others. Soon after the meeting was commenced, members raised the issue of ganja being smuggled from the district and lack of action by prohibition and excise officials. They alleged that some officials were extending tacit support to smugglers and demanded that strict action be taken against those smuggling ganja. ZPTC member and vice chairman Prabhakar alleged that audit department people were collecting huge amounts from sarpanches to clear the audit report. Another member pointed out that several sarpanches were in deep financial trouble as the measurement book (MB) record was not completed. It was brought to the notice of the ZP that a sarpanch had been paying a monthly interest of Rs. 30,000 as interest for the investment of Rs. 30 lakh he made on Vaikuntha Dhamam and dumpyard. He said that same was the condition of many sarpanches. The Collector promised to conduct a special drive for clearing MB records. “The State’s financial condition is not good and it was not possible to release funds as demanded by you. Probably, the Finance Minister might have answered your questions had he attended the meeting," said the Zilla Parishad chairperson. “All the works cannot be collected in single stake. Understand the financial condition of the State. Various development works were taken up by government and they are in progress. Focus on drug supply and deal it with iron hand,” said Mr. V.

05 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Tea planters in Assam flag dipping prices||A Rs. 38 hike in the daily cash wage of labourers has been a major factor in price realisation of tea declining markedly below the cost of production, a tea planters’ body has said. The North Eastern Tea Association (NETA) on Wednesday said the tea industry was struggling for survival due to an 18% dip in the price realisation of tea compared to that in 2020. “The price realisation of tea has gone down by Rs. 44.19 per kg in a year while the cost of production has gone up due to the hike in wages and increase in the cost of inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, natural gas, coal and transportation,” NETA adviser Bidyananda Borkakoty said. The cost of production of processed tea had gone up by Rs. 25 a kg. The daily cash wage hike from Rs. 167 to Rs. 205 and a Rs. 7 increase in input costs led to a “negative impact” on the industry to the tune of Rs. 76 per kg of processed tea, he said. According to the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre, the average price realisation of CTC tea from April to July this year was Rs. 208.02 per kg, down by Rs. 44.19 from Rs. 252.21 per kg during the same period in 2020. “Only about 9% teas have fetched above Rs. 300 a kg and about 51% of teas have got sold below Rs. 200 per kg,” NETA chairman Sunil Jallan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tea-planters-in-assam-flag-dipping-prices/article35735627.ece

05 August 2021||Navi Mumbai,||7-year-old Gujarat girl treated for tilt in neck||Doctors at Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai, have successfully operated on a seven-year-old girl from Valsad in Gujarat to treat her for a fibrous tumour in neck muscle. When Somya Tiwari was six-month-old, her parents noticed a lump on the right side of neck which gradually increased and caused a tilt in the neck. After two surgeries failed to address her condition, the family approached Apollo Hospitals where the girl underwent a multi-stage surgery carried out by a team of doctors from the departments of spine surgery, paediatric, paediatric orthopaedic, ENT and plastic surgery. “This appears to be a condition called benign fibrobastic proliferation of sternocleidomastoid muscle, also known as fibromatosis colli. This is a congenital fibrotic process that is rarely seen and affects infants with an incidence of 0.4% of live births. It is usually on one side, affects the right side in 3/4th of cases, and usually, male infants are affected slightly more often than the females,” Dr. Agnivesh Tikoo, spine surgeon, said. The neck tilt and rotation were so bad that the first and second cervical spine bones (vertebrae) had slipped from their original positions, Dr. Tikoo said. The MRI and CT scan imaging showed a bony bar extending from the collarbone to the mastoid bone located behind the ear. The surgery, led by Dr. Tikoo and Dr. Swapnil Keny, paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, was carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the bony bar was excised and removed along with tight muscle fibres. A paediatric halo, which holds the head via metal pins, was applied to child’s skull and gradual traction with weights was applied over the next three weeks. The second surgery was carried out three weeks later. It involved fixing the slipped cervical vertebrae which was performed under neuromonitoring (a device/system which monitors the spinal cord and nerves during the surgery). The child remained in the halo vest for three months before it was replaced with a specially made collar. The child underwent a third minor procedure a few days ago to make her neck more flexible to aid in physiotherapy. The child can now see straight with both the eyes and can hold her neck straight.

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘No farmers’ rally in Delhi on I-Day’||There will be no programme by protesting farm unions within the national capital on Independence Day, Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders said at a press conference on the Singhu border protest site on Wednesday. They will carry out rallies carrying the National Flag in block and district headquarters, they said. R-Day tractor rally They were briefing journalists on decisions taken at an SKM general body meeting on Tuesday. The announcement comes in the wake of last week’s comments from Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait that a tractor rally “is not a bad thing”, indicating that such a parade would be held on Delhi’s roads on August 15. This had given rise to concerns of a repeat of Republic Day, when a tractor rally by farmers in Delhi had spiralled out of control and led to chaos and violence. “Let me be very clear. Samyukt Kisan Morcha will not enter Delhi on August 15, there will be no programme in the capital on Independence Day,” said Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh leader Abhimanyu Kohar at the press conference. SKM urged farmers to carry out “tiranga yatras” at the tehsil, block and district levels between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on August 15, tying the National Flag to tractors, cycles and other vehicles. With regard to the BJP’s own ‘tiranga yatra’ in Haryana, SKM reiterated its decision not to oppose it, although the protesting farmers had been boycotting all other events of the ruling party for several months. “We have all respect for the National Flag and we do not want to give the BJP any fodder for propaganda that the farmers have disrespected the flag. So we will not oppose their yatra,” said Ravi Azad, a BKU leader from Haryana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-farmers-rally-in-delhi-on-i-day/article35735626.ece

The agency has re-registered the FIR on a reference from the Jharkhand government and a further notification by the Central government. The Judge died of a head injury after he was hit by an autorickshaw while he was on a jog on July 28. The incident was captured on a CCTV camera. The CCTV footage raised suspicion of foul play. The police soon arrested two persons, Lakhan Kumar Verma and Rahul Verma, and seized the vehicle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-death-of-dhanbad-judge/article35735932.ece
05 August 2021||Pune,||‘Pune riverfront project granted green nod in objectionable way’||In October 2019, the Maharashtra government’s State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) granted clearance for the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) ambitious Rs. 2,619-crore Pune River Front Development Project, which aims to clean and rejuvenate the 44-km stretch of the city’s rivers. However, noted environmentalist and architect Sarang Yadwadkar, has alleged that the green nod was given in a highly objectionable and controversial manner. He said the project would only result in the rise of floodwater levels while irreversibly destroying the rich biodiversity along the riverbank. Speaking to The Hindu , he pointed to the dangers in sanctioning such projects by the State’s civic bodies, particularly in the wake of the recent floods and the 2019 downpour in Pune, in which 25 people lost their lives. The project, which is to be implemented on the lines of Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati River Front Development Project, predominantly comprises channelising and converting the rivers into canals by constructing 30-40 foot embankments along both the banks. Three barrages will also be constructed at certain points along the Mula-Mutha river. The embankments are to be constructed inside the flood lines, narrowing the river and reducing the riverbed’s cross-sectional area. The floodplains on the outer sides of these embankments are to be filled with soil to create artificial gardens. “The embankments proposed to contain the rivers in this project are pretty high. At some locations, they are above the surrounding ground level. This will obstruct the natural flow of storm water from other parts of the city, causing massive inundation in residential localities,” Mr. Yadwadkar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pune-riverfront-project-granted-green-nod-in-objectionable-way/article35735832.ece
05 August 2021||Kabul,||Taliban claim attack on Afghan Minister||The Taliban on Wednesday claimed responsibility for a huge bomb attack in Kabul targeting the Defence Minister, as the insurgents fought for control of a string of besieged cities across the country. The bomb-and-gun attack on Defence Minister Bismillah Mohammadi on Tuesday was one of the biggest in Kabul for months, bringing violence to the capital after intense fighting in the south and west of the country. The Afghan and U.S. militaries have carried out air strikes against the insurgents to push them back, and the Taliban said the Kabul attack was a response to that. “The attack is the beginning of the retaliatory operations against the circles and leaders of the Kabul administration who are ordering attacks and the bombing of different parts of the country,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on social media. It represents a major escalation by the Taliban, who have largely refrained from large-scale attacks in the capital in recent years after starting talks with the United States on troop withdrawal. The first bomb exploded in the centre of Kabul, sending a thick plume of smoke into the sky, AFP correspondents reported. Less than two hours later, there was another loud blast followed by smaller explosions and rapid gunfire, also near the high-security Green Zone that houses several embassies, including the U.S. mission. The Minister was safe and Afghan forces repelled the attackers, but at least eight people were killed, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai. Mr. Mohammadi later said it was a suicide car bomb attack targeting his house.  The Taliban threat came after the Afghan military launched a counterattack against the insurgents in the southern city of Lashkar Gah.   Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch accused the Taliban of “summarily” executing detained soldiers, police and civilians with alleged ties to the Afghan government in areas they had recently seized. The rights group said it had also obtained a list of 44 people who were killed by the Taliban in the town of Spin Boldak, which the insurgents captured last month along the border with Pakistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-claim-attack-on-afghan-minister/article35735135.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. ships 110 mn doses of COVID-19 vaccine abroad||The U.S. has shipped more than 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to middle-and-low-income countries, President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday. This exceeds a commitment to donate at least 80 million doses of mostly AstraZeneca vaccine globally. India did not appear on an official list of countries that had received U.S. vaccines, a consequence of unresolved liability issues between the government of India and vaccine manufacturers. An Indian official involved in the vaccine negotiations told The Hindu that the government is keen to resolve the indemnity issue for both donations as well as commercial orders for the three U.S. vaccine manufacturers (Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &Johnson), and all vaccine shipments from the U.S. are held up for now. In an interview to NDTV, the government’s vaccine panel chief, N.K. Arora, suggested that India could reconsider its position on sovereign indemnity for U.S. vaccines if a larger number of doses, between “100 and 200 million doses” were offered, but that India is going ahead with its vaccine plans to inoculate all eligible adults with COVID-19 vaccines without factoring in vaccines imported from the U.S. Liability waiver Thus far, India has only given approval to pharma company Cipla on Tuesday to import the Moderna mRNA vaccine. In early July, a shipment of 7.5 million doses of Moderna vaccines were bound for India. This shipment, a part of the donations from international vaccine distribution facility COVAX, were held back at the last minute, as neither the government nor Cipla was willing to sign the liability waiver, according to the official who spoke to The Hindu . Pfizer is yet to apply for approval in India. During his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Biden said the U.S. would begin shipping by the end of this month some of the 500 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that it had committed to foreign countries. The U.S. was also expanding manufacturing at home and abroad, including in India, according to Mr. Biden. “We have committed to over a half a billion doses. And we’re trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we’re helping them do that. That’s what we’re doing now,” he said. India and the U.S., along with their Quad partners Japan and Australia, plan to supply at least 1 billion doses of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine across Asia by the end of 2022. These will be produced in India by the Hyderabad-based Biological E. Far from clear But the road ahead is far from clear. After the press reported earlier this week that J&J had withdrawn an application for accelerated approval of its Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in India, the company said it remained in talks with the Indian government on “how best to accelerate our ability to deliver our COVID-19 vaccine to India”. In Parliament last week, Minister of State for Health Bharti Pravin Pawar said the government-instituted vaccine panel was in “continuous dialogue with Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to discuss and address various issues including the issue of indemnity”. Most of the 111,701,000 doses donated by the U.S. so far have been distributed via COVAX. Indonesia has received the largest share (8 million doses) according to a ‘factsheet’ released by the White House on Tuesday. Several South Asian countries were on the list: Afghanistan (3.3 million doses), Bhutan (500,000 doses), Nepal (1.5 million doses), Sri Lanka (1.5 million doses), Pakistan and Bangladesh (5.5 million doses each). Mr. Biden said that countries which had vaccinated their populations should provide vaccines or financial support to the 100 or so nations in need of vaccines. “We had that discussion at the G7 [Group of Seven]. A number of those countries said they were going to do that. Some have followed through,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-ships-110-mn-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-abroad/article35735143.ece
05 August 2021||London,||Fully vaccinated one-third as likely to get COVID-19: study||Fully vaccinated people in England were one-third as likely to test positive for COVID-19, according to an ongoing survey of the population released on Wednesday. The latest findings, from a long-running study by scientists at Imperial College London and market research company Ipsos MORI, were based on 98,233 swabs taken between June 24 and July 12. They showed one in 160 people infected with coronavirus, with a prevalence rate of 1.21% for unvaccinated respondents and 0.40% for those fully jabbed. The study also found that double vaccinated people may be less likely to pass on the virus to others than those who have not received a vaccine. However, officials and scientists in Britain have urged caution after the government eased all virus curbs in England on July 19, including the legal requirement to wear masks in certain indoor settings. A U.S. government document leaked last week warned that infections among fully vaccinated people are not as rare as previously thought and that such cases are highly contagious. Paul Elliott, a Professor at Imperial’s School of Public Health and director of the survey programme, said the findings “confirm our previous data showing that both doses of a vaccine offer good protection against getting infected”. “However, we can also see that there is still a risk of infection, as no vaccine is 100% effective.”  COVID-19 cases registered daily by Britain’s Health Ministry have declined since the relaxation of rules, while population surveys have suggested they may still be rising, albeit at a slower rate. The trend has surprised experts and officials, who predicted a surge in new infections. The Imperial-Ipsos study — covering the period up to July 12 — showed even then cases were climbing more gradually than during the previous month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/fully-vaccinated-one-third-as-likely-to-get-covid-19-study/article35735133.ece

The three-month suspension of the Dutch section of Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) represents the latest blow to the troubled humanitarian response in Tigray, where the UN says hundreds of thousands are suffering from famine.  In a statement on Wednesday, Ethiopia said both MSF and NRC “have been disseminating misinformation in social media and other platforms outside of the mandate and purpose for which the organisations were permitted to operate”. Jan Egeland, NRC’s secretary general, has frequently used his Twitter account to issue stark warnings about the humanitarian situation in Tigray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ethiopia-suspends-two-aid-groups-in-tigray/article35735130.ece

So goes the routine welcome ceremony for China’s wayward herd of 14 wild elephants, whose wandering ways have sparked an unusual operation aimed at steering them home across steep, winding, and often populated terrain. The group left its home range far south near the Laos border 16 months ago for a grand food tour across rich farmland in southeastern Yunnan province. Now it’s a jumbo task for the three dozen forestry firefighters who have been charged with shepherding the elephants safely home. This includes tracking the night-moving animals that can disappear into thick forest and trek up to 30 kilometres a day using drones. It’s the furthest north that China’s wild Asian elephants have travelled in recorded times, said Yang Xiangyu, a task force leader. They’ve travelled more than 700 km, Mr. Yang said, and though now pointed homeward, still have several hundred more to go.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-coaxing-wayward-herd-of-elephants-home/article35735137.ece

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||A language ladder for an education roadblock||Every great change starts with a revolutionary step. The recent decision of 14 engineering colleges across eight States to offer courses in regional languages in select branches from the new academic year (https://bit.ly/3lsPuma) marks a historic moment in the academic landscape of the country on which rests the future of succeeding generations. Showing the way On a parallel note, the decision of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), to permit B. Tech programmes in 11 native languages in tune with the New Education Policy (NEP), is a momentous one. This monumental move opens the door to a whole world of opportunities — to students of B.Tech courses, in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam, Bengali, Assamese, Punjabi and Odia. The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, in his address marking the first anniversary of the National Education Policy (NEP), hailed the move and pointed out that the NEP’s emphasis on the mother tongue as the medium of instruction will instil confidence in students from poor, rural and tribal backgrounds. Importantly, he added that even in elementary education, the mother tongue is being promoted and referred to one of the key drivers in this regard — the Vidya Pravesh programme launched on the occasion. These remarkable steps should be welcomed and scaled up over the next few years to ensure that the dreams of millions of students seeking to pursue professional courses in their mother tongue are realised. Interestingly, in a survey conducted by the AICTE in February this year, of over 83,000 students, nearly 44% students voted in favour of studying engineering in their mother tongue, underscoring a critical need in technical education. The progressive and visionary NEP 2020 champions education in one’s mother tongue right from the primary school level — improving the learning outcomes of the child and the development of his/her cognitive faculties hinge upon this. Multiple studies have proved that children who learn in their mother tongue in their early, formative years perform better than those taught in an alien language. UNESCO and other organisations have been laying emphasis on the fact that learning in the mother tongue is germane to building self-esteem and self-identity, as also the overall development of the child. Unfortunately, some educators and parents still accord unquestioned primacy to English, and resultantly, the child’s mother tongue ends up as their ‘second/third language’ in schools. There are bubbles now It would be pertinent to recall the words of the great Indian physicist and Nobel Laureate, Sir C.V. Raman, who, demonstrating exemplary vision, observed, “We must teach science in our mother tongue. Otherwise science will become a highbrow activity. It will not be an activity in which all people can participate... (https://bit.ly/2VvakX6).” While our educational system has seen phenomenal growth to the extent that it offers courses of international repute in engineering, medicine, law and the humanities, we have, paradoxically, excluded our own people from accessing it. Over the years, we have ended up building academic roadblocks, impeding the progress of the vast majority of our students and remained content with creating a small bubble of English-medium universities and colleges, while our own languages languish when it comes to technical and professional courses. Global practices A cursory look at the global best practices in the medium of instruction at the level of higher education should inform us more on where we stand. Among the G20, most countries have state-of-the-art universities, with teaching being imparted in the dominant language of their people. Take the Asian nations among them, for instance. In South Korea, nearly 70% of the universities teach in Korean, even as they aspire to play a role on the international stage. In a unique move, with the increasing craze for learning English among parents, the South Korean government, in 2018, banned the teaching of English prior to third grade in schools, since it appeared to slow pupils’ proficiency in Korean. Similarly, in Japan, a majority of university programmes are taught in Japanese; in China too, universities use Mandarin as the medium of instruction. In Europe, France and Germany offer us great insights into how nations protect their languages. France went to the extent of having a strict ‘French-only’ policy as the medium of instruction in schools. In Germany, while the language of instruction in schools is predominantly German, even in tertiary education, more than 80% of all masters’ programmes are taught in German. Canada showcases a sound approach to education, revealing a picture of a country with linguistic diversity. While English is the dominant medium of instruction in most provinces, in Quebec, a province with a majority French-speaking population, French is the medium of instruction in primary and secondary education in many schools, as also a number of universities. In this global context, it is ironic that India has an overwhelming majority of professional courses being taught in English. In science, engineering, medicine and law, the situation is even bleaker, with native language courses being practically non-existent. Fortunately, we are now beginning to find our voice in our own languages.  How do we improve this grim situation? The NEP outlines the road map, demonstrating to us the means to protect our languages while improving the access and quality of our education. We must begin with imparting primary education (at least until Class 5) in the student’s mother tongue, gradually scaling it up. For professional courses, while the initiative of the 14 engineering colleges is commendable, we need more such efforts all across the country. Private universities must join hands and offer a few bilingual courses to begin with. One of the biggest bottlenecks for more students to take up higher education in the native languages is the lack of high-quality textbooks, especially in technical courses, and this needs to be addressed urgently. Build on these initiatives In the digital age, technology can be suitably leveraged to increase accessibility of these Indian language courses to students in remote areas. Content in the digital learning ecosystem, still a nascent domain in our country, is greatly skewed towards English which excludes the vast majority of our children, and this has to be corrected. A welcome development in this regard is the collaboration between the AICTE and IIT Madras to translate SWAYAM’s courses in eight regional languages such as Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam and Gujarati. This will be a major boost for engineering students and help them transition more smoothly to an English-dominated curriculum in later years. We need more such tech-led initiatives to really democratise higher education. Not exclusivist Laying the stress on instruction in the mother tongue is not exclusivist in nature — as I often say, one should learn as many languages as possible, but what is required is a strong foundation in the mother tongue. In other words, what I am advocating is not a ‘Mother tongue versus English’, but a ‘Mother tongue plus English’ approach. In today’s increasingly interconnected world, proficiency in different languages opens new vistas to a wider world. Together, we must work to remove the sense of inferiority some of us display when it comes to speaking in our own languages. In the end, we must remember that if we neglect a language, not only do we lose a priceless body of knowledge but also risk depriving future generations of their cultural roots and precious social and linguistic heritage. I hope more institutions will be encouraged and inspired in the coming years to offer courses in regional languages. India is a land of immeasurable talent. We must unlock the full potential of our youth, without letting their seeming inability to speak a foreign language impede their progress. It is against this backdrop that the decision of the 14 engineering colleges across eight States to offer courses in regional languages needs to be seen and appreciated. M. Venkaiah Naidu is the Vice President of India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-language-ladder-for-an-education-roadblock/article35735121.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||A grand tax bargain in danger of coming apart||After four years, the promise of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) remains substantially unrealised. It is a far cry from the attempted avoidance of cascading and continues to be a not very transparent multi-rate system with associated difficulties in computing and assessing tax liability, tax burden and tax incidence. States have less headroom in handling GST collection shortfall after surrendering their fiscal autonomy. When the period of five years of compensation ends in 2022, will we see a continued flawed system or a freshly minted GST 2.0, given the asymmetry of the power equations between the States and the Centre? The tax base of GST does not appear to be expanding as the recent uptick has reversed last month. The GST is strongly co-related to overall GDP. Revenue collection of the GST is dependent on the nominal growth rate of Gross Value Added (GVA) in the economy. Since inception, GVA per quarter has been between Rs. 40-lakh crore to Rs. 47-lakh crore and GST revenue has not been higher than Rs. 2.7-lakh crore to Rs. 3.1-lakh crore. The Tax to Gross value addition is only about 5% to 6.5% though GVA growth was much higher. Obviously, a very large segment is covered by exemption, composition schemes, evasion and lower tax rate. Centre holds the cards The fundamental weakness of the GST is its political architecture which is asymmetrically loaded in favour of the Centre. Disputes between States and between the Centre and the States are inevitable in a mosaic arrangement. But in the current structure, no particular body is tasked to adjudicate this though the original Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill 2011 (GST Bill) had a provision for such an institution. In the voting, the central government has one-third vote and States have two-thirds of total votes (with equal voting rights regardless of size and stake). With the support of a dozen small States whose total GST collection is not more than 5% of the total — and their Budget is mostly underwritten by the central government — the game is hugely in the Centre’s favour. With equal value for each States’ voting, larger and mid-sized States feel shortchanged. Severe fiscal strain is expected when the 14% compensation comes to an end as the median growth rate of subsumed taxes is only 11%, and in many States between 5% to 10%. The median subsumed tax buoyancy is below unity. This means with 1% growth, there will be a 0.75% growth of tax. The contraction of GST revenue across the country means that the compensation amount will be higher and the clamour for a continuance of compensation scheme is inevitable. Issues with tax structure The second problem is the design flaws in the tax structure. Nearly 45% to 50% of commodity value is outside the purview of the GST, such as petrol and petroleum products. In addition, States which export or have inter-State transfers or mineral and fossil fuel extractions are not getting revenue as the origin States and need a compensation mechanism. The pre-existing threshold level of VAT has been tweaked too often which has led to an evaporation of tax base incentivising, enabling evasion and mis-reporting. Most trading and retail establishments, (however small) are out of the fold of the GST. At the retail level, irrespective of whether Input Tax Credit (ITC) is required or not, the burden can be passed off to the consumer. As a result, the loss could be as high as one third. Third, exemptions from registration and taxation of the GST have further eroded the GST tax base compared to the tax base of the pre-existing VAT. Exemptions are purely distortionary and also provide a good chance to remain under the radar, thereby directly increasing evasion or misclassification. Theoretically, exemptions at the final stages reduce tax realisation. As multiple rates are charged at different stages, it goes against the lessons of GST history. This tax works well with a single uniform tax rate for all commodities and services at all stages, inputs and outputs alike. While most countries have a single rate, India stands out and is among the five countries to have four rates/slabs. Exclusion as another issue The fourth is that of exclusion. Petroleum products remaining outside the purview of GST has helped the Centre to increase cesses and decrease central excise, in what would otherwise have been shareable with the States. Now, States will be keen on including petrol and diesel under the GST as their share of tax goes up in the process, even if there is a special rate fixed for it. In April 2017, cess and surcharge formed 56% and 35% of the excise duty on petrol and diesel, respectively. Now, their share has increased to 91% and 85%, respectively, and the shareable central excise has reduced by Rs. 6.5 a litre, making it Rs. 2.98 for petrol and Rs. 4.83 for diesel. Equity requires that petrol and diesel be brought under the GST. Apart from the complexity it creates in record keeping and ‘granting ITC’, in the present form it also leads to a cascading which the GST avowedly tried to avoid (https://bit.ly/3xiIhYp). Fifth, compliance with GST return (GSTR-1) filing stipulation and the resultant tax information is not up to date. The gap in filing GSTR-1 was 33% in 2019-20 and has been increasing. As per GSTR-3B, the effective tax rate is as low as 6.5% when GSTR-1 shows an average 15% tax rate. Fraudulent claims of Input Tax Credit (ITC) because of a lack of timely reconciliation are quite high though it has come down by two thirds. Tax evasion, estimated by a National Institute of Public Finance and Policy’s paper, is at least 5% in minor States and plus 3% in the major States. These policy gaps with regard to a higher threshold (when in sales tax, it was lower) exemption level and multiple tax rates have led to a base erosion. Policy gaps along with compliance gaps do need to be addressed. Without proper tax information, infrastructure and base, the States would go in for selective tax enforcement. In the long run, voluntary compliance will suffer and equity in taxation will be violated. Finally, the grand bargain will come apart. Given all these problems, a version 2.0 of GST may have to be designed sooner rather than later.

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The doubted scientist and her vaccine revolution||As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly apparent to every country that rapid mass vaccination is the only sure way to stop the virus in its tracks. Yet, as we debate issues like vaccine inequality and vaccine nationalism, we tend somewhat to neglect the science bit, the creation of the vaccines, which happens to be the only positive element in the discourse about the pandemic. Indeed, the speed with which the vaccines to fight COVID-19 have been invented and tested is unparalleled in the history of medical science. And one interesting fact about this stunning feat of science is that several women have led it from the front. These women of science have emerged as role models in a field of human endeavour that is still perceived as ‘masculine’ and is dominated by men in leading positions. Sarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford led the creation of AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria (known in India as Covishield). In the same league we have K. Sumathy, who steered the team behind Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Hanneke Schuitemaker, a Dutch virologist, guided the development of Janssen by Johnson & Johnson. Elena Smolyarchuk at Sechenov University led the study for Sputnik V. A bold idea However, the scientist who should be feted the most for her work on developing vaccines to fight COVID-19 is Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian-origin biochemist working in the U.S. Dr. Kariko has not only led the creation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is one of the most effective, but in doing so, she has also invented and perfected a new technique involving a molecule called the mRNA. This has revolutionised biotechnology, paving the way for unheard-of miracles in drug development. The mRNA (messenger-Ribonucleic Acid) is a molecule naturally manufactured by animal cells that gives signals to cells about which proteins to make. That is, it carries to the cells vital genetic information upon which protein synthesis, one of the most critical physiological functions, thoroughly depends. Yet, no one before Dr. Kariko thought mRNA could be modified in labs to harness their code-carrying ability for triggering the manufacture of specific proteins by cells — proteins that would generate precise antibodies needed to fight particular antigens or disease-causing micro-organisms. This idea, of tweaking the ‘message’ in the mRNA for customised signalling to cells, was simple and logical, like many breakthrough ideas in science. But it was also stunningly bold. In effect, Dr. Kariko was aiming to play God with a cellular function so foundational that it has always been taken for granted. Expectedly, her idea was treated by the whole scientific community in the U.S. as odd and improbable. It was repeatedly rejected by funding bodies, and Dr. Kariko struggled to get a grant or even a lab to work consistently on the mRNA. Two chance encounters Yet, she held on to her idea, working on it sporadically in shared labs, while surviving on a low-end, insecure job at the University of Pennsylvania. And this — the lack of grants or a solid professional position — meant more rejections and more isolation. Dr. Kariko was at the point of giving up when a chance encounter at a photocopy centre one morning in 1998 changed her decision. Dr. Drew Weissman, an influential biotechnologist working at UPenn, was moderately impressed by Dr. Kariko’s idea and agreed to share his lab and other resources with her. It was here that Dr. Kariko honed the technology to modify the mRNA and tested it on mice. After an initial hiccup, she was successful. The modified mRNA was able to trigger targeted protein synthesis in mice with no negative side effects. Yet — such is the hold of convention and status on the scientific establishment — there was hardly any excitement around the invention. Dr. Kariko remained where she was and what she was until another chance meeting at a conference with Uğur Şahin, the CEO of BioNTech. Dr. Kariko, an academic, became the vice-president of BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals, using her technology to manufacture an influenza vaccine. And then COVID-19 hit the world. In February 2020, when the virus was still mostly confined to China, her employer seemed to sense it was going to be much worse. He and Dr. Kariko decided to start working on a vaccine against the novel pathogen using the mRNA technology. By then BioNTech had partnered with Pfizer, and Dr. Kariko’s work led to the development of their vaccine against COVID-19. Moderna later used the same technology to develop their vaccine. Thus, Dr. Kariko’s once-derided idea led to the genesis of two of the most effective anti-COVID-19 vaccines, in the process establishing an epoch-making new technology in biomedicine. Lessons from the invention Dr. Kariko’s brilliance as an innovator underscores the point that women can be as good as men in science — a point that should have been well-established by now, but which is hardly the accepted view among people even in the Western world. Her revolutionary invention, one hopes, would go some way in negating sexist assumptions about women in science, not many of whom achieve such spectacular success but all of whom contribute to the collective endeavour of human science. Dr. Kariko’s career, moreover, should have a lesson for all systems of power everywhere — that when some idea challenges the norms or conventions of a system, it is the system that needs to stretch itself in order to give it a chance. Entrenched conventionality is the bane of all human endeavours, and especially of science, which is synonymous with progress. When Dr. Kariko was invited to a vaccination site for health workers at UPenn, in December 2020, the otherwise emotionally stable woman was moved by the sight of the big crowd waiting to get a shot of her vaccine. And when the doctors broke into spontaneous clapping as she and Dr. Weissman walked past them in a hall, she gave in and “cried a bit” in joy, she told Gina Kolata of The New York Times . Her life’s dream, which she had been chasing since she was 22, was finally realised, and a long saga of doubt, implied insult, and unrewarded toil had come to an end. I believe Dr. Kariko deserves the Nobel Prize in Medicine for her revolutionary idea and her incredible hard work. Hers is an idea that has opened up the scope for endless possibilities in drug development.

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Clash of cultures in a federation||Though probably the most equitable form of governance for multiracial, multicultural countries, there are only a few confederations in the world, such as Canada and Switzerland. India and the European Union (EU) are unions. However, India is a federation because powers are divided between the Union and the States, and the EU a supranational organisation that defies definition, with both confederal and federal aspects. It is this division of powers in India and the EU that brings the unions into conflict with their constituent parts. Latest controversy in the EU The EU is variously criticised as a “political dwarf”, “a hobbled giant” distracted by internal bickering and competing national agendas, and an aggregate of secondary powers in search of primary status through collective agency. Despite the EU being one of the largest economies of the world, the 27 leaders squabble over issues from fisheries to budget allocations. The union finds it easier to promote universal standards in areas like climate change and food and bio-safety than domestic values. The latest controversy with Hungary and Poland on gay and lesbian rights is a case in point. Gay marriage is not recognised by Budapest and only heterosexual couples can legally adopt children. The LGBTQ law that took effect in July outlaws information perceived as promoting homosexuality or gender change to children under 18. This led to strong criticism from 17 liberal EU nations who believe the Hungarian law undermines the principle that discrimination on the basis of sexuality, ethnicity and gender is not permissible within the union. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán has countered by proposing a national referendum on the law. He has been re-elected thrice, commands two-thirds of the legislature, and has diminished institutions designed to limit the powers of the state, such as free media, universities and an independent judiciary. Mr. Orbán also regularly frustrates EU’s unity on foreign policy, such as on refugees in 2016, opposing criticism of China’s actions in Hong Kong, and the call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Hungary was the first EU member to accept Russian and Chinese COVID-19 vaccines before approval by the EU medicines regulator. The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly to haul Hungary before the European Court of Justice over its LGBTQ law, and while there is an EU provision to remove voting rights from an offending country, penalties require unanimous agreement from EU states. This will never be forthcoming since Hungary and Poland support each other and the union cannot expel a member state without the unanimity requirement. Poland’s Catholic-conservative governing party takes a similar stance on LGBTQ with by-laws that have designated one-third of the nation as ‘LGBT-free zones’. Budapest and Warsaw are supported by Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, who condemns Brussels for imposing “imaginary European values” without paying heed to local tradition. All three countries’ leaderships have expressed doubts, and placed restrictions, on the functioning of judicial independence. Although none of these leaders believe they can convince their EU colleagues to follow their social policies, they do not wish to separate from the union, since EU membership is supported by a huge majority. Hungary is the second-largest net beneficiary of the EU budget, receiving €5 billion more than it contributes each year. The measures introduced by the three nations are for domestic popularity in a combined population of nearly 50 million with cultural traditions different from more liberal EU member states. The crisis represents a clash of cultures, which underlines why integration towards a closer union is unlikely to materialise. A fractious relationship In India, the Centre and Opposition-controlled States have a historically fractious relationship. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959 dislodged the Communist government in Kerala on specious grounds. Ever since, the pattern of the Union government attempting to subvert Opposition States by stimulating defections, ordering selective raids by investigative agencies, electronic surveillance, and delaying or refusing financial entitlements has become the unsavoury norm, now taken to extremes by Hindutva ideologues in control of the Centre. The tensions between New Delhi and the Opposition-led periphery are magnified by differences in values, perceived arrogance on the part of the Centre and the victimhood card played by Opposition parties. The homogenising bias of the union clashes with the particularism unique to individual States, resulting in the clash of cultures. The term ‘cooperative federalism’, coined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been reduced to an oxymoron.

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||No fundamental right to strike||Recently, the Minister of Defence introduced the Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021, in the Lok Sabha to provide for the maintenance of essential defence services so as “to secure the security of nation and the life and property of the public at large” and prevent staff of the government-owned ordnance factories from going on strike. The Bill seeks to empower the government to declare services mentioned in it as “essential defence services” and prohibit strikes and lockouts in any industrial establishment or unit engaged in such services. The Minister, however, assured the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) employees that their service conditions will not be affected. Rules and rights This is not for the first time that strikes by government employees are being made explicitly illegal by the government. The Madhya Pradesh (and Chhattisgarh) Civil Services Rules, 1965, prohibit demonstrations and strikes by government servants and direct the competent authorities to treat the durations as unauthorised absence. A strike under this rule includes “total or partial cessation of work”, a pen-down strike, a traffic jam, or any such activity resulting in cessation or retardation of work. Other States too have similar provisions. Under Article 33 of the Constitution, Parliament, by law, can restrict or abrogate the rights of the members of the armed forces or the forces charged with the maintenance of public order so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline among them. Thus, for the armed forces and the police, where discipline is the most important prerequisite, even the fundamental right to form an association can be restricted under Article 19(4) in the interest of public order and other considerations. The Supreme Court in Delhi Police v. Union of India (1986) upheld the restrictions to form association by the members of the non-gazetted police force after the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, and the Rules as amended by Amendment Rules, 1970, came into effect. While the right to freedom of association is fundamental, recognition of such association is not a fundamental right. Parliament can by law regulate the working of such associations by imposing conditions and restrictions on their functions, the court held. In T.K. Rangarajan v. Government of Tamil Nadu (2003), the Supreme Court held that the employees have no fundamental right to resort to strike. Further, there is prohibition to go on strike under the Tamil Nadu Government Servants’ Conduct Rules, 1973. Also, there is no moral or equitable justification to go on strike. The court said that government employees cannot hold the society to ransom by going on strike. In this case, about two lakh employees, who had gone on strike, were dismissed by the State government. Grievance redressal A police havildar was convicted of contempt of court by the sub-divisional officer, Gaya. The Gaya police, thereupon, gave notice of strike unless redress was given to the havildar and the sub-divisional officer punished. Though an inquiry was ordered immediately, the strike commenced on March 24, 1947. When some representatives of policemen met Gandhi at Jehanabad on the March 28, he told them that their strike was ill-advised. They were not mere wage-earners but the members of an essential service. They should immediately and unconditionally call off the strike. In his speech on March 27, Gandhi said that “the police... should never go on strike. Theirs was an essential service and they should render that service, irrespective of their pay. There were several other effective and honourable means of getting grievances redressed...” There is no fundamental right to strike under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Strikes cannot be justified on any equitable ground. Strike as a weapon is mostly misused which results in chaos. Though the employees of OFB have threatened to go on strike, Parliament, which has the right to restrict even the fundamental rights of the armed forces, is well within its right to expressly prohibit resorting to strike.

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Over the borderline||The drawing down of tensions between Assam and Mizoram, at least at the leadership level, with the respective governments announcing the withdrawal of FIRs against the Chief Minister of Assam and a Rajya Sabha MP from Mizoram, among other steps, comes as a great relief. These actions followed the deaths of six policemen and a civilian from Assam in a violent gunfight in the border town of Vairengte in Mizoram on July 26, which exacerbated an already fraught situation between the States. The retaliatory actions such as filing FIRs against prominent representatives, at a time when locals in the Barak Valley in Assam had already imposed a blockade, disallowing trucks with essential goods from entering Mizoram, seemed to indicate that the States’ leaderships were throwing away their scabbards, militating against their own moves to restore calm. After all, the governments had taken the right decision to withdraw their police forces from a four-kilometre “disputed stretch” and let it be manned by central paramilitary forces till a permanent solution is found on the border question. But the “blockade” and the damage caused to the only rail line connected to Mizoram made matters tough, culminating in the Mizo Bar Association filing a PIL before the Aizawl Bench of the Gauhati High Court against the “economic blockade”. The Chief Ministers now seem committed to talks, with Assam’s Himanta Biswa Sarma even suggesting that his government will approach the Supreme Court to find an amicable solution. Continuing talks without recriminations is the only way out to tamp down tensions between the two States. The situation should never have come to this. What began as a conflict between residents of the States in the border area that is disputed between them, morphed into a violent battle between police, with paramilitary forces doing little to control or halt this. Their role in stopping the violence and securing the peace in the border areas between the States will now be paramount, even as the Assam government must compel residents to avoid continuing the blockade. An impartial inquiry into the sequence of events that led to the firing incident and the deaths must also be held so that such a situation does not recur. On the question of settling the borders to the satisfaction of both States, a concerted, people-oriented approach by the respective authorities with the facilitation of the Centre can strive to achieve that instead of a purely juridical approach that seeks to address this via the States’ respective historical claims, a method that is used to settle sovereign claims. After all, both Assam and Mizoram are part of the Indian Union, and inter-State cooperation and cohesion are central to the sanctity of the federal system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/over-the-borderline/article35735116.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Tigray’s woes||When Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops to Tigray, the country’s northern-most region, in November 2020, he promised it would be a short campaign against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Seven months later, when Ethiopia declared a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew, Mr. Abiy was indirectly accepting defeat. Government troops are now facing serious allegations of war crimes as bodies wash up in a river in Sudan that borders Ethiopia. The federal troops had initially ousted the TPLF from Mekele, the Tigrayan capital, and established a parallel government. But the TPLF retreated to the mountains, and then struck back. In June, it recaptured Mekele, forcing the federal troops to pull back. At least in defeat, Mr. Abiy could have accepted his mistakes and sought a settlement. But instead, he announced a blockade on Tigray, with even international aid deliveries stopped. The UN says at least 3,50,000 people are facing a “severe food crisis” in the region. The TPLF says it will not stop fighting unless the government lifts the blockade and pulls back all opposing troops. The conflict has already spilled over into the Amhara and Afar regions, threatening the very regional make-up of ethnically divided Ethiopia. An influx of refugees has raised tensions with neighbouring Sudan. Mr. Abiy, a Nobel Prize winner, went to war in Tigray as part of an ambitious plan to rewrite the country’s power balance. Since Ethiopia embraced democracy in 1995, the TPLF, which led the resistance against the military dictatorship, the ‘Derg’, had played a key role in the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Mr. Abiy, an Oromo, rose to power in 2018 amid growing ethnic tensions and protests as the EPRDF’s nominee. He ended the war with Eritrea, released political prisoners and promised more freedoms. But he also moved to end the TPLF’s clout in Addis Ababa, which led to a split in the EPRDF. He formed a different coalition, the Prosperity Party, and retained power, by cutting the TPLF off federal government networks. When a defiant TPLF challenged the government, he declared war on Tigray. He may have hoped that the federal troops could oust the TPLF from power and establish order quickly. But he seemed to have overlooked Ethiopia’s complex history of ethnic relations and the TPLF’s guerrilla warfare. The war may have helped him politically — his coalition won a huge majority in the delayed June Parliamentary elections which were held in all regions except in Tigray — but it has pushed Tigray into an endless rebellion and shaken up the country’s ethnic balance. It is time for Mr. Abiy to act like a statesman. He should stop the collective punishment of the Tigrayan people, end the blockade and be ready for talks with the TPLF for a mutually agreeable cessation of all hostilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tigrays-woes/article35735117.ece

They gathered 13 kilos on the first excursion, 35 on the second and 29 on the third. These are net weights excluding the collection bags and storage boxes. Irwin weighs 72 kg., according to NASA, Scott 79, and Alfred Worden, the third crewman, 69. Other calculations by NASA showed that the lunar Rover covered a total distance of just under 24 km. on a “straight line map” basis — not counting hills and valleys. Its mileage counting edometer on the wheels recorded a distance of about 28 km. The Apollo 15 command ship to-day ejected a satellite into moon orbit for long-term study of the lunar environment.

05 August 2021||MUMBAI,||SBI Q1 net jumps 55% to record Rs. 6,504 cr. on lower provisions||State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday said first-quarter standalone net profit rose 55.3% to Rs. 6,504 crore due to lower loan loss provisioning and sizeable recovery from a bad loan account. This was its highest quarterly net profit, the lender said in a filing. Profit was lifted by the recovery of Rs. 1,692 crore from the Kingfisher Airlines loan account during the quarter. Loan loss provisions slid 46.6% to Rs. 5,030 crore. Net interest income rose 3.74% to Rs. 27,638 crore while domestic net interest margin fell 9 basis points to 3.15%. Provision Coverage Ratio declined 39 bps to 85.9%. Slippages rose multifold to Rs. 15,666 crore from Rs. 3,637 crore. But a significant part of this amount had been pulled back in July, chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said at a video press conference. “The most impact was felt in May. The localised lockdowns had significant impact on our business and collections.... We expect recovery to improve in the coming quarters,” he added. He declined to give any guidance for FY22 citing the uncertain economic environment. He said stress was seen in the housing, gold and SME loan segments. During the quarter, the bank received loan ‘restructuring 2.0’ proposals worth Rs. 7,302 crore, of which Rs. 5,246 crore were approved. Gross NPAs rose 3.55% to Rs. 1,34,259 crore, while net NPAs increased 1.05% to Rs. 43,153 crore. COVID-19 related contingency provisioning was at Rs. 9,065 crore. The loan book grew 6.27%. Despite stress in home loans, the chairman said SBI would continue to expand the size of the bank’s housing loan book. “There is no reason to worry... We have no plans to slow down the home loan book,” Mr. Khara said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sbi-q1-net-jumps-55-to-record-rs-6504-cr-on-lower-provisions/article35735102.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Service sector contracts for a third straight month: PMI||India’s service sector contracted for the third straight month in July, with job losses extending to an eighth successive month, as per IHS Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index. The PMI stood at 45.4, marginally better than the 41.2 recorded in June. A score above 50 indicates an expansion. For the first time in a year, services firms were pessimistic about the outlook for the 12-month period on worries about the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and profit margins. Consumer services was the worst-affected during July, indicating that the unlocking across States had failed to lift confidence in the resumption of contact-sensitive activity, while transport and storage was the only subsector to see higher sales in the past month. “In line with sustained falls in new work, there was a further reduction in service sector jobs during July,” IHS Markit said in its Services PMI statement for India. “Employment contracted for the eighth consecutive month, albeit at a moderate pace that was slower than that seen in June,” it added. The service sector’s performance in July is in contrast to the manufacturing sector which logged its highest PMI in three months and saw a pause in job losses for the first time since the pandemic’s onset last March. “The subdued performance of services more than offset a rebound across manufacturing, causing further contractions in private sector sales, output and employment,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. India’s overall output, manufacturing and services combined, thus contracted for the third month in a row as the Composite PMI Output Index was 49.2 in July. June’s reading was 43.1. “Private sector employment decreased for the seventeenth month in a row in July,” IHS Markit added.

After Sushil Kumar, Worlds bronze medallist and two-time Asian champion Ravi became the second Indian wrestler to book a berth in the final. Meets Uguev in final Dahiya will take on two-time World champion Zaur Uguev of Russia in the title clash. The Indian made a sensational comeback to beat double Worlds medallist Kazakh Nurislam Sanayev ‘by fall’ in the semifinals. Leading 2-1 in the first period, he trailed 2-9 in the second as the Kazakh defied his head injury to roll the Indian over with a double-leg hold. However, Dahiya closed the gap to 5-9 and showed his class to pin down the Kazakh spectacularly to reach the final. Earlier, the Indian beat Pan American silver medallist Colombian Oscar Tigreros 13-2 and Bulgarian Georgi Vangelov 14-4 on technical superiority to make the last four. Double leg attack In his opening bout, which was 2-2 after the first period, Dahiya relied on a double leg attack on Tigreros for a crucial take-down. The Indian accumulated points at a faster pace to outclass the Colombian. In the quarterfinal against Vangelov, Dahiya was 6-0 up in the first period. He outwitted Vangelov in an action-packed second period to wrap up the contest with 16 seconds left on the clock. Worlds silver medallist Deepak Punia won two bouts before losing to former World champion David Taylor of the USA 10-0 in the 86kg semifinals. He will face either Ali Shabanau or Myles Amine in the bronze medal contest. Anshu Malik (women’s 57kg), who went down fighting to double Worlds medallist Iryna Kurachkina 8-2 in the first round, had a reason to celebrate her birthday on Thursday as she made it to the repechage round following the Belarusian’s progress to the final.  Anshu will meet Rio Olympics silver medallist Russian Valeria Koblova in her first repechage match.  Deepak claimed his opening bout on technical superiority, beating African champion Nigerian Ekerekeme Agiomor 12-1. Digging deep He staved off a strong challenge from Chinese Lin Zhusen to post a 6-3 win and reach the semifinals. At 3-3, Lin had the upper hand.

Making a second successive Olympic appearance, Aditi ended the day in the tied second spot with American Nelly Korda. Sweden’s Madelene Sagstrom led the field with a 66. Diksha Dagar, a late Indian entry in the 60-player field, was tied 56th after a 76. Two good rounds in Rio In Rio, Aditi had two good rounds and was among the top-10 before fading away to the tied 41st place. “Last time I think it was more just enjoying the experience and staying at the (Olympic) Village, seeing all the other athletes, but this time I think definitely here to have a good finish, hopefully give my best, try and win a medal,” said Aditi, who shot two birdies on the front nine and another three after the turn. “I think having played the Olympics once definitely gets you more prepared, you’re not as overawed by it. I mean it’s still the Olympics, it’s still really exciting, but, yeah, definitely more prepared for this one. “My mom is caddying for me. Last time, I had my dad ‘on the bag’, so the experience was just so incredible. I was like I want to have my mom next time and I made good on that promise,” she said. “This time, I think I have a lot more experience. Just playing on the LPGA Tour the last five years. kind of, has made me way better as a player than I was at Rio. “And I think the Olympic experience was, I didn’t finish as well as I wanted to, but just seeing the effect that it had on golf in India was inspiring and that’s kind of what motivated me for this one as well,” said Aditi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aditi-tied-second-after-round-1/article35735437.ece
05 August 2021||Tokyo,||India goes down to Argentina in a bruising contest||The Indian women’s inspiring run ended in the semifinals as the team slipped to a 1-2 loss to former world champion Argentina. Rani Rampal’s side will face Great Britain in the bronze medal match on Friday. At the end of a bruising contest, the Argentines revelled while the Indians were left dejected. Brilliant start The Sjoerd Marijne-coached team made a brilliant start as Gurjit Kaur scored off a penalty corner — her second in as many games — in the 90th second. Argentina women’s team, which has won medals at four consecutive Olympics (2000 to 2012), slowly started making inroads, winning a penalty corner in the eighth minute but nothing came off it. The world’s second-ranked team mounted pressure on India, effectively combining aerial passes and scorching runs on the flanks but the Indian defence stood resolute. Argentina came out in the second quarter like Gaucho cowgirls running wild in the Pampas and found the equaliser in the 18th minute. Their 37-year-old captain Maria Noel Barrionuevo rifled a bullet drag-flick to restore parity. India’s inability to close out opportunities cost it dear as two penalty-corner chances went begging in the 26th minute. Neha Goyal had a great chance four minutes later when she stormed into the penalty circle, but she shied away from taking a shot, looked for a pass instead, and was robbed of the ball. Argentina’s Agustina Albertarrio was a menace on the left and made a marauding run in the 33rd minute that served as a warning. Barrionuevo scored her second goal of the evening in the 36th minute from another penalty corner. The goal, which took a heavy deflection off an Indian defender, was her 197th international goal in 344 appearances. It was the beginning of the end for India as Argentina dug deep and fortified its defence. India had a few stray chances, but the goal remained elusive. The side had a sliver of hope in the last minute, but Argentina goalkeeper Belen Succi showed great reflexes to keep out Navneet Kaur’s deflection from close range. Argentina takes on the Netherlands, which defeated Great Britain 5-1, in the final.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-loses-to-argentina-in-a-bruising-contest/article35735398.ece
05 August 2021||Tokyo,||‘I couldn’t achieve what I set out to’||Lovlina Borgohain was bitterly disappointed that she couldn’t make it to the gold-medal bout. “I’ve just lost, and I am not really happy about it. I’ve had to be content with the bronze medal throughout my career. A medal is a medal, whether it is an Olympic medal or an inter-district one,” she said right after the bout. When asked if she realised the gravity of her achievement, which puts her among the elite in India’s sporting history, she said: “Ever since I began boxing it has been my dream to win an Olympic gold medal. “I trained and spent every moment towards this goal. It feels good that I have a medal, but I could not achieve what I set out to. I came here with the target of winning the gold medal, I was sure that I would win the gold.” Lovlina admitted her strategy was ineffective against her Turkish opponent. “She was strong, and I knew she would fight aggressively. I felt that if played defensively then I would have to take more punches. I wanted to punch back as good as I got hit,” she said. Surmeneli, one bout away from fulfilling her promise to Turkey president Tayyip Erdogan of winning Olympic gold, said she gets her aggressive approach from coach Cahit Sume, a former Olympian. Be aggressive “My coach is the man who taught me to play aggressively. I feel I can prove myself by being aggressive and dancing in the ring is my signature,” she said. She added that she got some messages from Indian fans on Twitter , who told her not to defeat Lovlina.

All that changed on Wednesday as the 26-year-old won the 200m, his first global title and Canada’s first gold in 93 years in the event, shocking World champion and season-leader Noah Lyles. de Grasse had won the 200m silver, behind Usain Bolt, in Rio and had taken the 100m bronze in Tokyo and it looked like he would have to wait longer, for Lyles was in the front at 150m. But the Canadian produced a superb finish to triumph in a world-leading 19.62s. Americans Kenneth Bednarek (19.68) and Lyles (19.74) took silver and bronze. For the second successive day, there was a world record in the 400m hurdles. This time it was 21-year-old American Sydney McLaughlin who overtook defending champion Dalilah Muhammad in the final straight to better her record with 51.46s for gold with Dalilah (51.58) also coming under the previous record. Neeraj Chopra surprisingly topped the qualification round with his opening effort and entered the final even as some of the world’s top javelin throwers struggled for answers. The 23-year-old Asian Games champion’s 86.65 was way better than the automatic qualification standard (83.50m). German world leader Johannes Vetter, who had been consistent over 90m this year, was in danger of being eliminated at one stage after two 82m throws before making the cut with an 85.64m for the second spot. Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem (85.16m) was third, making him the first from his country to enter an Olympic final in athletics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/de-grasse-finally-nails-gold/article35735405.ece

Lovlina, a double Worlds bronze medallist, gave it her best shot before losing 0-5 in the bout thoroughly dominated by Surmeneli. Third Indian After Vijender Singh (2008) and M.C. Mary Kom (2012), the 23-year-old Assam woman has become the third Indian boxer to claim an Olympics bronze. Boxing with confidence, Surmeneli landed clean, powerful and accurate combinations on Lovlina’s head to take the early advantage. The taller Indian, who received a standing count, replied with some well-directed counters but lost the first round 0-5. The Turkish boxer continued to attack with the same intensity even as Lovlina delivered some body shots and right hooks in the second. The Indian, who was served a warning, felt the fury of Surmeneli’s punches. Though the Turkish boxer continued to land solid blows on target, Lovlina fought on bravely and lasted the course despite receiving another standing count. Surmeneli won the last two rounds, like she did the first, to book a spot in the final.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lovlinas-remarkable-journey-ends-with-a-bronze-medal/article35735407.ece

05 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||There are many more laurels to come, says Sindhu||It was a complete effort with a lot of sacrifices by everyone involved in the journey in the last few years in search of the Tokyo Olympic medal, said P.V. Sindhu, who bagged a bronze in Tokyo, her second Olympic medal after the 2016 Rio silver. Special feeling “I am grateful to each and every team member who made me realise the dream of another Olympic medal. No doubt, the target was gold. “But, getting a bronze is also a special feeling for me given the backdrop of how the pandemic disrupted the whole world, especially our tournaments schedule,” Sindhu told the media at her residence on Wednesday. “I must thank my coach (Park Tae Sang, who was with her at the briefing) for the kind of sacrifices he has made by missing his family for almost a year since he joined me,” she said. “It is a dream come true for all of us, including the sparring partners from Suchitra Academy, the two gentlemen Praveen Raju and Pradeep Raju from that Academy, fitness trainer Srikanth Verma and physio Evangeline,” Sindhu said. “Well, when my fitness trainer says that I could withstand the training load without any complaints, I must remind myself that unless we put in that kind of effort we cannot be in this position (with an Olympic medal). This is just the beginning and there are many more laurels to come in the run-up to the Paris Olympics,” she said. Planning and effort “It has been a really tough year in the run-up to the Olympics. And, this bronze medal would not have been possible but for so much planning and effort,” she said. “Well, if I keep playing well and winning tournaments, then the World No.1 can also be a certainty. The preparations for 2024 Paris Olympics will begin after a short break as the ultimate goal is to win gold there,” a smiling Sindhu said. “I will continue to train at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium,” she added. Korean coach Park said Sindhu’s bronze was the most unforgettable moment of his life. “This being my first Olympic medal as a coach, I cherish every bit of it. Come on, Sindhu let us start training from tomorrow to get the gold in Paris,” he said with a big smile. “The pandemic proved to be very tough for athletes too. We were patient right through and really worked hard,” Park said. Sindhu’s fitness trainer at Suchitra Academy, Srikanth said the training programme for the shuttler was a real torture and any other athlete would have given up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/there-are-many-more-laurels-to-come-says-sindhu/article35735109.ece
05 August 2021||Chennai,||Siddharth, Gandhi shine||The match ‘turning’ performance arrived at the beginning of the contest. Lanky left-arm spinner M. Siddharth’s telling strikes — he finished with four for 20 — in the first seven overs derailed Siechem Madurai Panthers’ innings. Chasing just 125, Chepauk Super Gillies was home in 19th over losing five wickets in this TNPL clash at Chepauk on Wednesday. Early wicket The side lost N. Jagadeesan early; he attempted to boost the side’s run-rate. Subsequently, Super Gillies promoted the left-handed Sai Kishore. Captain Kaushik Gandhi, compact and busy, played some attractive shots during his 50-ball 64, timing the ball through the gaps. Possessing pacey slinger R. Silambarasan and left-arm seamer V. Gowtham, a young paceman with speed and a future, Madurai could have created pressure had it not dropped catches. Earlier, after Madurai opted to bat, Siddharth impressed. Bowling with control, altering pace and using the crease, Siddharth’s influential four successive overs — three of them in the PowerPlay — snuffed out Madurai’s hopes. Siddharth bowled opener P. Praveen Kumar with an arm ball that fizzed off the pitch. If a left-arm spinner has this delivery, then he is someone with potential. And among his victims was the experienced K.B. Arun Karthik who perished attempting to sweep a delivery that held its line. Skipper N.S. Chaturved’s fighting 50-ball 70 meant the Madurai outfit managed a recovery of sorts; it finished at 124 for nine. Chaturved is a well-organised batsman with footwork and balance. He cut and drove well and a back-foot punch piercing the off-side field off Sonu Yadav was a gem. However, he injured his shoulder during his batting stint and J. Kousik led the side. Sandeep Warrier seemed to be struggling with a sore knee. Considering the paceman’s workload for Tamil Nadu, he needs to be handled with care. Left-arm spinner Sai Kishore, struggled for rhythm. In fact, Super Gillies fielded three left-spinners and the third spinner of this variety, R. Alexander, bowled tidily. Frayed tempers were on view during the chase and the umpires spoke to Kousik and Arun Karthick.  The scores: Siechem Madurai Panthers 124/9 in 20 overs (N.S. Chaturved 70, M. Siddharth 4/20, Sonu Yadav 2/18) lost to Chepauk Super Gillies 125/5 in 18.5 overs (Kaushik Gandhi 64) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/siddharth-gandhi-shine/article35735491.ece
05 August 2021||The Hague,||van Gaal set to coach the Netherlands||Dutchman Louis van Gaal will return for a third time as the national football coach, leading the team to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the Dutch football federation (KNVB) said on Wednesday. The appointment of the 69-year-old, dubbed the “Iron Tulip”, comes after the resignation of Frank de Boer in June after the Netherlands’ dismal last-16 exit from Euro 2020. van Gaal, whose last major job was at Manchester United, previously managed the Oranje between 2000-2002 and 2012-2014, when they finished third at the World Cup in Brazil. “Dutch football has always been close to my heart and national coaching is in my view a key position for the further advancement of our football. “Moreover, I consider it an honour to coach the Dutch national team,” van Gaal said in a statement released by the KNVB. His technical staff will consist of assistants Danny Blind and Henk Fraser, and goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, the KNVB said. Exceptional qualities The Dutch federation said it had been looking for a coach with “exceptional qualities” to turn the ship around with a “minimal preparation period” for the World Cup. During van Gaal’s first spell as manager the Dutch failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, but the Netherlands finished third in Brazil in 2014 during his second stint. He then went on to take up a coaching job with Manchester United, but was unceremoniously axed by the club two days after winning the FA Cup in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/van-gaal-set-to-coach-the-netherlands/article35735578.ece
05 August 2021||Tokyo,||Ondra — yelling his way to the top||Weightlifters are among the most vocal athletes at the Olympics, letting out screams as they lock out at the top of a lift: “ahhhhhh!” Tennis players have long been known to be grunters, usually with some form of “ha-uh!” or “ha-ooah!” The loudest vocalisations of the Tokyo Games may come from the grounds in one of the Olympic programme’s newest sports. Adam Ondra is widely considered the best climber in the world and a gold medal favourite in sport climbing’s Olympic debut. He’s also a bit of a yeller. “It might sound bad, but it helps me,” Ondra said. “The shrieking comes when I’m at my absolute limit,” Ondra said. Some scientific studies say he may be right. Whatever it is, it’s hard to argue with the results. Ondra has become the rock star of rock climbing, a long-limbed, long-necked Czech who moves up sheer faces like a spider across a web. The 28-year-old has tackled more of the world’s most difficult climbs than anyone, scaling routes with names like Silence, Change and Pure Imagination — ascensions that leave even above-average climbers standing on the ground shaking their heads no. Ondra also is arguably the world’s best indoor climber, winning four World championships and finishing in the top three seven other times. He may be the loudest, too. As Ondra’s celebrity has risen with his climbs up rock walls, his audible exaltations have become part of popular culture, turned into ringtones, GIFs and mashups with songs. A compilation of his screams has been mixed with metal music and another person inserted his shrieks into Taylor Swift’s “ I Knew You Were Trouble.” “If I’m focused on a certain move and I scream, I know I’m 100% breathing out,” he said. Ondra is onto something in that aspect. Tennis players have been grunting for years to add power and rhythm to their strokes. Screaming, shrieking and grunting has infiltrated other sports as athletes try to find any extra edge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ondra-yelling-his-way-to-the-top/article35735580.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ayonika Paul clinches top spot with narrow win||Olympian and World Championship finalist Ayonika Paul shot 249.8 to pip Ayushi Podder by a half point to the top spot in women’s air rifle in the second National shooting selection trials at the Dr. Karni Singh Range.

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||TTFI to issue show cause notice to Manika||Taking a serious view of Manika Batra’s refusal to be guided by National coach Soumyadeep Roy during her singles matches in Tokyo Olympics, the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has decided to issue a show-cause notice to her. The unanimous decision was taken by the TTFI’s Executive Board meeting on Wednesday. The virtual meeting, chaired by the TTFI’s senior vice-president Rajeev Bodas, was also briefly attended by Haryana’s Deputy Chief Minister and the TTFI president, Dushyant Chautala.  According to the TTFI secretary Arun Banerjee, “What happened in Tokyo was a serious act of indiscipline. When Manika left for Tokyo her personal coach (Sanmay Paranjpe) carried an accreditation card which limited his access to the practice area. Soon after her arrival in Tokyo, Manika demanded that Paranjpe’s accreditation be upgraded to enable him to access the Field of Play. “In spite of the best efforts of the Indian Olympic Association officials, the Organising Committee went by the International Olympic Committee norms and declined to upgrade any accreditation. “The Board members felt that if at all Manika wanted to show her displeasure, rejecting the services of the national coach for her singles matches was no way to do it,” he said. It may be recalled that Manika justified her demand by saying Soumaydeep Roy was the personal coach of the other Indian entry in the women’s singles, Sutirtha Mukherjee and hence her personal coach be allowed access to the Field of Play for her singles matches. “Soumyadeep was in Tokyo as the coach of the Indian team, and not as Sutirtha’s coach,” clarified Banerjee. The show cause is likely to be issued on Thursday and Manika will have 10 days to respond. Cracking the whip, the TTFI also decided to make it mandatory for all selected players, coaches and officials to attend all National camps. Ahead of the Tokyo Games, the TTFI organised a National camp (from June 17 to July 10) which was attended by Sharath Kamal and Surtitha at Sonepat. G. Sathiyan stayed away, preferring to train with his personal coach S. Raman in Chennai. Manika attended the first three days before returning to Pune. “No personal coach, sparring partners, support staff, etc. will be allowed in the camp. Medical certificates, if any, issued by only TTFI certified doctors would be valid. “If a player chooses to stay away, he or she will not be considered for selection to participate in the event for which the camp is being held,” explained Banerjee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ttfi-to-issue-show-cause-notice-to-manika/article35735436.ece

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||More hiccups than cheers||The kitchen of Middle of Nowhere was frantic with activity. Staff at the recently launched bar in Mogappair checked expiry dates on meat, cheese and perishables, even as they energetically wiped down tables and sterilised equipment. One would think they were getting set to open a restaurant. But, this was in preparation to shut down. Middle of Nowhere, along with a clutch of other optimistic bars, launched early this year, only to close down almost immediately after opening night. As the second wave of COVID-19 battered Chennai, an intense lockdown was announced in May. “At that point we did not know how long we would be shut for,” says Arasu Dennis, consultant for Middle of Nowhere, and other popular city bars including The Living Room (Anna Nagar), Off The Record, BOATS, and Fat Monkey. Living Room ran for four months and Middle Of Nowhere for a month before the lockdown. Reopening after a lockdown is as tough as a launch, says Arasu, stating, “All your investments are dead.” He adds, “It affects stock, food gets wasted, and we need to service the air-conditioning and other equipment before opening.” Given his association with multiple bar launches in the city, Arasu has almost mastered the skill of shutting down and reopening ever since the first lockdown in March 2020. “You have to learn to adapt if you want to survive,” he adds. Which could explain why, despite the repeated drill of launch, close, reopen and the challenges of operating during a pandemic, a slew of new bars and restaurants have opened across the country. The scene is no different in Chennai, with restaurateurs fearlessly going ahead with pandemic babies. “If anything, launching in times of COVID-19 has equipped us to be better prepared for all situations,” says Madhulika Umashankar of Down Sterling. The charming 75-year-old bungalow on Sterling Road that is now a resto bar, opened late March this year. While most businesses have tried to put on a brave face, the recent, temporary ban on serving alcohol by the Tamil Nadu Government has been an added disadvantage for bars, pubs and restaurants. As they wait on tenterhooks for further updates from the Government, Arasu says the no-liquor order has led pubs and restobars to rework their game plan, and focus more on food. For example, he says, Middle of Nowhere was not doing delivery when they went into lockdown. But now, bracing for a possible third wave, they are all set to deliver to clients. Since bars primarily depend on the sale of liquor for their profits, menus normally list 90% alcohol and only 10% non alcoholic beverages. Now, bartenders are concocting more mocktails to keep afloat. “Mocktails have gone up by 30% in most places,” observes Arasu. Bars are expensive business, he says, adding that even rentals are 50% more for bars than restaurants. “We are making 30% of what we used to make pre-pandemic,” says Arasu. A few businesses have decided to remain shut till liquor can be served again. The much-awaited Monkey Bar, which finally opened in Chennai this April, functioned for around three weeks before stopping operations. As patrons pored over its exhaustive online menu created by Chef Manu Chandra, and shortlisted what to order, they were disappointed to learn that the gastro pub is not even doing delivery. “Delivery alone can never keep a restaurant our size afloat. With aggregators taking commission, our margins are thin,” says Chetan Rampal, partner Monkey Bar Chennai (Olive group of restaurants), over a call from Mumbai. Delivery also means the kitchen has to be fully stocked and the entire menu made available, he adds. There is more to it. If the pub is functioning, then a percentage of the revenue goes towards the landlord. But with the whole setup closed, Monkey Bar is saving on rent, says Chetan, adding that Chennai has given them a rent break. It is a different story in their other branches in other cities, as each State Government has their own set of rules. Their operations remain closed in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Mumbai allows liquor to be served only on weekdays and till 4 pm. In Kolkata they are open till 8 pm, and in Delhi till 10 pm. At the end of the day, says Chetan, “There are a lot of people dependent on us: right from our staff of 70-80 to small vendors like the one who supplies us with flowers or the person who brings us eggs. Where do they go?” The waiting game For most businesses, waiting for a return to the old normal, or even an approximation of it, is not an option. Many of 2021’s openings were planned in 2019, and restaurateurs need to pay rent, regardless of lockdowns. Add staff salaries and other overheads, and the costs can be crushing, which is also why this year has seen many closures. Sin & Tonic in T Nagar got tired of playing the waiting game and decided to take the plunge. The 300-seater resto bar, earlier slated to open in May 2020, finally launched in March this year. “There were too many things to follow up on,” says Swati Chauhan, partner and co-founder of Sin & Tonic. “Our manpower had left, including staff we had trained over months, so we had to hire again. Tastings did not go as planned, and crockery we had ordered had to be cancelled.” Getting ready to open again after the second wave entailed a rigmarole of pest control, sanitisation and kitchen maintenance. “Lot of expense and no revenue,” says Swati, adding, “My kitchen team is from up North. With each State having different restrictions, gathering them back here is a big task,” she says. Right now, the 8,000-plus square feet space is operating with 50% staff. “We are taking in only about 75 to 100 people. Since we are not serving alcohol at the moment, it’s nice to see families coming and dining with us. Some of the kids are so excited to be in a place like this that they run around the outdoor area and take pictures,” laughs Swati. “It is also demotivating for the owners, promoters and staff to look at an empty space minus its clients,” says Swati, explaining why, despite all odds, a host of bars went live as soon as training, stock and licenses fell into place, hoping to make the most of the situation. Bay 6 in Akkarai, started with a similar mindset. “We opened in December last year as we wanted to cash in on Christmas and New Years,” says co-owner Bharath Raju. “Things would have been way better if not for COVID-19 but I have nothing to complain about,” he adds, visibly pleased with the customers his beach facing property is drawing. “It’s open air with a lawn so people don’t have to worry about being seated in closed air-conditioned spaces. The lower deck is family friendly, so a lot of kids come along,” he says. A cafe for pet lovers and their fur babies is underway as well: he is going in, all guns blazing. The same can be said about Hari Chandran and Lakshmana Perumal, who launched their ambitious four-storey project The Thief on Kodambakkam High Road. Painstakingly curated with installations and pictures of digital and hand-painted art, this resto bar features different themes for each of its floors. “We haven’t scrimped on anything be it the decor or the menu which features Thai, Japanese, Italian... We are known for our lobsters, jumbo prawns and crabs that come from Rameshwaram,” says Hari. The Thief opened in April and could function for only three days before the lockdown. “Even when it was closed we made sure some of the staff came in and cleaned the place. We did not want it to smell musty when it opened again,” says Hari. The team worked on this project for a year and a half and had earlier planned to set up in December 2020. They started operating at the first chance they got. “It made no sense to wait any longer because no one knows how long the pandemic is going to go on for,” he says, adding “We have to adapt.”  For now, order mocktails Middle of Nowhere,Mogappair,9677140625  The Thief,Kodambakkam High Road,9176374187  Down Sterling,Sterling Road,9383893838   Sin & Tonic,T Nagar,8110955055  Bay 6,Akkarai,7770066662   The Living Room,Anna Nagar East,9841701506||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/more-hiccups-than-cheers/article35735330.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||An ode to a war hero||It has been 22 years since Kargil War hero Captain Vikram Batra was killed in action while fighting for the nation. His actions on the battefield inspired the Indian Army to victory and he went on to become a household name across the country. After the war against Pakistan, Batra, who was just 24 when he succumbed to enemy fire, was posthumously honoured with the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military award for distinguished acts of valour during wartime. Now, an ode to his indomitable spirit and courage comes to life with the film Shershaah , along with a hitherto unseen look into Batra’s relationship with his girlfriend and fiancee, Dimple Cheema. Tamil director Vishnuvardhan (of Billa fame) makes his Hindi debut with the film, set to premiere next week. Starring Bollywood hotshots Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani, the biopic, which is being touted as the first Indian film to have been shot in the Kargil War terrain, promises an emotional, patriotic look at the Indian Army officer’s life, flamboyant personality, and his ultimately doomed love story. Excerpts from an interview: Captain Vikram Batra is a legend, but he also seems to have been a larger-than-life character in real life. How do you represent someone like him?  Sidharth: You are absolutely right. Going through Captain Vikram’s book or the stuff written about him, you find that he was an extremely ‘filmy’ person, for lack of a better word. I was fortunate that the first person I met was his twin brother. Who better than him to tell me about Capt Vikram? Of course, I met his parents, his family, and chatted with his comrades who were in the battlefield. That is where the idea of what he would be like started from because there is so much already written about him in the public domain. We had Army personnel training me and the rest of the cast, and helping us shoot in the Kargil terrain. I think our action pieces look slightly fresh, because we are the first Hindi film to shoot in Kargil. Kiara, this is your second biopic after the M.S. Dhoni film. Is there a sense of apprehension when you play a living character? When you are playing a real-life character, their feedback is the most important. I saw M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story with Sakshi Dhoni and was lucky to get her feedback. I hope the same happens with Dimple with Shershaah . Portraying someone real comes with its own set of challenges, and a certain responsibility. But as an actor, we are given the source material and we try to be as honest as possible to the emotion and personality we are playing. Vishnuvardhan is known for commercial blockbusters such as Billa and Arrambam in Tamil. Now he makes his Bollywood debut with Shershaah ...  Sidharth: I had earlier seen one of Vishnu’s commercial films, Billa . After we connected, I saw some of his other films too. Shershaah has been through an odd journey, from when I first heard it years ago, with a completely different team attached. But after all the changes, once Vishnu came on board, his energy was so enthusiastic and he was eager to be part of this film. Full marks to Vishnu and our cameraman Kamaljeet Negi for giving it a very real and raw feel, and shooting with a minimal setup on top of that mountain, be it wind, rain or any kind of difficulty.  Kiara: He is such an amazing person to be around, and knows exactly how to get you into the zone. The fun scenes between Sidharth and I, and the banter between us comes across as so real because he just let us be. Even though he is Tamil, he really nailed the Punjabi accent and dialect in the film. He still calls me ‘Dimple’ and I love it ( laughs ). Shershaah premieres on Amazon Prime Video on August 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-ode-to-a-war-hero/article35735300.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Women of the uprising||A few years after her heroic death, folk memory — in the form of songs and poems — waxed eloquent of Rani Lakshmibai’s valour in the battlefield. At the same time, stories of her alleged “intemperance” spread far and wide, with the British calling her sexually promiscuous, a liquor addict with a violent temper. In sharp contrast to this stands Begum Hazrat Mahal’s absence in public memory or recollection. These are two women who never met each other, but led similar lives, with a common goal: to overthrow British rule in India. While one has been hailed a nationalist icon, the other remains shadowed in forgotten accounts. Right from their eventual rise during a pivotal moment of India’s colonial history — the Revolt of 1857 — to their heroic yet poignant deaths, author Rudrangshu Mukherjee’s latest non-fiction work, A Begum & A Rani — Hazrat Mahal and Lakshmibai in 1857 , (published by Penguin), captures what makes them feminist icons. Mukherjee has been researching the 1857 uprising for nearly 45 years and this is his sixth book on the subject. His area of research was largely on Awadh and Kanpur, but this time, he decided to shift his focus to Jhansi. “I noticed the contrast — Lakshmibai was treated as a nationalist icon, whereas Hazrat Mahal, also a woman leader of the rebellion in Awadh, was relatively a forgotten figure,” speaks Mukherjee of the inception of the book. The seed has been in Mukherjee’s mind for at least five to six years. “It was when I became housebound, with all this archival work here with me, that I decided to give it a structure,” he recalls, adding that he started writing in February 2020. Through the narrative, he examines this anomaly and at the same time highlights the achievements of these two remarkable women, who fought tooth-and-nail not only against the British, but also the oppressive, patriarchal norms that plagued mid-19th Century India. Chronologically, their stories run parallel but the trajectories are different, says Mukherjee. The first contrast that struck him was that Lakshmibai was a late entrant in the uprising of 1857. “She didn’t turn a rebel till January or February of 1858. But Hazrat Mahal was a rebel since the uprising was taking place in Lucknow, end of May/early June 1857. The second contrast that is equally intriguing is that Lakshmibai died on the battlefield, fighting. Meanwhile, there is no sighting of Hazrat Mahal even though we know that she was sending directions as a general. Unlike Lakshmibai, she fled to Nepal where she died in penury and obscurity,” says Mukherjee. He asks questions on whether the manner in which both died has anything to do with their differing popularity. “The other suggestion I make is that one was an upper-caste queen, from a royal family whereas Hazrat Mahal was a slave’s daughter who caught the fancy of the king of Awadh. She becomes somebody only when her 12-year-old son is put on the throne by the rebels.” The different social standing, Mukherjee believes, had an impact on the way people saw these women. Largely pinned on years of archival research, the narrative of A Begum & A Rani takes on a different hue towards the end, as Mukherjee meditates on their afterlives by analysing public memory. “I see history as an exercise in retrieval of the aspects of the past. The more aspects we retrieve, the richer our understanding of history becomes,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/women-of-the-uprising/article35735346.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||T-Rex on a pearl hunt||About 110 million years ago, the Irritator moved through the coastal lagoons of Brazil. We do not know exactly how it annoyed palaeontologists to earn that name, but what we do know is that it has earned itself a place in a coastal town again — that of Mamallapuram. The Irritator, with the short-handed T Rex, the teethy Velociraptor and other giant reptiles are the denizens of Dinosaur Museum, the latest addition to India Seashell Museum on ECR. The park, opened last month, features 14 mechanical models fitted with sensors that prompt them to swish their tails, raise their necks, and roar every time a visitor moves past them. “Families want entertainment. We added the Dinosaur Museum for children so that they don’t get bored as their parents stroll through the seashell museum,” says Mohamed Riswan, proprietor of the India Seashell Museum. The Dinosaur Museum isn’t the only addition — over the years, the seashell museum has expanded to accommodate a pearl museum, set up in 2018, and a mineral museum, which was set up last year but owing to the pandemic, could only open this year, after the lockdowns were relaxed. The collection belongs to Riswan’s father, Raja Mohamed, a fish merchant from Rameswaram who set up the museum in 2012. “For 38 years, my father has been collecting seashells, pearls and minerals,” says Riswan. But the idea of a mineral museum struck Raja only after a visit to Singapore. “When my father saw the Merlion, he wanted to recreate it with seashells,” says Riswan. And so, a giant Merlion, made of 25,000 seashells stands outside the mineral museum, flanked by a shell chandelier, shell tree and shell bouquet. The space is decorated in blues and greens to simulate the underwater world. A tunnel-like room leads us to the mineral collection — behind glass panels are onyx, amethyst, quartz, moonstones, topaz, jasper and jade, all polished and shaped into orbs. From here, our guide, Syed Salim, takes us to the pearl museum, rattling off at full speed the names of oysters that hold pearls inside them. “The colour of the pearl depends on the colour of the lips of the oyster,” he says, before explaining how pearls are formed. “When a foreign body enters a mollusc’s mantle, it forms a sac around it. Layers and layers of secretion around it creates a pearl.” Which is why pearls are not always in the circular shape we know them to be, but appear as coins, claws, nuggets, peanuts, crescents — including one particularly unfortunate fish that has been encrusted into a pearl. Riswan shares how his father collected these pearls and shells. “My father grew up in Rameshwaram, in a coastal hamlet. He started as a fish merchant at the age of 19. He would walk across the seashore, collect shells and sell them in markets. Once he started earning money as a fish merchant through exports, he used that money to invest in his hobby of collecting shells.” Seashell museums are popular world over, however environmentalists have concerns over their mass collection. “Seashells feed the beaches — they have a function in the ecosystem, so their hardcore collection from one strip would be invasive,” points out naturalist M Yuvan. “Collection shouldn’t be for collection’s sake, but to facilitate a deeper understanding about what lives on the beach.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/t-rex-on-a-pearl-hunt/article35735313.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Trees need check-ups too||Everybody loves a Gulmohar. Its fiery flowers command stretches of cityscaped horizon, and are often mistaken by the average morning walker for the flame of the forest — the fleshier, more distinctive blossoms of the Palash. And yet, for all their similarities of hue, there are enough differences between the two to keep five earnest children busy all morning. Masks on, forms out, pens at the ready, the middle-schoolers were out on their maiden tree survey, encouraged and guided by city-based friends of trees initiative Nizhal. They stopped at each tree down their street — Ormes Road — and repeated the same ritual of calculations that have been followed by groups across different Chennai neighbourhoods over the past two months. “The tree survey is being conducted all over the city. So far, we have had about 80 participants from Kilpauk, Nungambakkam, RA Puram, Mugalivakkam, Vepery and Thiruvanmiyur, to name a few,” says Avni Mohindra, Nizhal member and a programme coordinator for the survey. “We encourage participants to start with surveying trees on their street first, then take on more streets in their neighbourhood,” she adds. Though now meant as a way to make Chennaiites feel more involved with,the Nature around them, after a year of staying indoors, the idea of such surveys is not new to the city. “Our first tree survey was back in 2007,” says Shobha Menon, founder of Nizhal. “Now, the idea is to make an inventory of all trees in the city, and encourage planting of native trees. So, this time, we want to do it in neighbourhoods around Chennai, and get residents involved.” She adds that Nizhal hopes to build enough of a database to eventually create a GIS (Geographic Information System) survey of the city’s trees, with information visible by location on online maps. That, however, is the far-flung future plan: the immediate one is to increase awareness among participants. To that end, back on Ormes Road, the young gang of five meticulousl filled up rows of data per tree. They noted its species, estimated its age and its health, measured its height, canopy (in metres) and trunk circumference. Under “comments”, they noted whether or not it had been pruned, and how. They checked for symptoms of common tree diseases, as per a list provided by Nizhal. Most importantly, they checked it for five specific kinds of tree abuse: nails or cables, rubbish, injury by careless chopping, choking by paving, and surprisingly enough, tree guards. Meant to protect saplings, tree guards can deter growth when not removed from around a maturing tree, explains Shobha. Avni adds, “Tree abuse was something they were not aware of before participating in the survey.” Indeed, the information the children gained went far beyond the 10 trees they managed to survey that day. Says Avni: “One of the key learnings was identifying names of trees which they were not aware of previously. Another was the presence of a large number of exotic species like Gulmohar, Raintree, Copperpod in comparison to native tree species.” While Gulmohar was categorised as exotic, the Palash — had they found one — would have been a victory, as the sighting of a native species of tree. There were other little victories, however, in the form of a marked change in attitude. As Avni observes, “Some of the children noticed the biodiversity more closely like bees, birds, butterflies and they are motivated to set up bird baths in their street for their bird friends. This is the kind of impact we would like on our participants after the survey.”  Nizhal coordinates its tree surveys through a WhatsApp group.

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||All about romance||Modern Love, based on the eponymous The New York Times column explored different shades of love in New York. The first season written and directed by John Carney featured a bunch of A-listers including Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, Andy García, Dev Patel and John Slattery. Season 2, which streams from August 13, has its share of stars from Tom Burke and Minnie Driver to Kit Harington and Tobias Menzies. The right choice “It feels like you will find the right actor for the right job in this show,” Carney, who reprises his writer-director duties for Season 2, says over a video call. “It is half an hour of their time. If the actress is free, she comes and plays for a week and a half. While it is not a huge amount of money or prestige, they feel like ‘I connected with that script and got to make these cool episodes’. There is no more commitment and that is attractive to some actors in certain phases of their careers.” Carney enjoys the show’s half-hour format. “I find that challenging. I am getting a little tired of TV going on and on with long shows that require you to watch everything in order. You can dip in to Modern Love at any stage in the series.” Modern Love is a weekly column, which started in 2004. It is also a book, a podcast and a show. Picking articles that would work as television from 17 years of content is a mammoth ask. “There are two kinds of criteria that I look for. The first is a personal connection with the piece. That can be a dimension of a character, a relationship or a friendship that hits me,” says Carney. He adds, “The second is when I am struck by something about a particular essay as a filmmaker. I could imagine things in a scene playing well. Or I could imagine, directing five things that would be fun, challenging and interesting. I don’t usually go ‘Oh I love that essay so therefore I love that piece of TV’. That is not the way it works. We have actually found that often the best essays should remain written. I have struggled often to shoehorn an essay that I love into a half-an-hour screenplay that has not worked.” About time Though the show is calledModern Love, Carney says, love is timeless. “Obviously the circumstances in which we find ourselves, with cell phones, iPads and computers affect our expectations of love. At the end of the day, what we looked for in these stories is less about being super-current and more about being romantically truthful, regardless of geography.” Modern Love Season 2 streams on Amazon Prime Video from August 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/all-about-romance/article35735302.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Conquering waves||Fans of The Covelong Point Surf, Music and Yoga Festival might have to wait a year or two before the popular carnival by the beach makes a comeback. But serious surfing enthusiasts have no time to waste as Covelong Classic at Surf Turf kicks off next week. Taking place between August 9 and 11, the Indian National Surf and SUP Championship 2021, will see best surfers from around the country in participation. “It is a Surfing Federation of India event. We are trying to do it differently this time by following the World Surfing League format,” says Arun Vasu, president of Surfing Federation of India, partner Surf Turf and one of the sponsors for the event. The idea is to get more serious now that surfing is part of the Olympics as well, he says. The older events had about 200 surfers and various categories like U-17 and Masters because the idea was to encourage people to come out and surf. “Now we want the best of the best and we want to strengthen them so they win more competitions abroad,” adds Arun. For the upcoming competition, there are 60 participants so far, registered from Covelong, Puducherry, Rameshwaram, Mamallapuram, Mangaluru, Goa and parts of Kerala among others. Given the pandemic-related restrictions, the event will focus only on national participation. Unfortunately, it is also not open to spectators this year. Categories include Boys — Under 15 and Girls — Under 15, and Open categories for both, for ages 16 and above. For stand up paddling, the distance is six kilometres for men and two or three kilometres for women. Winners will get Rs. 40,000. There are also prizes for the top five finishers. “We are going to have a talent watch and identify two to three new surfers. The SFI will take them on and train them,” says Vasu. Post that they will get to participate in the Asian Surfing Circuit that takes place in Bali, and countries like the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Japan. The best from that lot will then qualify for the next level which is the World Surfing League.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/conquering-waves/article35735319.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The frog who saved a forest||In a corner of a sprawling cardamom plantation at Pothamedu in Munnar, a small but inspiring story unfolds. A critically endangered frog species, theRacophorus pseudomalabaricusor Anaimalai flying frog, is getting a new home. Naturalist, frog enthusiast and Kerala Tourism guide Hadlee Renjith, who leads herping tours in Munnar, constructed two ponds at Windermere Estate to restore the habitat for the Anaimalai flying frog. He struck upon the idea on one of his photography tours at the 60-acre property, when he caught a glimpse of the frog in a cement tank previously used for irrigation. Hadlee sought support from the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), which took it up as its first rapid action project for amphibian conservation and offered to fund it. Fortunately, the plantation owners readily agreed, demarcating an area, which they pledged to leave undisturbed. “Trees and the undergrowth in a cardamom plantation offer the perfect environment for these frogs to hibernate,” says Hadlee. “Everything they need for survival — trees, rain and a water pool — are right here, so we can re-create a favourable ecosystem.” Endemic to the southern part of the Western Ghats, the numbers of these frogs have declined rapidly due to the loss of habitat. When the grasslands of Munnar were converted to tea plantations, some of the Shola forests became cardamom plantations. Munnar has an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 hectares under cardamom cultivation, and while trees are protected, undergrowth is usually cleared leading to the habitat loss of several frog and reptile species. Hadlee set to work with two friends, his wife and daughter, digging the earth for ponds. The bigger pond is about 10-feet-long, three-feet wide and 2.5-feet deep. They lined these with jute sacks and tarpaulin to hold water through the dry period. They then added pebbles and planted vegetation to create natural hiding spots for the frogs. “We created awareness among the plantation supervisors to refrain from clearing undergrowth just before harvesting cardamom,” adds Hadlee, who is working on a field guide on frogs in Munnar, for which 30 species have been identified. The project has helped dispel myths surrounding the frog. “There is a popular misconception that these frogs feed on the cardamom pods. They don’t feed on the pods; they feed on insects and other pests instead,” says Simon John, owner of the Windermere Estate, where naturalists take guests on herping tours. Hadlee is pleased that his first attempt at conservation has yielded results. “I spotted seven tadpoles in one of the ponds. And this means there could be more.”  Know your frog Also known as the False Malabar Gliding Frog, this species is usually larger than bush frogs: the female can grow up to three inches. Mating takes place usually between June and October, during the rainy season. The female creates foam nests on leaves, into which the eggs are laid and the male fertilises them. The outer layer of foam protects the eggs from bacteria, predators and weather changes. When the eggs hatch, the nest disintegrates and tadpoles drop into the water body below.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-frog-who-saved-a-forest/article35735349.ece

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Come,||Total Gaming’s YouTube channel puts a 33-second countdown for Garena Free Fire (a battle royale multiplayer shooter game) live session. On the live chatbox, more than a hundred messages cascade within this half a minute. Channel owner Ajay (known as Ajjubhai in the gaming world), welcomes his fast-increasing audience, reads out the sponsor’s name and gets down to business. In the four-hour-25-minute livestream, he makes silly jokes, replies to a few messages, gives shout-outs for Super Chat (a feature wherein viewers pay to highlight their message in the chatbox) and sings, as his characters roam, shoot, jump and dive. The stream, within two days, gets two million views on YouTube. Ajjubhai is a superstar streamer. He started in October 2018, with just four people watching his videos. Today, Total Gaming channel has over 26 million subscribers and its videos have been watched over four billion times. Ajjubhai, who featured in YouTube’s list of top live streamers for 2020, also owns an eSports team. But this isn’t just about Ajjubhai. This is the story of Indian streamers like him who thrive in the global gaming industry, which generates US$159 billion a year in revenue (according to Newzoo, a gaming analytics company) — to put this in perspective, Qatar’s annual GDP in 2020 was US$146 billion. Going by YouTube’s numbers, there has never been a better time for a streamer than last year. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced people to stay indoors, crowds for game-streaming surged. Last year saw 100 billion watch time hours, over 40 million active gaming channels, and more than 80,000 YouTube Gaming creators hitting 1,00,000 subscribers. Show me the money The bulk of streamers’ revenue comes from three main sources: ads on YouTube, features such as Super Chats and Super Stickers, and sponsorship or brand deals. It is significantly more than what Hari Raman, a young doctor from Purushanur, a hamlet in Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram district, earns through his job at Villupuram Medical College. Hari’s YouTube channel, PVS Gaming, has close to two million subscribers. He started the channel in 2018 while pursuing his MBBS at a college in North India. “Because I couldn’t speak Hindi very well, I didn’t have a lot of friends at college. Streaming games in Tamil got me a lot of people to interact with online,” he says. His subscribers grew almost exponentially and the channel helped him meet his educational expenses, which, hitherto, was a challenge. Hari had to overcome odds to be a doctor. He recalls how his village would treat his humble roots with derision — “Why does a coolie’s son want to be a doctor?”, some would ask. He fulfilled his dream early this year, finishing MBBS. But gaming, he says, has given him a bigger identity. Hari can afford to give up his profession. But he won’t, because it is also his passion. Now, he dispenses medical advice during his streaming sessions. “There was a lot of hesitancy about taking the vaccine this year. I used to dispel the myths and misinformation,” he says. While YouTube still continues to be the most successful platform for game streaming in India, independent platforms such as Twitch, Rooter and Loco have seen ballooning audiences. These platforms serve as alternative sources of revenue for gamers, some of whom enter a contract with them for streaming. Imagine a pyramid with top, middle and bottom sections, each representing the three categories of gamers: star players with their own clout, up-and-coming gamers with significant following, and novices. Platforms such as Rooter, which has over 7.5 million active users of which 3.8 million come from their app, primarily target the bottom and middle parts that consist of a sizeable proportion of gamers. “YouTube is not going to support middle players because their algorithm throws them out of the system. These are gamers with potential to go big; we are giving equal opportunity irrespective of size,” says Piyush Kumar, CEO, Rooter. Selling their personality Live streaming sessions can go up to four or five hours. There are no time restrictions for streaming on Rooter, says Kumar. In fact, when Kumar got on a call with MetroPlus , a streaming had been on-going on for seven hours and still had over 1,200 followers. Rooter, especially, has been actively building its brand by signing contracts with star gamers like Gyan Gaming, who has 11 million subscribers on YouTube, and PVS Gaming, with the biggest subscriber base in South India. How do they hold their audience’s attention for so long? “It is, in a sense, a performance,” says Kaashvi Hiranandani, who owns YouTube channel Kaash Plays. She has the energy of a radio jockey in her streams. “In real life, I am a bit reserved. If a person I am close to offline watches my stream, they will be shocked,” she says, but reckons this change in personality is necessary: “People are investing two or three hours of their time in what I am doing. It is like a TV show for them. So, I try to be as entertaining as possible.” In a way, these streamers sell a personality — and, it needn’t always be theirs. Ajjubhai, for instance, does it without even revealing his face. “When a fellow YouTuber gamer revealed his face after a while, people turned up at his house, and college. Fans even called his parents. I get very uncomfortable with such attention,” he says. The regional connect Language seems to be an important determiner in gaining followers. Hari reckons audiences prefer regional languages over English. All the Indian streamers featured in YouTube’s list of top live streamers for 2020 speak Hindi in their videos. Kaashvi, who grew up in Singapore, used to stream in English initially. But, upon her audience’s request, she polished her Hindi, which significantly increased her subscribers. There are also streamers who use abusive language to draw followers, most of whom are adolescents. Scrutiny on such streamers increased in Tamil Nadu after the recent arrest of Madan Kumar Manikkam (known as Madan OP), after complaints about him hosting obscene conversations with minors and women. This incident, Hari says, got a bad rap for streamers in Tamil Nadu. “Even my parents asked me to reconsider gaming,” he adds, “But streamers like this are in the minority.” However, abuse cannot be prevented, especially when it comes from the audience. Kaashvi, as a female streamer, understands this better, explaining, “If I get 100 good comments, there will be 10 bad ones. And, some of them get really nasty. People know how to pick on one’s insecurities. I am fairly new to streaming, so it does bring me down.” Despite the challenges, she continues to stream because it is as lucrative as it is fun. Kaashvi works in finance, drawing “a mid-seven-figure salary” a year. But, she once made as much money in a month through streaming. She concludes, “It’s probably a dream job.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/come/article35735343.ece

05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||An ode to a war hero||It has been 22 years since Kargil War hero Captain Vikram Batra was killed in action while fighting for the nation. His actions on the battefield inspired the Indian Army to victory and he went on to become a household name across the country. After the war against Pakistan, Batra, who was just 24 when he succumbed to enemy fire, was posthumously honoured with the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military award for distinguished acts of valour during wartime. Now, an ode to his indomitable spirit and courage comes to life with the film Shershaah , along with a hitherto unseen look into Batra’s relationship with his girlfriend and fiancee, Dimple Cheema. Tamil director Vishnuvardhan (of Billa fame) makes his Hindi debut with the film, set to premiere next week. Starring Bollywood hotshots Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani, the biopic, which is being touted as the first Indian film to have been shot in the Kargil War terrain, promises an emotional, patriotic look at the Indian Army officer’s life, flamboyant personality, and his ultimately doomed love story. Excerpts from an interview: Captain Vikram Batra is a legend, but he also seems to have been a larger-than-life character in real life. How do you represent someone like him?  Sidharth: You are absolutely right. Going through Captain Vikram’s book or the stuff written about him, you find that he was an extremely ‘filmy’ person, for lack of a better word. I was fortunate that the first person I met was his twin brother. Who better than him to tell me about Capt. Vikram? Of course, I met his parents, his family, and chatted with his comrades who were in the battlefield. That is where the idea of what he would be like started from because there is so much already written about him in the public domain. We had Army personnel training me and the rest of the cast, and helping us shoot in the Kargil terrain. I think our action pieces look slightly fresh, because we are the first Hindi film to shoot in Kargil. Kiara, this is your second biopic after the M.S. Dhoni film. Is there a sense of apprehension when you play a living character? Kiara:When you are playing a real-life character, their feedback is the most important. I saw M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story with Sakshi Dhoni and was lucky to get her feedback. I hope the same happens with Dimple with Shershaah . Portraying someone real comes with its own set of challenges, and a certain responsibility. But as an actor, we are given the source material and we try to be as honest as possible to the emotion and personality we are playing. Vishnuvardhan is known for commercial blockbusters such as Billa and Arrambam in Tamil. Now he makes his Bollywood debut with Shershaah ...  Sidharth: I had earlier seen one of Vishnu’s commercial films, Billa . After we connected, I saw some of his other films too. Shershaah has been through an odd journey, from when I first heard it years ago, with a completely different team attached. But after all the changes, once Vishnu came on board, his energy was so enthusiastic and he was eager to be part of this film. Full marks to Vishnu and our cameraman Kamaljeet Negi for giving it a very real and raw feel, and shooting with a minimal setup on top of that mountain, be it wind, rain or any kind of difficulty.  Kiara: He is such an amazing person to be around, and knows exactly how to get you into the zone. The fun scenes between Sidharth and I, and the banter between us comes across as so real because he just let us be. Even though he is Tamil, he really nailed the Punjabi accent and dialect in the film. He still calls me ‘Dimple’ and I love it ( laughs ). Shershaah premieres on Amazon Prime Video on August 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-ode-to-a-war-hero/article35735813.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Women of the uprising||A few years after her heroic death, folk memory — in the form of songs and poems — waxed eloquent of Rani Lakshmibai’s valour in the battlefield. At the same time, stories of her alleged “intemperance” spread far and wide, with the British calling her sexually promiscuous, a liquor addict with a violent temper. In sharp contrast to this stands Begum Hazrat Mahal’s absence in public memory or recollection. These are two women who never met each other, but led similar lives, with a common goal: to overthrow British rule in India. While one has been hailed a nationalist icon, the other remains shadowed in forgotten accounts. Right from their eventual rise during a pivotal moment of India’s colonial history — the Revolt of 1857 — to their heroic yet poignant deaths, author Rudrangshu Mukherjee’s latest non-fiction work, A Begum & A Rani — Hazrat Mahal and Lakshmibai in 1857 , (published by Penguin), captures what makes them feminist icons. Mukherjee has been researching the 1857 uprising for nearly 45 years and this is his sixth book on the subject. His area of research was largely on Awadh and Kanpur, but this time, he decided to shift his focus to Jhansi. “I noticed the contrast — Lakshmibai was treated as a nationalist icon, whereas Hazrat Mahal, also a woman leader of the rebellion in Awadh, was relatively a forgotten figure,” says Mukherjee of the inception of the book. The seed had been in his mind for at least five to six years. “It was when I became housebound, with all this archival work here with me, that I decided to give it a structure,” he recalls, adding that he started writing in February 2020. Through the narrative, he examines this anomaly and at the same time highlights the achievements of these two remarkable women, who fought tooth-and-nail not only against the British, but also the oppressive, patriarchal norms that plagued mid-19th century India. Chronologically, their stories run parallel but the trajectories are different, says Mukherjee. The first contrast that struck him was that Lakshmibai was a late entrant in the uprising of 1857. “She didn’t turn a rebel till January or February of 1858. But Hazrat Mahal was a rebel since the uprising was taking place in Lucknow, end of May/early June 1857. The second contrast that is equally intriguing is that Lakshmibai died on the battlefield, fighting. Meanwhile, there is no sighting of Hazrat Mahal even though we know that she was sending directions as a general. Unlike Lakshmibai, she fled to Nepal where she died in penury and obscurity,” says Mukherjee. He asks questions on whether the manner in which both died has anything to do with their differing popularity. “The other suggestion I make is that one was an upper-caste queen, from a royal family whereas Hazrat Mahal was a slave’s daughter who caught the fancy of the king of Awadh. She becomes somebody only when her 12-year-old son is put on the throne by the rebels.” The different social standing, Mukherjee believes, had an impact on the way people saw these women. Largely pinned on years of archival research, the narrative of A Begum & A Rani takes on a different hue towards the end, as Mukherjee meditates on their afterlives by analysing public memory. “I see history as an exercise in retrieval of the aspects of the past. The more aspects we retrieve, the richer our understanding of history becomes,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/women-of-the-uprising/article35735923.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||T-Rex on a pearl hunt||About 110 million years ago, the Irritator moved through the coastal lagoons of Brazil. We do not know exactly how it annoyed palaeontologists to earn that name, but what we do know is that it has earned itself a place in a coastal town again — that of Mamallapuram. The Irritator, with the short-handed T Rex, the toothy Velociraptor and other giant reptiles are the denizens of Dinosaur Museum, the latest addition to India Seashell Museum on ECR. The park, opened last month, features 14 mechanical models fitted with sensors that prompt them to swish their tails, raise their necks, and roar every time a visitor moves past them. “Families want entertainment. We added the Dinosaur Museum for children so that they don’t get bored as their parents stroll through the seashell museum,” says Mohamed Riswan, proprietor of the India Seashell Museum. The Dinosaur Museum isn’t the only addition — over the years, the seashell museum has expanded to accommodate a pearl museum, set up in 2018, and a mineral museum, which was set up last year but owing to the pandemic, could only open this year, after the lockdowns were relaxed. The collection belongs to Riswan’s father, Raja Mohamed, a fish merchant from Rameswaram who set up the museum in 2012. “For 38 years, my father has been collecting seashells, pearls and minerals,” says Riswan. But the idea of a mineral museum struck Raja only after a visit to Singapore. “When my father saw the Merlion, he wanted to recreate it with seashells,” says Riswan. And so, a giant Merlion, made of 25,000 seashells stands outside the mineral museum, flanked by a shell chandelier, shell tree and shell bouquet. The space is decorated in blues and greens to simulate the underwater world. A tunnel-like room leads us to the mineral collection — behind glass panels are onyx, amethyst, quartz, moonstones, topaz, jasper and jade, all polished and shaped into orbs. From here, our guide, Syed Salim, takes us to the pearl museum, rattling off at full speed the names of oysters that hold pearls inside them. “The colour of the pearl depends on the colour of the lips of the oyster,” he says, before explaining how pearls are formed. “When a foreign body enters a mollusc’s mantle, it forms a sac around it. Layers and layers of secretion around it creates a pearl.” Which is why pearls are not always in the circular shape we know them to be, but appear as coins, claws, nuggets, peanuts, crescents — including one particularly unfortunate fish that has been encrusted into a pearl. Riswan shares how his father collected these pearls and shells. “My father grew up in Rameshwaram, in a coastal hamlet. He started as a fish merchant at the age of 19. He would walk across the seashore, collect shells and sell them in markets. Once he started earning money as a fish merchant through exports, he used that money to invest in his hobby of collecting shells.” Seashell museums are popular world over, however environmentalists have concerns over their mass collection. “Seashells feed the beaches — they have a function in the ecosystem, so their hardcore collection from one strip would be invasive,” points out naturalist M Yuvan. “Collection shouldn’t be for collection’s sake, but to facilitate a deeper understanding about what lives on the beach.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/t-rex-on-a-pearl-hunt/article35735925.ece
05 August 2021||August 05 2021 00:00 IST,||All about romance||Modern Love, based on the eponymous The New York Times column explored different shades of love in New York. The first season written and directed by John Carney featured a bunch of A-listers, including Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, Andy García, Dev Patel and John Slattery. Season 2, which streams from August 13, has its share of stars from Tom Burke and Minnie Driver to Kit Harington and Tobias Menzies. The right choice “It feels like you will find the right actor for the right job in this show,” Carney, who reprises his writer-director duties for Season 2, says over a video call. “It is half an hour of their time. If the actress is free, she comes and plays for a week and a half. While it is not a huge amount of money or prestige, they feel like ‘I connected with that script and got to make these cool episodes’. There is no more commitment and that is attractive to some actors in certain phases of their careers.” Carney enjoys the show’s half-hour format. “I find that challenging. I am getting a little tired of TV going on and on with long shows that require you to watch everything in order. You can dip in to Modern Love at any stage in the series.” Modern Love is a weekly column, which started in 2004. It is also a book, a podcast and a show. Picking articles that would work as television from 17 years of content is a mammoth ask. “There are two kinds of criteria that I look for. The first is a personal connection with the piece. That can be a dimension of a character, a relationship or a friendship that hits me,” says Carney. He adds, “The second is when I am struck by something about a particular essay as a filmmaker. I could imagine things in a scene playing well. Or I could imagine, directing five things that would be fun, challenging and interesting. I don’t usually go ‘Oh I love that essay so therefore I love that piece of TV’. That is not the way it works. We have actually found that often the best essays should remain written. I have struggled often to shoehorn an essay that I love into a half-an-hour screenplay that has not worked.” About time Though the show is calledModern Love, Carney says, love is timeless. “Obviously the circumstances in which we find ourselves, with cell phones, iPads and computers affect our expectations of love. At the end of the day, what we looked for in these stories is less about being super-current and more about being romantically truthful, regardless of geography.” Modern Love Season 2 streams on Amazon Prime Video from August 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/all-about-romance/article35735814.ece

On the live chatbox, more than a hundred messages cascade within this half a minute. Channel owner Ajay (known as Ajjubhai in the gaming world), welcomes his fast-increasing audience, reads out the sponsor’s name and gets down to business. In the four-hour-25-minute livestream, he makes silly jokes, replies to a few messages, gives shout-outs for Super Chat (a feature wherein viewers pay to highlight their message in the chatbox) and sings, as his characters roam, shoot, jump and dive. The stream, within two days, gets two million views on YouTube. Ajjubhai is a superstar streamer. He started in October 2018, with just four people watching his videos. Today, the Total Gaming channel has over 26 million subscribers and its videos have been watched over four billion times. Ajjubhai, who featured in YouTube’s list of top live streamers for 2020, also owns an eSports team. But this isn’t just about Ajjubhai. This is the story of Indian streamers like him who thrive in the global gaming industry, which generates US$159 billion a year in revenue (according to Newzoo, a gaming analytics company). To put this in perspective, Qatar’s annual GDP in 2020 was US$146 billion. Going by YouTube’s numbers, there has never been a better time for a streamer than last year. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced people to stay indoors, crowds for game-streaming surged. Last year saw 100 billion watch time hours, over 40 million active gaming channels, and more than 80,000 YouTube Gaming creators hitting 1,00,000 subscribers. Show me the money The bulk of streamers’ revenue comes from three main sources: ads on YouTube, features such as Super Chats and Super Stickers, and sponsorship or brand deals. It is significantly more than what Hari Raman, a young doctor from Purushanur, a hamlet in Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram district, earns through his job at Villupuram Medical College. Hari’s YouTube channel, PVS Gaming, has close to two million subscribers. He started the channel in 2018 while pursuing an MBBS course at a college in North India. “Because I couldn’t speak Hindi very well, I didn’t have a lot of friends at college. Streaming games in Tamil got me a lot of people to interact with online,” he says. His subscribers grew exponentially and the channel helped him meet his educational expenses, which had been a challenge. Hari had to overcome odds to be a doctor. He recalls how his village would treat his humble roots with derision — “Why does a coolie’s son want to be a doctor?”, some would ask. He fulfilled his dream early this year, finishing MBBS. But gaming, he says, has given him a bigger identity. Hari can afford to give up his profession. But he won’t, because it is also his passion. Now, he dispenses medical advice during his streaming sessions. “There was a lot of hesitancy about taking the vaccine this year. I used to dispel the myths and misinformation,” he says. While YouTube still continues to be the most successful platform for game streaming in India, independent platforms such as Twitch, Rooter and Loco have seen ballooning audiences. These platforms serve as alternative sources of revenue for gamers, some of whom enter a contract with them for streaming. Imagine a pyramid with top, middle and bottom sections, each representing the three categories of gamers: star players with their own clout, up-and-coming gamers with significant following, and novices. Platforms such as Rooter, which has over 7.5 million active users of which 3.8 million come from their app, primarily target the bottom and middle parts that consist of a sizeable proportion of gamers. “YouTube is not going to support middle players because their algorithm throws them out of the system. These are gamers with potential to go big; we are giving equal opportunity irrespective of size,” says Piyush Kumar, CEO, Rooter. Selling their personality Live streaming sessions can go up to four or five hours. There are no time restrictions for streaming on Rooter, says Kumar. In fact, when Kumar got on a call with us, a streaming had been on-going on for seven hours and still had over 1,200 followers. Rooter, especially, has been actively building its brand by signing contracts with star gamers like Gyan Gaming, who has 11 million subscribers on YouTube, and PVS Gaming, with the biggest subscriber base in South India. How do they hold their audience’s attention for so long? “It is, in a sense, a performance,” says Kaashvi Hiranandani, who owns YouTube channel Kaash Plays. She has the energy of a radio jockey in her streams. “In real life, I am a bit reserved. If a person I am close to offline watches my stream, they will be shocked,” she says, but reckons this change in personality is necessary: “People are investing two or three hours of their time in what I am doing. It is like a TV show for them. So, I try to be as entertaining as possible.” In a way, these streamers sell a personality — and, it needn’t always be theirs. Ajjubhai, for instance, does it without even revealing his face. “When a fellow YouTuber gamer revealed his face after a while, people turned up at his house, and college. Fans even called his parents. I get very uncomfortable with such attention,” he says. The regional connect Language seems to be an important determiner in gaining followers. Hari reckons audiences prefer regional languages over English. All the Indian streamers featured in YouTube’s list of top live streamers for 2020 speak Hindi in their videos. Kaashvi, who grew up in Singapore, used to stream in English initially. But, upon her audience’s request, she polished her Hindi, which significantly increased her subscribers. There are also streamers who use abusive language to draw followers, most of whom are adolescents. Scrutiny on such streamers increased in Tamil Nadu after the recent arrest of Madan Kumar Manikkam (known as Madan OP), after complaints about him hosting obscene conversations with minors and women. This incident, Hari says, got a bad rap for streamers in Tamil Nadu. “Even my parents asked me to reconsider gaming,” he adds, “But streamers like this are in the minority.” However, abuse cannot be prevented, especially when it comes from the audience. Kaashvi, as a female streamer, understands this better, explaining, “If I get 100 good comments, there will be 10 bad ones. And, some of them get really nasty. People know how to pick on one’s insecurities. I am fairly new to streaming, so it does bring me down.” Despite the challenges, she continues to stream because it is as lucrative as it is fun. Kaashvi works in finance, drawing “a mid-seven-figure salary” a year. But, she once made as much money in a month through streaming. She concludes, “It’s probably a dream job.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/come/article35735922.ece

This is the third collaboration between director Sukumar and Allu Arjun, after Arya (2004) and Arya 2 (2009). The story revolves around the red sanders heist in Andhra Pradesh. The Pushpa team also plans to unveil a promotional song on August 13, composed by Devi Sri Prasad. The song ‘Jaago Jaago Bakre’ is composed in five languages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sukumar-allu-arjun-fahadh-faasil-and-rashmika-mandannas-pushpa-eyes-december-2021-release/article35735816.ece
05 August 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. puts price cap on RT-PCR test at pvt. labs||The Delhi government on Wednesday reduced the maximum rates private labs can charge for RT-PCR tests for COVID-19. The rates have been reduced to Rs. 500, when a person gives the sample at a centre and to Rs. 700 for home collection of samples, compared to earlier rates of Rs. 800 and Rs. 1,200 respectively. “All labs/hospitals will display the revised rates at a prominent place latest within 24 hours of this order. This order comes into effect immediately and is for strict compliance by all concerned,” read the order issued by Bhupinder S. Bhalla, Additional Chief Secretary (Health & Family Welfare). The maximum rate the government pays to private labs, when samples collected by government centres are sent to private labs for testing, has also been reduced to Rs. 300 from Rs. 800. “Delhi govt. drastically reduces corona test rates. This will help the common man [sic],” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet. Chetan Kohli, Chief Operating Officer of Genestrings Diagnostics, said that the price cap may affect the labs’ ability to manage costs. “Subsidised rates will ensure more people can afford RT-PCR tests but the price cap may affect the labs’ ability to manage costs that entails kits and consumables, as well as manpower, logistics etc. The older price was fair and affordable with a decent incentive for smaller labs to continue investing further in enhancing their capacity. Hence, in hindsight this price reduction may hurt the overall need to enhance capacity,” he said. More vaccinations The number of daily COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the city has increased for the second consecutive day, as per government data. A total of 95,063 doses of vaccine were administered in the city on Tuesday, compared to 91,100 doses on Monday, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi government on Tuesday. But it is still less than the end of June when 1.5 to 2 lakh people were vaccinated daily on several days. The vaccine stock of the city on Wednesday morning would last for four days and there were 3,50,930 doses of Covishield and 3,75,110 doses of Covaxin, as per the data. Till now, 1,02,95,389 doses of vaccines have been administered in the city, as per the bulletin. 67 new cases The city reported 67 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,36,518. There was no death reported and the total number of deaths stood at 25,058. A total of 72,965 tests were done in a day and the TPR was 0.09%. Of the total cases, 14,10,947 people have recovered and there are only 513 active cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-caps-rt-pcr-price-at-pvt-labs/article35735601.ece
05 August 2021||New Delhi,||Nangal case: CM meets family, assures support||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday met with the family of the nine-year-old girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered before her body was forcibly cremated in the Delhi Cantonment area. In addition to assuring the family of all possible support, Mr. Kejriwal announced that the Delhi government will provide the family an ex gratia of Rs. 10 lakh, order a magisterial enquiry into the case, and appoint top lawyers so that the culprits get the strictest punishment. The CM was accompanied by Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam and Delhi Commission for Women Chairperson Swati Maliwal along with Aam Aadmi Party MLAs. “A nine-year-old girl had to unfortunately suffer a heinous crime and was then murdered. I met her grieving parents. The injustice that has happened with the family is very distressing,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He also stressed upon the “detrimental” law and order situation in Delhi and appealed to the Central government to take concrete measures in this regard. Mr. Kejriwal assured the Centre that the Delhi government will “fully cooperate” with it in order to fix the law and order situation. Such incidents in the national capital send out the wrong message internationally, he added. “Delhi is the national capital. If such incidents take place in the city, it does not send out a good message about the city. It makes the people feel unsafe, and internationally sends a message that India’s Capital is witnessing such heinous incidents,” Mr. Kejriwal said. Stating that the case is “very serious” and merits “urgent attention”, the DCW has summoned the Deputy Commissioner of South West district to be present before it on August 5 and produce the complete case file of the matter along with a copy of the FIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nangal-case-cm-meets-family-assures-support/article35735614.ece
05 August 2021||Lucknow/Bareilly,||‘U.P. govt. sabotaging BSP rallies’||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Mayawati on Wednesday accused the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of misusing the COVID-19 restrictions to scuttle its Brahmin outreach meetings, claiming that the ruling party is rattled by their success. Last month, the BSP — which counts on Dalit votes — began a series of “prabuddha varg sammelans” (intellectuals’ meetings) to woo the Brahmins ahead of the next year’s Assembly polls. The Samajwadi Party also appears set to launch a similar exercise. After a “prabuddha sammelan” in Bareilly on Wednesday, BSP national general secretary Satish Misra claimed that both the Dalits and the Brahmins are living in fear in the State. Meeting reporters, he also said the party will not enter into any alliance for the Assembly elections. In Lucknow, Ms. Mayawati charged that the BJP is misusing official machinery to sabotage the BSP meetings. She claimed that her party has been organising the meetings after obtaining necessary clearances but the authorities are now trying to impose “new conditions”. Ms. Mayawati said at some places the district administrations have been imposing restrictions on the number of participants. “Not only the Brahmins but everyone can see that for BJP leaders there is no ban relating to the coronavirus protocol at any programme and they have the freedom to openly flout all such rules,” The BSP supremo charged. “But in the case of opposition parties, they have different rules and this has become clearly evident during the BSP sammelans at some places,” she told reporters in Lucknow. ‘Cases registered’ Ms. Mayawati said cases were registered against some members of the Brahmin community after a meeting on Tuesday, and called it “casteist hatred” and an attempt to “intimidate” the participants. But this has only led to more passion for the BSP and anger towards the BJP, she said. Ms. Mayawati claimed that alarm bells are ringing in the BJP after the “success” of these meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-govt-sabotaging-bsp-rallies/article35735623.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two women officers played a critical role in Delhi Police’s biggest arrest of the year||It was around 2.30 p.m. and the Delhi Police team was following gangster Kala Jathedi and his partner Anuradha Chaudhary for nearly 24 hours. As the couple stopped at a dhaba in Saharanpur- Yamuna Nagar highway, the team waited a few seconds. “Target in sight and not moving,” said one. The direction to arrest him dead or alive was followed. The plan was to park one of the three cars at the rear part of the dhaba but the last minute call was to drive all cars right in front of the eatery. The officers immediately swung into action, got out of the vehicles and placed Kala Jathedi under arrest. In a black turban at the time, the turban was removed to ensure it was him. But it was Sub Inpector Preeti Sangwan, 27, who quickly moved towards Anuradha and held her tight from behind. “You are under arrest,” she told her. In the team of 40-odd officials working on arguably the biggest arrest of the year for Delhi Police so far – Kala Jathedi – two were female officers: Sub Inspectors Preeti and Neetu Sindhu, 30. The two officers from the Special Cell’s Counter Intelligence Unit exclusively spoke toThe Hinduabout the operation and what it means to be a part of a unit particularly dominated by men. Going against the grain Ms. Sangwan hails from Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri where her father is a farmer and mother, a housewife. Being born and brought up in a town where girls were not encouraged to step out, the officer started breaking barriers right from her school days by completing her higher studies. She then attended college by travelling a long distance “with a male friend” — much against the societal norms. But she had resolved to pursue higher education and went on to complete her bachelors in Commerce, and Masters in Computer Applications. She joined Delhi Police in 2018, and became part o the Special Cell (CIU) in 2020. “It’s been a great experience here because the learning is impeccable. I have learnt different types of technologies and how to use them in digital investigation. It’s the kind of work that gives me an adrenaline rush. The seniors and colleagues both are extremely supportive,” she added. An unforgettable case Recalling the operation to arrest Kala Jathedi, which was named ‘D-24’ – an operation which she claims to never forget in her career, she said she was on the field the last 10 days till the arrest was finally affected on July 30. After analysing data, the team — which had been working on the case for over one year — zeroed in on a car in which Jathedi could be present on July 20. SI Preeti picked up and followed that vehicle on Mathura-Gwalior Road. The shadowing continued till 1.30 a.m. the next day when they reached Faridabad only to ascertain that the ‘target’ was not in the vehicle. The next day, the team found that they had to find and spot two vehicles in Uttarakhand where the target could be. SI Preeti, along with a team, immediately left for the next assignment. “We had divided the area 40 km each, road by road, street by street and colony by colony, we looked for the cars left to right. In car, on foot and through jungles also, we kept looking for the two cars,” she recalled. She had to cover parts of Dehradun and Haridwar. After struggling for three days, an apartment complex in a district in Uttarakhand was the new search destination. The next challenge was to spot the car in the apartment complex without getting noticed. SI Preeti was asked to get a scooty, act like a local, and go inside the apartment complex to find whether the white coloured car is there. And the moment they had all been waiting for arrived. After walking and scanning for over 4 hours, a suspect car was found. “I wish I could explain the feeling. It was finally done”. The next three hours, she spent walking in the rain waiting for the car’s occupants to come out and to ascertain whether the car they had spotted was in fact Jathedi’s. They finally came. A man in a turban and a woman. The team was almost sure it was him. “Even inside the apartment complex, they would drive at a very high speed. That night, they came back in one hour”. The next day, SI Preeti managed to ascertain the tower in which the target could be residing and the floor using the analysis on time taken by the woman to walk up and shut the door, which the officer could hear. On July 29, the couple left the apartment at an unexpected time and didn’t come back till the night. With over 20 teams of two-three personnel scattered in an area covering 20 square km, the chase began, with SI Preeti in the lead. Midway, the target managed to exchange cars with a dummy couple and shifted to an SUV. However, all efforts at camouflage were to end in vein by the afternoon of July 30. Technical support SI Neetu, a 2014-batch officer, posted with CIU since 2020 and trained by C-DAC and pursuing Post Graduate Diploma in Electronics & IT, spent the last 72 continuous hours of the operation in the CIU office providing technical assistance — critical for last-mile operation — leaving behind her three-year-old daughter at home. “I would video call with my daughter only during the day because she knows that I’ll be in office at that time but in the evening, she would want to come to office if I would call her,” she recalled. “My posting at Special Cell has been a revelation of my inner strengths”, she said.  She returned home triumphant and exhausted after Jathedi was finally in her colleague’s net.  I have learnt various types of technologies and how to use them in digital probes. It’s the kind of work that gives me an adrena- line rush. The seniors and colleagues are very supportive Preeti Sangwan Sub Inpector||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-women-officers-played-a-critical-role-in-delhi-polices-biggest-arrest-of-the-year/article35735605.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Students, activists compare incident to Hathras case, seek swift justice||The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) on Wednesday took suo motu congnisance of the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl in the Capital. The commission said that after meeting the family of the victim, NCSC chairman Vijay Sampla met district officials to recommend releasing compensation as per provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 2016. CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat also met the family of the victim and wrote to Home Minister Amit Shah requesting urgent action. She said that a “lie” is being spread that the girl’s mother agreed to the hasty cremation, adding that it was reminiscent of what happened in the Hathras rape case — in which a 20-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped and killed by four men in Uttar Pradesh’s Boolgarhi village last September. The woman later died in Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital. A controversy erupted after the U.P. Police and the district administration cremated the woman without the consent of her family. Ms. Karat said that instead of helping the minor girl’s family who were in a state of shock, the police detained them at the station for several hours. She demanded action against the officers involved. ‘Govt. is duty-bound’ “It is indeed regrettable that you [Mr. Shah] have not intervened yet in this case even though Delhi police is directly under your ministry. My request is that you kindly ensure that justice is done. The parents cannot be ever compensated for the loss of their beloved daughter. But the government is duty-bound to ensure them financial support,” Ms. Karat said in her letter. Meanwhile, several protests were held at Jantar Mantar by student groups demanding that the culprits in the case be punished without delay. The Students’ Federation of India, along with Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch and the All India Democratic Women’s Association said that sexual violence against women is a larger problem concerning a patriarchal society wherein women are rendered inferior and powerless. They added that Dalit women are among the most powerless and oppressed in society owing to their gender and caste identity. Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh said that dalit women are doubly oppressed. “We live in a political environment in which caste is being reinstated into our social order with its former vigour.” All India Students’ Association Delhi vice-president Madhurima Kundu said: “The country witnessed how the Hathras accused were shielded by the RSS-BJP. In Delhi, Delhi Police, which is under Amit Shah has failed to ensure the safety and security of women in the Capital.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/students-activists-compare-incident-to-hathras-case-seek-swift-justice/article35735609.ece
05 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Planters flag dipping tea prices||A Rs. 38 hike in the daily cash wage of labourers has been a major factor in price realisation of tea declining markedly below the cost of production, a tea planters’ body has said. The North Eastern Tea Association (NETA) on Wednesday said the tea industry was struggling for survival due to an 18% dip in the price realisation of tea compared to that in 2020. “The price realisation of tea has gone down by Rs. 44.19 per kg in a year while the cost of production has gone up due to the hike in wages and increase in the cost of inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, natural gas, coal and transportation,” NETA adviser Bidyananda Borkakoty said. ‘Negative impact’ The cost of production of processed tea had gone up by Rs. 25 a kg. The daily cash wage hike from Rs. 167 to Rs. 205 and a Rs. 7 increase in input costs led to a “negative impact” on the industry to the tune of Rs. 76 per kg of processed tea, he said. According to the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC), the average price realisation of CTC tea from April to July this year was Rs. 208.02 per kg, down by Rs. 44.19 from Rs. 252.21 per kg during the same period in 2020. “Only about 9% teas have fetched above Rs. 300 a kg and about 51% of teas have got sold below Rs. 200 per kg,” NETA chairman Sunil Jallan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/planters-flag-dipping-tea-prices/article35735826.ece
05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Will stand by victim’s family till they get justice: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday met the family of the nine-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in the Capital. Mr. Gandhi said he will stand with the family till they get justice and will not back down even an inch. Twitter row Reacting to a picture that Mr. Gandhi posted on Twitter with the girl’s parents, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) wrote to the social media platform asking for action against Mr. Gandhi’s account for revealing the identity of the victim. “Tweeting a photo of a victim’s parents and thereby revealing her identity is a violation of the POCSO Act, 2012. NCPCR has taken cognisance of the matter and issued a notice to Twitter seeking action against Rahul Gandhi's Twitter handle as well as removal of the post,” NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo tweeted. Meanwhile, the Delhi Congress organised several protests across the city and demanded trial of the case by a fast-track court. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar, who accompanied Mr. Gandhi to meet the victim’s family, said the parents of the girl said that “she was also a desh ki beti (daughter of the country), and deserved justice”. Mr. Kumar said it was surprising that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was busy increasing the salary of his MLAs, could not spare time to meet the family immediately after the incident. “Instead of addressing the problems being faced by Delhiites now, including the safety and security of women, broken roads, waterlogging, and spike in cases of vector-borne diseases, Mr. Kejriwal was fooling people by painting a rosy future of making Delhi like Singapore by 2047,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/will-stand-by-victims-family-till-they-get-justice-rahul-gandhi/article35735611.ece
05 August 2021||New Delhi,||Lack of clarity on buffer stock of oxygen: HC||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday remarked there was lack of clarity on the steps taken by the Centre for setting up buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in the Capital to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic even as a third wave is anticipated. “Today the situation may look fine but then everyone saw what happened in April-May. There is no escape from this [buffer stock of LMO]. This is like insurance,” the Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh said. The Bench said the status report filed by the Centre does not indicate that buffer stock of LMO is actually created for the use of Delhi and it only talks of enhancement of oxygen storage capacity here. In April, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre and the Delhi government to create appropriate buffer stock of LMO in the capital. Reminding the government of the top court’s order, the Bench said, “Creation of buffer stock cannot happen in a week or two. You will need to first install necessary infrastructure for that.” During the hearing, senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae in the case, said it was not clear whether a buffer stock of LMO exists in Delhi, and to what extent. The Central government’s standing counsel said the Delhi government had done enough for creating a buffer stock. The Delhi government, represented by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, said the capital had a buffer stock of around 420 metric tonnes of LMO kept at different places with suppliers outside Delhi and by August 31, the Delhi government will transfer this stock to Delhi. The Centre said that the manufacturing capacity of Liposomal Amphotericin B, used for treating patients of black fungus, which primarily affects those who have recovered from COVID-19 and was in short supply earlier, had been augmented. It said the centralised allocation of the medicine to States has been discontinued and now they [the States] will have to procure the drug directly from manufacturers. In a status report, the Centre said that there had been a fall in the cases of black fungus, which numbered 28,475 on June 27, to 18,833 on July 30. The court was hearing various issues related to the COVID-19 crisis. It will hear the petition again on August 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lack-of-clarity-on-buffer-stock-of-oxygen-hc/article35735599.ece

Justice Mukta Gupta said the status report has to indicate the role of each accused and as well as the duration of the stay of the foreigners. The court directed the status report should indicate, “the role of each accused and also as to when the alleged foreign national were housed in his house, be clarified so as to find out whether the accused gave housing facility after the notification was issued or prior thereto”.

A magisterial inquiry has been initiated, police said. Police said that a call was received at 9.15 a.m. regarding the death of Ankit Gujjar, resident of Baghpat, in Tihar jail number three. He was found dead on the jail dispensary’s bed. He was in jail on charges of murder and criminal conspiracy. Two cell mates of the deceased: Gurpreet Singh (22) and Gurjeet Singh (22), were found injured. They were taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where they are undergoing treatment. “Inquest proceedings have been initiated and action will be taken according to the findings of the inquest report and post-mortem,” a senior police officer said. Ankit’s family members alleged that he was murdered by the jail officials following a quarrel. They said they received a call on Tuesday night stating that Ankit was beaten up and that he is critical. They then called the police and reached Tihar jail in the morning. They were not allowed inside the premises after which they went to the Hari Nagar police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/inmate-found-dead-in-tihar-jail-2-injured/article35735606.ece
05 August 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. must speed up implementing options to stubble burning: experts||With the Lok Sabha passing a Bill to formalise the Commission for Air Quality Management for National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Wednesday, experts said the government has to now speed up implementation of alternatives to stubble burning. The Centre, facing flak earlier this year from farmers protesting against the farm laws, had committed to removing a clause in the Air Commission Bill that would penalise farmers for burning stubble, an important contributor to noxious air quality. The current text of the Bill does away with this clause. Anumita Roychowdhury, head of Clean Air Programme at the Centre for Science and Environment, said it is unfair to fine farmers without giving them viable alternatives. Three solutions “If just by penalising farmers, stubble burning could be stopped, we should have been able to end it by now. We have evidence that in areas where alternatives are implemented, fire incidents have come down,” she said, The government should instead focus on alternative solutions to burning, she said. “There are three main solutions to stubble burning: in-situ treatment of stubble, ex-situ treatment, and changing cropping pattern. The last one being the deeper and more fundamental solution. For in-situ management, the government is currently giving equipment to farmers to mix the stubble back into the soil, so that they do not have to burn it, but everyone is not getting these machines. The government should ensure their availability to everyone. Similarly, in ex-situ management, some companies have started collecting stubble for their use, but we need more action on this front,” she said. Ms. Roychowdhury said farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, need support for adoption of in-situ strategies, to mulch the straw into the soil and not burn it. “Penalty without access to solutions does not work.” Polash Mukerjee, Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said farmers burn stubble as other methods are expensive and they have less time before the next sowing season. “Imposing a fine is not going to work in our socio-economic conditions for curbing stubble burning. We need to focus on alternative solutions,” he said. But he said that the current development is bad in terms of deterrence to burn stubble. “Already there is economic distress and now there is no deterrence, so the farm fires could go up during this year’s harvest season,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/need-viable-alternatives-to-stubble-burning/article35735616.ece

05 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govts. can’t abdicate their responsibility to rehabilitate Khori residents: ex-MP||Former Lok Sabha MP and Congress national spokesperson, Udit Raj, on Wednesday said the Haryana and Delhi governments and the Union government could not abdicate their responsibility to rehabilitate those rendered homeless because of the demolition of Khori Basti in Faridabad and reiterated to continue his fight for their rights. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Raj, said the Haryana government had come out with a rehabilitation policy for the residents of Khori Basti with the identity proofs of the State, but the Delhi government was mum on rehabilitating those belonging to the national Capital. He said efforts of the Haryana government for rehabilitation too were not enough, and the two State governments along with the Modi government at the Centre could not run away from their responsibility. Rich spared He demanded to know as to what was the hurry to knock down the houses of over one lakh poor people amid the pandemic when the Haryana government’s amendments to Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 were in the pipeline. He alleged that the big hotels, farmhouses and educational institutes on the forest land belonging to the rich were spared, but the poor were targeted. Mr. Raj, who is also the national chairman of All-India Confederation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes organisations, lamented that the Supreme Court did not order recovery from the land mafia that had sold the government land to the gullible migrants and compensate the poor. Meenu Verma, national co-ordinator of the confederation, alleged that hundreds of houses in colonies under the PM-UDAY, a scheme for recognition of the property rights in unauthorised colonies in Delhi, were also demolished by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad. She said that her representations to Delhi government in this regard did not elicit any response. Confederation leader Sanjay Raj said the people in power could not see the pain and sufferings of lakhs of people, including pregnant women, teenage girls and elderly, rendered homeless and their memoranda to the office of Prime Minister and Home Minister did not elicit any response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/will-fight-for-rights-of-khori-basti-residents/article35735602.ece
