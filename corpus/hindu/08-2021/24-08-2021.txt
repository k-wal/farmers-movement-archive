24 August 2021||New Delhi,||Modi non-committal on Bihar team’s demand for caste census||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, along with a delegation of leaders from 10 parties from the State, including RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and BJP representatives, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for a caste census. Mr. Modi, it is learnt, has not given any assurances, though the meeting was described as positive. So far the BJP has walked a tightrope on the issue, with leaders from Bihar speaking in favour of a caste census and the party leadership at the Centre keeping mum. The wider implication of such a census on the party’s carefully crafted OBC bloc in Uttar Pradesh has kept it on tenterhooks. Sources said the Prime Minister did not counter the delegation nor did he express the Centre’s inability to carry out such an exercise. ‘Historic opportunity’ Given that the last caste census was conducted in 1931, the delegation argued that it would be a historic step, if the Prime Minister was to hold a census now. At the end of the meeting, after listening to each member of the delegation, Mr. Modi, as per sources, said he would get the issue thoroughly examined. Speaking to presspersons after the meeting, Mr. Kumar said that all parties spoke in one voice. “It is up to the Prime Minister and the Union government to decide. We explained our stand and he sincerely heard us out,” he said. Mr. Kumar said the fear that a caste census would lead to a return of the Mandal days with widespread protests and chaos was misplaced. “Every person, no matter which caste or religion he is from, wants the caste census. Once we have the caste data, then we can formulate policies for the uplift of each and every caste,” he said. Mr. Tejashwi Yadav said if animals and trees could be counted, so could people. “The caste census is in national interest. It will help the poor and deprived sections of society.” Rare collaboration The caste census has seen a rare coming together of Mr. Yadav and Mr. Kumar despite their bitter campaign against each other during the Assembly election of 2020. Asked if this collaboration would extend beyond the caste census issue, Mr. Kumar said the Opposition in Bihar had always supported the government over pro-people measures and those in national interest. Mr. Kumar and Mr. Yadav said the reply by Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai in the Rajya Sabha that there was no proposal for releasing caste-based population data had triggered unrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modi-non-committal-on-bihar-teams-demand-for-caste-census/article36070909.ece

24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fix glitches in I-T portal by Sept. 15, FM directs Infosys CEO||Union Minister for Finance andCorporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman has set a September 15 deadline for software major Infosys to fix all the glitches plaguing “the current functionalities” of the new Income Tax filing portal, after conveying the government’s “deep disappointment” with the firm’s services to its CEO Salil Parekh. The Minister had summoned Mr. Parekh on Monday to explain why the I-T portal had still not stabilised and its flaws fixed, more than two-and-a-half months since its launch. The “summon” came as the portal had become inaccessible over the past weekend, within days of Ms. Sitharaman stating that she expected it to be fully functional within two or three days.  “The Finance Minister demanded that the issues faced by taxpayers on current functionalities of the portal should be resolved by the team by 15 September, 2021 so that taxpayers and professionals can work seamlessly on the portal,” an official communique after the meeting said, adding that Ms. Sitharaman also sought an explanation from Infosys on the mess. Ms. Sitharaman has urged Mr. Parekh to put more resources and efforts into the portal so that the “the much-delayed delivery of agreed services is ensured”. She also conveyed ‘the deep disappointment and concerns of the Government and taxpayers about the continuing glitches in the Income Tax e-filing portal’. The Infosys CEO, who was ‘sensitised on the difficulties’ taxpayers were facing and the repercussions of delays in the portal’s functioning, explained that ‘he and his team are doing everything to ensure the smooth functioning of the portal’, as per a statement from the Finance Ministry. The fresh September 15 deadline proposed after the Minister met Mr. Parekh indicates taxpayers’ woes will last for almost another month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fix-i-t-portal-by-sept-15-fm-directs-infosys-ceo/article36070910.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Goyal hints at tit-for-tat trade restrictions||Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday asked industry bodies to identify obstacles being imposed by countries to restrict India’s exports, and promised that the government would respond “appropriately” to such curbs. The remarks by the Minister, suggesting that the government is not averse to taking retaliatory trade policy measures to counter export barriers beyond the realm of tariffs and duties, came at an interaction with industry bodies on achieving the $400 billion merchandise exports target for the year, ramping up to $2 trillion by 2030. “[The Minister] urged all to share the experience on non-tariff barriers in other countries so that India can take appropriate response wherever feasible,” the Commerce Ministry said. The statement came after the Minister’s comments at the closed-door meeting. Last week, he promised a fresh approach towards free trade agreements, while disclosing that an Indo-U.S. trade deal is off the table and the govt. would look to resolve non-tariff barriers with the U.S. instead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/goyal-hints-at-tit-for-tat-trade-curbs/article36070911.ece
24 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||‘3 capitals’ cases adjourned to Nov. 15||The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Monday adjourned hearing on a host of petitions challenging the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Acts, 2020 to November 15, due to the threat of a third wave of COVID upon requests for postponement made by some senior advocates through letters to Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami on August 21. Thousands of farmers in the existing capital region of Amaravati, who are aggrieved by the government’s proposal to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam in the name of ‘Executive capital’, and others who called the ‘three capitals’ as a retrograde measure, have to now wait another 83 days for the High Court to possibly conduct a physical hearing of the cases in view of their urgency. The YSR Congress Party government had passed the above enabling legislations for developing Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool as the Legislative, Executive and Judicial capitals, in the Assembly last year, but they hit a stumbling block in the Legislative Council as its Chairman Md. Ahmed Shariff referred them to a select committee. Eventually, the Assembly adopted a resolution for the abolition of the TDP-dominated Council and sent a recommendation to that effect to the Union government, with which the matter is still pending. Travel restrictions Soon after the Chief Justice and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N. Jayasurya commenced hearing on Monday, the requests for adjournment necessitated by the likely resurgence of COVID and the travel restrictions were taken to their notice and the Judges conceded the pleas to put off the cases to November. While expressing his readiness for the hearing, Advocate-General S. Sriram said the advocates who could not travel to Amaravati, should have made alternative arrangements in view of the importance of the cases being dealt with by the High Court. Nevertheless, due to the insistence that the cases should be posted to a later date in order to be cautious about COVID, particularly looking at the manner in which it is hitting the U.S. again and the threat looming in India, the court may agree for the postponement, the Advocate-General told the court, which made clear that it would not accommodate requests for adjournment on account of counsel inconvenience after November 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-court-puts-off-hearing-on-three-capital-cases-to-nov/article36070857.ece
24 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Attendance low as schools and PU colleges reopen||As many schools and pre-university (PU) colleges opened their gates again on Monday for students wearing a festive look, the response from students was at best lukewarm. The attendance in high schools and PU colleges was poor on day one when offline classes resumed after a gap of five months. Classes were closed in March because of the second wave of COVID-19 infections. According to official data, the attendance in both offline and online classes across the State in Class X stood at 21%, while it was 19.5% in Class IX. PU colleges reported slightly higher showing as the cumulative attendance for both offline and online classes stood at 36%. While many schools and PU colleges had anticipated that attendance would be low for offline classes, what was worrying was that the attendance for online classes too was extremely poor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/attendance-low-as-schools-and-pu-colleges-reopen/article36070941.ece

The remarks by Mr. Tewari came a day after Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd.) took strong exception to the recent comments by the advisers — Malvinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg — on social media on issues such as Kashmir and Pakistan. Mr. Mali is a retired government teacher and political analyst, while Mr. Garg is the former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health and Sciences. While Mr. Garg reportedly questioned Capt.

24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jaishankar to brief floor leaders on Afghanistan||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will on Thursday brief floor leaders of all parties in Parliament on the developments in Afghanistan at the Parliament House, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi said on Monday. India last week evacuated hundreds of Indians and Afghan nationals and the staff of its Embassy in Kabul after the takeover by the Taliban. Special visa category The government also launched a special visa category for the evacuation of Afghan partners from that country. The fast-developing situation there and its implications for security in India have been a matter of concern, with various political parties expressing this concern. “In view of the developments in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has instructed that Ministry of External Affairs brief floor leaders of political parties,” tweeted Mr. Jaishankar, after which Mr. Joshi announced the date, time and venue of the briefing. At a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting early last week, Mr. Modi said the evacuation of Hindus, Sikhs and Afghan “brothers and sisters” was a priority for the Government of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-to-brief-floor-leaders-on-afghanistan/article36070827.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Participants of vaccine trial to get certificates||Digital COVID-19 vaccination certificates will now be issued to the clinical trial participants of Covishield and Covaxin through Co-WIN, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted on Monday. The Minister said that the nation “thanks them [trial participants] for their incredible commitment & contribution to COVID-19 vaccine research & treatment.” He said participants could download their individual certificates through the CoWIN portal or the Aarogya Setu, Digilocker or UMANG applications. The Union Health Ministry, in its release, noted that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (SII), had conducted Phase 2 and 3 bridging studies of Covishield from August 2020. Participants’ requests Phase 3 efficacy clinical trials for Covaxin were conducted by Bharat Biotech from November 2020. “The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had received several requests from the trial participants for digital vaccination certificates through Co-WIN,” said the Ministry’s release. It added that a decision was taken that vaccination certificates may be issued to such participants who were administered the vaccines during these trials/studies, after the trials/studies were unblinded. The ICMR was designated by the Union Health Ministry as the nodal agency for collection of vaccination data for such participants.

Digital vaccination certificates will now be issued through Co-WIN, to such persons who participated in these studies or trials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/participants-of-vaccine-trial-to-get-certificates/article36070846.ece
24 August 2021||Ghaziabad,||Afghan students at AMU seek govt. support||The Afghan students studying at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have expressed concern over the fragile socio-political situation back home and appealed to the Indian government and university administration for support. University sources said 23 Afghan students were enrolled in different courses, out of which 15 were at present in the country. “The Vice-Chancellor has assured all possible help and cooperation,” said Syed Ali Nawaz Zaidi, adviser, foreign students. “A delegation of students met the proctor and expressed concern over the political instability in the country and its impact on banking and telecommunication services. They urged the government and university administration to help the students who had gone back home during the COVID-19 lockdown in getting the visa for India so that they could continue their studies,” said Dr. Zaidi. The university’s association with Afghanistan goes back to Bharat Ratna Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the secular Pashtun leader of the Freedom Movement, who was an alumnus of the Mohammden Anglo-Oriental College that later became the AMU. Reflecting on the evolving situation, a postgraduate student of Tajik origin, who did not want to be named, expressed fear that Pashtuns would target other ethnic groups such as the Tajiks and the Hazaras. “The majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns and recent events suggest that they are in dialogue with the Pashtun leaders of the previous dispensation,” he said. His brother is studying at Hyderabad’s Osmania University and took the last Air India flight out of Kabul. “The situation is getting worse as banking and telecommunication services are badly hit. My father who worked for a U.N. agency has left the country. I have put in an application requesting an extension for the payment of fees,” he said, fearing for the plight of his other family members. Sher Ali, a Pashtun, who is a student of engineering said it was not about regional identities. “Taliban are united by an extremist interpretation of Islam and that they don’t spare the Pashtuns as well those who don’t abide by their rules.” Mr. Ali said the Taliban had support in the areas that share a border with Pakistan. “They have support in the mountainous regions where development has not reached.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afghan-students-at-amu-seek-govt-support/article36070823.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘No immediate plan to ban 2 Hurriyat factions’||The Union government is currently not thinking about any ban on the two Hurriyat factions, a government official said on Monday. Responding to reports that the government was considering a ban on the Hurriyat factions under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the official said there was no such plan at this stage. The Union Home Ministry banned the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) under the UAPA in March 2019, days after the Jamat-e-Islami (JeI-J&K) was proscribed under Section 3(1) of the Act. The decision to ban the JKLF followed a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Based on evidence The government decides to ban any organisation based on evidence warranting such a step. In the past, investigation agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have taken legal action against several separatists in Jammu and Kashmir. In July 2017, the NIA arrested seven persons, including Altaf Ahmed Shah who is the son-in-law of separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. In a chargesheet filed in January 2018, it arraigned several separatist leaders for their alleged involvement in orchestrating violent protests in Jammu and Kashmir. The NIA also conducted searches in February 2019 at multiple locations, including the premises of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, JKLF chief Yasin Malik, Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party president Shabir Shah, Tehreek-e-Hurriyat chairman Mohammad Ashraf Khan and All Party Hurriyat Conference general secretary Masarat Alam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-immediate-plan-to-ban-2-hurriyat-factions/article36070825.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||75 persons to be airlifted from Kabul||Seventy-five persons, including Hindu and Sikh citizens of Afghanistan, reached the Kabul airport on Monday morning for the next round of the Indian airlift operation that is currently under way. They are carrying Sri Guru Granth Sahib from three gurdwaras in Afghanistan. “I can confirm that 75 passengers that include stranded Indians and 46 Afghan Hindu and Sikh citizens with three Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji are currently inside the Kabul airport and are being escorted by international forces to the Indian Air Force aircraft on the ground. They will be evacuated in a few hours,” said Puneet Singh Chandhok, president of the Indian World Forum, an organisation that is coordinating with the External Affairs Ministry and the Indian Air Force in the airlift operation. India brought back 392 individuals from Kabul on Sunday in three flights, and similar operations are expected to continue for several days as hundreds more remain in Afghanistan. Kabul has been witnessing growing tensions between the Taliban and the members of the previous government. A woman Afghan lawmaker, who has been in Delhi for some time, said the Taliban were expected to target at least 60 Members of Parliament who had ties to the government of former President Ashraf Ghani. ‘Son in hiding’ “They have been visiting our homes and issuing threats. They have been demanding that my 18-year-old son should join them and because of the threat, my son has gone into hiding,” she said requesting anonymity. “All those people who spoke or wrote against Taliban and its links to Pakistan are vulnerable to attacks from their side. I have been vocal against them and my videos remain on social media. Taliban are scanning these videos and planning their move,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/75-persons-to-be-airlifted-from-kabul/article36070893.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protest can’t hinder traffic, says SC||The Supreme Court took a nuanced stand on Monday, saying farmers have the right to protest but the agitation should not hinder traffic or public movement. A Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul said the solution to end the farmer-government impasse over the three agriculture laws lay with the government. Protesting farmers have been camping on the outskirts of the capital for over a year. Collective intervention The Supreme Court has asked the Central, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments to take stock of the ground situation. The Bench, including Justice Hrishikesh Roy, was hearing a petition filed by Monica Agarwal, a Noida resident. She has complained that commuting to and fro between Delhi and Noida has become a nightmare due to road blocks because of the ongoing farmers’ protest. “The solution lies in the hands of the Union and States. If the protests are on, the traffic should not be stopped in any manner, so that to and fro for people is not disturbed,” the Bench remarked. The court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central government, to ask his client to intervene. In a recent affidavit, the Uttar Pradesh government said it had reached out to the farmers about the inconvenience being caused to commuters. Blocking free public movement was illegal, it stated. ‘Administrative failure’ The court scheduled the next hearing for September 20. “It is her say that she is a single parent and also has some medical issues and it has become a nightmare to travel to Delhi where it is taking two hours instead of normal 20 minutes. She contends that despite the various directions passed by this Court to keep the to and fro passage clear [the roads], the same still does not happen. We did put to her if it is so, it is an administrative failure as the judicial view has already been propounded by us,” the Bench noted in its April order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/protest-cant-hinder-traffic-says-sc/article36070851.ece
24 August 2021||Srinagar,||2 TRF militants killed in Srinagar||Two militants of The Resistance Front (TRF), including its ‘commander’, were killed in a brief encounter in Srinagar city on Monday afternoon. The police said the duo was killed in “a brief exchange of fire” at Aloochi Bagh. They were identified as ‘commander’ Abbas Sheikh and his ‘second in command’ Saqib Manzoor. “It is a big success for the security forces,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said. In list of top wanted The slain militants were among those in the list of top wanted of the police. It was made public recently. Sheikh, 45, was a top militant from south Kashmir’s Kulgam. According to the police, he was arrested twice but rejoined militancy. Manzoor was a militant from Srinagar’s Barazulla area. “They were involved in attacks on policemen,” the police said. Mr. Kumar said that after getting specific inputs from the Army about the movement of the duo, 10 policemen in civvies cordoned off the area. “There was firing from the militants, which was retaliated, leading to the encounter. Subsequently, the duo was killed,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-trf-militants-killed-in-srinagar/article36070806.ece
24 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Rapid test exorbitantly priced: flyers||Passengers travelling to West Asia by flight from Chennai have a new concern — they have to pay Rs. 4,000 for the Rapid RT-PCR test at the airport. A few weeks ago, airport authorities introduced this facility as travellers bound for West Asia had to be in possession of an RT-PCR negative result from test done six hours prior to their departure. Until a few days ago, the time was even shorter. It was four hours before the flight. The rapid RT-PCR test gives the results within 30 minutes. Passengers are upset that they have to spend so much for a test in addition to the ticket cost. A one-way fare on Chennai-Dubai flight is Rs. 8,500 to Rs. 13,000 depending on the day and time of the flight. Many have taken to social media platforms urging the authorities to bring down the cost of this test. Ashokan S, a passenger tweeted: “#HLL rapid pcr test cost at chennai airport fixed very high ie 4,000/head, whereas the original equipment cost ranges from 500 to 1,250, request you to fix the same as 900.” Mohamed Ismail, another passenger, said, “Airports Authority of India, please look into the pricing of RT-PCR test in Chennai Airport it is Rs. 4,000 whereas in small Trichy Airport it is Rs. 1,575 only. As the high volume of passengers undergoing tests in Chennai Airport, it should be less than the Trichy Airport. Please reduce.” Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said they were keen on reducing the cost. “The pricing factor depends on the kit used for the test; the lab has got approval from the government and AAI for this kit and hence it is Rs. 4,000. If they get a new kit approved, then the cost can be definitely reduced,” an official said. The fees for RT-PCR test whose result will come within four to seven hours is Rs. 900.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rapid-test-exorbitantly-priced-say-flyers/article36071004.ece
24 August 2021||Srinagar,||Army’s new bid in Kashmir to wean youth off militancy||The Army on Monday used a rare tool to wean off local youth from militancy — screening a grim, black-and-white animation film of 2 minutes and 13 seconds named Back from Jaws of Death on 23 boys who were rescued from joining militants in north Kashmir’s Bandipora in 1998. The film depicts how the boys remained in the dense jungles of Ajas in “pathetic conditions” from August 4 to August 23 of that year after a militant named Bambar Khan, with the help of local overground workers, either by force or through radicalisation, kept them there for the final push across the Line of Control (LoC) in the Gurez Sector for arms training. Troops to the rescue An Army spokesperson said, “On August 23, 1998, the terrorists accompanying these youths ran away, while taking cover of thick foliage and vegetation.” “The troops quickly took control of the situation and helped the boys cross the Kishanganga River, which was in spate in the Gurez Sector. The rescued boys, as of now, are leading normal, happy lives. They are married and have families of their own, with children,” the Army spokesperson added. Lieutenant General Y.K. Joshi, Army Commander of the Northern Command, met the rescued individuals and their families during an event organised at Bandipora’s Manasbal lake. He also released the animation film in the memory of the rescued individuals, “who suffered harrowing experiences with the terrorists in the jungle”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/armys-new-bid-in-kashmir-to-wean-youth-off-militancy/article36070853.ece
24 August 2021||Srinagar,||Tension in Hurriyat camps amid reports||Tension and uncertainty was palpable among the Hurriyat camps in Kashmir on Monday against the backdrop of media reports that the Union government was likely to ban the separatist groups under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Supporters of senior separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani were seen removing the signboard of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat (TeH) from his residence-cum-office in Srinagar. Incarcerated Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, however, said his faction of the Hurriyat would continue “representing people’s aspiration”. Mr. Geelani, who is not keeping well, resigned from the All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) in June 2020 after developing differences with the leadership across the border. So far, no formal order has been issued by the police or the Home Department to ban the factions. Earlier, the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), a pro-independence group, and socio-religious group Jamaat-e-Islami were banned and their leadership arrested in 2019, ahead of the government’s move to end Jammu and Kashmir’s special constitutional position in August that year. Most of the Hurriyat factions have been silent and defunct after the August 5 move by the government. The Mirwaiz, in a statement, said his group would “always represent the aspirations and seek their fulfilment through its principled stand of dialogue and deliberations among the stakeholders of the conflict”. In a statement, a spokesperson of the Mirwaiz said: “The sentiments of the people of J&K, with regard to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute in a peaceful and fair manner, cannot be altered despite repression, legal tactics or propaganda.” Sending students to Pak. He also denied police allegations that the Hurriyat was sending local youth to Pakistan colleges against money. “We reject and denounce the propaganda. This is completely unfounded and can be verified from those students or parents whom we have recommended, with many of them from economically weak sections,” the Hurriyat spokesperson said. The Mirwaiz was giving recommendation letters to students to get admission in the colleges and universities in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey and elsewhere, the spokesperson stated. BJP stand The BJP’s State president, Ravinder Raina, described the Hurriyat as “puppets” of Pakistan, and sought action against them. “The Hurriyat is a puppet, and their strings are in Pakistan. They took money and arms from Pakistan to destroy Kashmir. The mother organisation of the Hurriyat is already banned. They misled youth from Kashmir and sent them to Pakistan on the pretext of MBBS courses, but bring them back as terrorists. There should be strict action,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tension-in-hurriyat-camps-amid-reports/article36070830.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.S. approves highest number of student visas||Over 55,000 Indian students and exchange visitors to the United States have been given student visas in 2021 despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest number ever, the U.S. Mission in India said on Monday. “Through these efforts, more than 55,000 students and exchange visitors are boarding planes to study in the United States, and more students are being approved every day,” a U.S. Mission statement said. Thriving atmosphere Ambassador Atul Keshap, the Chargé d’Affaires at the U.S. Embassy here, said studying in the U.S. was a unique experience for Indian students. “Indian students also enrich U.S. society, achieve high levels of academic success, and deepen the bonds of friendship between our countries,” he said. Though the COVID-19 second wave led to a two-month delay in starting the student visa season, which usually starts in May, the consular teams were able to process more visas this year than during the pre-COVID times, the statement said. “In July, as soon as conditions allowed for the resumption of visa services without endangering applicants’ health and safety, consular teams worked not only to match, but surpass, their pre-COVID workload. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates opened additional hours for visa appointments and made every possible effort to ensure timely arrival for academic programmes for as many students as possible. Ultimately, these efforts paid off, as more students than ever before received visas to study in the United States of America,” the statement read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-approves-record-student-visas/article36070847.ece
24 August 2021||MOSCOW,||Russian stealth frigates to come in 2023||The first of two additional Krivak class stealth frigates being built by Russia is expected to be delivered to India in the middle of 2023, Alexey Rakhmanov, chief executive officer of United Shipbuilding Corporation, said. “Due to COVID we had delays in execution of some of the stages of construction. There was an approximately eight-month delay. The first ship should be delivered in the middle of 2023,” Mr. Rakhmanov said at the ongoing Army 2021 exhibition in Moscow. In October 2016, India and Russia signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for four Krivak or Talwar class stealth frigates — two to be procured directly from Russia and two to be built by Goa Shipyard Ltd. (GSL) — after which a $1 billion deal was signed for the direct purchase. On the construction at GSL, Mr. Rakhmanov said they would soon be inviting Indian technicians for the ongoing construction of the two frigates at the Yantar shipyard in Russia to familiarise themselves with the specificity of the equipment and the construction. In the second stage, substantial work would be done at GSL, including technology transfer, he said. He added that the frigates were being built to operate both Indian and Russian equipment. The basic structures of the two frigates are already ready at the Yantar shipyard and they are now being completed. The keel for the first ship to be built at GSL was laid in January and for the second ship in June this year. Keel laying symbolises the formal commencement of the construction process. The Navy had recently said that the first of these ships would be delivered in 2026 and the second six months later. In November 2018, GSL signed a $500 million deal with Rosoboronexport of Russia for material, design and specialist assistance to locally manufacture the two frigates, and in January 2019 the contract was signed between the Ministry of Defence and GSL. The engines for the ships are supplied by Zorya Nashproekt of Ukraine. Four gas turbine engines, gear boxes and specialist support will cost around $50 million per ship, as reported by The Hindu earlier. The Navy currently operates six Krivak class frigates weighing around 4,000 tonnes procured in two different batches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/russian-stealth-frigates-to-come-in-2023/article36070897.ece
24 August 2021||New Delhi,||Is the split wide open in Chhattisgarh Congress?||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Singh Baghel and Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo are scheduled to meet former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday amid reports of an ongoing tussle between them. All India Congress Committee (AICC) in charge of Chhattisgarh P.L. Punia would be present in the meeting, a source said on Monday. After Punjab’s Amarinder Singh versus Navjot Sidhu spat and Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot, the rift in Chhattisgarh, too, is wide open. Mr. Deo is reported to be upset with the leadership for not “honouring” a power-sharing formula by rotating the Chief Minister’s post after two-and-a-half years as Mr. Baghel completed that period in mid-June this year. For the past few weeks, the Minister is also upset after party colleague Brahaspat Singh, a tribal lawmaker, alleged that Mr. Deo had “orchestrated” an assault on the MLA’s convoy while it was travelling to Sarguja district. Since Mr. Singh had made the allegation when the Assembly session was on, the BJP-led Opposition wanted answers from the government on the floor of the House.  The Minister wanted Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu to clear his name in the Assembly. However, when Mr. Sahu’s statement in the House failed to clear Mr. Deo’s name, the Health Minister walked out in protest. The incident only added to the speculation that Mr. Deo has been upset with the party leadership over ignoring his claim to the top post. However, party leaders, including Mr. Punia, denied that there was an agreement in December 2018 — when the Congress formed the government — that the party would rotate the top post between Mr. Baghel and Mr. Deo. In mid-July, Mr. Baghel was asked about the power-sharing formula when he visited Delhi. “The high command instructed me to take the oath [as Chief Minister], so I took the oath. When they say someone else will be the Chief Minister, then it will be so,” he said. However, playing down the talk of a rivalry, AICC leaders said the meeting between Chhattisgarh leaders and Mr. Gandhi was fixed “sometime ago” to review the work of the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/is-the-split-wide-open-in-chhattisgarh-congress/article36070837.ece
24 August 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Railway Minister reaffirms Odisha ties with Jan Ashirwad Yatra||Over 100 meetings in six Lok Sabha constituencies in seven Odisha districts within just four days by road and rail is a difficult proposition even for leaders in active politics. But for Aswini Vaishnaw, Union Minister for Railways, Communications and Electronics, and Information Technology, who entered parliamentary politics two years ago, the unprecedented reception he received during his recent Jan Ashirwad Yatra kept him going and helped him re-establish his ties with Odisha. The Minister in the Narendra Modi government had begun his professional life from Odisha as a civil servant in 1996 and left the State in 2003. The public had little idea about Mr. Vaishnaw before he made a dramatic entry into the Rajya Sabha race in June 2019. Bid by BJD So much was his “utility” that Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had initially announced his candidature from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). However, the BJP leadership managed to field him as their candidate. He again stunned political circles with his induction into Mr. Modi’s Cabinet. Mr. Vaishnaw hails from Rajasthan. His carefully crafted visit to the undivided Kalahandi, Balangir and Koraput districts (KBK region) reaffirmed his political identity with Odisha. The KBK region lacks adequate railway integration, and one-fourth of the country’s villages unconnected by the Internet is in Odisha. The Minister’s visit has triggered a new wave of expectations. Certain non-political citizens’ forums even queued up to give representations to Mr. Vaishnaw, seeking his intervention for the development of rail connectivity. The former IAS officer travelled to the districts by train and collected feedback from passengers. During his roadshows, he talked to roadside vendors, sipped tea with party workers and mingled with the public. His eloquent Odia also gave him an edge. With just one visit, Mr. Vaishnaw has managed to create an impression of a leader who is accessible and can deliver. Though the visit was part of the Jan Ashirwad Yatra planned by the BJP to introduce its new Union Ministers to the public, it assumes importance ahead of the panchayat and civic body polls scheduled early next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railway-minister-reaffirms-odisha-ties-with-jan-ashirwad-yatra/article36070844.ece
24 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Jewellers’ token strike partially successful||The nationwide token strike called by jewellers on Monday was partially successful as large and corporate jewellers stayed away by opening their showrooms and carrying out business as usual. However, jewellers from the MSME category responded overwhelmingly to the call of National Task Force on hallmarking to protest against what they called arbitrarily implemented HUID (hallmarking unique ID) in the implementation of mandatory hallmarking process in the country by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The jewellers clarified that they were not against hallmarking but against HUID, which tracks every piece of jewellery, the customer, and jeweller, through the unique id. MSME jewellers through their Sarafa Associations were seen observing the token strike in several cities. Some shops were open in Zaveri Bazaar, the jewellery hub of Mumbai. In Vizag and many other cities, the big retail chains were kept open, according to available information. Dinesh Jain, representing jewellers from the MSME segment, said: “The token strike received wholehearted support from over 300 associations in the east, west, south, central and north regions. Except for few corporates [jewellers], almost 90% stakeholders have remained closed today, demanding HUID to be replaced with successful and consumer friendly old 4-mark hallmarking.” Muthu Venkatraman, representing Southern Region said, “The complexity of hallmarking can only be understood by a jeweller.” Samar Kumar De, representing the Eastern Region said, “Each and every corner of Bengal responded 100% to the strike.”  Members of the All Kerala Gold & Silver Merchants Association (AKGSMA) Alappuzha District Committee protested by burning HUID order in front of BSNL central office and AKGSMA general secretary K. Surendran referred to Monday as a black day and all members wore black marks. The National Task force was formed by 350 Associations/Federations representing all four zones of the entire Gems & Jewellery Industry. The objective of this committee is to ensure a smooth implementation of mandatory hallmarking across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jewellers-token-strike-partially-successful/article36070804.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Modi non-committal on Bihar team’s demand||The BJP’s Janak Ram, who was part of the delegation, said Mr. Modi heard out everyone’s view like the “guardian of a family”. Everyone was “satisfied” and the Prime Minister’s decision would be acceptable to all, he added. Congress MLA Ajit Sharma, who also attended the meeting, said the caste census would remove the current hostility about reservation. “The census is essential to identify the creamy layer which has been cornering the reservation benefits so far which irks the forward caste,” Mr. Sharma said. The recent narrative on caste census built up by the Bihar parties could impact the Uttar Pradesh election. A senior leader who was part of the delegation, said that when every political party in the country was demanding a caste census and with the BJP themselves claiming that they were not against it, the Centre would be hard put to delay it. “The OBC community in every State is getting restive.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Fix I-T portal by Sept. 15, FM directs Infosys CEO||She also conveyed ‘the deep disappointment and concerns of the Government and taxpayers about the continuing glitches in the Income Tax e-filing portal’. The Infosys CEO, who was ‘sensitised on the difficulties’ taxpayers were facing and the repercussions of delays in the portal’s functioning, explained that ‘he and his team are doing everything to ensure the smooth functioning of the portal’, as per a statement from the Finance Ministry. The fresh September 15 deadline proposed after the Minister met Mr. Parekh, indicates that taxpayers’ woes will last for almost another month, and even then, the full functionalities of the portal that the Finance Ministry had promised will ensure ‘immediate processing of income tax returns and quick refunds’ will remain a work in progress. Along with other features, a mobile app was to be released subsequent to the initial launch of the portal. “Familiarisation with the new system may take some time, so, the Department requests the patience of all taxpayers and stakeholders for the initial period after the launch of the new portal and while other functionalities get released since this is a major transition,” the IT department had said ahead of the portal’s launch in June. Citing the difficulties reported by taxpayers in electronic filing of IT returns, the Finance Ministry had earlier allowed a few forms to be submitted manually instead of online. Over 750 team members are working on the IT project and Infosys CEO Pravin Rao is personally overseeing this project, Mr Parekh told Ms. Sitharaman. “Mr. Parekh also assured that Infosys is working expeditiously to ensure a glitch-free experience to the taxpayers on the portal,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fix-i-t-portal-by-sept-15-fm-directs-infosys-ceo/article36070816.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Piyush Goyal hints at tit-for-tat trade curbs||Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday asked industry bodies to identify obstacles imposed by countries to restrict India’s exports and promised that the government would respond ‘appropriately’ to such curbs. The Minister’s remarks, suggesting that the Centre is not averse to taking retaliatory trade policy measures to counter export barriers beyond the realm of tariffs and duties, came at an interaction with industry bodies on achieving the $400 billion merchandise exports target for the year. “(The Minister) urged all to share the experience on non-tariff barriers so that India can take appropriate response ,” the Commerce Ministry said. The statement came after the Minister’s comments at the closed-door meeting. Last week, the Minister had promised a fresh approach towards free trade agreements, while disclosing that an Indo-U.S. trade deal is off the table and the government would look to resolve non-tariff barriers with the U.S. instead. When the U.S. had dropped India from the Generalised System of Preferences for exports from developing countries in 2019, India had responded with tariff hikes on over two dozen U.S. products. “The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles,” Mr. Goyal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/piyush-goyal-hints-at-tit-for-tat-trade-curbs/article36070818.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Tewari’s tweet exposes Punjab Cong. rift again||The remarks by Mr. Tewari came a day after Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd.) took strong exception to the recent comments by the advisers — Malvinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg — on social media on issues such as Kashmir and Pakistan. Mr. Mali is a retired teacher and political analyst, while Mr. Garg is the former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health and Sciences. While Mr. Garg reportedly questio- ned Captain Amarinder’s criticism of Pakistan, Mr. Mali is said to have written that “Kashmir is a country for Kashmiri people”. Mr. Tewari tweeted: “I urge Harish Rawat, AICC gen secy in charge of Punjab, to seriously introspect that those who do not consider J&K to be a part of India and others who have ostensibly Pro-Pakistan leanings should be a part of Punjab Congress.” Mr. Tewari added, “It mocks all those who have shed blood for India.” While Mr. Sidhu is said to have summoned his advisers over the remarks, the tweet from Mr. Tewari, known to be close to the Punjab Chief Minister, once again exposed the faultlines within the State unit. Speaking to a news agency, Mr. Rawat, however, said the statements by the advisers “may have been twisted”. “I had sought information. Sidhu ji and some others say that statements were twisted. There is a possibility that political advantage is being sought at the time of polls,” Mr. Rawat said. Before the Congress high command formally appointed Mr. Sidhu as the chief of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, leaders in the Capt. Amarinder camp had pointed out how Mr. Sidhu’s perceived soft corner for Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan could pose a problem for the Congress in the run-up to the Assembly election early next year. Despite stiff opposition from the Chief Minister, Congress president Sonia Gandhi asserted herself and appointed Mr. Sidhu as the PPCC chief last month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tewaris-tweet-exposes-punjab-cong-rift-again/article36070820.ece
24 August 2021||New Delhi,||Give keys of residential portion: HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the city police to hand over the keys of the residential portion of the Nizamuddin Markaz, which has been locked since March 31 last year, to its occupants. Justice Yogesh Khanna gave the direction while hearing a plea by the mother of Jamaat leader Maulana Saad. The judge directed that the keys be handed over to her within two days. ‘No entry’ elsewhere The court additionally clarified that the occupants cannot enter any non-residential portion of the property till further orders. It noted that the mother, who was living in the premises with eleven family members, cannot be allowed to stay in guest houses. “What is Section 60 [of Evidence Act on oral evidence], Section 310 [CrPC on local inspection]? What Sections have you put? Preserving a site does not mean you lock. Take photos and move from the site. What was recovered? Case was only that people were residing there,” it said. The petition said on March 31, 2020, the entire Nizamuddin Mosque was vacated and locked for the purported purpose of sanitisation and disinfection by the authorities. To extend utmost cooperation to the authorities, the keys of the centre, including the residential portion, were handed over to the Delhi police on April 1, 2020. “However, several months have elapsed since the handing over of the keys and the petitioner or her family have not been made aware for what reason or under what authority they are being prevented from entering or accessing their own residence,” the plea said. The court will hear the case again on December 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/give-keys-of-residential-portion-hc/article36070821.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the NTCA to decide the representation in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy. The High Court’s order came on a petition by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal on the issue of alleged rampant illegal construction going on in tiger breeding habitat of the Corbett Tiger Reserve in Uttarakhand. Mr. Bansal, in his plea, said that the illegal construction of bridges and walls in the breeding habitat shall not only disturb the whole ecology of the Corbett Tiger Reserve, but it is also against the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Forest Conservation Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-against-construction-in-corbett-reserve/article36070800.ece
24 August 2021||Kolkata,||CPI(M) suspends Professor for articles in TMC paper||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has suspended Ajanta Biswas, daughter of former State secretary Anil Biswas, for writing essays, titled Bangarajinitite Narishakti (women in Bengal politics) in Jaago Bangla , the Trinamool Congress’s mouthpiece. The Professor of History of Rabindra Bharati University was suspended by the Kolkata district committee of the CPI(M) for six months on August 21. She went on to praise Mamata Banerjee by writing in detail about her political career. Ms. Biswas said the movement at Singur against the Tata Motors small car project was “gana bikhop” mass movement. Anil Biswas, West Bengal secretary of the CPI(M) from 1998 to 2006, was one of the most important leaders of the CPI(M) known for his deft organisational skills. While the suspension came as no surprise, the question is what prompted Ms. Biswas to write essays in Jaago Bangla and why did the mouthpiece accept such a write-up. The CPI(M) and the professor have not made any remarks on the development.  Senior CPI(M) leader Rabin Deb told The Hindu that the Trinamool Congress was trying its best to minimise the strength of the CPI(M), belittle the legacy of 34 years of rule of the Left Front, which was led by the CPI(M), and the entire episode illustrated this. Political observers feel that there is more to the development that the Trinamool is trying to appropriate the legacy of the CPI(M). Biswanath Chakraborty, Professor and Head of the Department of Political Science at Rabindra Bharati University, said the incident should not be looked into in isolation. The 2021 Assembly election was a crucial moment when in the name of campaign of “No Vote to BJP”, the Left supporters and intellectuals supported the Trinamool, and the incident should be looked in that light. Political observer Subhamoy Maitra said the controversy was only because Ms. Biswas is the daughter of a well-known senior CPI(M) leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-suspends-professor-for-articles-in-tmc-paper/article36070808.ece

24 August 2021||Mumbai,||Uddhav appeals for muted Dahi Handi festival||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday appealed to dahi handi festival mandal s to observe restraint in celebrations this year owing to the pandemic, in the wake of Niti Aayog’s warning of the possibility of a devastating third wave in India next month. “Let’s keep our festivals and celebrations aside for some time to save lives of people. We should send this message to the world that Maharashtra prioritised health over everything. It is time to face the pandemic with patience and resolve,” Mr. Thackeray said in an online meeting of representatives of dahi handi groups, Ministers, doctors, political leaders, and officials. Mr. Thackeray said that restrictions had been in force for over one-and-a-half years now. “One must realise that these restrictions are to save lives. Some are talking about agitating against the restrictions. They would do better if they protested against corona than the government,” he said. Reiterating that relaxations in the pandemic restrictions are only to keep the economy running, Mr. Thackeray said the present “window period” is to be used only to extend relief to the poor. “If the oxygen demand for COVID-19 patients goes above 750 MT, then we will be left with no option but to implement lockdown, yet again,” he added. Senior doctors, including members of the State task force against COVID-19, explained the reasons behind the need to show restraint in dahi handi celebrations. “The festival involves a human pyramid where ‘Govindas’ climb upon each other, water is thrown. A wet mask is useless for protection against the virus. One patient in a group may infect the entire troupe. We should celebrate the spirit of dahi handi by organising blood and medicine donation camps,” Dr. Sanjay Oak said. Meanwhile, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded that the government allow a traditional dahi handi in the spirit of the festival. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said, “Low height handis with minimum crowd and only those with two doses of vaccine should be allowed. This is our demand. The Sena is neglecting it, but we will continue to push for it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uddhav-appeals-for-muted-dahi-handi-festival/article36070842.ece

Stalin intervened and requested Speaker M. Appavu to expunge the remarks. The Finance Minister, in turn, pointed to some remarks made by Mr. Palaniswami, and they were expunged, too. Mr. Munusamy continued with his speech and thanked Mr. Stalin for his intervention. He said Mr. Rajan had conscience, hence he had recently apologised in the House for his remarks directed at AIADMK MLA V. Sampathkumar. The Speaker joined the debate and said Mr. Rajan’s apology proved him “magnanimous”. Mr. Munusamy, too, concurred and said the Minister had the “maturity”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-didnt-cut-tax-on-petrol-even-once/article36071025.ece
24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Kodanad case accused, witness approach HC with contradictory pleas||The present controversy over the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case has now spilled over from the Legislative Assembly to the Madras High Court with a few accused as well as a prosecution witness approaching the court with contradictory requests. Revision petition While three accused -- D. Deepu, M.S. Satheesan and A. Santhosh Samy -- filed a revision petition against the trial court's refusal to grant permission for examining former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, V.K. Sasikala and others, the witness 'Anubhav' Ravi alias Ravi insisted on completing the trial at the earliest. Mr. Ravi, a jeweller-cum-realtor based in Coimbatore, told the court that he was also the joint secretary of AIADMK's Amma Peravai in Coimbatore city. He claimed to have got acquainted with prime accused Kanagaraj (since dead) when the latter was a driver to one of his friends, Ashok Kumar of Chennai. Phone call Claiming to have been watching a movie at a cinema in Coimbatore on April 28, 2017, the petitioner said that he received a phone call from Kanagaraj on that day stating that he and his friends had robbed the Kodanad Estate, jointly owned by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and Ms. Sasikala, a few days ago and ended up murdering the watchman, Om Bahadur. The petitioner reportedly advised the driver to surrender before the police and later learnt that he had surrendered before Sankagiri Deputy Superintendent of Police. Prosecution witness Stating that he had also been introduced to the surviving prime accused K.V. Sayan once but severed the ties, the jeweller said the police had included him as one of the prosecution witnesses in the case. He recalled that in 2019, the Supreme Court had rejected activist ‘Traffic’ K.R. Ramaswamy's plea to order a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the heist-cum-murder. Subsequently, the High Court had, on multiple occasions, ordered completion of the trial within three months. Yet, the matter was prolonged and now the prosecution had decided to conduct further investigation in the case, he complained. He urged the court to stay further investigation into the case and issue a consequent direction to the trial court to conduct the proceedings on a day-to-day basis. On the other hand, in their revision petition, the three accused urged the High Court to set aside an order passed by the Nilgiris Sessions Court on April 30 and consequently permit them to examine Mr. Palaniswami, Ms. Sasikala, J. Elavarasi, V.N. Sudhakaran and a few others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kodanad-case-accused-witness-approach-hc-with-contradictory-pleas/article36071046.ece

24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City jewellers oppose new rules||Members of the Chennai Jewellers’ Association and The Jewellers and Diamond Traders Association, Madras, downed shutters for a few hours on Monday in protest against new hallmarking rules. They staged a demonstration on N.S.C. Bose Road and held placards against the move to provide Hallmarking Unique ID (HUID) for every piece of jewellery. The token strike coincided with the nationwide protest. Around 7,000 shops remained closed between 9 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. against HUID being made mandatory. The Bureau of Indian Standards had made gold hallmarking mandatory for 14, 18 and 22 carat jewellery since June 1. While BIS said that updating details on the portal would improve the quality of hallmarking and ensure purity of gold, jewellers complained about it as a tracking mechanism and HUID caused delay in hallmarking of each piece of jewellery at the assaying centres. There were about 120 assaying centres in the State as of now. Jayanthilal Challani, president, The Jewellers and Diamond Traders’ Association, Madras, said: “We have to share data on the entire chain of manufacturing and sale process for HUID.” Moreover, jewellery with HUID once sold would be considered as old jewellery. Customers would have to bear with wastage and other charges during exchange even within a few days of purchase, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-jewellers-oppose-new-rules/article36071000.ece
24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Facilities upgraded at govt. medical college in Omandurar||A slew of facilities to improve treatment, including for COVID-19, were commissioned at the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Government Estate, here on Monday. They included an oxygen generator that can produce 500 litres a minute, a 24x7 COVID-19 preventive vaccination centre and a 15-bed paediatric intensive care unit. Health Minister Ma. Subramanian, who participated in the event, said the oxygen generator was established with support from the Corporate Social Responsibility fund of the Infosys at a cost of Rs. 1 crore. According to him, in 55 healthcare institutions, such as government and medical college hospitals, besides eye and peripheral hospitals, round-the-clock vaccination centres had been opened. The paediatric ICU, equipped with ventilator, had been established with Rs. 30 lakh from Rotary International and Rs. 1.20 crore from the health department’s funds, he said. Efforts were on to procure Covaxin available with Apollo Hospitals. “We are in talks with Apollo Hospitals to administer 5 lakh doses of Covaxin in its possession. We are coordinating with the hospital to provide Covaxin free of cost to those waiting for their second dose. We hope to complete the coordination process in a couple of days after which we will start administering the vaccine,” the Minister said. The department had urged the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation to extend the tenure of temporary COVID-19 workers, who had complained to him that they were being terminated. He said he had urged the Corporation to retain the workers until December and that the letter extending their term would be issued to them. Mr. Subramanian urged people to not let their guard down just because the government had relaxed the lockdown norms. People should continue to wear mask and observe COVID-19 protocols, he said. HR and CE Minister P.K. Sekarbabu and senior officials of the Health Department officials were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/facilities-upgraded-at-govt-medical-college-in-omandurar/article36071006.ece
24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No traditional priest was ousted from service, says HR&CE Dept.||The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department has asserted before the Madras High Court that no traditional Archaka (temple priest) has been ousted from service in the State to accommodate those who had pursued one-year certificate course in Agama Sastras at training institutes run by the department as part of the government’s move to appoint priests from all caste groups. The submission was made in a counter affidavit to a sub-application moved by All India Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal Seva Sangam to include over 30 temples in the State as respondents to a writ petition filed by it alleging discrimination against traditional priests. The department said, new appointments had been made only in the place of vacancies that had arisen long back due to retirement or otherwise of the traditional priests. Pointing out that the retired priests had all along been allowed to continue till the filling up of the vacancies through direct recruitment and that some of them had been engaged on daily wage basis too by individual temples, the department said, even now, after making regular appointments through direct recruitment, those traditional priests had been allowed to perform Archaka service in some other sannadhis or sub temples. As per law The counter filed through Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram stated that the latest advertisements for filling up the Archaka vacancies were issued by individual temples as per law and not by the HR&CE department. It also stated that the Supreme Court in the famous Seshammal case (1972) had held that an Archaka was only a servant of the temple concerned and could not be regarded as religious head. Denying the charge that many temples in the State had begun to insist upon completion of one-year certificate course for Archakar appointment only to eliminate the traditional Sivachariyar (priests of Saivite temples) and Bhattachariyar (priest of Vaishnavite temples), the department stated that prescription of minimum qualification was essential and elementary for appointing any person. It said that the traditional priests who had undergone training for much longer period in a Gurukul system were also being considered for the post on presenting certificates from their gurus. The court was told that only 23 out of 58 priests appointed recently to various temples in the State had undergone one-year certificate course in the Archaka training institutes run by the department. The State government had constituted a high-level committee in 2006 and the latter had prescribed syllabus as well as duration of training for the post of Archakas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-traditional-priest-was-ousted-from-service-says-hrce-dept/article36071018.ece
24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Waterbodies will be created, rejuvenated across T.N.: Minister||The Water Resources Department (WRD) will construct waterbodies and channels to conserve floodwater. This was one of the key announcements made by Water Resources Minister Duraimurugan in the Assembly on Monday. While waterbodies would be created in Vellore, Theni and Dindigul districts, the WRD would build channels in Thoothukudi, Tiruvannamalai, Tiruvallur, Tenkasi and Villupuram to save rainwater that went waste. The WRD would also construct groynes and seawalls in Chennai, Tirunelveli, Kanniyakumari, Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi districts to check sea erosion and minimise seawater incursion into fishing villages. Sources in the WRD noted that such structures in the Ennore Estuary and the mouth of the Cooum in Chennai were part of the 16 projects to be implemented. About 200 waterbodies in 23 districts, including Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur, would be taken up for repair, renovation and restoration with the Union government’s financial assistance. The scheme is aimed at desilting the waterbodies and increasing their storage to help improve agricultural productivity and drinking water availability. Similar projects would be executed in the river basins, including those of the Kosasthalaiyar and the Kovalam, with assistance from NABARD, sources said. Work is in progress to desilt lakes at Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam at a cost of Rs. 20.44 crore and boost their storage to meet the needs of Chennai. There are plans to take up desilting in the Red Hills at an estimated cost of Rs. 9.90 crore. Clearing silt in these four waterbodies would help to restore the capacity of 1,904 million cubic feet. Construction of buildings for various circles and divisional offices and for the Institute of Hydrology and Hydraulics at Poondi in Tiruvallur district was one of the announcements made in the Assembly. These buildings would be completed in five years. Besides upgrading the standards of the Irrigation Management Training Institute in Tiruchi, new institutes would be built in Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai with funding from the Union government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/waterbodies-will-be-created-rejuvenated-across-tn-minister/article36071038.ece

24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Delay in reaching Jayalalithaa led to Chennai floods: Minister||The issue of water release from the Chembarambakkam reservoir in December 2015 that led to the floods in Chennai resurfaced in the Assembly on Monday. Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan alleged that “a break and interjection” in contacting the then Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, resulted in the disaster. Recalling a report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, Mr. Rajan said the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority had not met even once in three years until 2015. “The government was not able to evolve regulations,” he said, responding to former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s argument that 60 cm of rain on a single day was responsible for the floods. “I will bring the report and place it in the House. Let the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader clarify the issue thereafter,” Mr. Rajan said, pointing out that even the report was not tabled for two years under the pretext of seeking a clarification from the Accountant-General. Mr. Rajan said he could see “excess of democracy” in the Assembly, and was happy about it. “When I was a member of the Opposition, those who were in power did not give us an opportunity to express our views,” he said, referring to the permission given by Speaker P. Appavu to AIADMK members. Mr. Palaniswami, however, said that when waterbodies were full during the rainy season, local officials could decide on water discharge, and they need not get permission from anyone. “Permission is required only to release water for irrigation,” he said, responding to A.P. Nandakumar, of the DMK, who alleged that the delay in reaching the then Chief Minister had caused the floods. Mr. Palaniswami had said two days ago that the rain in Chennai caused traffic jam. “In 2015, Chennai received 60 cm of rain on a single day, and the runoff from over 100 waterbodies had also flowed into the Chembarambakkam reservoir.”  Recalling a CAG report, Mr. Rajan said the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority had not met even once in three years until 2015||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-reaching-jayalalithaa-led-to-chennai-floods-minister/article36071027.ece

24 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||DMK leader goes down memory lane||Senior DMK leader and Minister Duraimurugan on Monday recalled his long involvement in the Department of Water Resources, which was first allocated to him by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. In his reply to the debate on the demand for grants for the Department in the Assembly, he said M. Karunanidhi had allocated the portfolio to him several years ago. “Thalaivar said he was allocating the portfolio to me with the same sentiment that [former Chief Minister] Anna had while handing it to him [Karunanidhi].” Unlike other Ministers who could run their departments by staying in the Secretariat, the one who handled the Public Works Department (which had earlier included the Department of Water Resources) had to visit riverbanks and lakes, Karunanidhi had told him. As the Minister who had handled the PWD and the Department of Water Resources, Mr. Duraimurugan claimed credit for the construction of more than 20 dams in the State. “Even the construction of some of the dams that were initiated during the AIADMK government were completed by me. Among them was the Sothupparai dam,” he said. When the DMK returned to power this year, party president M.K. Stalin asked him for his choice of portfolio. “I chose this portfolio because I have a great deal of involvement in it for several years,” he said. The signing of the file for supplying free electricity to farmers moved him to tears, the Minister said. “We had three pumps, and my mother lost her gold ornaments every time we paid the electricity bill.” The senior DMK leader said he was touched by the resolution moved by Mr. Stalin to felicitate him for his 50 years of service in the Assembly. Hence, he was speechless. “In a way, our Chief Minister is the reason I could not speak today,” he said in a lighter vein.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-leader-goes-down-memory-lane/article36071028.ece
24 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Duraimurugan marks 50th year of entering Assembly||Water Resources Minister and Leader of the House Duraimurugan, who first entered the Tamil Nadu Assembly 50 years ago in 1971, turned emotional on Monday when the House, led by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, felicitated him. The DMK veteran had won in 10 Assembly elections — eight times from Katpadi and twice from Ranipet — and lost only on two occasions in the five decades. The Minister vowed to follow the path of the Dravidian Movement and Mr. Stalin, the DMK president. Mr. Duraimurugan, who is known for his debates and oratory, could not complete his sentence as he became emotional and took his seat with folded hands. Vacuum filled Earlier, thanking the Chief Minister for moving a resolution and members of the House who spoke in praise of his contribution, Mr. Duraimurugan said, “I would live up to the faith you have reposed in me.” “I do not know how I will repay the love showered on me. My leader has so much love for me and if it were some other place, I would have hugged him and cried. I thought there would be a vacuum after the death of my leader [former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi]. But Mr. Stalin has not only filled the vacuum but also gone further and excelled,” he said. Mr. Duraimurugan recalled that he had moved closely with former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai, Karunanidhi and M.G. Ramachandran, and now with Mr. Stalin. “For the first time, I am at a loss for words to express my feelings.” Recalling his association with Karunanidhi, his “guide, mentor and a friend with whom he would spend hours chatting”, Mr. Duraimurugan said, “Kalaignar asked about my caste only when he fielded me in the election. He treated me like a friend even when I was a student.” Mr. Stalin said he would be envious sometimes as Karunanidhi would spend hours with Mr. Duraimurugan. “If he did not visit our house, Kalaignar would ask us to call him,” he recalled. “When he was admitted to hospital for a surgery, Kalaignar spent the whole night with him.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/duraimurugan-marks-50th-year-of-entering-assembly/article36071030.ece

Jayadevan has said that spurious automotive fuel sold as biodiesel can damage vehicles and pollute the environment. “It has recently been observed that some suppliers of an automotive fuel of dubious quality, purported to be ‘BioDiesel’ are mushrooming in the market and are involved in clandestine marketing of this spurious product. Such suppliers are stealthily operating out of covered nondescript godowns without name boards,” he said. Genuine biodiesel with specifications of BIS 15607/2016 (B-100) can be marketed only with the approval of the State government. The premises selling biodiesel should have valid statutory licences meeting Class B petroleum safety standards. In markets like Salem, Namakkal, Sankari, Tuticorin, Erode and Coimbatore, the unauthorised sales of this spurious product had been polluting the environment and damaging vehicles, Mr. Jayadevan said. Meanwhile, Namakkal Lorry Owners’ Association has said that it would seek licence to sell biodiesel since its members were demanding it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spurious-fuel-can-damage-vehicles-iocl/article36070998.ece

Panneerselvam of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) to move applications before a special court seeking exemption from personal appearance in a criminal defamation case filed against them by former party spokesperson V. Pugazhendhi who was ousted for indulging in “anti-party activities”. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar told senior counsel Vijay Narayan that applications could be filed under Section 317 of CrPC to dispense with their appearance on August 24. If the special court passes any adverse order, then the duo could approach the High Court for appropriate relief, he said. The judge said this when the senior counsel insisted on early hearing of cases filed by them for quashing the criminal defamation case. It was brought to his notice that the special court had issued summons requiring the presence of the two AIADMK leaders on August 24 and hence there was an urgency in hearing the quash petitions. After hearing him out, the judge said it had been his consistent practice to hear petitions related to the special court, constituted for trying cases booked against legislators, only on Fridays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/move-special-court-in-defamation-case-says-hc/article36071441.ece

24 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||600 saplings planted on reserved site in Saravanampatti||Greening of a reserved site in Emerald City Park, Saravanampatty, began here on Monday with the planting of a sapling by Corporation Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. Sources said the Corporation had joined hands with Pricol Rural Development Programme and the Siruthuli to develop a Miyawaki garden on the 90-cent reserved site. On the first day on Monday, around 600 saplings were planted, including the palm saplings supplied by the Kovai Kulangal Pathugappu Amaipu . The periphery of the garden area would have palm, the State tree of Tamil Nadu and the inner lines would have native species. Palm was chosen because it was a good water harvesting species, the sources said and added that the reserved site would also have a walkers’ path. The initiative received good response from residents in the neighbourhood in that children from the families there also joined the sapling plantation drive.

24 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Plea to drop charges against farmer Gopalsamy in Ottarpalayam incident||Tamizhaga Vivasayeegal Sangam, a non-partisan farmers’ association, has urged the Coimbatore district administration and the police to drop charges against farmer Gopalsamy, against whom the Annur Police have registered a case on charges of ill-treating a Dalit village assistant in Ottarpalayam VAO’s office. Petition  In a petition to Collector G.S. Sameeran, the association’s General Secretary T. Venugopal said that after a video showing the Dalit village assistant falling at Mr. Gopalsamy’s feet went viral, the association members met the District Revenue Officer (DRO) on August 10 to explain the entire truth. They had told the DRO that the video that went viral did not depict the incident in full, the Revenue Department officials had fudged Mr. Gopalsamy’s land records and sought action against them. On August 13, the association members released the video recording of the entire incident where the Dalit village assistant was shown assaulting Mr. Gopalsamy, Mr. Venugopal said and added that the association’s demand for dropping charges against Mr. Gopalsamy had not been met, even though 10 days had passed. The administration was yet to act against the Revenue Department officials who had fudged Mr. Gopalsamy’s land records, the association said and demanded that the administration initiate steps to dismiss the then Ottarpalayam Village Administrative Officer Kalaiselvi and Village Assistant Muthusamy. Further, the farmers’ association also sought action against the person who claimed to be a journalist and released the video in parts, as his action had led to the entirely avoidable controversy. The farmers submitted a similar petition to the Inspector General of Police West Zone, demanding that the case against Mr. Gopalsamy be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-drop-charges-against-farmer-gopalsamy-in-ottarpalayam-incident/article36071050.ece

Sri Ram, president of Tamil Nadu Gold Silver Diamond Traders Federation, said they had sent memorandums to the Ministry and officials concerned against the move.

24 August 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||Reaching out to students, podcast style||A radio jockey with Kodai FM before taking up teaching in 2014. Now, in the times of a pandemic, P. Karthikeyan, a post-graduate teacher in commerce, has launched a new initiative this Independence Day to reach out to students of his school who face difficulty in accessing online classes. Though online teaching has picked up momentum among urban students, lack of connectivity and devices still keep many rural students away from formal learning. This motivated Mr. Karthikeyan to launch a podcast-based digital teaching method at Government Higher Secondary School in Esanatham in Karur district. The aim is to ensure connectivity to all students including those with access only to 2G supported mobile phones .In this intitiative, he had the backing of P. Marudhaiveeran, headmaster of the school, and his colleagues. In the first phase, a series of digital audio files on various lessons was aired and stored by the school as podcasts. The audio link was then sent to students in Class XI and Class XII through bulk text messages. Now, many students have begun to listen regularly to the audio lessons posted by their teachers on a daily basis on the podcast. Those, who have subscribed to the podcast, get notification of the new audio files. “The lessons are available not only to those who have access to smartphones, desktops and laptops but also to those with 2G supported button phones. There is a mechanism to monitor usage of digital podcasting by students as well,” says Mr. Karthikeyan. His technical and practical experience with All India Radio has come in handy to reach out to students in a smart way. The podcast service has 7,000 followers. Students of many districts, including Karur, Dindigul, Namakkal and Tiruchi, regularly listen to the audio classes, says Mr. Marudhaiveeran. The school has planned to launch a dedicated podcast service to blind students from September 5, adds Mr. Karthikeyan, recipient of ‘Kanavu’ teacher award from the State government in 2017 for using information and communication technology in teaching and learning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reaching-out-to-students-podcast-style/article36071138.ece
24 August 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||Communist martyrs to remain ‘freedom fighters’||Martyrs of the communist movement of Kerala, including the ones killed at the Punnapra-Vayalar, Kayyur, Karivelloor, and Kavumbayi uprisings, will remain as freedom fighters in the annals of India’s struggle for Independence. A three-member committee appointed by the Indian Council of Historic Research (ICHR) to review the entries in the fifth volume of the ‘Dictionary of Martyrs: India’s Freedom Struggle (1857-1947)’ is understood to have left the martyrs of the Left movement untouched. The fifth volume covered freedom fighters from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Solely on 1921 rebellion The ICHR had recalled the publication and appointed a review panel after a section of the Sangh Parivar historians strongly objected to the inclusion of the martyrs of communist movement and the 1921 Malabar Rebellion in the compendium, which was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier. The committee is understood to have recommended the deletion of the Malabar Rebellion leaders Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji, Ali Musaliar, and 387 other ‘Moplah martyrs’ from the list. The review panel deliberated exclusively on the 1921 rebellion and did not touch upon the other uprisings in Kerala, all the original entries in the dictionary except the ones related to the 1921 rebellion from the State would stay, ICHR sources said. The names of 84 martyrs of Punnapra-Vayalar uprising, who participated in the movement for responsible government in Travancore, and against Diwan C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar’s ‘notorious proposal for setting up an American model of administrative arrangement’ have found place in the dictionary. Civil disobedience Nearly 80 other martyrs, including those killed in the police firings at Neyyattinkara, Kollam, and Puthupally, and those who lost their lives while participating in the civil disobedience movement would stay on the list, according to indications. There were no objections to the inclusion of Kayyur martyrs, including Aboobacker and Chirukandan of Kayyur, “who walked to the gallows shouting Inquilab Zindabad and Communist Party Zindabad” and “died as brave communists.” Abu and Chattukutty, who were killed in the Tellichery police firing on September 15, 1940, have passed muster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/communist-martyrs-to-remain-freedom-fighters/article36070865.ece
24 August 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||Removal of names slammed||The proposal to remove the names of Malabar Rebellion leaders Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji, Ali Musaliar, and other ‘Moplah martyrs’ from the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle has evoked sharp response from various quarters. Historian M.G.S. Narayanan felt that the changed political circumstances in the country might have influenced the decision, which he said was “not right and not good.” ‘Not a freedom fighter’ However, he felt that Kunhamed Haji could not be considered a freedom fighter. “He was interested in freedom. But there is no need to place him in a position of stature,” he said.  The Hindu had reported that a subcommittee appointed by the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) had recommended the deletion of names. The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) said that martyrs of freedom struggle would live in the hearts of the people, and not in records. “Even if you rewrite or erase the records, nothing can be erased from people’s hearts,” said IUML national general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MLA. IUML district president Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said that one should not be thankless to those who fought for the land. “By trying to deal with history dishonestly, you are doing a great injustice to the next generation,” he said, referring to the Sangh Parivar. Kerala Muslim Jamat State general secretary Sayed Ibrahim Khaleel Bukhari too condemned the move. “The removal of the names of those who fought the British would be the biggest shame for independent India. Patriots will never accept it,” he said. K.M. Jafar, a member of the Chakkiparambu family of Kunhamed Haji, said the names were included on the list after a lot of research. Several Hindu leaders had joined hands with Kunhamed Haji in the fight against the British, which disproved the arguments that the rebellion was anti-Hindu, he said. Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) State general secretary P. Abdul Hameed termed the move anti-national. BJP’s voice BJP national vice president A.P. Abdullakutty described Kunhamed Haji as Kerala’s first Taliban leader. Setting up a memorial and glorying him as a freedom fighter amounted to distortion of history. Malabar Rebellion was neither a peasant revolt nor a freedom struggle, but an act of Hindu genocide, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/removal-of-names-slammed/article36070856.ece

24 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Jewellers oppose HUID norm||Jewellery shops on South Avani Moola Street, South Masi Street and West Masi Street that form the ‘jewellery cluster’ in the city, downed their shutters until 11.30 in the morning on Monday, to show their dissent over the Central government’s decision to make Hallmark Unique Identification Number (HUID) mandatory. Shopkeepers of more than 1,000 stores that come under the Jewellers and Bullion Merchants Association of Madurai and hundreds of others outside it, stood in front of their closed shops, with placards that opposed the move. G. Dakshana Murthy, president of the association, said, “In June this year, the government implemented mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery with HUID (Hallmark Unique Identification Number). Gold jewellery does require generalised standards to ensure quality, in the form of Hallmark, but we are opposing the introduction of HUID. As far as southern districts in the State are concerned, a majority of the jewellery shops are small-scale ones. They make plenty of jewellery pieces that are less than 10 gm. To get these jewels hallmarked with the HUID is practically difficult, with only seven government-approved hallmark centres in the city for the more than 1,500 shops. It is taking more than five to six days to get HUID for one set of jewels. Small-scale traders can’t afford to wait that long as their business practices are traditional.” Some jewellers also pointed out that the store had to hire one or more extra staff to organise and put HUID entry for all the jewels.  There are only seven -approved hallmark centres in Madurai for the more than 1,500 shops Jewellers’ association||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jewellers-oppose-huid-norm/article36071352.ece

After the recent death of the 292nd pontiff, Sri La Sri Arunagirinadha Sri Gnanasambanda Desika Paramacharya Swamigal, the historic Shaivite mutt had announced that Harihara Desika Swamigal would become the next pontiff as he was appointed as the junior pontiff of the mutt in 2019. Sri La Sri Harihara Sri Gnanasambandha Desika Swamigal was born as ‘Bagavathi Lakshmanan’ to Gandhimadhinadhan Pillai and Janaki Ammai in 1954 in a village called Udankudi in Tirunelveli. He became a saint when he was 21-years old. For about 39 years, he held different positions in famous Shaivite mutts such as Kundrakudi Adheenam, Thiruvavadudurai Adheenam and Dharmapuram Adheenam. The ceremonies kick-started with a puja inside the mutt in South Avani Moola Street, at 8 a.m. At 11 a.m., the pontiff visited the Adhenaam’s place in Munichalai where Arunagirinadha Swamigal’s mortal remains was laid to rest and a Guru Puja was conducted. A little later, the 293rd pontiff’s anointing ceremony took place in the presence of Masilamani Desika Paramacharya Swamigal. After that, a Maaheshwara Puja was performed by saints from different Shaivite mutts across Tamil Nadu. Later in the evening, the pontiff, along with the other saints, visited the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple. Pattina Pravesam, a procession in which the pontiff was carried in a palanquin-like structure around the four Chithirai Mada Streets, was also held. Then, he returned to the mutt to provide his blessings to some devotees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/293rd-pontiff-takes-over-at-madurai-adheenam/article36071010.ece
24 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Take steps to maintain temples, says HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed that properties of religious institutions, temples in particular, must be maintained properly so as to generate more income to spend for their betterment. The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department had started implementing the same, but at a snail’s pace, said a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and B. Pugalendhi. The courts had time and again observed that temples in Tamil Nadu were not only sources of identification of the ancient culture, but also testimony to the pride and talent in the field of arts, science, sculpture and a conduit for spiritual activities, the judges said. Taking note of the report submitted by the HR and CE Commissioner, the judges said it appeared that approximately 5.17 lakh acres of immovable properties belonged to temples as per data available. But the extent of available temple properties disclosed was 4.78 lakh acres. This means 39,000 acres of land were in the hands of encroachers. Therefore, the authorities must take steps to maintain temple lands, the judges said. The court was hearing a petition filed by A. Radhakrishnan. The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities to safeguard properties of Sankara Rameswarar and Vaikunda Pathi Perumal Temple in Thoothukudi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-steps-to-maintain-temples-says-hc/article36071169.ece
24 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Establish medical college in places where there is none, says HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has disposed of a petition as premature that sought a direction to the State government to include 11 new government medical colleges in the State in the counselling for admission to MBBS/BDS courses. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and B. Pugalendhi took note of the fact that the construction was going on, creation of infrastructure and equipment was in the process which was a prerequisite for the National Medical Mission approval. When this was the case, it was not expected to include the 11 colleges for counselling, the judges said and directed the State to take steps to create infrastructure such as construction of buildings, laboratories and equipment at the earliest. Taking into account the fact that at least 16 to 20 private medical colleges were located in and around Chennai, the court observed that crowding the medical colleges in one area will not help the cause. Once a medical college is established, it is not only for the benefit of medical students but also for treating the people of the particular region. Therefore, medical colleges must be established where there are none, the judges said. The court was hearing a petition filed by K. R. Vasudevaa of Madurai. He sought a direction to the State to include the 11 new medical colleges in counselling. In 2020, the government announced 11 new medical colleges in Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Namakkal, the Nilgiris, Dindigul, Tiruppur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvallur, Ariyalur, Krishnagiri and Kallakurichi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/establish-medical-college-in-places-where-there-is-none-says-hc/article36071348.ece
24 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Ex-Judge seeks removal of road from temple land||Retired Judge of the Madras High Court A. Selvam has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to authorities to remove a road laid on a temple land in Pulankurichi in Sivaganga district. Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy sought a response from the State. In his petition, Justice Selvam said the temple land was known as ‘Sri Uruman Aalayam’ or the resting place of the God. There was a large number of trees around the temple. The petitioner said his father and forefathers served as the temple priest. They followed customary practices that included prohibition of use of footwear on the temple premises and commercial activities, including laying of roads, on the temple land. Under these circumstances, a road was laid on the land. The temple was taken over by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department in 1975 and nobody could lay a road on the land without the permission of the department. The authorities concerned inspected the area and passed an order to remove the road. But, no steps were taken in this regard. He had also sent a representation to the authorities, but to no avail, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ex-judge-seeks-removal-of-road-from-temple-land/article36071147.ece

Under the guidance of the organisation, the students are learning and spreading awareness about animals like Sangai, Nilgai, fishing cat, clouded leopard and flying lizard. One of the students, M Soumiya Nandhini, says, “One of the main aspects of conservation of biodiversity is protecting the animals. Apart from the popular Asian elephants and Royal Bengal tigers, people do not know much about the variety of animal species in India and why some of them need to be protected. Most of us do not even know our own State animals. Hence, we are trying to keep people informed about unfamiliar animals like pangolins, dhole, the Himalayan wolf and many others.” The students have been doing write-ups, social media posts and podcasts on these topics. Priyadharshini Rajendran, HOD, says, “The college conducted a series of lectures about biodiversity in Madurai last month. It led to students having an interaction with the portal and trying to help them with their awareness campaigns.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ldc-students-familiarise-themselves-with-wildlife/article36071353.ece

24 August 2021||MAYILADUTHURAI,TAMIL NADU||Warring fishermen keep away from sea||Though the situation has calmed down between the two warring groups of fishers supporting and opposing banned purse seine nets in the district, both sides continue to keep away from the sea. A strong posse of police personnel has been deployed to prevent law and order problems triggered earlier this month when a group of Poompuhar-based fishermen on a mechanised boat cornered another group belonging to Vanagiri mid-sea and damaged their fibre-glass boat. Three fishermen were injured. The situation escalated when a group of fishers from Vanagiri retaliated by setting on fire four fibre glass boats belonging to the opposite group. Police booked cases against perpetrators on both sides and seized the mechanised boat. “As such, there is no restriction on fishers entering the sea with permitted nets. The situation will ease further after a few more arrests [of absconding fishers] are made in a day or two,” Superintendent of Police Suguna Singh said. Meanwhile, fishers of Tranquebar have resumed their fishing activities. The police and fisheries departments have tightened vigil to prevent fishers of both mechanised and fibre boats from using nets with gaps that are smaller than the permitted level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/warring-fishermen-keep-away-from-sea/article36071124.ece

The agency reportedly seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai, 16 luxury cars and 2 kg of gold.

24 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||National Fisherfolk Forum submits memorandum to Union Minister||The National Fisherfolk Forum (NFF) has taken up with Parshottam Rupala, Union Minister for Fisheries, a set of key demands, including making diesel costs affordable as fuel expenditure had a direct and day-to-day bearing on their livelihood struggle. In a memorandum submitted recently to the Union Minister in Delhi, NFF chairperson M. Ilango pointed out that traditional fishermen use motorised boats, boats with out-board motors (OBM) and mechanised boats, and diesel was the main propelling fuel for craft that ventured into the sea for multiple days (though in some States, catamarans use kerosene as fuel for their OBMs). Fishermen, who undertake long expeditions, spend anywhere between few thousand and few lakh rupees per trip on fuel expenditure alone. Quite often, they return without sufficient catch to meet expenses and end up paying heavy interest for loans taken from private money lenders. “We request that fishermen be provided diesel and kerosene at cost price, without any customs or excise duties, service tax, sales tax or any other impost or cess,” said the memorandum of the NFF, which is the only national-level organisation that has membership in all 36 States of India, including all 13 coastal ones. Apart from fuel at cost price, the NFF also raised among its key demands, the long-standing appeal to include traditional fisher communities in the list of Scheduled Tribes and enhance Budgetary allocation in the newly-minted Ministry of Fisheries, given that the sector was earning foreign exchange to the tune of Rs. 45,000 crore per annum and contributing to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The community is also seeking recognition of fishing on a par with agriculture. Mr. Ilango, who was part of delegations that have been engaged in consultations on important fishermen issues with the Centre at several levels since NDA-I, said while negotiations did result in the formulation of several national-scale schemes for fishermen, the renewed focus of NDA-II under Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the coastal community raised hope that some other important long-standing issues would also be addressed. He pointed out that negotiations had been on for years to have a separate Ministry for Fisheries, bifurcating it from the Ministry of Agriculture. During the interim Budget presented in February 2019, it was announced that the existing Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairy and Fisheries, under the Ministry of Agriculture, would be bifurcated and a new Department of Fisheries would be constituted. The NFF, that did not accept this announcement, had been pushing its case and welcomed the Prime Minister’s decision to carve out a separate Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, following through on his announcement from April 2020, Mr. Ilango said. The NFF memorandum, which welcomed schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Matsaya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), urged the Centre to extend the benefit of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana to the fishing community, popularise fuel efficient fishing equipment and communication devices through subsidy schemes.  We request that fishermen be provided diesel and kerosene at cost price, without any customs or excise duties M.

24 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||‘Afghanistan shows what fundamentalism brings’||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said the powerful current of humanism that animated the teachings of 19th century social reformer Sree Narayana Guru is a panacea for the world riven by communal and racial conflicts. Inaugurating the birth anniversary celebrations of the Kerala renaissance leader via videoconference from Kannur, Mr. Vijayan used the occasion to condemn the rise of religious fundamentalism in Afghanistan. He said Afghanistan was an example of what would happen to a nation consumed by religious fundamentalism. “Fundamentalism is a destructive fire that lays civilisations and nations to waste,” he said. Only humanism could douse such destructive conflagrations. The Guru’s teachings moored to compassion, universal peace, human rights, and tolerance provided answers to the world’s woes, he said. Mr. Vijayan remembered the plight of the oppressed people of Palestine and the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He said communal hatred often reared its head in India. ‘Rights being throttled’ “There has never been a time in history where religious fundamentalism throttled the rights of human beings at such a global scale,” he said. The Guru had emphasised the essential oneness of humans irrespective of their race, culture, caste, creed, religion, gender or skin colour. He had overcome the powerful forces of caste in Kerala’s 19th century feudal society by spreading reason, education, enlightenment, and pacifist thought, the CM said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/afghanistan-shows-what-fundamentalism-brings/article36070869.ece
24 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Residents oppose private cement factory||Public from S. Kailasapuram village in Thoothukudi district opposed the setting up of a cement factory by a private player in their locality. The villagers, who were represented by advocates Santhana Sekar and Ramachandran, urged the district officials at the Collectorate on Monday to issue orders to stop work by the private sector in larger public interest. The district was already facing pollution-related issues, they said. At a recent public hearing, the villagers had opposed the establishment of the cement plant. However, the construction activity was going on. Apprehending that the factory may be commissioned in the near future, they sought firm action immediately from the Collector. ‘Open Sterlite’ A large number of youth from Pandarampatti, Kayaloorani, Nainarpuram, Sillanatham and T. Kumaragiri villages submitted a petition seeking to reopen the Sterlite plant here. The youth told reporters that some people had misguided the government and as a result, they had closed the unit. "We are all living in the same hamlets for the last two decades...we are hale and hearty. The Sterlite had given jobs to 3,000 people directly and indirectly from our hamlets," they claimed. Apart from this, they said that the company had also helped many children in pursuing their education, built community halls, drinking water projects and also constructed libraries in many panchayats. Considering these aspects, the government should immediately order reopening of the unit, they stressed. Permission sought Members from various Hindu outfits said that they have been celebrating the Vinayaka Chaturthi in a grand manner in the district. The pandemic had come as a stumbling block. With the relaxation announced by the government, they urged the district administration to give permission to display the Vinayaka idols on September 10 and also give bandobust for the procession and subsequent immersion of the idols on September 12. The members gave an assurance that they would adhere to the covid-19 protocols and were ready to give an undertaking to the Collector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-oppose-private-cement-factory/article36071475.ece

24 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Draining of polluted water from Teppakulam under way||Tiruchi Corporation has begun pumping out polluted water from Rockfort Teppakulam near Main Guard Gate. The move comes in the wake of the death of a large number of fish in the tank a few days ago and demand from traders and devotees of Thayumanaswamy Temple for action. The Corporation engaged a team of swimmers to remove the dead fish and the team also caught live ones. A foul smell emanated from the tank even after the dead fish were removed. So, the civic body has now embarked on a drive to pump out the water in the tank. Corporation Commissioner P.M.N. Mujibur Rahuman told The Hindu that three motor pump sets had been deployed to pump out the water. While the central part of the tank had water to a depth of 18 feet, its peripheries had about 10 feet. It had been decided to clear as much water as possible. Depending upon the situation, fresh water could be filled up. There was also a possibility of letting the tank fill up naturally during the northeast monsoon, which was round the corner. Mr. Rahuman said steps would be taken to prevent traders from dumping waste and food leftovers in the tank. The traders and the general public had been warned against dumping waste in the tank. Notice boards would be erected at various locations to create awareness of the need to keep the temple tank neat and clean.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/draining-of-polluted-water-from-teppakulam-under-way/article36071126.ece
24 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||All set for loco journey from Golden Rock railway workshop to Nilgiri mountains||An indigenously manufactured coal-fired steam locomotive manufactured for the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is all set for dispatch from the Golden Rock Railway Workshop here. It will mark yet another milestone in the workshop's chequered history. Trials have been successfully conducted at the workshop for the newly manufactured ‘X’ class loco fitted with rack and pinion arrangements to chug in the hilly and scenic terrain. The loco, which has been given a coat of polyurethane painting to boost its aesthetic appeal, is to be flagged off by Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas on Wednesday at the workshop that is more than 90 years old. The new loco will be dispatched by road to Mettupalayam where trial runs will be conducted on the hilly terrain before being deployed for regular operations. A technical team from the workshop will go to Mettupalayam when the trial runs are conducted on the NMR stretch. Milestone “This is the first time that the workshop has manufactured a coal-fired steam locomotive for operation in the NMR section, which will mark another important milestone for the workshop,” said Chief Workshop Manager Shyamadhar Ram. Loco pilots from the NMR section carried out trials at the workshop and were impressed with the performance of the new loco, senior officials said. The manufacture of the metre gauge loco was taken up after the Railway Board, New Delh,i entrusted the workshop with the task and sanctioned around Rs. 9 crore for the project. The workshop has all along been carrying out periodic overhaul of Swissmade coal fired steam locos in operation in the NMR section. But, this is the first time that the workshop has manufactured a coal-fired loco to run on the mountain stretch, Mr. Shyamadhar Ram said. Although the workshop had originally planned to dispatch the loco in February last, the project suffered delay for more than a year due to outbreak of COVID-19. The pandemic led to closure of the workshop for some period of time and caused delay in supply of critical components such as cylinders. The work gained momentum after the workshop resumed to function with full strength following relaxations announced by the State government and supply of cylinders. The new loco weighing 50 tonnes is fitted with an all-welded boiler suitable for coal firing and a steam powered turbo generator for producing electricity to power head lamps and for cabin lighting.  Water tanks The coal bunker for holding over three tonnes of coal is placed at the rear side of the loco pilot cabin. The loco has two stainless steel water tanks of a total combined capacity of 4,500 litres. The length of the new loco is 10,380 millimetre with its height being 3,420 mm. The new loco is provided with a vaccum brake system with hand brake arrangement in the loco pilot cabin besides dynamic braking and band brake arrangement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-set-for-loco-journey-from-golden-rock-railway-workshop-to-nilgiri-mountains/article36071128.ece
24 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Cinema halls remain closed||Cinema theatres in the city remained shut on Monday despite the State government allowing them to reopen with 50% capacity. However, cleaning and sanitising works got under way at the cinema halls in line with COVID-19 safety protocols, say exhibitors. “No theatre in the city reopened on Monday as there were no new film releases starring leading actors. Also, there were no other movies that could generate good collection,” said A. Loganathan, former president of Tiruchi Exhibitors Association and owner of a theatre in Tiruchi. Further, exhibitors would feel the heat as they would not be able to generate required collections with 50% capacity as permitted by the government. The expenditure in respect of paying electricity, wages for the staff and other miscellaneous expenses would surpass the revenue in the current situation, Mr. Loganathan said. The government announcement also came at a short notice. The theatres in Tiruchi might reopen after a few days, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cinema-halls-remain-closed/article36071132.ece
24 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Road widening work begins near TVS Tollgate, Ariyamangalam junctions||Meeting a long-felt need, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has begun work on widening the service lanes on either side of Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road near the TVS Tollgate Junction and also the carriageway on Thanjavur-Tiruchi NH stretch at Ariyamangalam traffic intersection in the city. The narrow service lanes near TVS Tollgate have emerged as traffic bottlenecks as the two-lane service roads are narrow and the bus halts close to the junction. The service road leading towards Golden Rock from TVS Tollgate Junction has, in particular, become a dangerous stretch as vehicles from different directions converge at the spot. A large number of vehicles take left from the junction to head towards Golden Rock. A slew of hotels and roadside eateries has come up along the service lane close to the junction in recent years and visitors invariably park their vehicles on the roadside. With police turning a blind eye to the problem of indiscriminate parking, road users face a harrowing time. Besides, whenever mofussil and town buses halt at the bus stops on either side, there will be a pile-up of vehicles. Despite a few policemen being on duty constantly on the road overbridge at the junction, chaotic traffic conditions prevail. Hence, widening of the road stretch near the junction is expected to help ease the situation. However, road users say roadside parking in front of hotels and eateries need to be regulated. “A large number of vehicles can be seen parked along service lanes, constricting road space. With the service lane leading to Golden Rock catering to a heavy traffic volume, it is a must that some sort of order is restored,”says R.Gopal, a commuter. NHAI is currently engaged in building storm water drains on the project stretch and the works are expected to be completed shortly. NHAI has also begun road development works at Ariyamangalam junction where a stretch is being widened to allow smooth free left turn on the carriageway leading to the city from Thanjavur. Work on construction of storm water drains is also under way at the site. The narrow stretch at the junction has resulted in traffic snarls and there has been demands to widen the short stretch to allow a free left turn for vehicles heading towards Senthaneerpuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/road-widening-work-begins-near-tvs-tollgate-ariyamangalam-junctions/article36071492.ece

Vishnu to consider them for deployment in other government hospitals. Submitting a memorandum at the weekly grievance day meeting here on Monday, the nurses said that they were working in Koodankulam Government Hospital in Tirunelveli district since the covid-19 pandemic surfaced last year.

With another 45 days time for the harvest, the farmers urged the Collector to give directions to the officers to visit their fields before the situation worsened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temporary-nurses-demand-jobs-in-ghs/article36071477.ece
24 August 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Four arrested for abducting youth||Tiruppur District Police on Monday arrested four men in connection with the kidnapping of a youth by a seven-member gang at Kangeyam for a ransom of Rs. 3 crore. According to the police, the gang abducted E. Sivapradeep (22), son of Eswaramoorthi, and his driver Satham Hussain at Kangeyam on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Sivapradeep was travelling in his car when the gang allegedly intercepted him at Veeracholapuram Pirivu claiming to be police personnel. They proceeded to abduct the two and stole their car. The gang contacted Mr. Eswaramoorthi, a rice mill owner, through the driver’s phone and demanded a ransom of Rs. 3 crore. On Sunday evening, he met the gang members on Oddanchatram-Dindigul road and handed over the ransom, following which Mr. Sivapradeep and Mr. Hussain were released. Mr. Eswaramoorthi visited the Kangeyam police station at around 9 p.m. on Sunday and lodged a complaint regarding the kidnapping for ransom, following which a case was registered and eight special teams were formed to trace the accused. Within 24 hours of the kidnapping, the police arrested Sakthivel (37), Augustine (45) and Balaji (38) from the Mattuthavani Bus Terminus in Madurai and Bashir (32) from Krishnagiri. Out of the Rs. 3 crore, a total of Rs. 1,89,94,000 was retrieved from the four accused. Efforts to nab the remaining three accused are under way, according to the statement.

24 August 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Farmers’ movement is about ‘breaking company raj’: Rajendra Singh||The farmers’ movement demanding the repeal of three farm laws is about “breaking the company raj,” asserted water conservationist Rajendra Singh on Monday. He, along with Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait and Yudhvir Singh, participated in a farmer’s conference dubbed ‘Maha Panchayat of Tamil Nadu Farmers’ organised at Koduvai in Tiruppur district. Mr. Singh told mediapersons the Centre must ensure that all farmers received water for agriculture. He alleged that the water was instead being offered to corporates. “ Pani (water), jawani (youth) and kisani (farmers) all three are in a crisis,” Mr. Singh said. He also flagged the pollution of Rivers Noyyal, Cauvery, Bhavani, and Amaravathi in the State. Mr. Tikait said the conference opposed the construction of transmission towers on agri lands, which was not just a local issue but a nation-wide issue. He said he would visit all States in southern India to garner support for the agitations. “We want to show [that] the movement is not only from some States or region; it is a national movement,” Mr. Singh said. He recalled that farmers’ leader from Coimbatore district Narayanasamy Naidu was the first president of BKU when it was formed in 1983.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-movement-is-about-breaking-company-raj-rajendra-singh/article36071168.ece

24 August 2021||TIRUVANNAMALAI,TAMIL NADU||Restrictions tightened in Tiruvannamalai till August 29||Rising COVID-19 cases in the temple town has made the Tiruvannamalai district administration tighten the existing lockdown, with more restrictions, including the closure of all parks, swimming pools and dams in Tiruvannamalai and the neighbouring Kattam Poondi, starting August 23. The stricter restrictions, which were announced by Collector B. Murugesh, late on Monday, will be in force till August 29. Among the restrictions announced, eateries will be allowed to function only between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. on all days, and takeaways will be open till 10 p.m. All shops, including hawkers and petty traders, can operate between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Likewise, only 50% occupancy should be maintained in restaurants and tea shops, and the owners and staff must be fully vaccinated. Fines for not wearing face masks, not maintaining physical distancing in public places and 50% occupancy in government buses are other measures that have been announced. Restrictions were intensified after the daily COVID-19 case count in the district crossed the State’s daily average, according to the district health officials. At present, the Tiruvannamalai Municipality has a total of 39 wards, covering key areas like Pallavan Nagar, Thenimalai, Samuthivam Kalani and Ajish Colony, with a population of around 8 lakh. The easing of more lockdown restrictions, especially since July 11, has increased the flow of traffic in the town. Key routes, including Tiruvannamalai Road, Vellore-Thoothukudi High Road, Perumpakkam Road, Polur Road and Avalurpettai Road, have been witnessing pre-COVID-19 levels of traffic congestion, since most of these connect the famous Arunachaleswarar temple to adjoining districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restrictions-tightened-in-tiruvannamalai-till-august-29/article36071438.ece

The district closed to tourists on April 20, during the peak of the second wave, and only travellers to the district visiting on essential work were being allowed. E-passes and negative RT-PCR test reports were also made mandatory for visitors from the neighbouring States. The Government Botanical Garden, the Rose Garden, Sims Park in Coonoor, as well as tourism spots being run by the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC), such as the Ooty Boat House and the Pykara Boat House were opened to the public on Monday. Officials from the district administration said that e-passes and negative RT-PCR test reports were still mandatory for visitors to the Nilgiris from Kerala, but that visitors from Karnataka, which also borders the district, would not need any documents to enter the Nilgiris. Visitors were allowed into the parks and gardens run by the Horticulture Department with strict guidelines in place to minimise the chance of COVID-19 infection. Hand sanitisers were placed at the entrance, while workers at the gates were told to prevent crowding and to ensure the use of masks and that people maintained personal distancing norms. Horticulture department officials said that around a 1,000 people had visited the GBG since Monday morning, but that visitor numbers tailed off as the day progressed due to heavy rain in Udhagamandalam town.

24 August 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Interstate bus services resume from Vellore district||The first day of resumption of interstate bus services from Vellore by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) on Monday received a lukewarm response from commuters with many of the buses operating near empty. The interstate bus services have been operated since April when the ban on such services came into force as part of safety measures against COVID-19. Initially, 50 buses are being operated by the TNSTC in Vellore region, mainly to neighbouring States like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, covering key places like Bengaluru, Tirupati and Chittoor. Of the 50 vehicles, 23 are operated to Karnataka and the rest 27 for Andhra Pradesh. Commuters with face masks were allowed to board buses at the temporary bus terminus for long distance travellers. Buses have been equipped with disinfectants with only 50% of seats allowed for commuters. At present, buses to Gudiyatham, Ambur, Tirupattur, Hosur and Bengaluru have been allowed to use the new temporary bus terminus behind Selliamman temple in Vellore. Likewise, buses to Arakkonam, Tiruttani, Kancheepuram and Chennai have also been using the new temporary bus stand. However, all city buses from Vellore to Arni, Tiruvannamalai, Gudiyatham and Chittoor via Katpadi are being operated from the old bus stand on Anna Salai near the Fort complex. Officials of TNSTC said that Monday being the first working day of the week, many buses did not have much crowd. More importantly, during the ban period, commuters from Vellore board local buses to reach the border checkpoint at Christianpet near Katpadi, from where they walk a few 100 metres to reach Andhra Pradesh border check-post to board buses operated by the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) to go to Tirupati and Chittoor. Similar is the case with those travelling to Karnataka during the interstate bus ban period. As a result, officials said commuters did not find much difference in boarding buses directly from Vellore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/interstate-bus-services-resume-from-vellore-district/article36071445.ece

This adage seems to have found resonance in a seven-year-old girl who has overcome a physical disability to excel in silambam , an ancient Tamil martial art form. Yashika, daughter of R. Veeraraghavan and Gomathi of Marakkanam, was born with three fingers on both her hands. Despite her physical condition, the girl battled all odds and learnt silambam . “Initially, Yashika faced difficulty in even holding small objects. She underwent an operation on her right hand when she was two years old to improve mobility, but it did not help. We felt that Yashika would be able to use her hands only when she gained strength in her fingers. So we decided to get her trained in silambam to increase hand movement,” says Mr. Veeraraghavan. The family lived close to a silambam training school and approached P. Sathish Kumar, the martial arts teacher who agreed to train her. “Yashika underwent training for two years, learning the moves and improving her skill. The art involves one-on-one combat and the moves were further elaborated during training,” said Mr. Kumar. With hard work and determination, Ms. Yashika illustrated various techniques using maan kombu (antlers), surul pattai (steel-blade whip) and has now excelled in silambam , he added. Now, Ms. Yashika is adept in the art form and has bagged the gold in a silambam e-competition held during the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/seven-year-old-girl-from-marakkanam-overcomes-adversity-excels-in-silambam/article36071443.ece

Sameeran’s Sunday order allowing commercial establishments to remain open till 10 p.m., shops across the city continued to function beyond 5 p.m., the earlier deadline for shops to close. Shoppers continued to visit the shops and busy old town areas around Oppanakara Street, Raja Street, Thomas Street, and those in and around Gandhipuram like100 Feet Road were busy after dusk. The extended business hours also saw traffic on streets in those areas even by 8 p.m. Sources in the Coimbatore Corporation said Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara had instructed officials who were part of mobile monitoring teams and zonal enforcement teams to ensure that all shops shut by 10 p.m. During the business hours, he wanted the teams to ensure that COVID-19 appropriate behaviour was adhered to, both by business establishments as well as shoppers. In Tiruppur, president of the Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners’ Association Tiruppur M.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Inter-State public transport between T.N. and Karnataka resumes||The inter-State border was opened to Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation buses at Zuzuvadi in Hosur after a year and a half on Monday. At Hosur bus stand, a semblance of normalcy returned with the KSRTC buses rolling into the premises. Until Monday, people had to find alternative means of transport up to the border. Even as the Tamil Nadu public transport was operated in a staggered manner, the inter-State public transport remained frozen due to the prevailing pandemic restrictions laid down by the Karnataka government. In its wake, the border at Zuzuvadi in Hosur and the border along Bagalur were barricaded for buses. This also meant the increasing reliance on tempos and autos apart from the infrequent town buses that went up to the border. With the resumption of bus services by both the states, the night time commuting traffic is expected to go up. The KSRTC buses witnessed moderate occupancy on Monday. In Erode district, due to a spike in cases, bus services between the two States through Hasanur and Talavadi were halted in May. Since Karnataka did not allow vehicles and buses to pass through its check post at Pulinjur to reach Talavadi, vehicles were allowed to use Dhimbam – Talamalai forest road to reach Talavadi. After the norms were relaxed, buses were operated from Erode and Sathyamangalam to Mysuru and Bengaluru while KSRTC also operated its buses to various destinations in the district. Buses from various depots under the Salem Division were operated to Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka based on public demand. Officials said all staff under the Division were vaccinated and COVID-19 safety protocols would be followed while operating the services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inter-state-public-transport-between-tn-and-karnataka-resumes/article36071156.ece

Among various segments of the sector, agriculture topped the list with 6.89% growth. In absolute terms, the value of agricultural production was estimated at Rs. 53,703 crore. The grain production was 113.4 lakh tonnes, of which rice (paddy) accounted for nearly 73 lakh tonnes and millets 36 lakh tonnes, with pulses constituting the rest. As for the other agricultural crops, the production of sugarcane was 128 lakh tonnes, oilseeds 9.82 lakh tonnes and cotton 2.5 lakh bales. While livestock and fishery put up an equally impressive show, the outliers in the primary sector were forestry and logging and mining and quarrying. For the second year in a row, the segment of mining and quarrying showed negative growth. This time, it was about minus 17.8%. There was not much to talk about the secondary sector, comprising manufacturing, construction, electricity and other utility services. The sector had managed to show a positive growth of 0.36%. As for the services sector, the performance was marginally better than that of the secondary. Financial services did an impressive job with 10.83% and real estate scraped through with 0.62%. Predictably, the other segments such as hotels, restaurants, transport and communications took a beating. As per an estimate, taxes of all types — the Goods & Services Tax, customs and excise duties — fetched the State about Rs. 1.6 lakh crore last year, about Rs. 3 lakh crore higher than the previous year. The value of subsidies on products such as food, fertiliser and petroleum, about Rs. 20,590 crore, was approximately Rs. 2,000 crore lower than that of 2019-20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-posts-positive-growth-amid-pandemic/article36071023.ece

There is a lot in common among us but language continues to be a barrier. The proposed study centres would help us understand each other,” he said. He noted that there were many similarities between various dimensions like spiritualism, art, food and cultures of India and Japan. “We continue to be hugely influenced by Buddhism that was introduced to Japan around the sixth century. The influence is on our history, culture and way of life. Six of the of the seven important Gods who are worshipped by the people of Japan during new year celebrations, are of Indian origin,” he said. Later, he participated in a Q&A session with students.He said that a synergy between India’s youth power and the skilled production capabilities of Japan could lead to sustainable development. Around 500 companies of Japan origin have their offices in Karnataka, he said. To a query, he said the secret of longevity of the Japanese was nutritious food and recreation. M.B. Patil, former minister and BLDE society chairman hoped that Japan and India would work together for tourism development and processing of horticulture produce and finding remunerative markets for horticulture crops.

Karnataka is the first State to implement the National Education Policy (NEP). All higher education institutions should admit students by providing exit options and allowing students to opt for multidisciplinary subjects.

24 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police still searching for body of woman killed by husband||The Soladevanahali police, along with the Fire and Emergency Services personnel, are on the search for the body of a 28-year-old woman, who was allegedly killed by her husband over a domestic row and whose body was dumped in a lake around 20 days ago. The incident came to light on Monday when the parents of the deceased filed a complaint about the mysterious disappearance of their daughter and suspected the role of their son-in-law. The deceased has been identified as Shirin, 28, a resident of Tarabanahalli on Hesaraghatta Main Road, and the accused Mubarak. Shirin’s father Subhan Sab, a resident of Davangere, filed a complaint against Mubarak and four of his family members with the Soladevanahalli police claiming that they had killed his daughter. According to preliminary investigation, the police said that Mubarak had allegedly beaten his wife to death over a marital row. He later put her body in a bag and disposed it in the Chikkabanavara Lake. The police said on the day of the incident, Mubarak allegedly fought with his wife over food that she had prepared. He allegedly used to beat her up over petty issues and Shirin had gone back to her parents once, but returned after elders counselled them. However, the accused allegedly continued to harass Shirin over trivial reasons. The police searched for the body in the lake, but they are yet to find it. The suspects are being questioned by the police. “We suspect that someone helped Mubarak dispose the body in the lake and that someone from his family is also involved in the murder. It will be known only after thorough interrogation,” said an investigating officer. Shirin’s parents could not reach her for two to three days and when they enquired, Mubarak and his family allegedly didn’t respond to them properly. Later, the accused told her father that she was missing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-still-searching-for-body-of-woman-killed-by-husband/article36070946.ece
24 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC upholds second delimitation of wards in zilla, taluk panchayats||The High Court of Karnataka has declined to interfere with the delimitation of wards of some zilla and taluk panchayats carried out by the State Election Commission (SEC) for second time after the 2011 census while holding that revision of delimitation necessitated in view of the change in law on population range per member. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while upholding the legality of notification issued on delimitation of seats in Raichur zilla panchayat, Chikkanayakanalli, and Chickballapur taluk panchayats. It was contended in the petitions filed by Lingappa Goudoru and others that the process of delimitation carried out sans any fresh census was illegal as the seats were already denotified based on 2011 census way back in 2015. The petitioners had claimed that number of wards/seats were changed in view of fresh delimitation carried out by the SEC in 2020-21 affecting the electoral process. However, the SEC had pointed out that revision of boundaries of warranted in view of amendment made by the State Legislature in 2016 by amending the provisions of the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act, 1993 in revising the population range to determine the number of seats for zilla and taluk panchayats. The court noted that the law was amended in 2016 making one member for every population between 35,000 and 45,000 for zilla panchayats as against 40,000 that was existing earlier; and one member for every population between 12,500 and 15,000 as against 10,000 that was existing earlier. Besides, some of the areas, which earlier formed part of these panchayats had gone of the “rural area” definition in view of creation of town or city municipal councils resulting in change in number of population of the zilla and taluk panchayat areas, the Court noted while dismissing the petitions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-upholds-second-delimitation-of-wards-in-zilla-taluk-panchayats/article36070979.ece

This 14-bed ICU has been established with donation from Muhammed Majeed from Sami Labs and Sanjay Nagar Lions Trust,” he said. The paediatric ICU includes six step-down ICU beds where patients who need oxygen but no ventilator will be admitted, before being shifted to the general ward. The Infosys Foundation has spent Rs. 25.5 crore on the OPD block that is spread across one lakh square feet. This block will cover over 12 departments and nearly 1,800 patients can be accommodated every day, he said. Sudha Murty, Chairperson, Infosys Foundation attended the event virtually. Dr. Ramachandra said treatment at the bone marrow transplant block with 17 rooms, a PET scan block and Department of Nuclear Medicine will be provided for free for those below poverty line and at subsidised costs for others. “We have also got a Genomic lab and advanced molecular Onco Lab, two new OTs, a central medical store, five units of 64 Slice CT scan, two CT Simulators and Brachy Therapy unit, 50 patient monitors and a central sterilization unit inaugurated today. All these were pending due to COVID-19,” he said. Other units Lauding the institute and donors for establishing world-class facilities in a government hospital, the CM said one unit of Kidwai will be soon started in Bengaluru South and Hubbali-Dharwad. “There is a need for further research in cancer.

24 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP proposes to let go of penalty and interest on tax arrears||The civic body has now proposed to the State government to let go of the penalty and the interest on property tax arrears notices it issued for wrong classification of tax zones since the last five years. But, it insists that property owners should pay the arrears. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) over the last few months issued over 78,500 tax notices to property owners for not updating their tax zones in 2016-17, when a new classification was notified. Notices asked them to pay the arrears, interest, and penalty for the five years since. BBMP expected to mop up Rs. 360 crore: Rs. 120 crore in tax arrears and Rs. 240 crore in penalty and interest. Many objected, arguing that the BBMP is also at fault for not reflecting changes on the property tax portal, not publicising the changes enough in 2016, and waking up now. As an acknowledgement of its faults, BBMP now proposes to let go of the penalty and the interest, but expects owners to pay tax arrears of Rs. 120 crore. “The government must take a final call on the issue. The ball is now in the Chief Minister’s court, who also holds the Finance and Bengaluru Development portfolios,” a senior official said. A decision in this regard is expected to be taken next week, he added. The Bengaluru NavaNirmana Party (BNP), which has taken up a campaign in this regard and petitioned the Chief Minister on Monday, demanded a complete waiver of tax arrears too. Holding the BBMP responsible for the confusion and chaos, the BNP has demanded all tax notices be immediately withdrawn and the new classification of tax zones be implemented from the next financial year after wide publicity. The BNP has also threatened to hold multiple demonstrations across the city on August 28, if their demands are not met by then. However, civic officials said that the new tax zones have already been in effect from 2016-17 and lakhs of property owners have been paying their taxes as per the new zonal classification for five years now and waiving tax arrears for the 78,500, who did not update their zones, would be unfair to other tax payers. “The BBMP is also at fault which we concede by proposing to let go of the penalty and the interest. But owners are also at fault. They will have to pay the tax arrears,” an official argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-proposes-to-let-go-of-penalty-and-interest-on-tax-arrears/article36070942.ece

24 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Clarification issued by DPAR on promotion riles SC/ST employees||A clarification issued by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR) on reservation during promotion has riled government Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe employees, who say it violates the Consequential Seniority Act, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court. The issue has come up after the Udupi district administration sought a clarification from the DPAR during the promotion exercise. The objection is on the DPAR’s suggestion to the Udupi administration that following the roster system is necessary if 15% and 3% of the working strength is filled by SC and ST employees, respectively. ‘Suggestion illegal’ D. Chandrashekaraiah, president of the Karnataka Government SC/ST Employees’ Association, said, “This suggestion is illegal. The 1978 order that provided reservation in promotion has categorically stated that the roster system has to be followed in promotion. It has also stated that whenever an SC/ST candidate is not available, the posts can be filled up by general category candidates, and backlog can be created. These backlog posts are to be filled as and when SC/ST candidates are available. This suggestion to the Udupi administration violates both the principles. The Consequential Seniority Act, 2017, has been clear about how promotions are to be effected by the departments. Despite these clarification, officials keep mis-interpreting the Act only to inconvenience SC/ST employees.” Time sought On August 18, a delegation of SC/ST employees met Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar, who is learnt to have sought time to deal with the issue. Office-bearers of the association plan to meet on August 21 to discuss their future course of action even as they have sought an appointment from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Social Welfare Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/clarification-issued-by-dpar-on-promotion-riles-scst-employees/article36070969.ece
24 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ORR metro work: IT firms asked to extend work-from-home till December 2022||In the wake of the commencement of metro work on the Outer Ring Road (ORR), from Silk Board to K.R. Puram, the State government has come out with an advisory to IT companies. In the advisory issued by Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Electronics, IT&BT, E.V. Ramana Reddy, the State government has asked the IT companies, especially those located on ORR, to extend the work-from-home option for most of the employees till December, 2022. They have also been advised to stagger the working hours for employees working at office. To reduce the traffic congestion on the road, the companies have been asked to encourage employees working from office to take BMTC buses or employee bus services provided by the company by using bus lanes. The advisory has been sent to the regional director of the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) and circulated among the companies. The letter states that metro work on the 19-km stretch could take one-and-a-half to two years. ‘Traffic congestion’ “The ORR houses many tech parks and IT company campuses and carries a large amount of traffic throughout the day. The ORR, despite having six lanes and service roads, is infamous for its perennial traffic congestion,” the letter stated. The letter further stated that it would be extremely difficult to manage the traffic movement on ORR, especially if the IT companies resume work from the office. In response to the advisory, the Outer Ring Road Companies’ Association (ORRCA) stated: “ORRCA’s understanding is that the government is going to issue a revised statement following questions they have received on the advisory. We are waiting for the revised statement and will respond.” The ORR houses over 700 companies and 10 to 12 tech parks. When contacted, Mr. Ramana Reddy said: “Based on the suggestions from the Urban Development Department we have issued the advisory. It was intended to reduce the congestion on the road. I am reiterating that it is only an advisory and not mandatory”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/orr-metro-work-it-firms-asked-to-extend-work-from-home-till-december-2022/article36070954.ece

24 August 2021||Hassan/Mangaluru/Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Schools in five districts across State yet to open||Schools in five districts in Karnataka — Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Kodagu, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada — did not open either because COVID-19 positivity rate remained above 2% or just below. Below 2% Schools did not open in Hassan and Chikkamagaluru districts, though COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) had dropped below the 2% in both districts. In Hassan, PU classes restarted, while schools remained closed. When the State government had taken a decision to open Classes IX to XII in districts, the positivity rate was more than 2%. The district administration has resolved to wait for one more week to open high schools. Hassan DDPI K.S. Prakash said that Class IX and X could be opened next week if the positivity rate remained below 2% till then. Similarly in Chikkamagaluru, the district administration has decided to wait till the end of August. B.V.

Teachers try to reach out At Kodagu, DDPI Sridharan said that teachers will continue their efforts to reach out to children through online modes to ensure continuity in learning. “Once the TPR falls below 2%, Kodagu may also get the government’s nod for reopening schools. Our schools are also ready to conduct physical classes and it all depends on the pandemic situation,” said Mr. Sridharan. He said children living in some hilly areas of Kodagu are facing problems with Internet connectivity, causing disruption in their online classes. “In such areas, we have taken steps to deliver worksheets and other study materials to the children’s homes through teachers. Online as well as video classes are being done regularly. Our teachers are in touch with parents and children can clear over phone their doubts with lessons.” Mr. Sridharan said 95% of teachers in Kodagu had been vaccinated and the remaining are being covered.

Jagadeesha said that the district will make all efforts to bring down the positivity rate below 2% by August 30 and resume classes. Meanwhile, according to Education Department officials, a small number of students seemed to have attended classes in these five districts, which were supposed to be closed.

24 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||State’s first material recovery facility in rural area comes up at Nitte||Taking a big stride towards scientific handling of and ensuring value addition to dry waste, the Udupi Zilla Panchayat is all set to commission a material recovery facility to process up to 10 tonnes of dry waste per day covering 41 gram panchayats. The facility is said to be the first in rural Karnataka. Trial run at the facility set up at Padavu in Nitte village of Karkala taluk on one acre of land is already on where about three tonnes of dry waste is being processed every day. This, according to Udupi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Y Naveen Bhat, will help reduce the burden of dry waste segregation on gram panchayats besides adding value to dry waste. Panchayats, at present, segregate dry waste at their solid and liquid waste resource management (SLRM) facilities deploying manual labour. The Nitte facility gets dry waste from 27 gram panchayats in Karkala taluk, 10 in Kaup taluk, three in Udupi taluk and one in Hebri taluk covering 72,000 houses and 7,000 commercial establishments. While dry waste from the existing system is sold to scrap dealers, the processed waste at the facility directly reaches the end user thereby saving multiple incidences of transportation. Furthermore the processed waste commands a higher price against unprocessed waste. Machinery Established at an estimated cost of Rs. 2.5 crore, the facility is equipped with a conveyor belt, bailing machine, shredder machine, among others. Workers segregate dry waste into 15-20 categories as they move on the conveyor belt. One worker can separate up to 150 kg dry waste per shift as against 30 kg under the conventional system, said Zilla Panchayat Chief Planning Officer Srinivas Rao. Mangaluru-based start-up Mangala Resource Management Pvt. Ltd. promoted by the Ramakrishna Mission has won the bid to manage the facility by deploying about 30 workers. While each gram panchayat has to pay a fixed sum to the facility based on the weight of dry waste, the facility also gets revenue from selling the processed waste thus enabling it to run the show. Despite paying the fixed sum, gram panchayats stand to gain as they save on worker salary at SLRMs. Dr. Bhat said that gram panchayats store weekly collection of dry waste while the vehicle from the facility will collect and bring waste. The Nitte facility will be inaugurated by the second week of September, he added. While there are chances of dry waste remaining uncollected under the existing system, the new system encourages collection of every bit as the processed waste commands a higher price. For example, while pet bottles get Rs. 18 a kg under the present system, bailed pet bottles get up to Rs. 32 a kg. Similarly, shredded plastic used for road construction gets up to Rs. 22 a kg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/states-first-material-recovery-facility-in-rural-area-comes-up-at-nitte/article36071367.ece
24 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Railway Ministry urged to revise Vijayapura train schedule||Dakshina Kannada MP and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Monday urged the Railway Ministry to restore the Vijayapura-Mangaluru-Vijayapura daily special express that was cancelled in view of COVID-19, with revised timings. In a letter to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnav, Mr. Kateel said that the earlier timings of the service were inconvenient to the travelling public as the train arrived at Mangaluru Junction at 12.40 p.m. and left for Vijayapura at 4.30 p.m. Travelling public and passengers associations have represented to him to ensure the timings were modified to suit travellers. He suggested that the train should arrive at Mangaluru Junction or Mangaluru Central before 9.30 a.m. and it should leave at around 5.30 p.m. This measure would increase patronage too, he noted. If Southern Railway finds it difficult to stable the rake either at Mangaluru Junction or Mangaluru Central during the day, it may be stabled either at the Goods Shed or Ullal stations, Mr. Kateel said. Chennai train Mr. Kateel in another letter to the Minister drew his attention to the demand for introducing a direct train between Mangaluru and Chennai via Hassan and Bengaluru. He said that the present services are operated via Palakkad and Coimbatore entailing a distance of about 890 km while the new route reduces the distance by around 200 km (720 km). The direct train besides offering convenient service to the travelling public will generate good revenues to the Railways, the MP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/railway-ministry-urged-to-revise-vijayapura-train-schedule/article36071368.ece

Sunil Kumar said on Monday that the State government is thinking of creating a corporation after 19th century social reformer Narayana Guru. Speaking at the State level 167th jayanti celebrations of Narayana Guru in Udupi, the Minister said that Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has been consulted and he has responded positively.

24 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Relax laws to allow farmers to sell trees’||Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Welfare Shobha Karandlaje on Monday said that she has urged the Forest Minister of the State to look into simplifying forest laws that are affecting the farmer community. Speaking at a public felicitation programme organised in Puttur, Ms. Karandlaje said that the forest laws do not allow farmers to harvest trees grown on their patta land and sell them. When the laws are relaxed, farmers can be allowed to raise forest crops on their land, harvest them and either use them for their own purpose or sell them, she said. Ms. Karandlaje said that she and the former Union Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda grew up in politics in Puttur and are recognised at the national level. She was not a competitor to senior leaders, including Mr. Sadananda Gowda, Ms. Karandlaje said and added that he was her guide. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given an opportunity to her and she would work in such a way to add name to the government. The Union Minister said that steps would be taken to open agriculture laboratories in agricultural universities to test and certify agri-products, including honey. Though the Malnad region was known for apiculture, lack of testing was affecting it, she said. She said that the Union government was supporting agriculture in a big way. So far, it has released Rs. 1.57 lakh crore to 21 crore farmers under the Kisan Samman programme. Felicitating the Union Minister, MLA Sanjeev Matandur said that the coastal region felt honoured with Ms. Karandlaje being appointed a Union Minister. Since she rose from the grassroots fighting for the cause of the common man, she will be able to do justice to the farmer community in the country.

24 August 2021||Mangaluru/Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Decision on trimming ‘Nada Geethe’ before legislature session begins||The Karnataka government will take a decision on reducing the duration of the ‘Nada Geethe’ (State anthem) before the State legislature session from September 13-24, said Minister for Kannada and Culture, and Energy V. Sunil Kumar. Speaking to mediapersons in Udupi on Monday, the Minister said a decision will also be taken on how the photograph of Kannadambe Bhuvaneshwari is to be displayed. Currently, various versions of the ‘Nada Geethe’ are being sung, usually 4-5 minutes long, some renditions going up to nine minutes. This has led to a call for trimming and standardising it. A committee led by poet Channaveera Kanavi had recommended the rendition be standardised to 90 seconds. However, another committee led by Manu Baligar, president, Kannada Sahitya Parishat, submitted a report in 2018 which recommended the rendition of the ‘Nada Geethe’ to be standardised at 150 seconds (2 minutes 30 seconds). No bridge music “We have recommended that no lines be dropped, but also no lines be repeated and the anthem should be sung with no bridge music. I have held a demonstration that this way the entire song can be sung in less than two-and-a-half minutes,” said Mr. Baligar. C.T. Ravi, who earlier held charge of Kannada and Culture ministry under the B.S. Yediyurappa-led government, had suggested the standardised version of 150 seconds be sung at official functions, but that any rendition can be sung at private events. However, this proposal met with opposition saying since it is the State anthem, it needs to have a standardised rendition at all places. On birth anniversaries The Minister said officials of the Department of Kannada and Culture, Department of Youth Empowerment and the Department of Education will meet on August 27 to deliberate upon celebrating various ‘jayanthis’ (birth anniversaries) in a meaningful manner by involving the participation of people. A decision on how the celebrations should be conducted will be taken before the session of the State legislature. ‘Amrut mahotsav’ The government is also thinking of involving the three departments in the ‘amrut mahotsav’ celebrations of independence to infuse the spirit of patriotism among people, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decision-on-trimming-nada-geethe-before-legislature-session-begins/article36070981.ece
24 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Monsoon normal in State, but deficient in Cauvery catchment||The quantum of rainfall in the catchment area of the Cauvery and its tributaries in the State continues to be a matter of concern with rain in Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru districts classified as “deficit” for June 1 to August 23. While rain appeared to pick up again on Monday in Mysuru and in surrounding regions, there are concerns on whether it will sustain and bridge the deficiency. While Kodagu received 1,326 mm of rainfall which is 29% below Long Period Average (LPA), Chikkamagaluru, which is the catchment for Hemavathi, the main tributary of the Cauvery, has recorded 953 mm of rainfall which is 22% below LPA, according to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC). Rainfall across the State was 587 mm against the LPA of 647 mm during this period. In Hassan Hassan district received 490 mm of rainfall which is 16% below LPA, while Mysuru received 245 mm, which is 16% below LPA. Only Mandya with 217 mm (32% above LPA) and Chamarajanagar district with 222 mm (29% above LPA) have rain in the excess category as defined by KSNDMC. Excess is defined as rainfall above 20% to 59% of the LPA, deficient is -20% to -59% of the LPA while normal is +19% to -19% of the LPA. Though Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya, and Chamarajanagar have received rain ranging from normal to excess, these are districts where LPA itself is low and receives relatively less rain compared to the Malnad and Western Ghats region. So, the quantum of water accruing to the rivers from these districts is not high compared to the yield from Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru regions. With the number of rainy days during the South West Monsoon set to recede after August, the probabilities of heavy rain are less but cannot be ruled out. KRS levels Sources in the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (CNNL) said the monsoon, though active, is weak in the Cauvery catchment region as a result of which the water level in Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) is yet to reach its full reservoir level of 124.80 feet. The reservoir level was hovering around 120.15 feet on Monday. But authorities said there have been years when the the KRS has attained FRL as late as September and the tradition of the Chief Minister offering ‘bagina’ or thanksgiving has taken place in mid or late September. However, in case of Hemavathi, the water level is approaching FRL and was at 2,918.11 on Monday against the FRL of 2,922 feet. The water level at Kabini was 2,282.48 feet against the FRL of 2,284 feet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/monsoon-normal-in-state-but-deficient-in-cauvery-catchment/article36070971.ece

I don’t think there should be any reason for staying away from the schools as all necessary precautions had been taken for the students’s safety,” he said. The CEO spoke to the youngsters and elicited their views on resuming physical classes. “All of them were very happy. They are aware of the precautions they are supposed to take including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” he said, adding that teachers were also excited and taken special interest in readying their schools for greeting children.

Parents’ consent is a must for their children to attend offline classes, he said, adding that the deputy commissioner and the ZP CEO had visited schools and checked the preparations done for the reopening. Deputy Commissioner S. Aswathi, who visited a few schools, told the students to wear mask and maintain social distance. She told teachers at Hebbakkawadi village to spread awareness about COVID-19 and precautions the children are supposed to take while they are in school. The schools had been asked to ensure basic facilities besides maintaining proper hygiene on the premises. Chamarajnagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi visited the government boy’s PU College in Chamarajanagar and checked the preparations done. Hassan Excise Minister K.

24 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||KSRTC services to Tamil Nadu resume||After nearly three-and-a-half months, the KSRTC in Mysuru resumed its services to Tamil Nadu from Monday. As many as 12 buses plied from the Mysuru rural division. “We are operating less than 50 per cent of buses to Tamil Nadu. If the response is good, we will increase the number of buses,” said KSRTC Divisional Controller Srinivas. Inter-state operation was first resumed to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and now to Tamil Nadu There have been no services to Kerala because of the prevailing COVID-19 situation. Mr. Srinivas said the Mysuru division was yet to recover its lost revenue as the response from the travelling public has not been very encouraging despite the services on inter-city routes restored on July 1. “Our daily revenue has been around Rs. 50 lakh. The income used to be around Rs. 85 lakh daily before the second wave. The revenue has dropped in view of weekend lockdown,” he said. With the RT-PCR negative report mandatory for those coming to State from Kerala, the number of passengers travelling in buses has dropped and therefore no buses are being operated to Kerala, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ksrtc-services-to-tamil-nadu-resume/article36071393.ece
24 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mayoral polls: JD(S) plays its cards close to its chest||Suspense continues over the stand of JD(S) in the mid-term Mayoral polls scheduled for August 25. With its support crucial for any party to clinch the post of Mayor in the hung Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), the BJP as well as Congress have reached out to it for an understanding. The BJP has 22 members while the Congress has 19 members in the House. The JD(S) has 17 members while BSP has one member. Five others are independents. Apart from the 65 members of MCC, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha belonging to the BJP, four MLAs – S. A. Ramdas and L. Nagendra (both BJP), Tanveer Sait (Cong) and G.T. Deve Gowda (JD-S), besides three MLCs – Marithibbe Gowda, Srikante Gowda and Sandesh Nagaraj (all JD-S) – have voting rights. While Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, called on former Minister and JD(S) MLA representing K.R. Nagar S.R. Mahesh and sought the party’s support to help elect a BJP Mayor, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) Working President R. Dhruvanarayan spoke to Mr. Mahesh over the telephone and sought continuation of the understanding between the two ‘secular’ parties. Mr. Mahesh has kept the BJP as well as the Congress waiting. Mr. Dhruvanarayan told reporters in Mysuru on Monday that the Congress had sought the Mayor’s post, which is scheduled to end in six months’ time, while the JD(S) can take the top post for the remaining two terms. Though Mr. Dhruvanarayan called Mr. Mahesh on Sunday, the latter did not receive the call. JD(S) leader K.T. Srikante Gowda told The Hindu that the party will take a decision at a meeting of the party corporators scheduled for Tuesday. Sources in the JD(S) said there is a split among the party corporators with a section preferring the BJP while another wishing to go with Congress. The corporators belonging to the Muslim community are wary of an understanding with the BJP as it would seriously impact their re-election. But, another section has argued that the JD(S) has supported secular values and stood by the minorities and their truck with BJP will not affect their re-election chances. The terms of understanding with the BJP are yet to be worked out. However, a BJP leader said party is unlikely to accept the offer JD(S) has received from Congress. “If they ask us to take the Mayor’s post for six months and allow JD(S) the occupy the post for the remaining two years, it may not be acceptable”, the BJP leader said. The mid-term polls to the post were announced after Ms. Rukmini Made Gowda of the JD(S) was disqualified from the membership of the MCC for submitting a false asset affidavit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mayoral-polls-jds-plays-its-cards-close-to-its-chest/article36071398.ece
24 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||KPCC leader stands by his comments||Former MP and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) Working President R. Dhruvanarayan on Monday stuck to his stand on comparing Taliban with RSS. Fielding reporter’s queries on his statement, which has evoked a sharp criticism from the BJP, he said a few features of Taliban and RSS were alike. “Both the organisations were proponents of religion. They have no commitment to secular values”, he said. Recalling that RSS was banned after its activist Nathuram Godse had shot and killed Mahatma Gandhi, who had brought freedom to India, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said Taliban as well as RSS were both proponents of religion and had no faith in democracy. Also, just like the Taliban kept women away from the mainstream, the RSS yields no space for women, he said. Mr. Dhruvanarayan said his remarks came after Mysuru MP Pratap Simha claimed that Taliban would have reared its head even in India without CAA. “Pratap Simha sought to target a particular community with his statement. So, I condemned it and said Taliban and RSS were alike”, the Congress leader said. He said the BJP was opposing his statement because RSS is its frontal organisation. Meanwhile, several BJP workers from H.D. Kote led by former Vice-President of H.D. Kote Taluk Panchayat B. Mallesh and BJP’s Mahila Morcha leader Bhagyalakshmi joined the Congress at a function held at the Congress Bhavan in Mysuru in the presence of Mr. Dhruvanarayan, H.D. Kote MLA Anil Chikkamadu, Mahila Congress chief Pushpa Amarnath and Mysuru District Congress Committee President Vijaykumar. Welcoming them, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said the Congress was a secular party, which stands by the underprivileged, dalits and backward classes in the society. He criticised the BJP leaders for spending their time issuing provocative statements instead of focussing on development of the society. Mr. Chikkamadu said more BJP leaders from H.D. Kote would be joining the Congress in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kpcc-leader-stands-by-his-comments/article36071400.ece

The then Minister for Public Works H.C. Mahadevappa along with the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah sent the project prepared by the State government to the then Union Surface Transport Minister Oscar Fernandes.

24 August 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||New device by students to check temperature||Thermal scanners, infrared thermometers and thermal cameras, which can measure body temperature in a contactless manner, have become vital tools in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In the search for newer technologies that are cost-effective and safe, three students of the Department of Physics, Sanatana Dharma (SD) College, Alappuzha, have designed an Automatic Temperature Measurement and Alert System (ATMAS). Face recognition The system consists of a camera, temperature module, and an Arduino microcontroller. It measures the temperature of the forehead of a person approaching via face recognition using the camera and temperature sensor. ATMAS can be used to estimate the body temperature from wrist or fist. Readings greater than the normal body temperature suggesting fever are instantly notified to the individual and authorities concerned. It is designed to measure the temperature irrespective of the height of the individual, and the camera captures photographs of those monitored with elevated body temperatures. Cutting cost One of the highlights of ATMAS, developed by Abhishek R. Nath, Midhun Mohan and Sangeeth S. Kini (final-year BSc students) under the guidance of Sreekanth J. Varma, assistant professor, Department of Physics, is the intelligent use of recycled items, thereby reducing the overall expenditure. The prototype costs around Rs. 5,000. Compact design The team said research was under way to make the device more compact, portable and economic. "In our fight against the pandemic, this invention is going to be of immense help," said P.R. Unnikrishna Pillai, principal, SD College. The research team is also planning to develop an automatic entry and exit system with a database recording facility that contains information of the individuals monitored. The invention comes at a time when SD College, the oldest college affiliated with the University of Kerala, is celebrating its platinum jubilee. The college had received a funding of Rs. 1 crore from the Department of Science and Technology, the Government of India, for research and teaching in basic sciences under the Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST) programme. The Department of Physics had secured special research assistance of Rs. 30 lakh from the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment.

It plans to regain its lost glory in the coir sector by enhancing the production of coconut and value-added products. As part of the project, high-breed coconut saplings will be planted in large numbers with the help of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers. Geetha Karthikeyan, president, Kanjikuzhy grama panchayat, said that the project would be implemented in association with Kera Gramam, a project of the State government meant to boost coconut farming. "It is going to be a five-year project. Coconut saplings will be distributed to 8,500 families in 18 wards of the grama panchayat. Before planting the saplings, coconut trees affected by diseases will be felled," said Ms. Karthikeyan. Officials said that once coconut production was increased, the local body would launch various projects for the production of value-added products such as fibre, coconut oil and coconut milk. To revive the coir sector, coconut husks would be procured.  The coconut cluster functioning at Ayyappanchery will coordinate the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kanjikuzhy-gears-up-to-attain-coir-village-tag/article36071336.ece
24 August 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||Expert panel mooted to study man-animal conflict||Environmental organisations in the district have expressed concern over the alleged apathy of successive governments in adopting proactive steps to mitigate man-animal conflict in hilly areas of the State, including Wayanad. The Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti (WPSS) urged the government to constitute an expert committee to study the issue comprehensively. The government had recently sought suggestions and opinions from environmental organisations, farmer organisations, political parties and NGOs in the State regarding the issue. The WPSS said in its reply that the massive anthropogenic intervention on wildlife habitat was the major reason behind the increasing incidents of man-animal conflict. Temporary measures such as constructing walls, installing power fence, digging trenches and erecting rail fence to mitigate the issue should be continued but corruption in the name of constructions should be avoided. Close to 36% of the forestland in the district has turned into monoculture plantations and they should be converted into natural forest at the earliest. The responsibility to address the issue should be handed over to grama panchayats as per the recommendation of the National Wildlife Board, and local body officials should be trained for the purpose. Subsidy and annual maintenance grant should be given to farmers on the fringes of forests, who are ready to develop measures to mitigate man-animal conflict effectively. The organisation also raised demands such as doubling the compensation for animal crop raid; increasing the compensation for human death in wildlife attack from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh; ensuring insurance for crop raid and wild attack; curbing unrestricted tourism inside the forest in the name of ecotourism and eradicating exotic plants that is posing a threat to the wildlife habitat.

The amount, which was deposited in their bank account on the day of Onam, gave hope for 142 employees, who are feeling dejected over the delay in re-starting the company and paying salary arrears, which has been pending for 36 months now. However, a senior employee in the production department said the relief amount was less compared with what was given last year by the company to the employee before the takeover when they received Rs. 15,000. V. Pavithran, vice president, INTUC, said that the company had gone into loss not because of the workers but due to the mismanagement by senior officials. Due to the delay in re-starting the company, all the workers were suffering. Even though the re-opening of the company had been included in the 100 days of the action plan by the CPI(M)-led government, there was no official word on it until now. The government should immediately take measures to re-open the company and pay all the benefits including the salary arrears, he said. The State government had finished the process of acquiring the shares and the company had also completed the internal auditing. Now, an external auditing had to be completed to formally finish the registration process, said another senior employee, on condition of anonymity. He said the company had a liability of Rs. 40 crore and once the registration was over, the company would re-open in a phased manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bhel-employees-receive-rs-10000-as-relief-amount/article36071250.ece
24 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Festive season rekindles hope among tourism stakeholders||The festive season has resulted in waterfront homestays in the city suburbs doing teeming business, with people frequenting them to savour the traditional Onasadya along with ethnic seafood delicacies. For those yearning to take a break from the monotony of life during the pandemic, freshwater fish caught in the traditional way and open spaces are the main attractions of homestays. Waterfront homestays were the most in demand during the past week, as guests could relish ethnic delicacies while enjoying the scenic backwaters, said M.P. Sivadattan, member, State Tourism Advisory Committee, and director, Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society (Kerala HATS). “The lull in the arrival of foreign tourists owing to the pandemic is being compensated to some extent by domestic tourists, many of whom want to have lunch and snacks in a village ambience,” he added. Keralam Kaanam Visitors appreciate the fact that pearl spot and other fish varieties caught in the traditional way, including using Chinese nets from nearby locales, and served fresh taste substantially different from those that are refrigerated and served in most hotels. “The renewed emphasis on rural and responsible tourism, in keeping with the global post-pandemic trend, is an added attraction. This has resulted in the Keralam Kaanam slogan, which exhorts people to check out locales in the vicinity, bearing fruit a year after it was popularised,” Mr. Sivadattan said. There has been a steady increase in the number of guests who want to have ethnic food amid a rural setting, said Antony Bava, owner of a homestay at Kumbalanghi, India’s first model tourism village. Local flavour “Guests are of the view that the waterfront and the locale tucked well away from the main road offer them peace of mind. Most of them come seeking seafood and duck dishes, prepared in the same kitchen as that of the hosts. They include those residing in resorts and high-end hotels, who want to eat simple dishes prepared in the ethnic way,” Mr. Bava added. The patronage for waterfront properties in the suburbs is in stark contrast to that in hitherto popular tourist hubs like Fort Kochi and Mattancherry, where tourist footfall is yet to reach the desired levels. Tourist locales Interestingly, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of visitors to Marine Drive, the waterfront avenue walkway of the Cochin Port Trust, and locales like Bhoothathankettu, Ezhattumukham, and Thattekad during the past week, said S. Vijayakumar, Secretary, Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC). Aimed at ensuring adherence to the COVID-19 protocol, random checks are being done. Penalty is being imposed on rule violators, especially those who have not taken the first dose of vaccine.

Vypeen Beach Club was formed over three years ago to help promote outdoor activities among those interested in them. The aim is to help people overcome the fear of the sea, which faces a variety of threats due to human intervention, said Shammy Chakravarthy, an early member of the club. “From training people to swim to cleaning up the beach, one gets to understand the sea better,” said Mr. Chakravarthy, who works with a software company at InfoPark. “Those who get to know the sea become more environment-friendly, besides realising the need to protect our surroundings,” he added. Akhil S. Pai, an engineer who was involved in building a bricklaying robot, said he was interested in outdoor activities and thus associated himself with the Beach Club. However, pandemic restrictions kept him away from them. Also, swimming is curtailed when the sea turns rough following rain. Though the COVID-19 protocol had resulted in beach activities coming to a near standstill, Beach Club members had got together on Independence Day to hoist the National Flag and clean up the Puthuvype beach, which is located close to the LNG terminal. Mr. Chakravarthy said one of the activities of the club was to retrieve driftwood and use them to put up decorations. A big swing was put up on the beach using driftwood. Dominic Simenti, a swimming enthusiast, said he associated himself with the club as he liked to train people to swim. He added that he used to offer instructions to people on essentials of swimming.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/swimming-enthusiasts-give-a-new-dimension-to-outdoor-activities/article36071296.ece

About 70 IT companies have been identified as potential investors to be invited at the State government-level. Companies that have invested elsewhere in the country but are yet to have footprint in the State and employing a chunk of techies from Kerala have been included on the list. IT dept. to pursue “Once the government-level invitation goes out, Infoparks Kerala and the IT Department will do the follow-up,” said Arun Rajeevan, manager (marketing) Infoparks Kerala. The move comes in the wake of a trend noticed whereby Keralite techies employed outside the State are increasingly preferring to return and work from their home. In the past, despite employing a large number of Keralites, tech companies were reluctant to open a centre in the State. “The disruption caused by the pandemic seems to have changed that mindset with employees returning home. We are increasingly receiving enquiries about space from companies based outside,” said Mr. Rajeevan. The rent factor Also, employees seem more comfortable working from Kerala considering its robust health care system guaranteeing hospital treatment in the event of an emergency. Besides, retaining office space in big metro cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad for limited purposes in the wake of the prevailing Work From Home arrangement may not be feasible for most IT companies. A city like Kochi could offer substantially reduced rent. The government is also offering perks exempting rent as an added incentive. Selling points “Unlike in the past when we showcased our cultural and scenic profile, this time we plan to promote State as an ideal technology destination by highlighting features like the health care system that came in for praise during the pandemic, better law and order situation, citizen-centric administration, life standards, ever improving education and logistics infrastructure etc.,” said Mr. Rajeevan.

This is because they pose a safety threat to the pillars, and subsequently to the viaduct. They also block the view of pedestrians and motorists using the road beneath, posing a danger especially to pedestrians who wait to cross the road. A total of 52 banyan tree saplings could be counted in the short stretch between Kaloor and Kacheripady. The KMRL has not uprooted them, although some are as tall as six feet, said George Kattunilath of GCDW. Safety hazard  The penetrating roots, especially of banyan trees, are considered a safety hazard, including to concrete structures. Such saplings, and the overgrowth of shrubs and weeds beneath the metro viaduct also seriously dent the aesthetics of the metro corridor, he said. To be cleared KMRL sources said directions would be issued to the operations team of the metro agency to clear the viaduct of such saplings. The agency had earlier attracted flak for shoddy upkeep of considerable number of medians beneath the 25-km Aluva-Pettah viaduct. An initiative to fill the medians with pruned branches of trees and plants, treat the material in an eco-friendly manner in order to convert them into a planting medium and then do landscaping over them, was discontinued earlier this year. Subsequently, such vegetation is idling beneath the viaduct at many places on MG Road. Instead, KMRL roped in sponsors to landscape the medians, following which almost all sponsors are banking on red earth and mud excavated from eastern parts of the city to fill the vacant space within medians. Still, vast stretches of medians are yet to be landscaped, resulting in overgrowth of weeds, shrubs and saplings.

Besides Kumarakom, the authorities are set to launch the facility at Manakkachira in Changanassery and Kodimatha in Kottayam municipality. “The projects at these two locations, which are expected to take off in the coming months as the tourist footfall picks up, will be operated with a fleet of six kayaks each,” said Bindu Nair, secretary, DTPC Kottayam. The launch of kayaks is expected to provide the much-needed push to the tourism business in the region, which has been severely hit since the COVID-19 outbreak last year.

Despite the incessant showers, the hill-side destination of Illikkal Kallu received up to 1,000 visitors daily. The stakeholder agencies are now betting heavily on the vaccination drive, which is almost complete in the tourism sector, to accelerate the consumer confidence needed to drive up the footfall. “There is indeed a revival, and if this momentum sustains, we may be able to recover at least a part of the losses incurred over the past several seasons,” said a houseboat operator based in Kumarakom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kayaking-kicks-off-at-kumarakom/article36071338.ece

If not for Valiyangadi councillor S.K. Aboobakker’s submission in the council meeting recently, these street lights might have remained orphaned for longer. The 125 sodium vapour lamps set up on major roads under the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development project in 2015 worked only for around a year and had been dead for the past four years. These lights, set up on much taller lamp posts with underground cables, are not part of the 56,000-odd lamps that are maintained by the Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation (KEONICS) as the corporation officials had neglected their existence. “These lights came to my notice when I checked for non-functioning street lights that are being maintained by KEONICS. They are distributed along Francis Road, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer Road, K.P.Kesava Menon Road, stadium and so on. After I gave a written complaint to the Mayor in the last council meeting, some of them were repaired. But more than 100 were yet to be in working condition", Mr.Aboobakker said. He said that Valiyangadi, the commercial sector of the city, was in utter darkness after dusk as none of the street lights were working. Similarly, AG Road, from Hotel Rahmath to 5th railway gate was also in darkness. However, there had been complaints that these lamps, the ones working, did not shed much light and that they needed to be converted into LED lamps for better lighting.

24 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Conflict in INL far from over||Troubles in the Indian National League (INL) appear to be far from over despite a visit by party national president Mohammed Suleman to Kozhikode last week. The numerically strong faction led by State general secretary Kasim Irikkur enjoys the support of the Central leadership. This was evident with the removal of State president A.P. Abdul Wahab and the expulsion of seven other leaders in connection with the violent incidents in Kochi last month. B. Hamza Haji has replaced Mr. Wahab to head the State unit. The faction led by Mr. Wahab, however, holds sway in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts and also has the tacit support of the National Secular Conference led by P.T.A. Rahim. Perhaps that is the reason why the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leadership gave both the factions some kind of ultimatum to sort out the internal problems if the party wants to remain a part of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Central leadership Sources said that the INL Central leadership was aware of the political situation that had emerged after the CPI(M)-led LDF continued in power in the State. Nevertheless it wants the State unit to be under its control, abide by the constitution of the party and function in a democratic setup without violating discipline. Now the Kassim faction feels that a truce has to be worked out with its rival entity without causing further embarrassment to the Left front. Also, for the first time, the party got a berth in the Cabinet with its lone legislator Ahammed Devarkovil being made the Minister for Ports. Truce bid Already the party leadership has set the ball rolling for amicably settling the factional problems with A.P. Abdul Hakeem Azhari, general secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham and son of Sunni leader Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar, planning to hold discussions with the groups. However, the mediation process was in its infancy. Many INL leaders believe that if not ended soon, the factional feud would result in a split in the party, just the way it happened in the Indian Union Muslim League, its parent body, which led to the formation of the party following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/conflict-in-inl-far-from-over/article36071299.ece
24 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Meppayur to be first panchayat to offer free Wi-Fi to students||The Meppayur grama panchayat in Kozhikode is all set to be the first panchayat in the State to offer free Wi-Fi to all students within its limits. The project named ‘Sajjam 2021’ will be launched by Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty on Tuesday. The project, aimed at ensuring that students in the panchayat did not have any difficulty accessing online classes, is being implemented as a result of two-and-a-half-month-long efforts. There are 7,138 students in 16 schools in the panchayat. There have been a lot of complaints related to accessing online classes and the panchayat conducted a survey to find the issues. “We found that a lot of students did not have devices to watch classes while some were sharing devices. We distributed mobile phones to 250 students spending Rs. 20 lakhs,” said V.D. Satheesan, the nodal officer for the project. However, even with the devices being made available, some students could not access classes due to poor mobile connectivity in their areas. Several rounds of discussions were held with mobile service providers to solve the issue. But, many students continued to face difficulty either due to the geography of their locality or financial problems. Realising that providing free Wi-Fi to all students was the only solution, the panchayat began efforts to implement it. Free Wi-Fi centres were set up in 25 anganwadis, one Sisu Mandiram and 36 clubs and libraries in the panchayat. Cable network providers helped make the arrangement at a cost of Rs. 7,000 per centre. The Wi-Fi centres are managed by a working committee in each centre, a ward committee in each ward, and a panchayat-level monitoring committee. “At present, 55 centres are functional. A few more will be set up by the end of the week,” said Mr. Satheesan. With the launch of the project, all students will be able to access Wi-Fi centres within five-minute walking distance from their houses. They can use the facility for one hour every day, during which they can download classes from the Victers channel and listen to classes organised by their schools. Neighbourhood groups will keep tabs on students. “This project will make sure that there is no digital divide in Meppayur panchayat,” said panchayat president K.T. Rajan.  Free Wi-Fi centres set up in 25 anganwadis, one Sisu Mandiram, and 36 clubs and libraries in the panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/meppayur-to-be-first-panchayat-to-offer-free-wi-fi-to-students/article36071251.ece
24 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Special squads yet to expose major illegal land filling attempts||Despite an increase in the number of illegal land filling attempts and illegal constructions, the special squads constituted to monitor such activities during the Onam vacation are yet to expose any major violation in their assigned villages. Though five special squads, including a district-level one, were formed to maintain vigil in various areas, there have been no fresh complaints other than those reported to the village officers concerned earlier. Environment activists from ecologically sensitive areas allege that there was no surprise inspection or quick response to confidential complaints related to illegal land filling attempts or constructions in banned areas. Though the squads were formed foreseeing the challenges of supervision during Onam holidays and the poor number of staff on duty, there was no major change in the situation, they claim. “The usual trick is to stop constructions or filling activities temporarily to hoodwink the special squads. When they visit the spot, there won’t be any active constructions, but it will be resumed after they return,” says N.V. Satheesh, an environmental activist from Thiruvambady. Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi leaders say an examination of the number of field visits undertaken by such squads will be enough to expose their inactivity during the Onam season. There is also an allegation that the five helpline numbers made available for the public to file complaints have been inactive. Very few people were aware of such helplines as they were announced late. “Though such squads are often very keen to interrupt small-scale constructions, many of the large-scale filling in wetland areas for multi-crore construction projects are ignored. Even the Kozhikode Corporation authorities are pretending to be ignorant of such illegal activities,” says N. Biju, member of a wetland conservation forum. Meanwhile, Revenue Department officials say the service will be available for citizens to file complaints even after the Onam season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/special-squads-yet-to-expose-major-illegal-land-filling-attempts/article36071264.ece

The role of persons hailing from other States is also being investigated. “Though there were reports about the arrival of a Tamil Nadu-based gang of burglars, there was no solid evidence to confirm it. With the recurring number of incidents in Kozhikode, there is a chance that an organised manner of thefts is taking place,” said a station house officer from Kozhikode Rural police district. He said the police had stepped up vigil after collecting visuals from some closed circuit television cameras. Though fingerprints were collected from various crime scenes, they did not match those of local gang members convicted in similar crimes earlier. According to the local police, it indicated the involvement of migrants in thefts. “With more such incidents being noticed, we have asked local residents to be careful about the presence of strangers in residential areas,” said V. Sajith, a senior civil police officer at Vadakara. Officers part of community policing schemes said the increasing number of thefts was yet to catch the attention of many people who left homes carelessly while going on vacation. The leaders of some residents’ associations said they were conducting night patrol. People who go on long vacations were asked to inform the nearby police stations and residents’ association leaders, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/serial-thefts-police-probe-role-of-organised-gangs/article36071265.ece

Rujeesh Rehman, who sustained serious injuries in the attack, has been admitted to a private hospital.  Police sources said it was a quarrel over washing a private vehicle that led to the clash. The shop owner’s reluctance to wash the vehicle allegedly provoked the vehicle owner who called his friends to attack the man, they said. In the preliminary investigation, it was found that the same gang had locked horns with Mr. Rehman during last Onam celebrations too. The injured man said he had turned down the request to wash the vehicle as the unit did not have adequate number of labourers to complete the work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/car-washing-unit-owner-attacked/article36071260.ece

According to the Palliyoda Seva Sangam (PSS) that organises the event, the palliyodams taking part in the event, namely Maramon, Kozhencherry and Keezhvanmazhy, were selected through a draw of lots. They are slated to reach the temple ghats at Aranmula by 10.45 a.m. and will be accorded a grand reception. No persons without the identification card provided by the PSS will be permitted to embark the boat, while the oarsmen will not be permitted to go ashore during the event. The race will be held in three legs respectively from the temple ghats to Sathrakadavu, from Sathrakadavu to Parappuzhakadavu and from Parappuzhakadavu to the temple ghats again. The races will be held along with the rendition of the traditional vanchipattu (boat songs) in praise of the presiding deity at the Aranmula temple. Restricted participation A decision to hold the annual regatta symbolically with just three palliyodams was made during a meeting convened by the State government last month. Notably missing from the event will be the festive atmosphere as the participation of public has been restricted for the second year in a row. Prior to the pandemic, up to 5,000 persons on board 52 snake boats had attended the event, which also drew a huge number of tourists to the banks of the Pampa. Meanwhile, the famed vallasadya at Aranmula will be held on August 30. The oarsmen of the three snake boats will be served with the traditional feast in three different venues. Only those producing COVID-19 negative certificates after undergoing RT-PCR test within 48 hours and others who have completed two doses of vaccine are permitted to attend the ritual.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/aranmula-set-to-play-host-to-a-symbolic-boat-race/article36071472.ece

24 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Rs. 94 lakh spent for ABC programme in 2 years||The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has spent Rs. 94.63 lakh out of the Rs. 1.05 crore allocated over the past two years for its Animal Birth Control programme to control the number of stray dogs, making it the local body with one of the highest spendings on sterilising stray dogs. This is despite the fact that the pace of the ABC programme has dropped somewhat ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The civic body is only second to the Kozhikode Corporation, which has spent Rs. 1.03 crore out of the Rs. 1.64 crore allocated over the past two years for sterilising stray dogs. None of the other urban local bodies in the State come closer to the two Corporations in spendings on controlling stray dog numbers, as per figures placed in the Assembly. Currently, the sterilisation of stray dogs which are caught from all the hundred wards of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation are being done in the facility attached to the Government Veterinary Hospital in Thiruvallam. Two veterinary doctors are currently carrying out sterilisation activities here. During the lockdown period, the sterilisation rate had fallen to 30 to 40 cases due to the shortage of dog-catchers, but recovered considerably afterwards. Before the pandemic, the average rate of sterilisation was at 400 per month. After many false starts, during which private agencies which were contracted for the project left it before the process could even begin, the ABC programme in the city Corporation attained some level of stability only in August 2018, before which the programme had even come to a halt for about seven months. The steady numbers of sterilisations seems to have had some effect, as the number of stray dog bites reported from the city have come down drastically, over the past few years. Decentralisation The pandemic has affected the plans for decentralisation of ABC activities by setting up sterilisation facilities in some of the 15 veterinary hospitals located within the Corporation area. There is also a plan to expand the facility at Thiruvallam by converting a large hall here into an operation theatre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rs-94-lakh-spent-for-abc-programme-in-two-years/article36071331.ece

Members of a pro-Congress social media group threatened to challenge the list of nominees proposed by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) if the leadership failed to give weightage to the choices of Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala. Meanwhile, the office of Mr. Chennithala distanced itself from the remarks made on the social media group. Sources close to Mr. Chennithala said he had informed the Congress high command that he was in the dark about the DCC president list finalised by the KPCC. However, Mr. Chennithala assured New Delhi that he would abide by the decision of the party’s high command. A party insider said Mr. Chandy had conveyed a similar message to the Congress national leadership. Nevertheless, the KPCC found it challenging to put a lid on the discord in the party. A set of Congress workers stuck posters damning the KPCC’s presumed choice for the post of DCC president, Thiruvananthapuram. A similar incident of rebellion had occurred in Kollam on Saturday. The unsigned bills, stuck in the vicinity of Indira Bhavan, accused Shashi Tharoor, MP, of proposing the name of the “non-entity”. Meanwhile, KPCC president K. Sudhakaran is scheduled to leave for New Delhi on Tuesday with the DCC presidents’ “final” list. He had held discussions with Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan here.

24 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KWA considering desalination systems in coastal areas||The quest for clean drinking water for the heavily populated coastal areas has prompted the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) to take a closer look at seawater desalination. The KWA has opened discussions with the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences for identifying desalination systems that are suitable for the State's coastal environment. The Fisheries Department also has been linked to the proposal as coastal fishing villages and harbours are potential beneficiaries, KWA managing director S. Venkatesapathy said. Discussion Following a preliminary discussion, the KWA, the Fisheries Department, and the NIOT have appointed nodal officers for examining the viability of the proposal, a senior KWA official said. “Desalination technologies are currently more expensive than conventional water treatment methods. There are multiple technologies available today. But we also need to assess factors such as the water requirement and the availability of land for taking the proposal forward,” the official said. In the just-concluded session of the Kerala Legislative Assembly, Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine had outlined the government's plans to collaborate with NIOT on seawater desalination, adding that detailed studies would be required before a pilot scheme is rolled out, given the cost factor. Kerala has a 590-km coastline. But coastal regions also tend to be plagued by drinking water shortages as, invariably, they exist at the tail-end of water supply schemes. That being the case, they are also the first places where the taps run dry when a disruption occurs in the distribution network, according to KWA officials. New technology NIOT, Chennai, has successfully demonstrated technologies such as Low Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) process which hinges on the temperature variations in sea water at varying depths. In this process, the warm surface water is flash-evaporated at a low pressure. Fresh water is produced by condensing the resulting vapour with colder sea water.

Sivankutty has said that Sree Narayana Guru’s teachings against social evils such as dowry found immense relevance in the present day. He was speaking while inaugurating the Guru Jayanti celebrations organised by the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam’s Vaduvoth branch here to mark the 167th birth anniversary of the social reformer on Monday. The social reformer, Mr. Sivankutty said, had then raised caution about the implications of such practices that were being witnessed in the society. His ideals on caste and religion were also equally significant as they addressed many problems caused by such social barriers. He had advocated service to mankind as the prime duty of every person, the Minister added. Sree Narayana Guru Open University also celebrated the first Sree Narayana Guru Jayanthi since its inception. Ethical dialogues Noted scholar Sunil P. Elayidom, who delivered the commemorative lecture on the occasion, viewed Sree Narayana Guru as one who stood for fostering ethical dialogues among people. While this remains the cornerstone for democracy, the spiritual leader strived against the elitist and fascist ideology of ‘excluding and annihilating the other.’ “He worked to nurture a culture that facilitated public discourse on pertinent social issues rather than muffling dissent and thereby strengthen unity. Sadly, his legacy is being used to create barriers among various sections,” Prof. Elayidom said. Sree Narayana Guru had also worked to reform faith by identifying the needs of the society. He stood apart from the other social reformers of the 19th century by considering religions from their historical perspective as well as fundamental values that stood as a driving force in their propagation, the academic added. University Vice Chancellor P.M. Mubarak Pasha spoke at the webinar that was formally inaugurated by M. Mukesh, MLA. Pro Vice Chancellor S.V. Sudheer, Registrar P.N. Dileep, Syndicate members A.

In a statement, organisation chairman R.S. Sasikumar and secretary M. Shajarkhan alleged the university was yet to cancel the degree certificates awarded to 23 students of career-related undergraduate courses who had benefited through the unauthorised modification of the moderated marks. Refuting allegations of any wilful malpractice, the university had also attributed the ‘error’ to a missing code in the moderation module of the tabulation software. The Director of its Computer Centre was also suspended for lapses in rectifying the glaring security flaws in the software despite being alerted on multiple occasions. Save University Campaign Committee has now claimed that the University Senate was set to hold a special meeting on August 26 to include new provisions to the Statutes in order to cancel degree certificates that have been issued erroneously. They alleged that such attempts were being made even while the university was well within its rights currently to withdraw degrees under certain circumstances..||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-marks-row-surfaces-again/article36071283.ece
24 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Mixed reactions to teaching technical courses in Malayalam||The idea of adopting Malayalam as the medium of instruction for technical courses has gained traction among certain sections. But, transitioning technical education to the vernacular language is fraught with complex challenges. Nevertheless, the academic community felt the proposed reform could break language barriers and boost inclusivity in higher education. Kerala State Higher Education Council vice chairman Rajan Gurukkal opined it was high time that Malayalam, which has been historically used as a conversational and creative language, evolved into a universally accepted technological expression. “Any language must be capable of conveying any advanced knowledge. The Japanese and the Koreans have had the intellectual focus to adopt their languages for advanced studies in fields including nanotechnology. Transliterations were later produced for wider reference. Unfortunately, we have never updated our mother tongue with technological advancements. This has prevented many creative students in our rural areas from becoming part of the global technical language stream,” he said. Challenging transition Digital University Kerala Vice Chancellor Saji Gopinath also felt a vernacular focus might prove to be essential in the long run, despite its requirement of a challenging transition. Citing the example of China’s economic growth with strong focus on IT development in its vernacular, Dr. Gopinath lamented the failure to evolve an operating system in Hindi or any other Indian languages. He added the adoption of Malayalam in higher education might appear pointless from an export-oriented perspective, considering the State’s IT parks derived much of its business from foreign projects. However, Kerala will require local solutions for its economy to grow. “This could work in the favour of large sections of the student community who often ineffectively communicated in English after processing their thoughts in their mother tongue. Also, a line of thought that a transition to a vernacular language might render students or education system as inferior does not have scientific backing,” he pointed out. While backing the view that adopting English as the medium of instruction has impeded several students in gaining new knowledge, APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University Vice Chancellor Rajasree M.S. said a shift to Malayalam would require fundamental changes right from the higher secondary school level. Limiting opportunities Besides, an abrupt shift might not auger well for students who could face difficulties later on while pursuing further studies or jobs elsewhere. Training students in the regional vernacular might even limit their opportunities, she feared. Both the Vice Chancellors proposed adopting a bilingual method for pedagogy or providing a choice to students to choose their medium of instruction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mixed-reactions-to-teaching-technical-courses-in-malayalam/article36071236.ece

24 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||‘Reveal Dharmadam link in tree felling case’||Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan on Monday said the government’s attempt to insulate a top forest official from prosecution in the South Muttil illegal rosewood tree-felling case pointed to the involvement of the State’s elected political executive in the timber loot. Mr. Satheesan said a person who held top political office in the State and hailed from Dharmadam in Kannur was behind the illegal tree felling. “I dare Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to reveal the Dharmadam link,” he said. Mr. Satheesan said an internal inquiry by the Forest Department had found the officer guilty of abetting the illegal tree felling. It had sent the report for further action to the Chief Minister’s Office. ‘Officer protected’ The file appeared to have reached a dead end. The CMO merely transferred the official to a new post and insulated him from criminal prosecution. It had protected the forest official to conceal the real power who orchestrated the timber loot. Mr. Satheesan said the diligence of a forest enforcer had resulted in the detection of the illegal felling of hundreds of ancient rosewood trees on assigned land in Wayanad. When the racket came to light, the top forest official attempted to discipline the officer who detected the forest wealth loot. He also covered for the illegal fellers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/reveal-dharmadam-link-in-tree-felling-case/article36071306.ece

24 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka schools draw fewer students||The attendance in high schools and Pre-University (PU) colleges was poor on day one when offline classes resumed after a gap of five months. These classes were closed in March due to the second wave of COVID-19 infections. According to statistics provided by the department, the attendance in both offline and online classes across the State for Class X stood at 21%, while it was 19.5% for Class IX. PU colleges reported slightly higher attendance as the cumulative attendance for both offline and online classes stood at 36%. While many schools and PU colleges anticipated that attendance would be low in offline classes, what was worrying was that the attendance in online classes too was extremely poor. More than two thirds of the students did not attend classes virtually or physically in high schools. B.C. Nagesh, Primary and Secondary Education Minister said that there were some errors in the statistics collated by the department and they would be rectified by Tuesday. “Many students told me that they were unable to focus on the online classes from their homes and said they were glad that offline classes resumed,” he said. District-wise variations There was huge variation in the attendance among different districts. While in Class IX, Uttara Kannada reported an attendance of 53%, Koppal reported an attendance of 2.06%. In Class X too, the highest attendance was clocked by Uttara Karnataka , while the least was 2.2% in Gadag . In PU colleges, Bengaluru Rural had an attendance of 78%, while the least was in Bidar, where only 8% of students attended both online and offline classes. Department officials said that the attendance was higher in government schools and PU colleges as well as small budget private schools. Many schools wore a festive look as the teachers had decorated the school campuses and even distributed sweets to the students.

He however added that many schools did not reopen on Monday. “While some schools have decided to reopen later after making all arrangements to follow the SOPs, some have decided to stick to online classes as the majority of parents have decided against consenting to their children attending offline classes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-schools-draw-fewer-students/article36070859.ece

The drive was carried out on Sunday evening near the UB City mall here. Transport Commissioner N.

Additional Commissioner (Enforcement) of Transport Department, Narendra Holkar, added, “Based on information from our sources, we carried out a drive at UB City. Officials seized seven cars, including a Rolls-Royce registered in Maharashtra. The vehicle was registered in the name of Amitabh Bachchan in 2019, but was later allegedly purchased by a builder from Bengaluru. During our drive, a person named Salman Khan was driving the car. He failed to produce documents related to the car. The car was taken out without insurance. We have impounded the car as per the rules.” Papers in order: owner The owner of the luxury car, Babu, a builder who spoke to the media, has maintained that all the valid papers for the vehicle were “at home” and they “will be produced before the officials”. He said that two years ago, he had purchased the car from Mr. Bachchan for Rs. 6 crore, but the car was still registered in the name of Mr. Bachchan. “Usually on weekends, my children take out the car.

24 August 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tamil Nadu posts positive growth amid pandemic||Tamil Nadu emerged as the only possible southern State to clock a positive growth rate of 1.42% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic – 2020-21. This forms one of the highlights of a perusal of the data released recently by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The data, compiled as on August 2, do not contain figures of several States including Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat. However, the available data reveal that during the year in question, three southern States – Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telengana - and the Union Territory of Puducherry saw contraction in their growth rate – minus 2.58%, minus 2.62%, minus 0.62% and minus 3.46% respectively. At the all-India level, the growth rate was estimated at minus 7.3%. An economist points out that all the figures are subject to revision subsequently as they have been worked out on the basis of available data. For example, Tamil Nadu's growth rate figure of 8.03%, provisionally worked out for 2019-20, has been scaled down to 6.13% During the year 2020-21, an impressive performance of the primary sector enabled the State to register the positive growth rate. Among various segments of the sector, agriculture topped the list with 6.89% growth rate. In absolute terms, the value of agricultural production was estimated at about Rs. 53,703 crore. The food grains production was about 113.4 lakh tonnes, of which rice (paddy) accounted for nearly 73 lakh tonnes and millets – 36 lakh tonnes with pulses constituting the rest. As for other agricultural crops, sugarcane’s production was 128 lakh tonnes oilseeds – 9.82 lakh tonnes and cotton – 2.5 lakh bales. While livestock and fishery had put up an equally impressive show, the outliers in the primary sector were forestry & logging and mining & quarrying. For the second year in a row, the segment of mining & quarrying showed a negative growth rate. This time, it was about minus 17.8% There was not much to talk about the secondary sector, comprising manufacturing, construction, electricity and other utility services. The sector had managed to show a positive rate of 0.36%. As for the services sector, the performance was marginally better than that of the secondary. Financial services had done an impressive job with 10.83% and real estate had scraped through with 0.62%. Predictably, other segments such as hotels, restaurants, transport and communications had taken the beating. As per an estimate, the State saw last year taxes of all types - Goods & Services Tax, customs and excise – fetching about Rs. 1.6 lakh-crore, about Rs. 3 lakh-crore higher than the previous year. The value of subsidies on products such as food, fertiliser and petroleum, about Rs. 20,590 crore, was approximately Rs. 2,000 crore lower than that of 2019-20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tn-posts-positive-growth/article36070968.ece

Schemes like YSR Cheyutha, Amma Vodi are not applicable to them. The State government had declared that those earning over Rs. 12,000 in urban areas would be ineligible for the welfare schemes, but Asha workers were denied the benefits even though they get lesser than the said amount, the leaders said. Andhra Pradesh Asha Workers Association State general secretary K. Dhana Lakshmi and CITU Chittoor district secretary P. Chaitanya, who led the stir, deplored that they do not get any retirement benefits despite working till the retirement age of 60. The protesting leaders observed that except for praising their services, nothing tangible was done to support the families of Asha workers who died of COVID-19 in the line of duty, and demanded an insurance benefit of Rs. 50 lakh to the families of the deceased workers. Their other demands included a provision of retirement benefit to the tune of Rs. 3 lakh and dropping the move to scrap welfare schemes for them. ‘Will intensify stir’ Ms. Dhana Lakshmi said protests would be organised in front of all the District Collectorates in the State on September 13, and the stir would be intensified in a phased manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/extend-welfare-schemes-to-asha-workers-association/article36071411.ece

Speaking at a meeting held with Vice-Chancellor and Heads of Departments (HoDs) at Dravidian University in Kuppam, Mr. Balasubramanyam said that the loss of Telugu University could be compensated by developing the Dravidian University in Kuppam. “Dravidian University, though neglected by the governments for three decades, is a unique entity of South Indian culture, representing the cultural, linguistic and historical importance of the Telugu States as well as that of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, besides serving as a bridge between the cultures of north and south,” he said. ‘Image makeover’ The panel chief felt that giving a facelift and adequate financial support to Dravidian University would go a long way towards bolstering the image of Andhra Pradesh all over the country and abroad as well. MLC Y. Srinivasulu said that it had come to his notice that Dravidian University was hit by a paucity of funds and had represented to the State government for a grant of Rs. 30 crore to the institution. He said he would pursue it with the State government and added that the university administration was facing a dilemma over the demand for regularisation of over 250 outsourced employees or renewal of their contracts. Vice-Chancellor Tummala Ramakrishna emphasised the importance of establishing a premier institute for study and research of ancient languages.

Commuters and travellers were stranded at Metro Rail stations and other locations, while traffic came to a grinding halt on several stretches due to waterlogged roads. Both stretches of road from Raj Bhavan and from Punjagutta up to the Chief Minister’s camp office were literal nightmares, with vehicles and pedestrians stranded on all sides. Blocked stormwater and sewerage lines proved to be the major causes for the flooding, as obvious from the overflowing manholes everywhere. “Been raining since 2 p.m., so I took an auto to office, just 1 km from home, but the driver left me midway coz of a heavily waterlogged stretch ahead in Somajiguda, leading to CM camp office! Why does this city break down every monsoon?” asked Shilpi, a Twitter user, tagging GHMC and Minister K.T. Rama Rao. “Literally #Hyderabad a ‘Water Plus' (under Swachh Bharat Mission) city,” quipped another user Mohammad Fasahathullah Siddiqui, taking a dig at the ‘Water Plus’ rank given to the city under the Swachh Bharat Mission. As per the data available on the automatic weather stations in the city, Uppal recorded the highest rainfall at 8.5 centimetres, followed by Marredpally at 6.8 centimetres. Kapra, Shaikpet, Malkajgiri, Secunderabad, Khairatabad, Ameerpet, Balanagar, Musheerabad, Saroornagar, Hayatnagar, and other locations received considerable rainfall. Department of Meteorology has predicted light to moderate rains across the State in the next three days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rain-batters-hyderabad-commuters-stranded/article36070864.ece
24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||River Board urged to stop ‘unauthorised’ Veligonda project||Ahead of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) scheduled on August 27, the Telangana government has addressed two more letters to the River Board on Monday requesting it to restrain Andhra Pradesh from executing “unauthorised” Veligonda project and to consider only 20% of the water drawn for drinking needs as per the provisions of KWDT-I award in force. In a letter addressed to Chairman of the KRMB M.P. Singh, Telangana Engineer-in-Chief (General-Irrigation) C. Muralidhar pointed out how the Bachawat Tribunal (KWDT-I), which is in force till date due to the delay in the finalisation of Brijesh Kumar Tribunal (KWDT-II) following the dispute over the water share between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, had not considered any diversion of water from Srisailam reservoir and stipulated giving priority for in-basin allocations over outside basin diversions. “Disregarding the provisions of KWDT-I, the erstwhile AP government proposed Veligonda project in 1994 to divert 3,000 cusecs of flood water during monsoon period to outside basin areas (Gundlakamma in Prakasam district) through a tunnel from Srisailam reservoir. Additional tunnel In 2005, an additional tunnel was proposed to carry another 8,600 cusecs of flood water or over one tmc ft a day from 875 feet level of the reservoir,” Mr. Muralidhar explained. However, the Telangana government has been strongly objecting to diversion of water from Srisailam to outside basin areas through Pothireddypadu Head Regulator, Srisailam Right Main Canal, Handri-Neeva (Malyala), KC Canal (Muchumarri) and Veligonda lift schemes. The matter was also raised at the second meeting of Apex Council held in October last, wherein Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat was also of the view that inter-basin transfer of water could be done only after fulfilling the in-basin needs. Telangana had been pleading before KWDT-II to stop outside basin diversions when the in-basin drought-prone areas were suffering water scarcity, the ENC said and mentioned that KWDT-I had stipulated that “Andhra Pradesh shall not acquire any right whatsoever to the remaining water in excess of the allocated and regenerated water and more weightage be given to in-basin use in future uses.” In another letter, Mr. Muralidhar requested the River Board to account for only 20% of the water drawn for drinking needs as per the provisions of the KWDT-I award. He also brought to the notice of the KRMB Chairman that an inter-State agreement of August 1973 between AP, Karnataka and Maharashtra had also decided to measure only 20% of water drawn for domestic supply needs. Further, he pointed out, in support of Telangana’s request, that the June 2019 report of the Central Water Commission (CWC) has put the consumptive use of domestic water utilisation in the country as 15%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/krmb-urged-to-stop-unauthorised-veligonda-project/article36071221.ece

24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC sets aside punishment to 6 top officials in contempt case||Telangana High Court on Monday quashed and set aside a single judge order awarding six-month simple imprisonment to six top officials and imposing Rs. 2,000 fine on each of them in a contempt of court petition. Allowing the appeal petitions against single judge order, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said the contempt petition was barred by limitation. The bench, however, gave liberty to the respondents to seek appropriate legal recourse if they were aggrieved by the orders issued in the year 2010. The six top officials, including two IAS officers and two IFS officers, filed the appeal petitions challenging the single judge order passed in the contempt plea. The division bench headed by the CJ observed: “we are of the opinion that the contempt petition having been filed highly belated by the respondents, was not maintainable in the light of the limitation prescribed under Section 20 of the Contempt of Courts Act”. The matter pertains to a writ petition filed by Mohd. Sirajuddin and nine others claiming rights over 383 acres of land in Maheshwaram village of Rangareddy district. In year 2009, a single judge instructed the six officials to take a final call on acquisition of the said land for conversion into Reserve Forest within six months. The petitioners filed a contempt of court petition stating that the authorities failed to comply with the single judge order. Eventually, they were held guilty of contempt and an order was passed awarding punishment to them. Senior counsel S. Nirajan Reddy appearing for the six officials said the State government had issued two orders in year 2010 following the single judge order issued in 2009 in the writ petition. The government then rejected the claims of rights over the lands by the petitioners declaring it as surplus land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-sets-aside-punishment-to-six-top-officials-in-contempt-case/article36071224.ece

24 August 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Honeymoon’ row: JNTU-K replaces in-charge Registrar||The Executive Council of the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Kakinada (JNTU-K) on Monday appointed L. Sumalatha as its new Registrar replacing in-charge Registrar R. Srinivasa Rao. The university authorities took the decision after reports emerged that a couple celebrated their honeymoon in the university guest house on the campus. Panel constituted Prof. Srinivasa Rao had constituted a five-member committee to probe the ‘honeymoon’ controversy. The committee headed by the Rector is likely to submit its report on Tuesday. Prof. Srinivasa Rao was reportedly the official who granted permission for the accommodation in the guest house in the name of Director of Women Empowerment and Grievances A. Swarna Kumari on August 18 and 19, who reportedly gave it for outsiders. Senior officials from the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education were present on the campus on August 20 on official visit. However, they left the campus immediately after the controversy broke out, according to sources. On the status of the inquiry committee, JNTU-Kakinada Vice-Chancellor M. Ramalinga Raju said that the university authorities had discussed the controversy on Monday. However, the five-member committee would sit on Tuesday before submitting its final report, the Vice-Chancellor said. When contacted, Prof. Srinivasa Rao said that he had handed over charge to his successor on Monday evening. The replacement of the Registrar appears to be the first step taken by the university to protect itself from the controversy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/honeymoon-row-registrar-replaced/article36070898.ece

24 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala govt. anticipates post-Onam case surge||In anticipation of a surge in COVID-19 cases after Onam, Health Minister Veena George has called for extreme vigil and precautions to be followed for the next four weeks to minimise the risk of infection. The Health Department anticipates that the COVID case graph will surge upwards in another two weeks because of increased social interaction and family gatherings during Onam festivities. Possible third wave It is very much possible that a major surge in cases at this point might emerge as a third wave, even before the second wave has subsided. The government allowed more relaxations in civil life just before Onam as it was no longer possible for the State to remain under permanent lockdown and in consideration of livelihood issues. Despite the caution to maintain the pandemic protocol, large crowds were witnessed at most markets and shops during Onam. With the highly transmissible Delta virus sweeping across the State, it is highly likely that the disease transmission rate would have been amplified during this season. Delta, apart from its high R0 factor (it is said to be as infectious as chicken pox virus which has an R0 factor of 8), is also a partial immune escape variant, which means that it can infect even those who have been fully vaccinated. With the State vaccinating over 2.5 crore people, a significant percentage of people now contributing to new infections are fully or partially vaccinated. These vaccine breakthrough infections are mostly mild or asymptomatic and while the vaccinated individual is protected from serious disease and death, the fact remains that he/she can still spread the infection to vulnerable people. During the first wave too, there was a major surge in cases after Onam. Ms. George cautioned that when offices and institutions reopen after Onam holidays on Tuesday, people needed to be more vigilant about observing the COVID protocol. The Minister said the government proposed increased testing and all individuals who displayed any influenza-like symptoms should get themselves tested immediately. Emergency meeting She also called for an emergency meeting of health officials on Tuesday to review the situation. The department’s preparations in anticipation of a third wave had started much ahead and from taluk level upwards, the number of oxygen beds and ICU beds had been increased. Paediatric beds and ICU facilities had been increased with 744 beds in all categories. The State also has 870 tonnes of oxygen in stock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-govt-anticipates-post-onam-case-surge/article36070867.ece

24 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jewellers down shutters against hallmarking rules||Owners of gold and jewellery shops across the State downed their shutters on Monday demanding that the Central government roll back the new gold hallmarking rules. The one-day bandh was observed in response to the call given by All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) and supported by jewellery associations. The members of various associations, including AP Bullion Gold Silver and Diamond Merchants’ Association, observed the bandh. Nearly 50,000 jewellery shops across the State remained closed. The jewellery associations are up in arms against the Union government’s Hallmarking Unique ID (HUID) system. Even while asserting that they were not against the hallmarking system, the associations contended that the new system was against the principle of ‘ease of doing business.’ Bezawada Jewellers and Diamond Merchants’ Association president K.J.N. Prasad, Bezawada Bullion Merchants’ Association president Borra Venkata Krishna Rao, Vijayawada Bullion Merchants’ Association president Javvadi Suryanarayana (Rudraiah) and others said they were not against hallmarking. But, they were worried about the newly introduced system, which would consume a lot of time and the process was also not simple. The new HUID system was impractical and unimplementable, they asserted. The hallmarking system was already running smoothly for the past 16 years and accepted by trade and consumers. The whole system had been changed under the mandatory regime without due deliberation and now all stakeholders were suffering, they alleged. The HUID system, which was made mandatory by the Bureau of Indian Standards’ (BIS) since June 16 along with the BIS hallmarking, was adversely affecting the jewellery business. The poor availability of hallmarking centres in the interiors of the State made it impossible for the implementation of the mandatory hallmarking regime, they said, adding, this would disrupt the whole industry and the value chain, putting at stake the livelihoods of millions of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jewellers-down-shutters-against-hallmarking-rules/article36070924.ece

In a statement on Monday, Mr. Swamy said that Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy was telling a blatant lie that 92% farmers in the State had given their consent for fixing of meters to their agricultural pump sets. The government should clarify whether it had taken up any awareness campaign on farm meters in the State till now. The government, instead, was blackmailing farmers that welfare benefits would not be extended to them if they did not agree for meters, he said. The government was telling lies that it would transfer cash even before electricity readings were taken. If the government was sincere, it would have thought of transferring cash to DISCOMs directly instead of farmers, he said and cautioned that his party would step up the agitation if the decision was not withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-telling-lies-on-farmers-nod-for-power-meters-tdp/article36070920.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the officials to be prepared to extend support to Essar Steel for coping with the market vagaries and overcoming certain financial constraints it has been facing for the last two years. Funds mobilisation Meanwhile, the State government is learnt to be trying to raise funds from the sovereign funds of the U.K. and Qatar among a host of potential sources, and the officials concerned are seized of the matter in order to start constructing the plant at the earliest. While the basic infrastructure – electricity and water – are in various stages of creation, the plan for laying a railway line from Muddanur has been changed to route it from the Jammalamadugu - Proddatur line. This is because of the difficulty in negotiating the tough gradients and reserve forest (which requires environmental clearances) if a way is to be made from Muddanur side to the plant site. A bridge is to be laid on the Penna in the alternative route, but the railway line’s overall cost is said to be much less than what is entailed by the line originally planned. The Chief Minister wants the project to commence without further delay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/joint-venture-agreement-on-kadapa-steel-plant-likely-soon/article36071417.ece

The analysis will involve elaborate and comprehensive software packages in order to enable better decision-making. When contacted, ANGRAU Vice Chancellor A. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said that the main objective of CARP will be to conduct scientific research of various government programmes and provide policy support inputs to the government for better execution of ongoing schemes. CARP head G. Raghunadha Reddy said that the institute will provide supporting information to policymakers for the formulation of effective and viable economic policies, market strategies and impact assessment studies in agriculture for attaining the goal of rural welfare. “CARP will study the schemes and programmes such as Rythu Bharosa, e-crop bookings, subsidy seeds, price stabilisation fund, free electricity, and other schemes,” he said. A.P. Agricultural Mission executive member M.

Narasimha Rao said that the formation of the Rohini Commission by the Centre was a significant step in its endeavour to ensure social justice for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). “The move reflects the commitment of the BJP to the welfare of OBCs. Whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) are making false claims to have had ensured the uplift of those sections through their policies and programmes. The BJP is ready for a debate on the issue,” the MP said, alleging that the two regional parties have given various posts to the OBCs only as a token measure. Addressing reporters here on Monday, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that real power was concentrated in the hands of a few leaders in the YSRCP and TDP and even if some significant posts were given to the OBCs, they were meant for personal aggrandisement. He said the YSRCP and TDP should explain why reservations for BC (E) category should not be cancelled, and give the number of MPs, MLAs and MLCs in their parties belonging to the Backward Classes.

TDP leaders objected to the undervaluation of Agrigold assets, alleging that it was being done in order to hand them over at cheap rates. Full amounts should be paid to the victimised depositors, the TDP leaderss said, condemning the decision of the State government for continuing to commit contempt of court regarding clearance of MGNREGS bills. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Reddy took a U-turn on his promise of implementing prohibition across the State in a phased manner, the TDP leaders alleged. ‘Harmful liquor’ was being supplied at exorbitant rates.

Addressing the media here on Monday, GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana said that there are about 578 Sachivalayams in the GVMC limits and each Sachivalayam will receive a garbage collection vehicle. Admitting that there were several issues in garbage collection process due to lack of adequate number of vehicles, she said that there were only one-third of vehicles against what was required till now. The new vehicles will resolve the issue, she said. Around 2.5 lakh Below Poverty Line (BPL) families who are unable to have dustbins in the corporation limits will receive three types of dustbins for dry, wet and hazardous wastes, she said. Explaining the important components of CLAP, Mayor G.

Ms. Srijana said that with the increase in microns, cost of plastic will increase. The main aim of these revised guidelines is to leave plastic and shift to alternative products. “Once we receive formal guidelines, we will prepare an action plan.

According to AU Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy, a few students could secure packages over Rs. 8 lakh per annum. Generally, the packages hover around Rs. 3.6 lakh to Rs. 4.2 lakh. But this year, a few students were selected for packages over Rs. 8 lakh, he said. In Andhra University College of Engineering for Women, the total pass percentage was 93 and close to 90% could secure placements. In the four-year B.Tech course of the AUCoE, the pass percentage was 90 out of a batch of 360 and 88% could get placement. The remaining opted for higher studies. In the six-year integrated B.Tech+M.Tech course, the pass percentage was 90 out of a batch of 500 and 91% could get placed, said Prof. Prasad Reddy. Speaking on branches that did well in placements, he said, “Students from mechanical, electrical, EEE, CSE, ECE and IT did fairly well when it come to placements. But there were a few issues with chemical, metallurgy, naval architecture, marine and civil engineering branches,” he said. Placement officer Though 90% of its students could secure placements, especially during the pandemic phase, the Vice-Chancellor said that top companies did not visit the campus. “Though we are the number one engineering college in the State with a good national ranking and our student profile is very good, as only top EAMCET rankers get placements, we expect top companies to come in, which is not happening,” said Prof. Prasad Reddy. To address this issue, AU has decided to appoint a professional placement officer for the engineering campus. “This officer will be shortly appointed only to take care of the placements. So far we have been depending on this aspect by giving additional charge to a teaching professor,” he said. Foreign faculty To better the exposure of the students, the AU has decided to appoint professors from the foreign universities to take classes. “The classes will be taken online and at least two subjects in every semester will taught by these professors from various foreign universities. We are already in talks with a few of the foreign universities,” said Prof. Prasad Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/90-of-au-engg-students-got-placement-says-vice-chancellor/article36071517.ece
24 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Collective efforts needed to curb crimes against women’||Andhra Pradesh Women’s Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma has said that the State government took several measures for the empowerment of women resulting in their increased participation in various sectors. Addressing the media here on Monday, she said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was keen on implementation of 50% reservation to women in nominated posts and now there was a noticeable change with more and more women entering politics. Similarly, the enrolment of girls in schools has shown a significant increase with toilets and other infrastructure being improved in government schools under the ‘Nadu – Nedu’ programme, Ms. Padma said. The government has launched a number of measures to tackle crimes against girls and women. The Disha app had recorded 30 lakh downloads, two-wheeler were provided to women police and the Disha Police Stations were provided vehicles for ensuring protection of women in distress, she said. Social media When her attention was drawn to the recent attacks on women in Vizianagaram and Guntur, the Women’s Commission Chairperson attributed such incidents to growing friendships through social media, where the identity of the other person was not known. She called for collective efforts to curb such crimes. To another query, she said that the functioning of Internal Complaint Committees (ICCs) was far from satisfactory in many organisations and measures were being taken to strengthen them. ‘Educate students’ Meawhile, Andhra University Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy has said that improved access to education and employment has enabled women to compete with men in all spheres. He was speaking at the inaugural of a one-day training workshop for Members of Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of AU and its affiliated colleges at the Platinum Jubilee Guest House of AU, here, on Monday. Prof. Prasad Reddy said that the ICC should educate both boys and girls on the consequences of sexual harassment. Boys should be made to understand that indulging in harassment could ruin their careers and girls should be told about their rights and reassured that the ICC would do justice to them. He recalled that during his earlier tenure as Registrar, some years ago, he had seen some of his colleagues harassing research scholars and complained to the higher authorities. The Executive Council (EC) had failed to take action against the accused, he said. He said, “Today, the State government has appointed five women to the nine-member EC. The council has recently dismissed one person accused in a sexual harassment case. Such stringent measures will deter others.” Ms. Padma said that meetings were being held all over the State for sharing of opinions and exchange of ideas for strengthening of ICCs, she said. She underlined the need for ICC members to be sensitive in assessing various complaints and abstain from dismissing every complaint as frivolous. “There is a thin line between good and bad and you should be able to distinguish and assess the complaints properly,” she said. A.P. Women’s Commission Member Jayalakshmi, Commissioner Director Ravuri Suez, Director of Durgabai Deshmukh Centre for Women Studies of Andhra University P. Usha and ICDS Project Director Sitamahalakshmi were among those who spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/collective-efforts-needed-to-curb-crimes-against-women/article36071511.ece

24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Optimistic start to COVID vaccination||The mass COVID-19 vaccination programme for the city, initiated by the Telangana State government through GHMC was off to a successful start on Monday. It will continue for the coming 10 days, with the target of 100 per cent first dose vaccination. Teams constituted at circle level have begun to visit colonies and slums to enumerate the vaccinated individuals and families. Successful vaccination of all individuals in a household will earn them a sticker certifying the same, which will be pasted on the door. Special camp In case of people unvaccinated, the team will issue them a slip indicating time and date of vaccination. Mobile vaccination clinics will visit the area to conduct a special camp, after which the colony or slum will be issued a certificate of vaccination. A GHMC official has informed that each team has been allotted about 1,000 households to be covered in the coming 10 days. If need be, the drive will be extended by five more days till the mission is completed. A total of 175 mobile vaccination units have been pressed into service for this programme, which will visit all the 4,846 colonies and slums to conduct the camps. All persons above 18 years of age will be vaccinated in the drive, a statement from GHMC said. So far, a total of 50 lakh residents have been vaccinated against the infection, it said. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar inspected the special vaccination programme organised at CIB Colony of Khairatabad on Monday, and said Hyderabad is the first metropolitan city to begin mass COVID-19 vaccination programme for all the eligible individuals. He urged all the public representatives and corporators to participate in the programme. While assuring that there is no indication of a third wave of the pandemic in the state, Mr.Somesh Kumar said the government is ready to face any situation. A total of 27,000 beds are ready, and the number of beds have been enhanced in the eight government medical colleges, he said. Principal Secretary, Medical & Health, S.A.M.Rizvi, GHMC Commissioner D.S.Lokesh Kumar, Director, Municipal Administration, Satyanarayana, Hyderabad District Collector L.Sharman, and Khairatabad Zonal Commissioner Praveenya participated in the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/optimistic-start-to-covid-vaccination/article36071216.ece
24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||75,000-odd eye patients lose out on vision restoration every year||Every year, around 75,000 of people with corneal blindness in India are missing out on the opportunity to regain vision. Reason? Shortage of donated corneas. Of the approximately one lakh patients with the eye disease, only about 25,000 undergo corneal transplantation. Specialist doctors at L.V. Prasad Eye Hospital (LVPEI) say the current cornea collection in India is able to cater to only one-fourth of the patients in need of corneal transplant surgeries. They have urged people to take a pledge to donate their eyes after death. 60% patients under 12 Speaking about the magnitude of the issue, they said of the 10 million people with blindness in India, over two million are affected by corneal blindness and 60% of them are below the age of 12. The reason could be corneal disease, injury or infection. “Only an eye donation from a deceased person can help restore the sight of a corneally blind person. Lack of awareness, myths and fears associated with eye donation are responsible for people not donating their eyes,” the specialists said. Awareness needed As part of the ‘National Eye Donation Fortnight’ observed every year from August 25 to September 8, LVPEI would organise a series of activities across its network centres to raise awareness about eye donation among the masses. Sunita Chaurasia, medical director–The Ramayamma International Eye Bank, LVPEI, said, “We urge people to come forward and pledge for eye donation. Equally important is that such prospective donors share their pledge and will to donate their eyes with their family members, and request them to execute the same after their death. Eye donation is possible only after the death of a person and with the consent of their family members.” The Ramayamma International Eye Bank crossed the milestone of one lakh cornea collections in 2019. Besides using the corneas for performing corneal transplant surgeries within LVPEI, the institute also distributes corneas to surgeons outside the network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/aye-for-an-eye-urgent-need-for-giving-gift-of-sight-to-thousands/article36071197.ece
24 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Misgivings about new heritage panel emerge||Days after the Telangana Government notified the constitution of Greater Hyderabad Heritage and Precincts Committee (GHHC), there are misgivings about the role of this committee. “It is packed with serving officials. Which officer will go against the will of the government? Do the officials have a stake or interest in the city? And what powers will these two co-opted members will have in the committee,” asks Sajjad Shahid, who has been part of the earlier Heritage Conservation Committees (HCCs) in the city. The GHHC and other district and the apex state heritage authority were notified on August 17 by the State government after nearly eight years since the term of the HCC expired and four years after the new Telangana Heritage Act was created in 2017. One of the reasons for the misgiving is the constitution of the committee which has 16 members headed by the Commissioners of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority. It also has the three police commissioners in the region, Collector of Medchal, Sangareddy, Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts, as well a conservator of forests as its members. The Telangana High Court has, on multiple occasions, asked the State about the heritage conservation committee forcing its hand. The Model Building Bye-Laws of 2016 specifies the qualification for membership of HCCs to include architects, urban planners, structural engineer, conservation architect, historian of the region and a natural historian, environmentalist and headed by the secretary of Urban Development. Prior to this, The GO 416 of 1996 specified the qualification for members of HCC. The Hyderabad HCC consisted of a retired chief secretary, a structural engineer, architect, director of state archaeology, a city historian, an environmentalist and the committee had the power to co-opt five additional members. The building list shrunk to 137 from 150 in March 1998, after the HCC submitted its report based on objections and suggestions showing the kind of power that will be wielded by these committees. Even in Delhi for the Central Vista Project, the Central government had to secure permission from the HCC. While the HCC in Delhi is under the Central government’s jurisdiction, in Telangana, the State government will call the shots. “Hyderabad will get a new masterplan by 2031 and if it overrides Regulation 13, then there will be no protection for Hyderabad’s heritage. The 2017 Heritage Act does not list key sites in Hyderabad which number about 140,” said a heritage activist unwilling to go on record. The High Court in its ruling in the Irram Manzil case had relied on the fact that that building was shown in the Special Reservation Zone in the 2010 masterplan. The HCC is a key to preserving and taking decisions about heritage in the city as the minutes of the meeting are logged and circulated, bringing an element of transparency in the functioning.  It is packed with serving officials. Which officer will go against the will of the government? Do the officials have a stake or interest in the city?

24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC imposes Rs. 25,000 costs on CS||The Telangana High Court on Monday imposed Rs. 25,000 costs on Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, who is also holding the post of Revenue Secretary, in a contempt of court case for the delay in executing the HC order over allotment of land to an ex-serviceman. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed the Chief Secretary to pay the costs to petitioner P. Laxminarayana Reddy, an ex-serviceman, within two weeks. Posting the matter for next hearing after two weeks, the bench also said the Chief Secretary should ensure possession of four acres of land allotted to the petitioner in Yenkepally village of Vikarabad district is handed over to him within two weeks. If possession of the land was not given to Mr. Reddy within two weeks, the Chief Secretary should appear before the court on the next date of hearing, the bench said. The ex-serviceman was allotted four acres of land under ex-servicemen quota by the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh State government. Mr. Reddy moved the High Court stating that the local Revenue authorities declined to handover possession of the land stating that he had not cultivated the said land for three years despite allotment. The ex-serviceman contended that the authorities actually never handed over possession of the land to him. After hearing his contention, a single judge took a serious note of the Revenue authorities’ action and observed that it is unfortunate that State government is treating ex-servicemen so shabbily. He imposed costs of Rs. 20,000 on the Revenue Secretary which was eventually paid by the latter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-imposes-rs-25000-costs-on-cs/article36071225.ece
24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Schools to reopen, but cases in second-wave onset range||The daily COVID-19 caseload in Telangana when schools and other educational institutions were shut for the second time following signs of the pandemic second wave and the current case tally, exactly five months later, is nearly the same. Notwithstanding that, the State government has announced that all educational institutions will be reopened from September 1. On March 23, the State had recorded 431 cases when the Education Minister P. Sabitha Indira Reddy announced in the Assembly that all educational institutions, with the exception of medical colleges, will be closed from March 24. Back then, the daily tests varied from 60,000 to 70,000. Over the past four days (August 20-23), around 75,000 samples are being tested every day, leading to the detection of 350-370 infections. On Sunday, the number of tests fell to around 47,000 and only 231 cases were recorded. Then vs. now The major difference between then and now is the intensity of the second wave. The second wave was taking root when schools were shut from March 24, but it is on the decline now. Signs of the second wave were observed in the second week of March. In fact, one of the early warnings appeared in the form of cluster of COVID cases among students at schools and hostels. From a maximum of 170 new infections in a day till March 7, the daily caseload reached 887 by the month-end. The second wave intensified and peaked in April fourth week. On April 26, as many as 10,122 people were detected with the virus, the highest daily total in the State recorded since the beginning of the pandemic. Currently, the second wave is on the wane. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao, on August 18, said that the COVID-19 second wave in Telangana has come to an end and that now is the time to reopen schools and other educational institutions. Markers Apart from the dailycase load, other factors which are considered to measure the intensity of a COVID wave include the number of ICU beds and oxygen occupied by COVID patients and daily oxygen consumption at hospitals. On March 23, a total of 580 ICU beds were occupied by COVID patients and on August 23, the number stood at 1,091. Parents concerned Following the State government’s decision to reopen educational institutions from September 1, a section of parents has expressed concern that it may trigger the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Senior Health officials earlier said that the risk factors which could trigger third wave are a large number of unvaccinated population, lack of COVID-appropriate precautions and a new variant. They have also mentioned that new variants of coronavirus are seen when large sections of people are not immunised, or do not have antibodies to fight the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/schools-to-reopen-but-cases-in-second-wave-onset-range/article36071201.ece
24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP offers to send Harish on study tour to Bangladesh, Pak.||Telangana BJP, on Monday, has caustically advised ruling ministers and MLAs of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to visit Pakistan, Bangladesh or even the Taliban Afghanistan on “study tours” to understand how these countries were being governed. Taking umbrage at Finance Minister T. Harish Rao’s reference to Bangladesh having a higher GDP when compared to India after the BJP came to power in Delhi, Dubbak MLA M. Raghunandan Rao said anyone who thinks neighbouring countries are doing better can see for themselves the living conditions there. “If Bangladesh is so developed, why have one crore people crossed the border illegally recently? We are ready for an open debate on the TRS finan cial management and the Centre’s at either the Gun Park or the Dr. Marri Chenna Reddy HRD Institute,” he said, at a press conference. Mr. Rao reiterated that the ruling TRS government has pushed the State into a debt trap and even the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) had clearly reported about the fiscal mismanagement here even as the Finance Minister had cleverly not disclosed the debt burden while boasting of high income in his press meet. “Since TRS government claims Telangana to be a rich State with a surplus budget why can it not reduce the taxes on the petrol or diesel or even the gas cylinder prices when it has been getting a windfall of up to 40% from the same?” he asked. Similarly, he demanded Mr. Harish Rao explain why the government has been unable to pay salaries on time, not implementing the pay revision, pensions, loan waiver or the promised stipend to the unemployed youth. The BJP leader charged the government of resorting to land sales, privatisation of the RTC services, contractors being denied payments and the hundreds of tenant farmers continuing to resorting to suicides. “We are ready to show how the country has developed under Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the GDP increasing, per capita income rising and foreign exchange reserves reaching a high,” he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-offers-to-send-harish-on-study-tour-to-bangladesh-pak/article36071226.ece
24 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||41 more oxygen plants in TS soon: Kishan||Union Minister for Culture, Tourism & North East States Development G. Kishan Reddy on Monday announced that 41 more medical oxygen plants are in the process of being installed across Telangana in various government hospitals and medical colleges with funding from PM Cares. Nine more such plants are already in different stages of commissioning in districts including Bhadrachalam, Jagtial, Jangoan, Karimnagar and Nalgonda besides AIIMS-Bibinagar to cater to the demands of patients. Altogether, 1,022 oxygen plants are being set up in the country. Talking to the media after inspecting Gandhi Hospital for the 10th time in as many months, the Minister, who is also Secunderabad MP, pointed out that the two oxygen units installed during the onset of the second COVID-19 wave have been providing 2,000 litres of oxygen every minute. Six smaller units providing 3,000 litres of oxygen a minute have also come up at the hospital with the assistance of the Pollution Control Board and corporate groups, he said, welcoming more such initiatives. “It is a fact that the unprecedented demand for oxygen during the second wave led to a lot of hardships for people and many lives were lost. We have to save lives, so this has led to the government taking up these plants on a massive scale,” said Mr. Reddy. With regard to the apprehensions about the third wave, he said the country has been “fortunate so far”. “I pray to the Almighty it remains so. The next wave will not come from abroad but is for us to control by practising COVID-appropriate behaviour of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing,” he said. The Minister claimed the Centre has been putting its entire might in increasing vaccine production capacities and encouraging research and development into new vaccines with about 58 crore doses administered so far. “We will be in a better position by December as far as vaccination is concerned. Every eligible person, even those in remote tribal areas, will get free vaccine. There are production constraints as it takes close to 128 days for a batch to be produced, and raw materials have to be procured from abroad. Every country has its own COVID issues, so this has become tough. Plus, every batch is tested before being released for vaccination,” he explained. In Telangana alone, 1.61 crore jabs have been administered and another 13.18 lakh vaccine doses stock is available with the hospitals. The Minister urged people to have faith in public healthcare institutions for treatment and vaccination instead of rushing to private hospitals and paying hefty bills. Every vaccine available in the country has been tested for safety and efficacy, so there was no room for doubt. He also sanctioned Rs. 2 crore from his constituency fund for roofing at 19 vaccination centres in Secunderabad as the drive is likely to continue till December-January. “No need to worry about vaccine side-effects; I myself took it at Gandhi Hospital,” said Mr. Reddy, adding that he has been stressing on COVID-appropriate behaviour during his public programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/41-more-oxygen-plants-in-ts-soon-kishan/article36071203.ece

24 August 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Horticulture to promote indigenous varieties||Plans are afoot to promote cultivation of exotic and indigenous fruit crops in little over 14 hectares in the district under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) in the current fiscal 2021-22. The horticulture department has readied an action plan to encourage farmers to take up cultivation of various other fruit crops including banana, papaya, mango, citrus, acid lime, guava, pomegranate and custard apple in 111.60 hectares under the Centrally sponsored scheme in the present financial year. The action plan envisages cultivation of the exotic fruit crop — dragon fruit in six hectares, and the indigenous species — aonla in three hectares, jamun in 2.60 hectares and jackfruit in 2.50 hectares, sources in the horticulture department said. The department is gearing up to conduct awareness programmes to motivate farmers to grow the indigenous fruit species such as aonla, jamun and jackfruit, known for their high nutritional value, by availing the subsidies under the MIDH to secure sustainable income. One of the mission objectives is to conserve the indigenous fruit species, sources added. The department has drawn up an ambitious plan to highlight the benefits of growing indigenous fruit crops like amla and neredu to meet the huge demand for the edible fruits of medicinal and nutritional value.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/horticulture-to-promote-indigenous-varieties/article36071456.ece

24 August 2021||Mumbai,||Uddhav calls for muted dahi handi fete||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday appealed to dahi handi festival mandal s to observe restraint in celebrations this year owing to the pandemic, in the wake of Niti Aayog’s warning of the possibility of a devastating third wave in India next month. “Let’s keep our festivals and celebrations aside for some time to save lives of people. We should send this message to the world that Maharashtra prioritised health over everything. It is time to face the pandemic with patience and resolve,” Mr. Thackeray said in an online meeting of representatives of dahi handi groups, Ministers, doctors, political leaders, and officials. Mr. Thackeray said that restrictions had been in force for over one-and-a-half years now. “One must realise that these restrictions are to save lives. Some are talking about agitating against the restrictions. They would do better if they protested against corona than the government,” he said. Reiterating that relaxations in the pandemic restrictions are only to keep the economy running, Mr. Thackeray said the present “window period” is to be used only to extend relief to the poor. “If the oxygen demand for COVID-19 patients goes above 750 MT, then we will be left with no option but to implement lockdown, yet again,” he added. Senior doctors, including members of the State task force against COVID-19, explained the reasons behind the need to show restraint in dahi handi celebrations. “The festival involves a human pyramid where ‘Govindas’ climb upon each other, water is thrown. A wet mask is useless for protection against the virus. One patient in a group may infect the entire troupe. We should celebrate the spirit of dahi handi by organising blood and medicine donation camps,” Dr. Sanjay Oak said. Meanwhile, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded that the government allow a traditional dahi handi in the spirit of the festival. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said, “Low height handis with minimum crowd and only those with two doses of vaccine should be allowed. This is our demand. The Sena is neglecting it, but we will continue to push for it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uddhav-calls-for-muted-dahi-handi-fete/article36071073.ece

24 August 2021||New Delhi,||Kejriwal inaugurates smog tower in Connaught Place||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday inaugurated a ‘smog tower’ in Connaught Place and said similar towers would be built across the city, if results of the current pilot project are satisfactory. The smog tower is a 24 metre-high structure fitted with fans and air filters. It will draw in polluted air from the top and release filtered air near the ground through fans fitted on the sides. The tower has 40 big fans and 5,000 filters to clean the air. Pilot project “This tower has been established as a pilot project and detailed studies will be conducted on its performance. IIT-Delhi and IIT-Bombay will analyse data and submit a report on the effectiveness of the tower. Once satisfactory results are received about the tower’s effectiveness, then the model will be replicated and smog towers will be established all over Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said. “The tower will take in air from a radius of 1 km. It has a capacity of cleaning 1,000 cubic metres of air per second. It is estimated that the area will see a rapid change in air quality due to this smog tower,” he added. On January 13 last year, the Supreme Court had ordered the Delhi government to build a ‘smog tower’ at Connaught Place by April 13, 2020, to control air pollution. On the same day, the court also ordered a smog tower to be installed in Anand Vihar by the Central Pollution Control Board, by the same time. But both the governments missed the deadline. On July 29, 2020, the Supreme Court threatened contempt action against the IIT-Bombay on learning that the premier institution has opted to pull out of the court-ordered project to install the smog tower. Less than a month after this, an MoU was signed for building the tower. The Delhi pollution control committee was the nodal authority for building the tower. IIT-Bombay and IIT-Delhi were technical advisors and Tata Project Ltd. executed the project. On Friday, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said once the monsoon season is over the tower will function at full capacity. “Then IIT-Delhi and IIT-Bombay’s experts will start their research on its performance. The Delhi government is committed in its fight against pollution and this tower will deeply aid this fight and act as a technological foundation for our future projects,” Mr. Rai said.

24 August 2021||new delhi,||Ensure quick relief to children who have lost parents to COVID: HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday observed that the city government must iron out issues which are making cumbsersome the disbursement of benefits of schemes for children who have lost their parents to COVID-19. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked: “It would be unfair to expect children who lost their parents to be able to procure documents and to avail benefits which they are entitled to.” There are 6,200 chidren who are left with a single parent and 292 left orphaned as on August 16, 2021, due to COVID-19, as per a status report filed by the Department of Women and Child Development and the Department of Social Welfare. Since the schemes have been framed to grant benefits to children, the government has to take a proactive approach rather than taking such applications in a routine way, the HC stated. The observation came after advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing Bachpan Bachao Andolan, submitted that even though numerous schemes were framed after April this year, nothing much has moved on the ground. Ms. Kaur highlighted the instance of one family comprising seven children, who lost both parents to COVID-19 this year. Seven siblings Of the seven siblings, five are minors. The eldest is 23 years old and the youngest is just four. Ms. Kaur submitted that the children are provided with basic ration and school books, but they still need care and support. Ms. Kaur said it was not possible for the children to repeatedly approach the committee for their daily needs like milk and ration. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, submitted that the implementation of the schemes for grant of benefits was taking time on account of verification of documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ensure-quick-relief-to-children-who-have-lost-parents-to-covid-hc/article36071108.ece
24 August 2021||new delhi,||Centre, Delhi get six more weeks to reply on Jaipur Golden deaths||The Delhi High Court on Monday gave six weeks additional time to the Centre and the Delhi government to submit their stand on a petition seeking a CBI probe into the death of 21 COVID-19 patients at Jaipur Golden Hospital here in April allegedly due to shortage of oxygen. Justie Rekha Palli was hearing a petition filed by the families of some patients, who died on the intervening night of April 23 and 24, 2021. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said the aspect of criminal probe was pending consideration before a magisterial court. Advocate Utsav Bains, appearing for the petitioners, said the aggrieved families before the High Court and the magisterial court were not the same. On June 4, the HC had issued notices to the Centre and Delhi government on the petition which contended that the cause of death of the patients was respiratory failure due to insufficient supply of oxygen and not comorbidities as stated by a Delhi government committee in its report. The families said the panel came out with an “erroneous” report that those who died did not suffer suffocation due to lack of oxygen supply. The petition sought for a probe by the CBI or an independent agency into the deaths “so that the truth can be brought to light”, and the families can be provided proper compensation. ‘Deliberate inaction’ The plea alleged that the incident took place “due to deliberate inaction and failure of the Centre and Delhi governments to provide adequate oxygen to patients despite knowing any shortage would lead to their immediate death”. “The respondents have rendered themselves not only liable to pay compensation to the families of the deceased but also for criminal prosecution for culpable homicide,” the plea has said. The petitioners also contended that the hospital did not inform the family members about the shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/centre-delhi-get-six-more-weeks-to-reply-on-jaipur-golden-deaths/article36071110.ece
24 August 2021||New Delhi,||AAP holds protests over Novelty Cinema land sale||The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday said its workers protested in all 272 wards of Delhi against the BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation for allegedly selling Novelty Cinema land worth Rs. 200 crore for Rs. 34 crore. “AAP workers took out a ‘padyatra’ against the civic body. The workers made people aware of how the BJP-ruled civic body sold the Novelty Cinema land worth Rs. 200 crore for a mere Rs. 34 crore. In the padyatra, they also told the people how the BJP is trying to fill its pockets with the help of corruption,” the party said. AAP leader and Leader of Opposition in the North civic body Vikas Goyal said that for the last 15 years, the BJP has been ruling the municipal corporation and they have not fulfilled a “single responsibility”. “Be it cleanliness and hygiene of the city, be it running civic body hospitals and schools or be it trying to curb water-borne diseases, the municipal corporation has paid no heed to any of it,” Mr. Goyal said. He along with other workers protested outside Novelty Cinema and demanded the North corporation to withdraw the decision to sell Novelty Cinema land. ‘Other scams’ He said the party will continue to protest till the demand is met. “The moral duty of theirs is committing corruption. They have not lost even one opportunity to not do corruption. The Bhalswa landfill scam, the medicine scam, books and mid-day meal scam, you just name the job, they will find a way to do corruption. They have ransacked the civic body and made it bankrupt,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-holds-protests-over-novelty-cinema-land-sale/article36071112.ece

Mr. Bidhuri also added that all colonies in Yamuna Khaddar should be regularised.

24 August 2021||Pune,||Rift in Congress widens: ex-MLA demands Dairy Minister’s ouster||With the Maharashtra Congress riven by internal turmoil and factionalism, another blow was dealt by former legislator Ashish Deshmukh, who has demanded that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray dismiss State Minister and fellow Congress leader Sunil Kedar from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Cabinet after accusing him of getting a lawyer-friend of his appointed as government pleader in the multi-crore Nagpur District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) scam case, in which Mr. Kedar is one of the main accused. Mr. Deshmukh, in a letter to Mr. Thackeray, also demanded that Mr. Kedar, who is the Dairy and Animal Husbandry Minister, be prosecuted separately in the Rs. 156 crore government securities scam. Massive irregularities within the NDCCB first came to light in 2002. After a protracted investigation over the next 12 years, Mr. Kedar, who was the bank’s chairman in 2000, was slapped with a Bombay High Court notice in 2014, which directed him and the bank’s then general manager Ashok Choudhary and nine others to pay up on defaulted dues amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees. Alleging that Mr. Kedar got his lawyer-friend, who is head of the State Congress’s legal cell, appointed as government pleader in the case, Mr. Deshmukh, in his letter dated August 22, said that it amounted to conflict of interest and that Mr. Kedar’s “appointee” should not be allowed to fight the case. The letter accused Mr. Kedar of making this move with the sole aim of getting himself acquitted. According to observers, Mr. Kedar’s ouster would make Mr. Deshmukh, a former MLA from Katol in Nagpur, the most prominent Congress face in Vidarbha. Meanwhile, while Mr. Deshmukh clamoured for the ouster of his own party colleague, the Opposition BJP said that it would not demand Mr. Kedar’s resignation until the charges against him were proven by the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rift-in-congress-widens-ex-mla-demands-dairy-ministers-ouster/article36071071.ece

24 August 2021||Kabul,||No extension for evacuations, warn Taliban||The Taliban warned on Monday there would be “consequences” if the U.S. and its allies extend their presence in Afghanistan beyond next week, as chaos continued to overwhelm Kabul airport. The Islamists’ takeover of the country last weekend shocked Western nations, coming just two weeks before an August 31 deadline for all troops to fully withdraw from the country. To manage the chaotic airlifting of foreigners and Afghans — many of whom fear reprisals for working with Western nations — thousands of soldiers have poured back into Afghanistan, with pressure growing on Washington to extend the deadline. But the Taliban on Monday showed no willingness to compromise, with spokesman Suhail Shaheen telling Sky News that staying beyond the agreed deadline would be “extending occupation”. “If the U.S. or U.K. were to seek additional time to continue evacuations -- the answer is no... there would be consequences,” he said. President Biden has insisted he wants to end the U.S. military presence and the airlifts by August 31. But with the EU and Britain saying it would be impossible to get everyone out by then, Mr. Biden is under pressure to extend the deadline. Speaking at the White House on Sunday, Mr. Biden said talks were under way to explore the possibility of extending the deadline. He also acknowledged the tragic scenes at the airport, which have included babies and children being passed to soldiers over razor-wire fences and men clinging to the outside of departing planes.  “There is no way to evacuate this many people without pain and loss and heartbreaking images you see,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/no-extension-for-evacuations-warn-taliban/article36070790.ece
24 August 2021||Kabul,||Militants say ‘besieged’ Panjshir Valley||The Taliban said on Monday their fighters had surrounded resistance forces holed up in Afghanistan’s Panjshir Valley but were looking to negotiate rather than take the fight to them. The announcement follows scattered reports of clashes overnight, with pro-Taliban social media accounts claiming gunmen were massing, and Afghanistan’s former Vice-President saying resistance forces were holding strong. Taliban fighters “are stationed near Panjshir”, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted, saying they had the area surrounded on three sides. “The Islamic Emirate is trying to resolve this issue peacefully,” he added. Pro-resistance accounts on social media had dismissed earlier claims of being pushed back, saying Taliban fighters had been ambushed and routed. Claims from either side were impossible to independently verify. Panjshir remains the last major holdout of anti-Taliban forces, led by Ahmad Massoud, son of the famed Mujahideen leader Ahmed Shah Massoud. Former Afghan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh is also there. The Valley is guarded by a narrow gorge, making entry — or escape — extraordinarily difficult for outsiders, who can be picked off by entrenched forces positioned on higher ground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/militants-say-afghan-resistance-force-besieged-but-seek-talks/article36070795.ece
24 August 2021||Singapore,||Harris vows ‘enduring engagement’ in Asia||Vice President Kamala Harris vowed “enduring engagement” in Asia on Monday, offering reassurances of Washington’s commitment to the region even as the U.S. completes its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover. The hardline Islamists’ swift return to power a week ago, and desperate scenes of thousands trying to flee, have cast a shadow over the U.S.’ status as a global superpower. But on a visit to Singapore, her first stop on a trip that will also include Vietnam, Ms. Harris repeatedly insisted that Washington could be depended on. “Our administration is committed to enduring engagement in Singapore, into Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific,” Ms. Harris told a press conference alongside Singapore’s leader. “The reason I am here is because the United States is a global leader, and we take that role seriously.” Questions on credibility But she dodged questions about whether U.S. credibility had been damaged by the Afghan debacle, saying her government’s focus was on “evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us and vulnerable Afghans, including women and children”. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong welcomed the Vice-President’s reassurances and said Singapore was offering a military aircraft to help in the chaotic evacuation from Kabul airport overseen by the U.S. Army. But he also expressed hopes that “Afghanistan does not become an epicentre for terrorism again”. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is seeking to reset relationships in Asia after the turbulent Trump era, and project Washington as a stabilising force in the face of growing Chinese aggression. But analysts say the seizure of power by the Taliban, notorious for their brutal 1996-2001 rule, and rapid collapse of U.S.-trained Afghan forces have caused fresh concerns about US dependability. Ms. Harris is also facing criticism for being tone-deaf in going ahead with a visit to Vietnam as U.S. forces struggle to evacuate tens of thousands of people. The crisis has prompted comparisons with the trauma of 1975 in Saigon, when U.S. helicopters ferried final evacuees from the embassy roof, as Viet Cong troops advanced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/harris-vows-enduring-engagement-in-asia/article36070797.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nepal PM Deuba behind silent campaign against Oli: Bhattarai||The Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Deuba has launched a silent campaign against former premier K.P. Sharma Oli that is fast reconfiguring the political set-up in Nepal, said a leading member of Mr. Oli’s party, CPN-UML. The allegation by Mr. Rajan Bhattarai, the chief of the foreign affairs cell of the party, came on a day when Mr. Vijay Chauthaiwale of Bharatiya Janata Party’s foreign affairs cell held extensive discussion on the changing political scenario of Nepal. “He has changed the rules of formation of Nepal’s political parties and helped Madhav Kumar Nepal in splitting away from CPN-UML. This was done to reduce the size and influence of our party which is the largest communist party of Nepal. This is aimed at strengthening the position of the government,” said Mr. Bhattarai, explaining that the move will “have widespread ramification in Nepal’s political system.” The government of Prime Minister Deuba on August 18 passed an ordinance that allows split in a political party with the support of 20% central committee or parliamentary party members. Earlier, the requirement for registering a new party was support from 40% members of central committee or parliamentary party. The ordinance has benefited former PM Madhav Kumar Nepal, who was among the main challengers against Mr. Oli and created a series of political crises for Mr. Oli that ultimately led to his dismissal by the Supreme Court of Nepal. Mr. Nepal has formed a separate party. The ordinance is expected to reconfigure the setting of the political parties in Nepal and influence the equation between the government of Mr. Deuba and the rest of the political class. In the midst of the ongoing politicalw reconfiguration, Mr. Chauthaiwale held a meeting with the leaders of several political parties in Kathmandu. Mr. Chauthaiwale is the first high-level Indian delegate to visit Nepal since the August 18 amendment was passed by the Deuba government. The Opposition led by CPN-UML has been criticising the amendment as a move to corner more political power. “In last 24 hours, I met four senior-most leaders of Nepal, Sher Bahadur Deuba, K.P. Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda and Mahanta Thakur Ji, representing diverse ideological and political spectrum,” said Mr. Chauthaiwale in a social media post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nepal-pm-deuba-behind-silent-campaign-against-oli-bhattarai/article36070788.ece
24 August 2021||Beijing,||China reports zero local virus cases as Delta outbreak retreats||China reported no new domestic coronavirus cases on Monday, and Beijing appears poised to bring to heel the pandemic’s most serious resurgence in months — driven by the highly contagious Delta variant — with mass testing and targeted lockdowns. The latest outbreak, which began in mid-July when cleaners at a Nanjing airport tested positive, is the most severe since COVID-19 first surfaced in the central city of Wuhan. Over a thousand people have been infected across dozens of cities. But Communist authorities reacted with swift localised lockdowns, travel restrictions and mass testing of neighbourhoods with infections as part of their “zero case” approach to the pandemic, which has virtually sealed off China’s borders but allowed the economy to rebound. New domestic infections have been falling for over two weeks. On Monday, National Health Commission data showed local infections returned to zero after a five week battle. Meanwhile, health experts are attempting to shore up confidence in the country’s vaccination drive. As of Saturday, almost 1.94 billion vaccine doses have been administered, official figures show, although the proportion of vaccinated people is unclear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-reports-zero-local-virus-cases-as-delta-outbreak-retreats/article36070791.ece
24 August 2021||Washington,||U.S. grants Pfizer vaccine full approval, triggers new mandates||The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a move expected to trigger a new wave of vaccine mandates as the Delta variant batters the country. Around 52% of the country is fully vaccinated, but health authorities have hit a wall of vaccine hesitant people, impeding the national campaign. “The FDA’s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. “While all three COVID vaccines have met FDA’s strict standards for emergency use, this FDA approval should give added confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective. If you’re not vaccinated yet, now is the time,” tweeted President Joe Biden. The vaccine, which will now be marketed under its brand name Comirnaty, is the first to receive full approval. More than 200 million shots have already been administered under an emergency use authorization (EUA) that was granted on December 11, 2020. The FDA is continuing to investigate safety data regarding myocarditis (heart inflammation), particularly within seven days after the second dose. The U.S. military said shortly after the announcement that it would mandate the vaccine, and a slew of private businesses and universities are expected to follow. Immediately after the announcement, New York City said it would require all its department of education employees to receive at least one dose of vaccine by September 27. The vaccine remains available under emergency use authorisation to children aged 12 to 15, but because it has now been fully approved, physicians may prescribe it to children under 12 if they believe it will be beneficial. “One of the talking points of the anti-vaccine movement which has falsely claimed that this was an ‘experimental vaccine’ has been removed,” Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security said. “Hopefully now you’ll see people who said that they were waiting for full approval line up to get vaccinated, hopefully more organizations, more businesses will require the vaccine as a condition of employment as a condition of participation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-grants-pfizer-vaccine-full-approval-triggers-new-mandates/article36070799.ece
24 August 2021||Jerusalem,||Gaza incendiary balloons trigger fires in Israel||Incendiary balloons launched from Gaza sparked fires in southern Israel on Monday, authorities said, after weekend border clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces wounded dozens of people. Incendiary balloon launches are a common tactic used by Palestinian militants in the enclave, which has been under a strict Israeli blockade since 2007, when Hamas Islamists took power in the Gaza Strip. Israel frequently responds with air strikes, including after such devices were launched on August 6. In a statement, the fire service said it was working to contain a number of fires in the Eshkol border region, which it blamed on at least nine incendiary balloons launched from Gaza. Saturday saw intense hostilities on the border. Israeli troops fired at Palestinian protesters who had gathered near the Gaza border and hurled explosives. An Israeli border police officer and a 13-year-old Palestinian were critically injured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gaza-incendiary-balloons-trigger-fires-in-israel/article36070792.ece
24 August 2021||Islamabad,||‘TTP won’t be able to operate on Afghan soil’||Pakistan’s Interior Minister on Monday said that the Afghan Taliban have assured the government that it would not allow their soil to be used against it by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militants, amidst reports that several hardcore TTP terrorists have been released in Afghanistan after the insurgents seized Kabul. The TTP has carried out a number of major terror attacks across Pakistan and reportedly been using Afghan soil to plot terrorist attacks in this country. Addressing a press conference, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that the government has taken note of the reports that the Afghan Taliban have set free some TTP militants, including its leading commander Maulvi Faqir Mohammad, after taking over the war-torn country, and it was in “full contact” with the Taliban on the issue. “The Afghan Taliban have reassured (us) that Afghanistan’s land will not be allowed to be used in any case by the TTP,” he said. The Minister’s remarks came amidst a media report that Pakistan has handed over to the Afghan Taliban a list of “most wanted terrorists” linked to the TTP, who were still active in Afghanistan. According to The Express Tribune report, the list was shared with the Afghan Taliban leadership recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-wont-let-ttp-use-afghan-soil-against-pak/article36070789.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||A pragmatic Afghan behind the religious garb?||Personnel of the institutions responsible for monitoring India’s external environment and ensuing the security of the country and its citizens, probably know more about the composition and character of the Taliban than they are letting out. They would do us all a favour if they were to loosen up a little since we need a vigorous national debate to reorient ourselves after the strategic situation was convulsed savagely over the past fortnight. Some pointers The foremost question in the minds of those thinking about Afghanistan is whether there is a Taliban 2.0. Is this avatar that stormed into Kabul on August 15 after capturing most of the country’s 34 provinces in a whirlwind campaign, any different from the barbaric entity that ruled the Afghans between 1996 and 2001. Currently, the answer to that question is up in the air since reports seem to support neither conclusion. We will perhaps truly know only if and when this dispensation consolidates its power. Meanwhile, we can consider some pointers. Between 1996 and 2001, when they were in power previously, the Taliban did almost nothing to improve conditions in what had by then become a devastated, impoverished country. All that the mullahs seemed to be interested in was oppressing women and minorities and providing sanctuary for jihadi terrorists from every part of the world. That crazed enterprise came to an end after the Arab guests over-played their hand, massacred civilians in the United States on September 11, 2001 and invited retaliation that drove the Talibs back to their old sanctuaries in Pakistan. Their return to power has raised the strong possibility that Afghanistan will revert to primordial mode. Apart from the memory of the consequences of 9/11, are there other factors that could inhibit the Taliban from reverting to their old ways? The departure and after No indication of a change in character of the movement or acceptability to the people is provided by the rapid disintegration of the previous government’s defence apparatus. The melting away of an army raised, trained, equipped and paid by the U.S. that was tasked with the mission of propping up the democratic order has occasioned much surprise. In retrospect, perhaps the only surprising element is that the event caused so much surprise. Amidst the current bewilderment at the ease with which the Taliban advanced, it is easy to forget that much the same pattern unfolded on the first occasion. The Taliban built up their presence and hence their strength steadily from pocket to pocket before moving towards a frenzied denouement. There seems to be a characteristic of Afghan warfare that combat is carried out for so long as it is feasible and given up as soon as it is not. This was an army raised to defend nebulous concepts such as nation, democracy, citizens’ rights, etc. from amongst a populace that has no experience in the operationalisation of these ideals. Traditionally, the Afghan has fought for his tribe, his clan or his family except when inspired by a few mighty war leaders down the ages. The men who joined the U.S.-created army must have done so overwhelmingly because the superpower was paying their salaries and feeding them. Once the U.S. decided to pull out unilaterally, it must have been clear to everyone concerned that the flow of funds would stop. With U.S. President Joe Biden setting August 31 as the date of America’s final departure, the timeline was clear to all. How could anyone have expected men posted at isolated bases to hold out when they could see that the supply of ammunition, fuel and food would stop in the not too distant future? Warlords and strategy Surprise has also been expressed at the inaction of the old warlords. Two of them, Ismail Khan and Abdul Rashid Dostum, have been in battle mode for 40 years and are well versed in the extreme viciousness of Afghan politics. A fight to the death would have been a last option, though accommodation could have been just as dangerous. For people like them, abject or complete surrender opens up the prospect of humiliation, torture, mutilation and execution. Not only for themselves personally but also for their families and adherents. Given the scenario, Dostum and Ismail Khan would probably not have stopped their men from fighting — as they both did — unless they had been provided assurances backed by solid guarantees. In Afghanistan’s current circumstances, only regional councils of notables (Shuras) can provide such guarantees. According to reports, Taliban commanders in various sectors had asked regional notables to negotiate the surrenders of government forces. It seems reasonable to think that Shuras also offered guarantees to the hold-outs. The very existence of these regional groupings appears to mark another difference between the Taliban’s victory in 1996 and its current success. From 1980, when the Soviets began their programme to pacify the countryside, to 2001 at least, conditions were so precarious that neutrals could do little. Many tribal elders, village heads, religious figures, etc. became collateral damage or fled abroad. There was no reason for the refugees to return either when the mujahideen factions got control of different pockets from 1992 to 1996 or even when the Taliban captured most of the country. There was too much of fighting in the first phase and too many other disincentives in the second. The U.S. and change With the entry of the U.S. into Afghan territory, there might have been no reduction in the physical danger (this pacification programme was just as brutal). However, economic activity and the sheer availability of funds, increased manifold. Electricity production and distribution improved significantly; highways were built up; mobile telephony was introduced and spread with its usual rapidity; and, the U.S., other governments and international agencies pumped in billions of dollars. Over 20 years, Afghans have been given enough reason to return to their farms and restart their businesses or professions. Regional elites, either the offspring of the old grandees or those who had prospered in exile, are bound to have regrouped in these circumstances. Would such regional elites be strong enough to hold the Taliban to account? Probably not, ultimately. But would the Taliban want to resort to the ultimate in a hurry? Most of them too have been living in refugee camps or something similar for the past 40 years. Leaders of the group must be in their 60’s with families clamouring for the chance to live in peace and prosper. Those wishes can only be fulfilled if combat ends, and it will not if others too are not given their share of the cake. The next chapter If Taliban leaders are so keen on participating in the development of their country and benefiting from the process personally, would not the same consideration have come into play in 1996? Did they not instead go about stifling their own people and antagonising the whole world? One major difference is that in the earlier period, these semi-literates had no ideas for developing their country, and knew it. Today, after the laying down of modern infrastructure and the return of people who can run industry and trade, the means for building the economy are visible and available. Political power will help the mullahs live as parasites, but the economy must function for them to be able to do so. Many analysts would say that rational thinking of this sort is alien to the Taliban. That they are religious fanatics ready to sacrifice everything on earth for a place in paradise. If they show that they are no different from what they were between 1996 and 2001, they need to be opposed on moral principle and for our national interest. However, there still seems to be time enough to find out if the pragmatic Afghan lurks behind the religious garb.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The Indian economy is struggling to recover||The International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s July version of the World Economic Outlook Update emphasises a dangerous divergence in economic prospects between the advanced countries and emerging economies. The global economy is projected to grow at 6% in 2021, a figure which is unchanged from the IMF’s April forecast. However, this is yet another instance where averages are misleading. While the forecast for advanced countries has been revised upwards, prospects for emerging countries and particularly those in Asia are projected to be somewhat worse. Quick pace of recovery This divergence in the pace of recovery from the pandemic is attributed mainly to two factors. First, there has been a huge difference in the pace of vaccine roll-out between the advanced and the emerging and low-income countries. The advanced economies have allocated large sums in procuring COVID-19 vaccines on a priority basis. Even the Trump administration, not known to be one with a human face, was proactive in transferring large sums to several pharmaceutical companies as soon as the magnitude of the global health crisis became apparent. This enabled the companies to develop and produce vaccines at breakneck speed. Pre-orders have enabled the U.S. to fully vaccinate over half the total population while over 60% have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.K. has also done exceedingly well in its vaccination drive. The European Union countries were slow off the block, but have now started vaccinating their population at an impressive pace. Overall, over 40% of the population in advanced economies have been fully vaccinated, according to the IMF. Compare this with just 11% in emerging market economies. The advanced countries now feel that the pandemic situation is under control. At any rate, unless something goes dramatically wrong, the possibility of large-scale lockdowns in these countries has receded. Second, the advanced economies have been able to use their vastly superior fiscal situation to implement significantly bigger stimulus packages. Apart from allocations designed to directly support domestic industry and growth, sizeable income support measures have been provided that have both propped up consumer demand and mitigated extreme hardships to thousands of people. This kind of fiscal support promises to continue well into 2021. These measures have ensured that advanced economies do not suffer the kind of damage witnessed elsewhere and have also accelerated the pace of economic recovery. Business confidence is recovering too, partly due to the feeling that COVID-19 has been tamed thanks to the protection provided by the vaccination cover. A laggard The Indian economy has been one of the laggards among the emerging market economies. After the first COVID-19 wave, it contracted by over 7% during 2020-21. This earned India the dubious record of being the country with the worst performance among all major world economies. Earlier projections claimed that the economy would grow at over 10% during the current year. However, no one had taken the severity of the second COVID-19 wave into account. The dislocations caused by the pandemic have resulted in lower growth estimates for the Indian economy. Although growth is muted and recovery is slow, retail inflation has crossed 6%, which is above the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s ‘safe’ level. Food prices too have played their part in contributing to the overall rate of inflation. This is a serious matter since the poor are particularly hard hit if food prices cannot be controlled. The overall price situation puts the RBI in a quandary. Should it tighten monetary policy in order to contain prices but also slow down the pace of recovery? Or should it try to promote economic growth and let prices find their own level? Fortunately, crude oil prices have cooled off in international markets and this will naturally have a cooling effect on domestic prices. Consumer spending has also been extremely sluggish and shows no signs of picking up. For instance, Google Mobility Index data showed that on July 26, visits to retail establishments including restaurants, cafes and shopping centres were down 20% compared to a pre-COVID-19 baseline. Sales of consumer durables are yet to pick up. Not surprisingly, business confidence is low and so entrepreneurs are wary of making new investments. This is evident from the fact that bank credit to the commercial sector has plummeted. The last component of domestic demand is government spending. But the government too has cut back spending as a proportion of GDP. Fortunately, Goods and Services Tax collections have been extremely good and this may induce the government to loosen the purse strings during the rest of the financial year. Much will depend upon the progress of the pandemic in the near future. Most experts claim that a third wave of COVID-19 will soon be upon us. The peak level of infection is supposed to be significantly lower than what we experienced a couple of months ago. However, the different variants of the virus and their differential transmission rates make it difficult to predict the spread of infection and hence the extent of economic disruption, although the current wisdom seems to be that vaccines are very effective in preventing serious illness. Source of disquiet This brings to the fore the very poor spread of vaccination in the country. India was known as the ‘vaccine capital’ of the world; yet the spread of vaccines has been abysmal. There is no doubt that the Central government was rather complacent in 2020. Unlike in the U.S., there was no attempt to accelerate production facilities in companies like the Serum Institute of India. The devastation caused by the second wave seems to have induced a sense of urgency in the Central government, which has now become more proactive. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the Central government will be able to achieve its target of vaccinating all adults by the end of the year. An added source of disquiet is that doubts have been expressed about the long-term efficacy of existing vaccines, particularly against mutations. Recently, Pfizer released data showing that there is a slight fall in protection against any symptomatic infection six months after immunisation, though protection against severe COVID-19 remained at nearly 97%. However, it is becoming clear that the virus is clever at evading the defences created by vaccines. In particular, there is now evidence which suggests that the Delta variant can cause breakthrough infections – several people are being infected even after being fully vaccinated. For instance, Israel, which implemented a very successful vaccination campaign, has witnessed an alarming rise in new infections. This has prompted Israel to offer a third dose of the vaccine to anyone above 60 years who was vaccinated at least five months earlier. Germany too has decided to offer booster doses to the elderly. Obviously, any need to provide booster doses will aggravate the existing shortage of vaccines in the country. This puts a question mark on whether we will soon witness the resumption of robust sustainable growth.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Tauktae, Yaas and planning for the next||The severe cyclones, Tauktae and Yaas, which battered India earlier this year, made landfalls on the country’s western coast, Gujarat, and the eastern coast, Odisha, on May 17 and May 26, 2021, respectively. Both storms caused massive damage to infrastructure, the agricultural sector, and houses. Government of India reports are that, put together, an estimated 199 people died, 37 million people were affected, and economic losses stood at Rs. 320 billion (U.S.$4.3 billion). In addition, crop area of 0.24 million hectares was affected, and around 0.45 million houses were damaged. Moreover, 2.5 million people were evacuated to cyclone shelters and relief camps in these two States. The large-scale uprooting of trees in the urban areas affected already depleting green cover. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these cyclones caused additional financial responsibility for State governments. The health costs need to be measured too. More frequent Increasing sea surface temperatures in the northern Indian Ocean and the geo-climatic conditions in India have led to a rise in the frequency of devastating cyclones in the coastal States accounting for 7% of the global tropical cyclones, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD), 2013 data. Every year, around five to six tropical cyclones are formed in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea; of these, two to three turn severe. The Indian coastline is around 7,500 km; there are 96 coastal districts (which touch the coast or are close to it), with 262 million people exposed to cyclones and tsunamis. The World Bank and the United Nations (2010) estimate that around 200 million city residents would be exposed to storms and earthquakes by 2050 in India. Between 1891 and 2020, out of the 313 cyclones crossing India’s eastern and western coasts, 130 were classified as severe cyclonic storms. The west coast experienced 31 cyclones, while 282 cyclones crossed the east coast. The Odisha coast witnessed 97 cyclones, followed by Andhra Pradesh (79), Tamil Nadu (58), West Bengal (48), Gujarat (22), Maharashtra/Goa (7), and Kerala (2). The economic costs Among the natural disasters, cyclones constituted the second most frequent phenomena that occurred in 15% of India’s total natural disasters over 1999-2020. During the same period, 12,388 people were killed, and the damage was estimated at $32,615 million. Cyclones are the second most expensive in terms of the costs incurred in damage, accounting for 29% of the total disaster-related damages after floods (62%). In addition, they are the third most lethal disaster in India after earthquakes (42%) and floods (33%). However, fatalities due to cyclones declined from 10,378 in 1999 to 110 in 2020; the significant drop was on account of improved early warning systems, cyclone forecasting, and better disaster management activities such as timely evacuation, rehabilitation and relief distributions. But these measures are not adequate to achieve a zero-fatality approach and minimise economic losses from cyclones. Between 1999 and 2020, cyclones inflicted substantial damage to public and private properties, amounting to an increase in losses from $2,990 million to $14,920 million in the absence of long-term mitigation measures. In addition, damages caused due to cyclones increased nine times during the same period. As stated earlier, cyclones also led to an increase in the fiscal burden of governments through increased spending to implement effective cyclone preparation measures. As a result, direct government expenditure on natural calamities increased 13 times. The Asian Development Bank’s report in 2014 estimated that India would suffer a loss of around 1.8% of GDP annually by 2050 from climate-related events. India lost around 2% of GDP and 15% of total revenue over 1999-2020. According to the Global Climate Risk Index report 2021, India ranks the seventh worst-hit country globally in 2019 due to the frequent occurrence of extreme weather-related events. Moreover, the report showed that India lost around 2,267 human lives, while damages stood at $68,812 million in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms in 2019. In the same year, India ranked first concerning human deaths and economic losses due to extreme weather-related events (Eckstein et al. , 2021). Measures in Odisha In the aftermath of the 1999 super cyclone, the Government of Odisha took up various cyclone mitigation measures which included installing a disaster warning system in the coastal districts, and construction of evacuation shelters in cyclone-prone districts. Other steps were the setting up of the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA), conducting regular cabinet meetings for disaster preparedness, and building the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF). All these activities have helped to minimise the toll from cyclonic storms such as Hudhud, Fani, Amphan, and Yaas. Still, Odisha’s disaster management model is inadequate to minimise the economic losses that result from cyclones. Therefore, the Government of India should adopt a few measures to minimise disaster damage and fatalities. Essential steps First, it is imperative to improve the cyclone warning system and revamp disaster preparedness measures. Second, the Government must widen the cover under shelterbelt plantations and help regenerate mangroves in coastal regions to lessen the impact of cyclones. In addition, adopting cost-effective, long-term mitigation measures, including building cyclone-resilient infrastructure such as constructing storm surge-resilient embankments, canals and improving river connectivity to prevent waterlogging in low-lying areas are important. Third, installing disaster-resilient power infrastructure in the coastal districts, providing concrete houses to poor and vulnerable households, and creating massive community awareness campaigns are essential. Finally, healthy coordination between the Centre and the States concerned is essential to collectively design disaster mitigation measures. It is only such a collective mitigation effort by the Centre and States that can help reduce the fiscal burden of States and also be effective in minimising disaster deaths.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Finding a healthy way to cook||In India, many women in poor households who use firewood or dung cakes for cooking spend long hours collecting firewood and making dung cakes. This is drudgery. It affects their health and puts the safety of women and girls in jeopardy. Using firewood and dung cakes also leads to indoor pollution, as chulhas (firewood-based stoves) using these sources of energy release carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Both these gases have an adverse impact on the health of the family members. They also impact the environment. The earlier solution to this problem — smokeless or fuel-efficient chulhas for cooking — was introduced in the 1980s. The National Programme on Improved Chulha was launched in 1984. This was backed by training programmes for making and maintaining these  chulhas. But these programmes failed when subsidies were withdrawn, governments lost interest, people could not be convinced to use the new chulhas and did not participate, target beneficiaries were not properly identified, and there was little quality control. Introducing LPG The Indian government then introduced Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in June 2013 under the PAHAL scheme on an experimental basis. The scheme finally covered 291 districts. Access to this clean energy was expected to alleviate the public health burden posed by household air pollution on women. With rising incomes, the lower classes were expected to be covered by the scheme. The scheme, it was thought, would improve women’s access to education, leisure, and the labour market, and also improve the environment, climate, and human health. In 2016, the Modi government launched the LPG scheme as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMYU). NITI Aayog laid out a road map for universal access to LPG by 2025. The subsidy for LPG increased from Rs. 12,000 crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 21,000 crore in 2017-18 (Petroleum Analysis and Planning Cell, 2018), and 94% of all households had an LPG connection as of September 2019, an increase from 56% in 2014-15. However, as per evaluation studies, many LPG connection holders were found to still be using other fuels like firewood and dung cakes. This is because men, who usually make the decision of buying the refill, often do not agree to a refill which is expensive for the poor. Studies found that the poor use LPG mainly for making tea or snacks while they continue to use firewood or cow dung for their main cooking, as these sources of fuel are free of cost and easily available. Usually, as low value is attached to women’s time in production, the opportunity cost of women’s labour is low even when a capital subsidy is available, and women have to depend on traditional fuels. LPG is used for cooking when the opportunity cost of women’s labour is considered high, such as in the peak season in farming. On the other hand, urban households with reasonably high incomes and rural households belonging to upper income groups consider LPG refill a necessity for full cooking. Official data show that 48% rural households used LPG (2018) but only partially. The other problems in accessing LPG are administrative and include the distance to LPG distribution centres, long waiting time, and rising costs of LPG cylinders. Despite these findings, the Prime Minister recently introduced Ujjwala 2.0 under which one crore additional PMUY connections aim to provide deposit-free LPG connections to those low-income families who could not be covered under the earlier phase of PMUY. Under Ujjwala 2.0, migrants will not be required to submit ration cards or address proof. The amount allocated for this purpose is Rs. 14,073 crore this year. It is clear that the planners have not looked at the evaluation studies of Ujjwala 1.0 and the official data on the performance of the scheme. LPG cylinders are not a priority for the poorest. They sometimes even sell the cylinder to meet their urgent needs. One size cannot fit all There is no doubt that crores of poor and middle class women need better sources of cooking energy that are time saving, healthy, easily accessible and affordable. LPG works well, but only for non-poor households. Others need affordable alternatives to choose from, such as solar energy and solar cookers, smokeless chulhas, biogas plants and electric cookers where electricity is cheap. Good research and development efforts need to be made in the public and private sectors to explore these alternatives. As one solution may not fit all, there is a need to offer a set of energy sources to households so that each of them finds a suitable energy for itself. Women in India can achieve energy security for cooking only through cheaper and efficient alternatives.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Bluster and bogus claims||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s attempt to replace electronic voting machines with paper ballots failed in Congress recently. But this may not deter him from sowing confusion ahead of the 2022 presidential elections. On August 10, Mr. Bolsonaro’s proposal fell short of the majority needed to effect a constitutional amendment. This is the closest the President has come to carrying out his threats to thwart the functioning of representative institutions.  Sliding popularity The fiery far-right nationalist President warned in July that either there will be a clean election or no election next year, alleging without evidence that electronic voting machines, in vogue since 1996, were highly susceptible to manipulation. Mr. Bolsonaro has in the past insisted that but for fraud, he would have clinched the 2018 presidential contest in the first round. Several sitting and former Supreme Court justices have emphasised the absence of any record of malpractices under the electronic voting system, even as supporters of Mr. Bolsonaro have demanded changes. While the superior electoral court is probing Mr. Bolsonaro for abuse of office, the Supreme Court is examining a charge of guilt on grounds of spreading fake news. Mr. Bolsonaro, who assumed office in January 2019, has seen a rapid slide in his ratings following his callous mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed over half a million lives. He is also embroiled in criminal investigations relating to financial irregularities and dereliction of duty in the government’s procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines. In a deal that was subsequently suspended, Brazilian authorities reportedly agreed to pay much more than the original price quoted by Bharat Biotech, which is producing Covaxin. Experts have suggested in The British Medical Journal that Mr. Bolsonaro wilfully allowed the contagion to spread to create herd immunity, a strategy that could amount to crimes against humanity. By one estimate, more than 50% of Brazilians think that Mr. Bolsonaro must be removed from office. As per another, the former President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is likely to emerge the frontrunner after his corruption conviction was overturned in March, could win the presidency in the first round of next year’s contest. Admirer of the military While his waning popularity may have sparked the recent assault on the election commission, Mr. Bolsonaro has long remained an unapologetic admirer of the country’s previous military rulers. Many former generals hold cabinet ranks in his government. With close ideological affinity to Brazil’s extreme right anti-communist icon Olavo de Carvalho, the Brazilian President lamented on one occasion that the dictators’ mistake was to stop at torturing rather than killing dissidents. Within months of his ascent, Mr. Bolsonaro instructed the armed forces to commemorate the anniversary of the 1964 coup which brought the military to power. In a sign of the prevalent sharp polarisation, the move was equated in the Left circles with Holocaust denial, while Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters hailed it a revolution to counter communism. The prosecutor general’s office declared that the event would be tantamount to celebrating an unconstitutional dictatorship, while another court ruled the event incompatible with the country’s democratic reconstruction. In April this year, the leaders of all three branches of the armed forces resigned after Mr. Bolsonaro replaced the Defence Minister who allegedly said that the armed forces owed loyalty to the constitution and were not the President’s personal force. Arguably, no leader among the world’s large democracies befits the epithet ‘elected dictator’ more than Mr. Bolsonaro. As the number of petitions for his impeachment increase, the President will probably further intensify his shrill rhetoric against the courts and Brazil’s Congress until the next elections.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Staying invested||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to ask the MEA to brief all parliamentary parties on the Government’s actions in Afghanistan comes as questions grow about the Government’s planning for contingencies there, with the Taliban’s takeover. Since August 15, when the Taliban militia entered Kabul, the Government, including the MEA and the Defence Ministry, has been understandably occupied with the challenging evacuation of Indian nationals. In addition, the Government’s decision to evacuate the entire embassy staff and security personnel first has made it more difficult to facilitate those Indians, as well as long-term visa holding Afghan Sikhs and Hindus needing to return. With most of the Indians based in Afghanistan returning home, or expected to soon, the Government must face the larger strategic questions over whether the Indian Embassy was evacuated too early. India had undertaken evacuations during the 1990s too, but then the presence of Indian nationals was not as large and Indian stakes in Afghanistan were not so deeply rooted. In the past 20 years, India has built considerable interests, including major infrastructure projects and ongoing development projects, helped script the Afghan Constitution and conduct of elections, as well as enabled the training and education of the next generation of officials, soldiers and professionals. It seems unfortunate, therefore, that this bank of goodwill came to naught as the Government decided it was safer to pull up stakes, emulating neither the U.S. and European countries who relocated their diplomatic outposts to the Kabul airport, nor Russia, China and Iran, which decided not to vacate their embassies there. Going forward, the Government must explain how it expects to approach the new regime in Afghanistan once it is formed. It is still unclear whether this will be merely a repeat of the brutal regime seen from 1996-2001, or whether negotiations are under way for a more inclusive coalition, including several former leaders of Afghanistan, will fructify into a transitional government. The rise of Taliban power and that of the group’s Pakistani backers is a particular security concern as groups such as the LeT and the JeM could use Afghanistan as a staging base for terror attacks in India. Finally, the Government must explain how it will approach the Afghan people, especially those whose lives could be in danger, including Embassy staff and associates, those working on Indian projects, minorities, including those Islamic sects such as the Hazaras who have been targeted, as well as women. A more open, liberalised visa policy, and more swift processing of the newly launched special “e-Emergency X-Misc” visas would reassure both Afghans and the international community that India’s exit from Afghanistan is not permanent, and it will retain its traditional and historic interests in the country and its people, despite adverse events there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/staying-invested/article36070772.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Bonding rites||A meeting of 19 Opposition parties on August 20 confirmed the sense of urgency that they feel to come together and build a united front against the BJP. It was also a demonstration of the challenges that they face in that task, in terms of programme and architecture. The meeting convened by Congress President Sonia Gandhi was attended by leaders of 18 other parties, including four Chief Ministers. These parties have strategic or ideological reasons to be part of a formation against BJP hegemony, and see no harm in aligning with the Congress in the process. All the 19 parties see the BJP as a threat to their own politics; some of them view it as endangering the constitutional values of the country too. There are other non-BJP parties that do not see it that way. The BJD, TRS and YSRCP, ruling parties in Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, respectively, see no gain in opposing the BJP or aligning with the Congress. They might also see antagonism with the BJP and affinity with the Congress as detrimental to their politics. Comparable is the situation of the BSP and SP, two influential parties in Uttar Pradesh that elects the largest number of Lok Sabha MPs. Ms. Gandhi has exhorted all parties to rise above compulsions to build a joint front against the BJP, the aim of which is to defeat the BJP in the 2024 general election. The fact is that the Congress is itself a prisoner of its own compulsions and rigidities such as its institutional antipathy towards the YSRCP and TRS, and the personal fancies of its leader Rahul Gandhi who wields all authority and holds no accountability. Additionally, the Congress of today is vastly diminished compared to its position in the run-up to the 2004 general election when it could bring a host of parties under a coalition. Regional leaders then deferred to Ms. Gandhi, and her command over the Congress was absolute. The disarray in the Congress leadership is a drag on the attempts at Opposition unity. There is also a vast divergence among these parties on identifying the most critical issues in designing the optimal campaign against the BJP. The Congress and Left want to front-load in any Opposition campaign, the use of a spyware by an unknown government entity to snoop on a wide range of individuals. Parties that are more rural think price rise and agriculture distress and unemployment would have more salience among voters. This divergence need not necessarily be disabling for the Opposition. In fact, various parties could appeal to different constituencies and amalgamate their strengths, as it happened in the UPA experiments between 2004 to 2014. That requires significantly more leadership and management skills than available today in the Opposition gallery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bonding-rites/article36070773.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. keen on mending relations||New Delhi, August 23: The United States is taking steps to put back Indo-American relations on an even keel before the Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, visits Washington in November for talks with President Nixon. An effort is being made, both in Washington and New Delhi, to get over the embarassment of a near breakdown in Indo-American communication and revive contacts at various levels to clear the decks for more candid and purposeful exchanges between the two Governments. The State Department is reported to have privately sounded the Indian Embassy in Washington about mutually convenient dates for the next round of the much postponed bilateral talks which serve as a useful forum for a free and frank exchange of views on almost any problem of interest to either Government. The first round of these talks was held in New Delhi in 1968 and the second one in Washington a year later. The third round in the series was to have taken place in New Delhi early this year, but it was postponed because of the mid-term parliamentary election. It was put off again after the Bangla Desh crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/us-keen-on-mending-relations/article36070781.ece
24 August 2021||Mumbai,||‘Roots of economic recovery deepen as restrictions ease’||With the easing of COVID-19-related curbs by States, the roots of economic recovery deepened in July 2021, ICRA Ratings said in a report. The unlocking in the country has manifested itself in improving performance across various high-frequency industrial and service sector indicators, mobility and toll collections in July 2021, according to the agency. “With the further easing of the State-wise restrictions, especially across the southern States, the roots of the economic recovery deepened in July 2021. Despite a normalising base, eight of the 15 high-frequency indicators recorded an encouraging improvement in their year-on-year (YoY) growth in July 2021,” the agency's chief economist Aditi Nayar said in the report. Moreover, 10 of the 13 non-financial indicators recorded a month-on-month (MoM) uptick in July 2021, although the pace of improvement eased, as expected, from levels seen in June, when State-wise unlocking had commenced, she said. The YoY performance of GST e-way bills, fuel consumption, electricity generation, output of Coal India Limited (CIL), vehicle registrations and domestic passenger traffic improved in July 2021 from June 2021. The worsening in the YoY performance of some indicators such as output of passenger vehicles (PVs), scooters and motorcycles was primarily due to the base effect, the report pointed out. Ms. Nayar said July volumes of seven of the 13 non-financial indicators — non-oil merchandise exports, GST e-way bills, electricity generation, CIL's output, petrol consumption, PV output and rail freight traffic — rose above both their pre-Covid as well as April 2021 levels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/roots-of-economic-recovery-deepen-as-restrictions-ease/article36070598.ece
24 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Hindalco plans capex of up to $3 billion over 5 years||Hindalco Industries Ltd. has earmarked about $2.5-$3 billion for capital expenditure to bolster growth over the next five years, chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said while addressing shareholders online at the company’s AGM on Monday. He said the capex in subsidiary Novelis would be invested mainly in the auto-finishing line expansions in the U.S. and China and in rolling and recycling capacity expansions in Brazil. “In India, we are on track to implement organic growth projects entailing capital outlay of over $1 billion towards Utkal Alumina expansion, various aluminium and copper downstream expansions, and specialty alumina projects. These investments will advance our strategy of building a more predictable and resilient business model,” he added. He said the company started FY22 at a strong pace, despite the impact of the second wave. “We continue to see strong demand across all our business segments, plants running at capacity, and improving margins, supported by better macros and operating efficiencies,” he said. ‘Gathering pace’ Mr. Birla said economic indicators showed the Indian economy was ‘rapidly’ normalising towards pre-pandemic activity levels. “The three factors of cyclical upswing, conducive policy impulses and an improving global backdrop are likely to align themselves to position India for a virtuous cycle of growth and investments in the medium term,” Mr. Birla said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hindalco-plans-capex-of-up-to-3-billion-over-5-years/article36070604.ece

The trend is likely to continue for the next several quarters as close to 80% of data firms are busy ramping up recruitment to meet exploding demand. Among all digital skills, a data scientist’s has become ‘extremely hot’ these days and hence, the demand has risen significantly across industries, as per TeamLease Digital, a specialised staffing division of TeamLease. “As companies race [ahead] on the digital-transformation efforts, sophisticated use of analytics is the answer to staying in the game,” said Munira Loliwala, AVP, Diversified Engineering, TeamLease Digital. “This is pushing companies, including non-IT firms, to ramp up their data team.” Sectors including health-tech, manufacturing, BFSI, auto and retail have raised the hiring mandate for data professionals at least by 60% this fiscal, the firm said. “Hiring volumes have picked up phenomenally in the last couple of quarters with almost every private and public business that deals in data going gung-ho about onboarding data professionals,” said B.S. Murthy, CEO, Leadership Capital, a tech hiring outfit. India has more than one lakh vacancies for data science roles, according to TeamLease Digital.

As many as 25 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports as well as 40 railway stations and an unidentified number of railway colonies have been identified for getting private investments. Under the plan, private firms can invest in projects for a fixed return using the InvIT route as well as operate and develop the assets for a certain period before transferring them back to the government agency. “The asset monetisation pipeline takes the National Infrastructure Pipeline to the next phase where you are looking at public-private partnership,” she said. Stating there is no transfer of ownership or land, she said “the NMP talks about brownfield assets where there is a completed asset which is either languishing or remaining not fully monetised.” The total indicative value for Centre’s core assets has been estimated at Rs. 6 lakh crore over the 4-year period from FY22 to FY25.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The Summer of ’71 that scripted a new chapter in Indian cricket||A glorious chapter in the history of Indian cricket was written on this day 50 years ago when India won its first series in England at The Oval. After a sensational aggregate of 774 runs in four Tests in the West Indies, Sunil Gavaskar was hailed as one of the premier batsmen in the world. In this interview, Gavaskar reflects on the landmark England tour. Excerpts:  It was very early in your career, were there any apprehensions? After a good tour of the West Indies, I was quietly confident but also aware that English conditions were vastly different from West Indian conditions. Any advice from former cricketers/coaches? I talked to Polly Umrigar, Vijay Manjrekar, Vinoo Mankad (my college coach), Bapu Nadkarni, Nari Contractor, Madhav and Arvind Apte, to name a few. But above all, to the then chairman of selectors Vijay Merchant, who had had two outstanding tours of England in 1936 and 1946. The length of the tour (last week of June to first week of September) must have been demanding... It was something none of us were used to. But being our first trip to England, it was quite enjoyable. There were eight tour matches before the first Test. How helpful were they? We got used to the weather and pitches. Players got the time to get into form. England recovered from 71 for five in the first innings of the first Test at Lord’s... Ray Illingworth was out a couple of times (but not given). Throughout the series, he benefited from such decisions. Maybe because he was the England captain. You rate the 57 in the first innings of the second Test very high... I have always said the 57 at Old Trafford in 1971 is my best Test innings. It was a real green top and there was a drizzle that was freshening up the pitch and the wind was biting cold. India made history at The Oval, winning by four wickets… Despite conceding the lead in the first innings we were brought back into the game by Chandra’s bowling and Wadekar’s shrewd captaincy. If you look at the England dismissals, they were all catches in front of the stumps — with Ekki (Solkar) again brilliant — or bowled. So the umpires didn’t come into play at all. The scenes below the balcony are still vivid in memory. About Chandrasekhar and Sardesai’s contributions... Chandra was simply unplayable (two for 76 and six for 38). The Englishmen had no clue. Sardesai played two vital knocks (54 and 40), and it was his partnership with Wadekar that saw us through the danger posed by Snow and Price. Also, Sardesai, with his good humour and jokes, kept us in high spirits, especially on the long coach rides between the counties. Ashok Mankad was another, who despite not getting too many runs, was invaluable with his sense of fun. How did the West Indies tour contribute to your success in England? Beating the West Indies under Garry Sobers had boosted our morale no end and that could be seen in the way we held our nerve on the final day to triumph at the Oval.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-summer-of-71-that-scripted-a-new-chapter-in-indian-cricket/article36070880.ece

Mariyappan won the men’s high jump gold medal in the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games, his life changed forever. Mariyappan, who at age five suffered a permanent disability in his right leg after being run over by an errant bus driver, became an overnight sensation. Cash rewards poured in, with the Tamil Nadu government leading the way with a Rs. 2 crore cheque for Mariyappan. The Khel Ratna, Padma Shri and Arjuna awards followed, as did a felicitation event chaired by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. Brave sportspersons Similar glory awaited India’s other medallists — Devendra Jhajharia (gold, men’s javelin), Deepa Malik (silver, women’s shot put) and Varun Singh (bronze, men’s high jump). The nation rejoiced in the success of these brave sportspersons. The 2020 Paralympic Games, which commences at Tokyo on Tuesday, provides another life-altering opportunity to India’s 54-member contingent. While Mariyappan and Jhajharia return to defend their crowns, there are a host of other candidates keen on having their moments in the sun. Strong contender Sundar Gurjar, who lost a part of his left hand in a freak accident some years ago, is a strong contender in Jhajharia’s event. Para shuttler Pramod Bhagat, the World No. 1 in his category (SL3 - standing/lower limb impairment/minor), enters as a favourite. The 33-year-old, a double gold medallist in the 2019 BWF World para badminton championship, most recently clinched the Peru and Brazil tournament titles. The shooting contingent is led by Avani Lekhara, who features in four events. Avani, affected by a spinal cord injury caused by a car accident, will look to improve upon her silver medal at the 2019 Para Shooting World Cup. Avani’s colleague Rubina Francis (women’s 10m air pistol SH1), with a world record and 2021 World Shooting Para Sport Cup gold medal to her name, is another medal hope. Every one of these para-athletes have already overcome tremendous odds to qualify for the mega event. The stage is ready; it is now time to shine under the bright lights and continue India’s fine show in Japan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mariyappan-and-jhajharia-look-to-repeat-rio-show/article36070883.ece

24 August 2021||Chennai,||White-ball fetish England’s undoing||England did not go down in the second Test at Lord’s owing to the ill-advised bouncer barrage at Jasprit Bumrah. The host certainly blew an opportunity to win on a dramatic last day with its bizarre bowling tactics at the Indian tail that wagged. But then, England lost because its batsmen lacked the heart, the will and the technique to bat two sessions on a wicket that held no devils. Overdose England’s capitulation for 120 in just 51.5 overs mirrored a disturbing lack of defensive technique that is a direct consequence of an overdose of cricket in the shorter formats. The batsmen lose sight of their off-stump, push hard at the ball, the feet and the hands no longer move in symphony, there are holes in defence and body balance is a million miles away. And the lack of patience to see off spells is often shocking. A batting disaster is waiting to happen. The Indian bowling was good, not devastating, and once England lost its only fully-rounded batsman Joe Root, there was going to be only one result. Looking at the carnage in the English camp, India must consider itself fortunate that it still possesses a Test match specialist in Cheteshwar Pujara. His 206-ball second innings 45 stonewalling the English pace attack that threatened to make serious inroads was an extremely valuable Test-match innings. Play as per situation Batting in Tests is not always about momentum that has become a fashionable term with many. It’s a lot about playing the situation, soaking up the pressure and blunting the bowling. Once this is accomplished, the others can cash in. It is no coincidence that when the Indians staged a famous jailbreak in the Sydney Test last season, the two batsmen, Hanuma Vihari and R. Ashwin, who bravely batted 42.4 overs to halt the Australian surge for a win, had minimal exposure to batting in Twenty20 cricket. Vihari, like Pujara, is a Test match specialist and the chances for Ashwin to bat in IPL games are few and far between. After the debacle in the 2015 ODI World Cup down under, England made a conscious effort to revamp its white ball teams — it found astonishing success too — but has clearly failed to groom Test match specialists. England’s batting debacle at Lord’s was in several ways reminiscent of its collapse on the final day of the Chennai Test of 2016. England went in for Tea at 167 for four but still ended up being bowled out. And the strokeplay, to put it mildly, was rash. What England needs is grit, steel and that famous bulldog spirit that appears to have vanished with the likes of Ken Barrington.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/white-ball-fetish-englands-undoing/article36070873.ece
24 August 2021||KOLKATA,||East Bengal in a fresh crisis||East Bengal Club found itself in deep crisis on Monday when its investor Shree Cement conveyed its decision to pull the plug on the deal it had entered with the club roughly a year ago. The decision came on the back of a continuing impasse with the officials of the 101-year-old club, who have put up a fresh list of demands and had been refusing to sign the final contract after giving their consent in the term sheet when the agreement was signed last year. Shree Cement on Monday conveyed its decision in a letter addressed to the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who had been instrumental in getting the cement behemoth to agree in funding East Bengal’s entry into the Indian Super League last year. Mamata unhappy The Chief Minister, who in the last few days had been asking both the parties to end their differences and ensure the signing of the final contract, conveyed her “dismay and annoyance” at Shree Cement’s unilateral decision to pull out. She later assured of making an effort from her side to convince the investor to stay back. “The investor has through a letter conveyed to me that they won’t be able to continue (their deal) with the club. I think it is a bad attitude on their (the investor’s) part as they kept the club waiting for such a long time and then suddenly decided to part ways. I am both sad and displeased with this decision,” Ms. Banerjee said during a media briefing. “It is sad for a club like East Bengal which has a rich legacy. We will also let them (the investor) know our displeasure. We will try (to resolve the issue) though time is very short,” the Chief Minister said while keeping the option open for a renegotiation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/east-bengal-in-a-fresh-crisis/article36070930.ece

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Happy people are talking about me’||Ajinkya Rahane said he is unfazed by the constant criticism he has received in recent times, as it shows that he is an important player for the side. The vice-captain made a crucial 61 in the second innings of the Lord’s Test that India won, his first half-century in eight innings. “I am happy people are talking about me. I am not bothered about criticism. People only criticise important people and, I am happy they are criticising me,” said Rahane on Monday. Defends Pujara He also came out strongly in defence of Cheteshwar Pujara, another embattled batsman with whom he stitched a crucial 100-run stand for the fourth wicket. “It was all about hanging in there. The communication was all about thinking about the small targets and then build on from there. Cheteshwar — we always talk about him playing slow — but that innings of him was important for us,” said the 33-year-old. “He batted more than 200 balls even though he got just 45 runs. I thought those 200 balls were really important for us. We just wanted to build one good partnership. We knew 170-180 would have been very good score on that wicket,” he added. The third Test starts on Wednesday at Headingley, a venue at which none of the current squad members has played in this format. When asked if it will be a challenge for the team, especially the pacers, Rahane said, “I feel the conditions and wickets here are similar. We are not thinking about the conditions and whatever Headingley has to offer. It is all in the mind. Mentally, we are really strong. It is about having that confidence and putting your best foot forward in this game.” Lower-order batting He credited the contribution from the lower-order in the first two matches, saying it can be frustrating for the opposition when the tail wags. “Last couple of games, the contributions our lower-order has given us, full credit to them. Since the WTC finals till now, every day they have batted 10-12 minutes in the nets. They have come on their own, and after finishing bowling they also want to spend some time batting. Even if they add 10 runs each, we have a very good score on the board.” The Mumbai batsman also revealed that pacer Shardul Thakur has recovered from the hamstring injury that forced him to miss the second Test and is available for selection.

Ronaldo started on the bench at the Dacia Arena in Udine amid rumours he is looking for a way out of the Italian giant, but he almost snatched the three points deep into stoppage time after Juve insisted he was going nowhere this term.

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Putana is liberated||Kamsa’s attempts to kill Krishna begin even when Krishna is an infant. Kamsa was brought up by Putana. So Kamsa sends Putana to find Krishna and kill Him. Putana arrives in Gokula, where Krishna is the darling of the Gopas and Gopikas, and the cherished child of Yasoda and Nandagopa. Putana coats her nipple with poison, so that when she feeds Krishna, He will die. But Krishna sucks out her life, and she dies. She had come in the guise of a woman with a pleasant appearance, but now her true form is revealed. She looks terrifying. And she looks enormous. However, when Putana’s body is burnt, there is no foul smell. A lovely fragrance emanates from the burning body. It seems as if sandalwood is being burnt. How did this happen? Putana had had the touch of Krishna, even if only briefly, and that was enough to purify her, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. Only the body of a yogi smells good, when cremated. But Krishna’s touch had made Putana’s body like that of a yogi. Putana, in a sense, was a yogini herself, for she gave her very life to the Supreme One. Narayana Bhattadri says if Krishna made Putana smell so good, how much more would He have given the Gopikas who doted on Him. Through the Putana episode, the Lord was giving them an idea of how they would be blessed by Him. If one listens to the Putana story, one will get moksha. Vedanta Desika says that Krishna sucked out Putana’s milk, her life, and her future births. So, if one listens to this story, one will never have to drink a mother’s milk again, he says. This simply means that if one listens to the Putana story, one will never be born again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/putana-is-liberated/article36070848.ece

24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Mammookka at 50||Fifty years of shining bright on the silver screen has not dimmed the lustre of Mammootty, aka Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail.  On August 6, 1971, Mammootty, then a lanky student of Maharaja’s College in Kochi, made his debut as an actor in a blink-and-miss appearance in film director KG Sethumadhavan’s Anubhavangal Paalichakal.  Mammootty reappeared in 1980 in a small role in Vilkkanundu Swapnangal (Dreams for Sale), written by MT Vasudevan Nair and directed by Azad. It was the late IV Sasi’s movies, many written by T Damodaran and MT Vasudevan Nair, that catapulted Mammootty into a superstar. Seema, Sasi’s wife, who acted with Mammootty in several blockbusters, recalls meeting him on the set of Sphodanam in 1981. “I liked his confidence and wondered who he was. I was told he was a newcomer called Mammootty. I went across and met him and told him that I liked the way he carried himself,” she says. When the actor was at his busiest, he got a call from auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan for Anantharam (1987). “It was not the lead and I told him that. But it hardly mattered to him. He came up with a superb act. Then he played the lead in Mathilukal for which he won his first National award for Best Actor,” says Adoor.  Vidheyan , the third film that Adoor and Mammootty teamed up, bagged the actor his second National award for Best Actor. “It was an anti-hero role. As soon as I called Mammootty, he said ‘yes’. He asked if he could read the screenplay. Mammootty is the only actor in my films who has read a screenplay of mine before the film began ,” says Adoor. Praising his discipline, Adoor says the halo of a ‘star’ was nowhere visible when Mammootty faced the camera. “Even at his peak as a superstar, here was an actor who was keen on doing offbeat films and enjoyed pushing himself to breathe life into his role,” he adds. Like nobody During the ‘80s and ‘90s , Mammootty worked in several back-to-back films under the helmsmanship of PG Viswambharan, J Sasikumar, Padmarajan, Bharathan, Lohitadas and so on. He also went on to act in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi and an English film on Dr. Ambedkar. Among the younger lot, Lal Jose ( Oru Maravathoor Kanavu) , Lohitadas ( Bhoothakkannadi ), Anwar Rashid ( Rajamanikyam ), Aashiq Abu ( Daddy Cool ), Blessy ( Kazhcha ), Amal Neerad ( Big B ) and Martin Prakkat ( Best Actor ) are those who turned directors with a Mammootty film. “It was Mammookka who made me a director. I was the cinematographer of Ranjith’s Mammootty-starrer Black and was set to return to Mumbai where I was working. Once the film was over, out of the blue, Mammookka told me to call him when I have a project to direct,” says Amal, whose first film was Big B.  Showing no signs of slowing down, Mammootty is currently working and listening to scripts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/mammookka-at-50/article36071315.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Wang’s kitchen lives on||Our story begins in the 1970s, at IIT-Kharagpur, where Ken Liu, founder of Liu’s Waldorf, is helping set up his brother-in-law’s restaurant. The Chinese joint, also called Waldorf, turned out to be popular among the students, and a chance-meeting with an IIT professor helped Ken realise the prospects of a thriving restaurant business in then Madras, a city slowly warming up to a cosmopolitan character. Could he replicate this success? In 1974, when Ken moved to Madras, he would find that the answer was yes. Adyar, which was bustling with student crowds from the nearby institutions such as IIT-Madras and Anna University, became a hotspot for business and before he knew it, Liu’s Waldorf was a hit. It certainly was not the first Chinese restaurant in the city, since Mount Road at least had three: Chungking, Nanking and Southern Chinese. But it was the only Chinese joint in the Adyar, Besant Nagar and Taramani area. Until 1975 when Ken bought the place to turn it into a full-fledged restaurant, Liu’s Waldorf had minimal character: an open place with just a roof and small kitchen. Nestling between Ramco Systems and IIT-Madras, it was the only restaurant, or building for that matter, on the sidelines of Sardar Patel Road, which was thankfully breezy, courtesy a bed of trees. The entire region resembled a jungle and was pitch dark in the evening; the only light that shone was Liu’s. Initially, Liu’s Waldorf was seen as a fast-food joint, especially by students who lined up for the Waldorf special soup, chilli chicken, chilli pork and beef. “The latter is popular even today. In fact, our customers come to us for the chilli pork and beef, since you don’t get them everywhere,” says Wang I Hsing, head chef and current owner, adding that American chop suey and noodles, too, are popular. The restaurant was a resounding success as it was priced economically: soup for Rs. 1 and a bowl of fried rice was Rs. 3.50 in the initial years. “It has gone up to 10, or even 15 times more today since we are no longer a restaurant for just students; it is now a family restaurant,” adds Wang with a laugh. Chinese vibe, Indian heart Liu’s Waldorf, like most Chinese restaurants in the city, is a show run by one family. Wang, 55, also known as Peter, joined as the head chef in 1980. He took over the business from his brother-in-law Ken and sister Susy, when the former passed away. For a long time, the family lived above the restaurant; a space now turned into a storeroom. Wang is the third generation of the family. His father, Wang Min Hsien, was from China. He came looking to start a business in Calcutta, where he met and married Wang’s mother. As he chats, Wang effortlessly switches between English, Tamil and Hindi — a result of his cross-cultural life. “I find Tamil much easier than Hindi, since I have lived all my life in Chennai and I am very much Tamil,” he says. The family also runs a few beauty parlours managed by Wang’s sister, and his wife, Rochelle. Waldorf’s interiors have not changed much over the years. The tables once covered in red gingham are now set with placemats. The dimly-lit space comes alive in the evening, illuminated by Chinese lanterns and a welcoming laughing Buddha. What has changed, however, is unlike before when they ferried sauces and groceries from Calcutta, now they have agencies in Chennai who deliver the necessary ingredients. Wang says he learnt the recipes from his mother. “But, I had to make it spicy to meet the Indian taste,” he says. Unlike many other restaurants that shut operations due to floundering businesses during lockdown, Liu’s Waldorf has managed to stay afloat. “I am able to run it because we own the place. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult. During a time like this, you cannot think about your margin, but your staff,” he says. Wang attributes the popularity of Liu’s to the once-students of the ‘70s and ‘80s who have now become fathers and grandfathers. “They bring their grandchildren and reminisce. Some of them even remember and ask about Ken. Such has been our relationship,” says Wang, heading back into the kitchen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/wangs-kitchen-lives-on/article36071313.ece
24 August 2021||August 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Ringside tales||‘Tiger’ Nat Terry was one of the most feared names in the Madras of yore. This Anglo-Indian boxer, after successful bouts all over the country, challenged one of Madras’s most popular boxers, Arunachalam, for a fight in the 1940s. That match proved fatal for Arunachalam, as one of Terry’s fierce blows caught him unawares. He collapsed in the ring at Kannapar Thidal. Barely three months later, Terry took on Kitheri Muthu, a rising star of Madras boxing, in one of the most celebrated duels till date. During that match, thousands of enthusiasts from across the city are said to have gathered to witness Kitheri Muthu take down Terry in an intense clash, fuelled by crowds baying for payback, on Arunachalam’s behalf. “It was a big deal,” recalls Kitheri Muthu’s grandson S. Babu, who currently runs MKM Boxing Club in Chennai’s Washermanpet along with his relatives Stephen and Sebastian. “Back then, three things drew huge crowds in North Madras: political gatherings, stage plays, and boxing.” Tamil Nadu, with a rich history of martial arts like silambam (stick fighting), took to boxing thanks to the British and Anglo-Indians. While Kitheri Muthu’s father, Manicka Mudaliar, was a silambam exponent, his son took to boxing after he turned 16. Fight clubs The epicentre of all this was North Madras, bustling with members of the fishing community and manual labourers. Eager to beat the British at their own game, the city raised several talented boxers over the next few decades . “Based on the neighbourhoods they hailed from, they were divided into various parambarais (clans),” says Babu. Sarpatta Parambarai, Idiyappa Naicker Parambarai, and the Ellapa Chettiyar Parambarai were among the most renowned boxing clans. Kitheri Muthu, from Royapuram’s Panaimara Thotti, belonged to the well-established Sarpatta Parambarai and enjoyed as much popularity as leading film stars of that generation. Several boxers emerged from the same parambarai , one of the most prominent among them being a fisherman named Sundar Raj, who also hailed from Royapuram. “A couple of boxing coaches saw him during a local brawl and were impressed with his confidence. They trained him, and he went on to become one of the best boxers of the Sarpatta clan,” recalls Sundara Ganesh, boxing coach and grandson of Sundar Raj. Today, parambarais have become clubs; 30-year-old Sundara Ganesh and his father Tamil Selvan run one in Sundar Raj’s memory. With over 50 aspirants training every day, students who usually train near Marina Beach, work at making an impression at local and national tournaments. Outside the ring If Royapuram was the epicentre of boxing in the past, other neighbourhoods soon started picking up the sport. In the 70s, people from Perambur and other neighbourhoods headed to Royapuram to pick up boxing skills, and subsequently trained others closer home. Ramalingam and Govindaraj are two such aspiring boxers; their family has been into the sport for five decades now. G. Thyagarajan aka Thiru, former National-level boxer and currently a coach, hails from a household in which boxing is an integral part of their everyday lives. “It helps that it led to employment opportunities,” explains Thiru, who currently runs Lakshmanan Boxing Club in Perambur’s Muniappa Chetty Street. “My uncle, Jilla (Rajamani) and another relative, Selvam, got inducted in the Integral Coach Factory due to their boxing credentials. Many boxers got employment in the Railways, Army and the police force. Boxing not only taught us discipline, but also gave us a livelihood,” he says. Which is why Thiru, who got into the sport in 1999, is giving back now. Apart from guiding actor Arya for the recent hit boxing movie Sarpatta Parambarai , Thiru is training 50-plus boxers, most of them in their 20s, to get to the next level. “Two things have changed the fortunes of boxing recently: Pa Ranjith’s Tamil film, and Lovlina Borgohain’s bronze medal in the recent Tokyo Olympics. Today, for the first time, I see mothers standing at 5 a.m. outside a boxing club to see their children excel in the ring,” he says. Like his student, S. Kishan Akash from Perambur. The 16-year-old has been training for three years, and is looking at a full-time boxing career. Akash says, “When I joined, I thought it will be like in films where I can send people flying, but slowly, I realised it was much tougher than that. This last year, with restrictions on going outside, has helped me practise more: I train in the ring for almost five hours every day. Someday, I’ll become an internationally-known boxer….” And if he does, Madras’s connection with boxing, from the days of the fearsome Anglo-Indian boxer Terry, would have come a full circle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ringside-tales/article36071314.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU graduate who led protests in Afghanistan uncertain of future||Crystal Bayat is a 24-year-old activist who graduated from Delhi University last year. She is among the several brave women who have openly protested against the Taliban in the face of arms and violence. Currently in Afghanistan, Ms. Bayat was on the way to Kabul airport on Saturday morning. “I don’t feel safe if I am on a video call,” she said over a WhatsApp call to The Hindu . She is scared to attend calls from India as her phone is “under control”. On Monday morning, she said over a WhatsApp call that she and her family are looking for a safe place. She doesn’t have access to the Internet for more than a few hours daily. “We have to hide from trouble. I am on the way to leave Kabul as soon as possible. Outside, I can’t talk loudly,” she said. On August 19, on Afghanistan’s Independence Day, days after the Taliban took over, she was among a few women who protested against the Taliban. “We chose the Wazir Mohammad Akbar Khan hill to raise the Afghan national flag, where the largest flag was installed. While the Taliban had announced that a decision on the national flag will be made later, their commanders and soldiers did not allow this,” she said. The protesters, she said, gathered at another site but weren’t allowed there as well. “I didn’t give up due to the verbal threats and airstrikes. They beat up many people. People were being shot at, especially some of the girls who were with me. They broke a young man’s mobile phone... they used violence and coercion. I was scared when I saw that if resist, they would fire at us. Taliban has not changed. They still do not believe in the freedom and demands of the citizens. No one can hold them accountable.” On things that made her gather the courage to protest, she said, “Restrictions, killings, violence, deprivations and the tyranny of the Taliban forced me to stand up against terrorism and extremism”. A terrible situation Sharing her experience, she said it was “bitter and painful” and that she is uncertain of the future of “all women activists, human rights activists, journalists, elites and especially women”. “How sad are the stories of women who have experienced twenty years of war and bloodshed? Afghanistan is in a terrible situation. The world must hear and act on the voices of Afghan women and youths. No one knows what will happen tomorrow.” Recalling her childhood, she said her mother — a doctor — helped many women at the time. “I have grown up with the changes and developments post-2001. My mother has extremely painful stories to share. The pain was the same that people are facing today,” she said. Ms. Bayat’s encounters with the Taliban in the past few days have made her conclude that they talk about supporting women’s rights “but the opposite happens”. “Their soldiers were staring at our clothes. I really felt harassed and violent but I was sure they wouldn't beat me in public. I talked with one of their soldiers he couldn't convince me, there are big deference between the statements and believes. I was afraid of being followed and chased. I was facing with Taliban for the first time was trembling. Their demeanor, mannerisms and speech had taken away peace from my mind [sic],” she said in a message.  I didn’t give up due to the verbal threats and airstrikes. They [the Taliban] beat up many people. People were being shot at, especially some of the girls who were with me. They broke a young man’s mobile phone... they used violence and coercion Crystal Bayat Activist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/du-graduate-who-led-protests-in-afghanistan-uncertain-of-future/article36071100.ece
24 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Now, Sidhu targets Amarinder govt. over sugarcane prices||As the farmers continued their protest against the Congress government in Punjab’s Jalandhar, demanding rise in State Assured Price (SAP) for sugarcane, party’s State chief Navjot Singh Sidhu said the SAP in Punjab is too low in comparison to neighbouring States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana. Notably, all these three States are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Sidhu’s remark is being seen as another attack on Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, indicating that ongoing turmoil within the Congress party is far from over. Both the leaders have been at loggerheads since long. “The sugarcane farmers issue needs to be immediately resolved amicably …. Strange that despite the higher cost of cultivation in Punjab the state assured price is too low as compared to Haryana / U.P. / Uttarakhand. As torchbearer of agriculture, the Punjab SAP should be better !,” said Mr Sidhu in a tweet. Sugarcane farmers from various regions of Punjab have been on an indefinite protest since August 20 on a national highway at Jalandhar, near Dhanowali, blocking the national highway and a railway line, resulting in disruption of vehicular traffic and railway movement. Farmer leader Manjeet Sing Rai said farmers union leaders and representatives from the Cane Commissioner’s office and agriculture university experts held a meeting in the Jalandhar on Monday. “We are demanding Rs. 400 per quintal as SAP for sugarcane. Tomorrow (August 24) Chief Minister is expected to announce a decision on the issue. We will continue our ongoing protest until our demands are met,” he said. Earlier talks with the State government representatives on August 22 it did not result in any concrete outcome. ‘We are anguished’ “We are anguished because the State government has been speaking about diversification of crops without adequate support to farmers who are attempting such diversification. The State government has kept its assured prices very low compared to neighboring Haryana, besides the arrears of previous years have not been paid by sugarcane mills so far,” he said. Punjab government had last week announced an increase of Rs. 15 per quintal in the SAP for all sugarcane varieties for the crushing season, 2021-22. The SAP of sugarcane is Rs. 325 for early variety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/now-sidhu-targets-amarinder-govt-over-sugarcane-prices/article36071089.ece
24 August 2021||New Delhi,||Umar says FIR in riots case ‘cooked up, unnecessary’||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the north-east Delhi riots conspiracy case, told a local court on Monday that there were various contradictions in the police’s claims and called it a “cooked up” case. Mr. Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA. They are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has sought bail in the case. Trideep Pais, Mr. Khalid’s lawyer, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that the FIR was cooked up and unnecessary, and was used selectively to target and frame them. The counsel pointed to two contradictions in Delhi Police’s claims. Firstly, he showed the court a 21-minute video clip of Mr. Khalid’s speech in Maharashtra, which the prosecution had allegedly labelled inflammatory. The lawyer, pursuant to showing the video, apprised the court that his client did not give any call for violence through the speech and in fact gave a message of unity to the people. “A message of unity based on Gandhi ji was given by Umar Khalid that day. It was termed as terror. Content is not seditious. He is talking about democratic power. He referred to Gandhi,” Mr. Pais added. Secondly, he argued that as per the police case, Mr. Khalid conspired with other accused on January 8 to cause riots during former U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, however, the news about his visit was announced only in February. “These are the kind of lies they are peddling. This is a joke. This FIR is a cooked-up theory. Is it that easy to prosecute people? Do you have no responsibility as a prosecution?” Mr. Pais said. Delhi Police had recently said that the bail plea has no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case. In April, the former JNU student was granted bail in one of the riot cases. The court while granting him bail noted that he was not physically present at the scene of the crime on the date of the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/umar-says-fir-in-riots-case-cooked-up-unnecessary/article36071094.ece
24 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Expedite refugee registration for those coming from Afghanistan’||Various students’ bodies and women’s rights organisations on Monday assembled at Mandi House in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan. Stating that the liberties and lives of human rights activists and welfare workers based in Afghanistan were in danger from the Taliban, the groups said the UNHCR should expedite refugee status registration for those arriving from Afghanistan. The charter of demands endorsed by over 250 signatories also said the Election Commission of India must ensure that “Afghanistan and Taliban” are not used as pretexts for hate speeches during campaigns during upcoming State elections. ‘India must ensure safety’ The signatories also demanded: “The Government of India must ensure that safety of all Afghan nationals residing in India. The Government of India cease any attempt to distinguish between Afghan refugees on the basis of faith or identity and instead open the country’s doors to offer safe refuge to any Afghan refugees in need.” Rukhsar Rahim, a student from Afghanistan who came to India in 2015 for her undergraduate degree said: “Several of my relatives are still in Afghanistan. People there are living in distress...they are not being able to go out of their houses.” The Jamia Milia Islamia student added: “In some areas in Afghanistan, people are being tortured and the basic right of speech has been snatched by the Taliban. We are asking the entire world to help Afghanistan set up a system where gender equality is restored. Given a chance, not just me but all Afghan youth would like to return to our country one day.” Annie Raja of the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) said: “We are here in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan. The NFIW has organised this meet across 22 States. It is to express solidarity particularly with the women in Afghanistan. We also want to tell the international community to not remain as a spectator.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/expedite-refugee-registration-for-those-coming-from-afghanistan/article36071103.ece
24 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Plan to deport 60,000 Chakmas from Arunachal slammed||Chakma organisations have slammed the proposed deportation of 60,000 people belonging to the Chakma and Hajong communities from Arunachal Pradesh. They said other States in India, specifically Assam, must not be the dumping ground of “unwanted people of the Northeast” although 94% of the Chakmas and Hajongs settled in present day Arunachal Pradesh by the Government of India in the 1960s are Indians by birth. CM Khandu’s speech In a statement on August 23, the Chakma Rights and Development Organisation (CRDO) expressed concern over Chief Minister Pema Khandu’s Independence Day speech and Law and Justice Minister Kiren Rijiju’s ‘warnings’ during his ‘Jan Ashirvad Yatra’ in the State. While Mr. Khandu said “all illegal immigrant Chakmas will be moved and settled outside Arunachal Pradesh with honour, and this matter has already been taken up and discussed with Union Home Minister Amit Shah”, Mr. Rijiju said there should be “no confusion about the fact” that Chakmas and Hajongs “will not be allowed to subsist or live in Arunachal Pradesh”. The Chakma and Hajong people were brought by the Government of India from Chittagong Hill Tracts (now in Bangladesh) from 1964-68 and rehabilitated in the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) that became Arunachal Pradesh later on, the CRDO noted. “The rehabilitation was under a Centrally-sponsored plan following a series of discussions between the representatives of the Central government, the NEFA administration and local tribal leaders,” its president Mahendra Chakma said. “We are very worried about our future as we and our forefathers have suffered long enough because of partition. We oppose any move to dislodge the Chakma community from the State,” the Arunachal Pradesh Chakma Gaonburah Association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/plan-to-deport-60000-chakmas-from-arunachal-slammed/article36071087.ece
24 August 2021||New Delhi,||Anti-CAA stir: Sharjeel Imam says his speeches did not call for violence||JNU student Sharjeel Imam, arrested for allegedly making inflammatory speeches during the protests against CAA and NRC, told a Delhi court on Monday that he cannot be hammered with sedition as his speeches did not call for violence. Mr. Imam has moved the court, seeking bail in a case related to speeches made by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India. He has been arrested under UAPA and sedition. During the hearing, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, representing the accused, apprised Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that no part of his speech called for any kind of violence to be initiated. “When Imam says that this piece of legislation [CAA/NRC] is unconstitutional, and seeks to persuade the government to rethink and says if you don't do it, we will be on the streets, he cannot be hammered by sedition,” the counsel asserted. He further said the right to protest, the right to blockade, and the right to bring the country to a standstill is not equal to an act of sedition. “The speech did not call for violence. He just called for a road blockade. He did not say that the northeast should become a different State and declare independence. That would have been seditious,” advocate Mir added. The alleged inflammatory speeches were made at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 28, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/anti-caa-stir-sharjeel-imam-says-his-speeches-did-not-call-for-violence/article36071093.ece

Congress members, led by Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, raised the issue of deaths during the pandemic due to lack of oxygen. Mr. Hooda said the government was trying to mislead the public about the truth of deaths. The Chief Minister said about 13,000 people died due to COVID-19 in the hospitals across the State. “Of these, about 9,500 were residents of Haryana, while about 3,500 were from other States. There are about 4,000 private hospitals in Haryana. Oxygen was supplied everywhere through agencies in every city. Oxygen was also supplied from a nearby city if needed,” he said. Mr. Lal said in some hospitals of Hisar, Rewari and Gurugram districts, a few irregularities were reported and a magisterial inquiry has been conducted. Assures action “In two reports pertaining to Rewari and Gurugram hospitals, it was stated that no death was reported due to lack of oxygen,” he said. In the investigation report of Hisar district, the matter of negligence of Soni Hospital was highlighted and the “said report has been sent to the Superintendent of Police, necessary action will be taken,” he added. The CM said during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, it was noticed that some hospitals admitted more patients than their capacity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/panel-will-probe-plaints-against-hospitals-cm/article36071092.ece
